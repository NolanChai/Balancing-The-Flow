The woman claimed that although there was "a long history" of incidents at the school that caused concern to staff and pupils alike, nothing had been done about it by teachers or school management . 

Ms. Stratton, from Blackpool in Lancashire, said her daughter Tianni - who has autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a mild learning disability - was "repeatedly bullied" at the school for four years by other pupils as well as some teachers, including being pushed to the floor, called names, spat at and thrown into lockers. 

Tianni is now unable to attend mainstream school or go out anywhere alone due to PTSD and anxiety, Ms. Stratton said, adding that she has had to give up her job as a childminder so that she could care for Tianni full-time . She is seeking an unspecified amount in damages from Blackpool Council at the High Court in London on Wednesday. 

The council did not deny any of Ms. Stratton's claims but said that there had been a lack of communication between staff and that they would like to apologise to Tianni for any stress caused . A spokesperson added: "We are committed to ensuring all our pupils have an appropriate education which meets their needs." 

According to the National Autistic Society, bullying is a common problem among children on the autism spectrum as they may have difficulty reading social cues and interpreting body language or facial expressions . They also tend to be more sensitive to sensory input such as lighting or sound, which can lead to avoidance behaviours in classrooms. 

The charity added that autistic children are at a higher risk of bullying because they may have difficulty communicating how they feel and need extra support . The government's Department for Education also launched the Anti-bullying Alliance last year to help schools combat this issue. 

In response to Ms. Stratton's allegations, Blackpool Council said: "We do not recognise any of Tianni Stratton's claims and we are committed to providing an appropriate education for all our pupils." 

This case comes a month after another mother accused a London school of ignoring her daughter's disability during the pandemic . Katrina Collier said that despite repeatedly raising concerns about her three-year-old daughter's special educational needs, the nursery teachers and managers at St Mary's Catholic Primary School in Hillingdon did not do enough to help her . 

Her daughter, Tilly Collier, has a complex medical condition called Smith Magenis Syndrome that causes physical disability as well as sensory difficulties including vision loss, hearing problems and mobility issues. She had been attending the school for five months before the coronavirus outbreak began in March 2020 . But after several complaints about how she was being treated at nursery, Ms. Collier said that the school failed to provide appropriate support during lockdown . 

In a letter published by the Local Government Ombudsman, it states: "The council did not seek to clarify whether the child's needs were being met and relied on the nursery setting to take care of her." It added that when Ms. Collier raised concerns about Tilly's health with staff in March 2021, they told her it would be "safer" for them all if she sent her daughter home . As a result of this lack of support, the council agreed to pay Â£500 compensation and apologised unreservedly. 

Speaking at the time, Ms. Collier said: "I'm devastated that Tilly was let down in such a basic way." She also criticised the government's decision to not fund nurseries enough during lockdown and said her daughter was now struggling with anxiety . 

According to the Disabled Children's Partnership, there are around 60,000 disabled children in England who need additional support from their parents but may not always get it due to lack of resources. It says that as a result, they are at "a greater risk" of being bullied or facing exclusion . 

In another case last year, the mother of an autistic boy said she was forced to give up her job in order to home school him after his school failed to provide adequate support during lockdown . Rachel Lowe said that although her son William had a statement of special educational needs, he was not given any additional help by staff at the Hewens Primary Academy in Leeds despite her repeated requests. 

She claimed she had to leave her job as an IT consultant to ensure William could learn at home safely and that without support from teachers, his learning had "regressed". Ms. Lowe said: "I'm a mother who cares about my child. I would not have put him through the trauma if he hadn't needed me." 

The school responded to these allegations by saying it was doing its best in challenging times and that William had been receiving support from a teaching assistant . It added: "He has made good progress academically and socially, which we are delighted with."
