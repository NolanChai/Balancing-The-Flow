let after the alleged attack but then returned when she realised her mobile phone was still on the table.

The young woman is now looking for witnesses who may have seen what happened at about 3am in the VIP area of the Chinawhite nightclub in London's Soho district last weekend. She told a Sunday newspaper: "I kept running away from him and trying to hide but he found me and slapped me round the face. He grabbed me by my top, ripped it and pushed me against a wall. Then I ran away again."

The teenager added that she was terrified of what Lennon might do when she returned to the table after putting her mobile phone in the toilet as he had been drinking heavily all night. When she returned she said: "I took out my mobile but then realised it was on the table so I went back to get it and there was Aaron at the next table with his friends."

She claims that she tried to hide behind a column when Lennon grabbed her by the arm as he was laughing. She says: "He picked me up, threw me against the wall, slapped me round the face again then ripped my top off and said: 'You've had too much to drink'. He kept repeating this over and over."

The girl claims she tried to scream but Lennon held her down by pinning her arms. She managed to free herself when a group of friends came upstairs. Afterwards, the young woman claims that Lennon said "he would sort me out" after seeing her with another man on TV.

She has since filed a police report and says she wants an apology from the England player for what happened. She is also seeking legal advice about making a personal injury claim. The footballer's manager, Simon Cliff, said: "He is not aware of any incident at Chinawhite. He has not been contacted by the Police or anyone else regarding this matter."

ChinaWhite confirmed that Aaron Lennon was there last Friday but would make no further comment on an incident that took place between 3am and 5am when he left.

The young woman said: "I didn't know what to do - I didn't even know his name, I just knew it was the England captain." The alleged victim claims she then waited for around five hours before a friend came along to collect her and took her home. She did not want to see anyone else as she was too scared of Lennon.

The girl said she now wants an apology from Lennon but also a payout "for the trauma this has caused me". She added: "I'm not interested in him apologising if it is just words, I want cash. I have been left feeling terrible."

The young woman claims that as well as being scared of Lennon she was worried about the repercussions for reporting what had happened. She said: "If people hear you were at Chinawhite on the night in question, they will think you must have been out with him - it's like a no go area."

A spokesman for ChinaWhite said he would not be making any further comment over an incident that took place between 3am and 5am when Aaron Lennon left the club. He added: "We are cooperating fully with police in their investigations into this matter."

Meanwhile, a source close to Aaron Lennon said: "He doesn't even drink that much so for him to go on like that is totally out of character . I can't believe he was drunk enough to do such a thing and we would be shocked if the police got involved."

The 21-year-old had been caught up in a scuffle between his girlfriend and another group of clubbers at Chinawhite. Lennon was also involved in a high profile argument with Jamie O'Hara, after the pair got into a fist fight in Soho, leaving both men needing hospital treatment.
