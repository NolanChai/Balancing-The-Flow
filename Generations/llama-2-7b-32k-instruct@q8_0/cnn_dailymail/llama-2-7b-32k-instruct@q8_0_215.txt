Sports News: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is planning a summer swoop for Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke. The club's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the 23-year-old during the La Liga match against Granada, and it remains to be seen what his interest in the player is all about. The Portugal international has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge in the recent past as he was reportedly unhappy over being limited to just 14 appearances last season . Mourinho might now want him at the club, and will hope that Emenalo's visit helps persuade him to join Chelsea. (ANI)

Title: US govt warns about Google phishing scam Title: A Good, If Not Great Game
Review: I played this game for a week or so. It was really fun, but the first thing you notice is how different it is from Final Fantasy 8, which in my opinion was one of the best games ever made. The plot and storyline are both very good, but they aren't as good as FFIX or VIII. The graphics are amazing, though some may think that they're a little too realistic. All of the characters have cool designs and it's easy to tell one apart from another. It has pretty much anything you could possibly want in an RPG: a big world with lots of things to see and do, multiple playable characters, sidequests, secrets, and a good story. The game is great overall, but doesn't quite live up to my high expectations

Title: A must read
Review: I have just finished reading this book and my jaw is still on the floor. This woman has an amazing story to tell. The way she kept her dignity and faith intact in the face of horrific atrocities is inspiring and humbling . Her writing style is very readable; she doesn't sugar coat anything but it is not graphic or gory, as some other reviewers have stated . This is a book that I will share with my friends.

Title: Good deal
Review: This was a great buy. I didn't need to spend $50 on a DVD player when this one cost less than half that amount and it works just fine for me. It came with all the connections needed to hook up my TV (no additional wires) so there were no headaches. I'll definitely buy another if needed
