90 minutes of Atletico's 1 - 0 win over Athletic Bilbao in La Liga. Chelsea are keen to strengthen their midfield and Koke is high on the list of players being monitored by Emenalo. The Daily Mail claims that Mourinho will make a move for the Spain international in July but may face competition from Juventus, Inter Milan and Barcelona who also have an interest in securing his signature.

Chelsea are also interested in making a swoop to sign Bayer Leverkusen striker Javier Hernandez. The club's technical director Michael Emenalo was spotted scouting the Mexican last week and the report claims that Chelsea would be willing to part with £17 million for his services.

The club is also interested in securing a deal for Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney this summer as Mourinho feels he has struggled since arriving at Old Trafford from Everton two seasons ago. The report claims that the 29-year-old would cost £15 million to secure his signature with Emenalo having travelled to watch him in United's 3 - 0 defeat to West Ham earlier this month.

Jose Mourinho will also make a move for Southampton star Morgan Schneiderlin once he has returned from his loan spell at Everton where the Frenchman is currently plying his trade. The report claims that Chelsea could face competition from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur for his signature.

The club are also looking to sign a centre back this summer as they have been struggling in that position since John Terry was ruled out with injury earlier this season. Chelsea are considering making an offer for Sevilla's Clement Lenglet but may face competition from Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur who are also interested in securing the young defender's signature.

The report claims that Mourinho is targetting a deal to sign Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte on loan with an option to buy at the end of his spell at Stamford Bridge. The 21-year-old impressed during Spain's World Cup campaign and Chelsea are looking to make him a part of their future plans as they believe he could be a long term replacement for Terry who is out injured until next summer.

The club is also interested in making a move to sign Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo on loan with an option to buy at the end of his spell at Stamford Bridge but face competition from Tottenham Hotspur, Napoli and West Ham United for his signature.

Jose Mourinho wants to secure a deal to sign Celtic left back Kieran Tierney this summer as he looks to bolster his squad defensively. The 19-year-old has been impressive during the current season where Celtic are leading in the Scottish Premiership and also impressed during Scotland's World Cup campaign last summer.

The report claims that Chelsea will make a move for the teenager but face competition from Arsenal, Southampton and Napoli who have been linked with him since his impressive season with Celtic so far.

Chelsea are also interested in making a swoop to sign Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips on loan this summer. The 19-year-old has been highly impressive for the club during their promotion campaign in the EFL Championship and is said to be high on Mourinho's list of players who he would like to bring to Stamford Bridge once the season comes to an end.

The club have also set their sights on securing a deal to sign Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane this summer with Emenalo having travelled to watch him in Los Blanco's 3 - 0 win over Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie.

The report claims that Chelsea face competition from Manchester United and Paris Saint Germain for his signature but believe they hold an advantage over their rivals as Real Madrid would be willing to sell him to a Premier League club rather than a La Liga side which is where both United and PSG play in.

Jose Mourinho will also make a move for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba once his loan spell at Manchester United comes to an end this summer. The 24-year-old has been linked with the club for some time now but was unable to secure a deal in January as both clubs could not agree on terms. However, it is claimed that the Frenchman will be available for around £120 million once his loan spell comes to an end and Emenalo will be willing to pay the fee.

The report claims that Mourinho wants to bring Pogba in this summer as he feels he can add something special to their midfield which has struggled since the departure of Nemanja Matic to Chelsea earlier this month.

Chelsea are also interested in making a move for Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon once his contract with Los Blanco comes to an end later this summer. The 39-year-old has been linked with the club since last year and was said to be close to completing a deal earlier this month before a move failed through due to personal terms.

The report claims that Buffon still holds the same desire to join Chelsea but is waiting for the right moment in order to leave Juventus where he has spent his entire senior career so far and Mourinho will be willing to offer him a deal if it is possible for both parties this summer.

Chelsea are also interested in making a move to sign Inter Milan forward Mauro Icardi once his contract with the club comes to an end this summer. The 25-year-old has been linked with several clubs since the end of last season but was unable to secure a move away from San Siro despite interest from Italian and foreign sides.

The report claims that Icardi is available for around £50 million this summer once his contract comes to an end and Mourinho wants to bring him in as he believes he can add something special to their attacking line which has struggled since the departure of Diego Costa who left Stamford Bridge earlier this month.

Jose Mourinho will also make a move for Paris Saint Germain striker Kylian Mbappe once his loan spell at Monaco comes to an end next summer. The 18-year-old has been linked with the club since last summer when it was believed that he would be on the verge of completing a deal to join Los Blanco but failed to secure a move due to the Frenchman's desire to stay at Monaco for another season.

The report claims that Mourinho wants to bring him in as soon as possible and has been keeping a close eye on his progress since last season and believes he can add something special to their attacking line once the youngster completes his loan spell with Les Monégasques next summer.

The club also want to sign AC Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma on loan this summer as they are looking for a long term replacement for Asmir Begovic who failed to impress during his short spell at Stamford Bridge earlier this season. The report claims that Chelsea have been in negotiations with the club and hope to bring him to England before the start of next season.

The club will also make a move to sign Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic once his contract with the club comes to an end this summer. The 24-year-old has been linked with Manchester City since last year but Mourinho wants to bring him in as soon as possible and is willing to offer the Bosnian international a deal which would make him one of the highest paid players at Stamford Bridge once his contract comes to an end.

The report claims that Chelsea are also interested in securing a deal to sign Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne this summer as they believe he could be a long term replacement for Alvaro Morata who is said to be unhappy with life at Stamford Bridge since his arrival from Real Madrid last summer.

The report claims that Chelsea are ready to offer him around £10 million per season on a deal until 2023 which would make him the highest paid player in England and they believe he would be willing to join them if they were offered such terms as his current contract runs out at the end of this season.

The club will also make a move for Monaco defender Benoit Badiashile on loan once his contract with the club comes to an end next summer. The 20-year-old has been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool since last year but Mourinho wants to bring him in as soon as possible and is willing to offer him a deal which would make him one of the highest paid players at Stamford Bridge once his contract comes to an end.

The report claims that Chelsea have been negotiating with the club for several months now over the signing of Badiashile on loan but will have to pay more than £6 million per season if they want him in their first team squad once the current season comes to an end.

The report also claims that Chelsea are interested in securing a deal to sign Paris Saint Germain forward Kylian Mbappe this summer. The 1
