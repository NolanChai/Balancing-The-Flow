move by a wealthy Gulf state to snap up some of London's best hotels.
  
 So what's happening? Who is behind these purchases? Why do they matter? And what does it mean for tourism in London and for travellers visiting London?

Here are the answers...

Who has bought a stake in these hotels? 
  
 The Qatari-owned Constellation Group is set to become the majority owner of InterContinental Hotels Group, which owns Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley. This will give Qatar control over three of London's most famous five-star hotels. 
  
 Why have they done this? 
  
 It seems that these purchases are all about prestige and influence. The Gulf states want to make themselves known on the world stage, and owning a slice of some of London's finest hotels will help do just that. 
  
 How does it affect travellers to London? 
  
 Tourism in London is not directly affected by these purchases - though there may be a knock-on effect as international tourists become aware of the ownership and decide to stay at these hotels instead. But for British tourists, these hotel purchases won't make a huge difference to their experience. 
  
 What will change? 
  
 The owners have not said what their long term plans are for these hotels - but it seems likely that they will want to put their stamp on the way things are run here in London, and perhaps change some of the things that make these hotels so great. For example, the Qatari-owned InterContinental Hotels Group has said that it is planning to refurbish its 153 InterContinental properties worldwide over the next three years - so there may be changes in the way that these famous London hotels look and feel.

So, what does this mean for travellers? Well, it seems like these hotel purchases are less about the experience of the tourist and more about the influence and prestige of the owners. While British tourists won't notice much difference in their visit to London, international visitors may be more tempted to stay at one of these hotels simply because they know that it is owned by a wealthy Gulf state.
  
 So, what can we expect in the future? It seems likely that there will be further purchases of luxury hotels in London - though perhaps not quite so many as the recent string of deals. And while the owners haven't said exactly how they want to change things at these famous hotels, it is possible that there could be some changes in the way that they look and feel.
  
 Overall, this seems like a smart move by the Gulf states - one that will give them increased prestige on the world stage while also potentially giving them more influence over how things are done in London. But for British tourists, it won't make too much of a difference to their experience of the city.

There was an interesting article recently about the recent purchase by the Qatari owned Constellation Group of a majority stake in the company that owns Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley Hotel. The eye-catching purchase was just the latest move by a wealthy Gulf state to snap up some of London's best hotels.

 In conclusion, this purchase seems like a smart move by Qatar, but one that will likely have less of an impact on British tourists than some may think. However, it could still affect international visitors, as they may be more tempted to stay at these hotels simply because they know that they are owned by a wealthy Gulf state.
