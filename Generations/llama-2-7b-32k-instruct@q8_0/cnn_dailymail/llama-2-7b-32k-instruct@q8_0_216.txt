may be in trouble -- at least according to a new study that suggests the Bard may not have written some of his most famous work.

The research, published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Biology Letters, was conducted by a team at King's College London led by Dr. William Shanks, a biologist. He and his colleagues compared DNA from 16 samples of Shakespeare's signature to that taken from a glove thought to have belonged to him. They found a mismatch between the two strands -- suggesting that Shakespeare was not the author of the plays for which he is so renowned.

"This may be shocking, but it appears we've been duped," Shanks told CNN. "If the data are accurate, they challenge what most people believe about William Shakespeare."

The team obtained a sample of the Bard's writing by using a pen knife to scrape a letter written by him in 1632 and stored at the Folger Library in Washington, D.C. They compared it to the glove -- which is on display at London's Museum of Writing -- with a DNA test that looks for short snippets of genetic material from the individual who handled both the pen and the glove.

In total, 16 samples were taken from the glove -- including parts worn by Shakespeare himself, his family members and servants. The researchers found four matches to different parts of the glove that were written between 1598 and 1632, when Shakespeare was alive and working as a writer and actor in London.

But they also discovered six mismatches -- including one from the end of King Richard II in 1601; and three others from works thought to have been written by Shakespeare later in his life, after he had left the city for Stratford-upon-Avon."

"It seems that Shakespeare's plays were ghostwritten," Shanks said.

The author of this study is not satisfied with their conclusion: "We would like to see further work done on the subject and we would also like to have an explanation as to how these differences occurred in the samples," he said.

"There are many ways that one's DNA can be altered, including through forensic means or when someone else uses the writing instrument after him."

Shanks added: "We believe it's more likely than not that this is a forgery. If Shakespeare didn't write them, who did?"

"There are many theories out there," Shanks said. "Some say Christopher Marlowe was a front for the Earl of Oxford; others suggest Robert Greene or Edward de Vere wrote his plays."

But he also suggests that the real author is none other than Sir Francis Bacon, who penned some 40 works -- including plays and poetry -- during his life.

The study has been widely reported in mainstream media outlets since Monday's publication, but its conclusions have not been well received by everyone."It seems to me that the only people who believe these results are those with a personal interest in promoting them," said Professor Stanley Wells of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, an institution founded more than 120 years ago.

Wells and other Shakespeare scholars have long accepted the playwright's authorship of his work -- including his historical plays Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V; comedies such as Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing; tragedies like Othello and Hamlet; and poems including Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece.
"This paper is just an excuse for a conspiracy theory," Wells said. "It's not worth the ink used to print it."

Wells has long maintained that Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564 -- which would make him 80 when he wrote King Lear and The Tempest and 85 when he died in 1616. But this study contradicts that. It suggests the playwright was born as much as four years earlier."

Shanks says his paper "does not challenge the accepted dating of Shakespeare's life, nor does it provide any evidence that anyone else wrote the plays," he said in an e-mail to CNN. "It is simply a report of a mismatch between DNA taken from one part of the world and another."

The researchers also state that their work has no bearing on whether or not Shakespeare's name should be attached to these works -- nor do they make any judgments about his authorship."We are just scientists who have uncovered an interesting result," said Shanks. "It is up to other scientists and literary scholars to determine the significance of this study."

Shanks' team has not yet found any evidence that Shakespeare had a twin or siblings -- which would be necessary for one person to write so much material."It could also mean someone else was playing the part of Hamlet," Shanks said. "Was it his twin? His sister?"

The researchers have published their findings in an academic journal, but they've made the full paper available online so people can draw their own conclusions."Shakespeare has been dead for centuries and he wasn't a famous person at the time," Shanks said. "So it is possible that some of these plays may not have come from him."

The researchers, however, admit there are several factors they haven't taken into account . They didn't take into account any inadvertent contamination during the sample collection process; nor did they test for a DNA profile that would suggest someone else was writing the plays.
"We also didn't have the luxury of comparing Shakespeare's samples to other known individuals who lived during his time," Shanks said."But if these findings are correct, then it's interesting," Wells said."If he didn't write them, it opens up a whole new area for investigation. Who wrote them?"

Shanks has another theory that could explain the mismatches . He suggests that Shakespeare had a twin or siblings -- which would be necessary to write so much material.In 2014, Shanks made headlines when he claimed in a paper published by The Times of London newspaper that someone else wrote all of Shakespeare's plays."If I'm right about this study, then it raises many questions," he said. "It opens up a whole new area for investigation into the authorship of these famous plays."

Shanks and his colleagues plan to submit their findings to another journal to have them independently reviewed."I think we should be cautious until some other scientists have had a look at it," Shanks said. "But if our data are correct, then something interesting is happening here."

A spokesperson for the Globe Theatre -- where Shakespeare's plays were staged in London during his lifetime -- called the study into question."We have always known that there was an air of mystery and romance around Shakespeare's life," said the spokeswoman, who didn't want to be identified. "But we find it difficult to believe this paper challenges what we think we know about Shakespeare's work."

Wells agrees with her ."The authorship question has been settled for some time," he said. "These are not new ideas, nor do they provide any evidence that someone else wrote the plays. It seems to me that these people should be ashamed of themselves."

Shanks is undaunted by criticism and wants more people to take a look at his research ."We're hoping that other scientists will come forward," he said. "It would be nice if some were from Oxford University Press (where Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was built) -- but we haven't gotten any responses."

Wells isn't convinced by the study or Shanks' claims."I can only say that it doesn't seem to me that there is much evidence for these claims," Wells said. "If they have a paper with new facts and information, I would be delighted if they submitted it to us for publication."

Shanks believes there may be another conspiracy involved in the Bard's plays -- one that has been hidden from public view."I think Shakespeare was part of an aristocratic club," Shanks said. "Someone who wrote the plays would have had to have had access to all sorts of people and information . He also would have had to have known about all these historical events."

Shanks believes this group would have been called The Oxford Players -- in reference to Oxford University, which was founded in 1570. Shanks said the club would have included some of the most powerful men in England at the time, including Queen Elizabeth I and her court ."I think they would have used someone else's name for their plays because it was so important," he said."It doesn't seem to me that there is any evidence that Shakespeare didn't write these plays."

Shanks and his team are hoping more people will take an interest in the study and help them find out why there are discrepancies between the two samples of DNA from the glove and a letter written by Shakespeare in 1632 ."We would like to see further work done on this subject," Shanks said. "It's more important than ever that we find out if these plays were really written by Shakespeare."
