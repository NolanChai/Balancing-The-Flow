A ten - year - old boy's obsession with naval history turned out to be a good thing when he met an octogenarian World War II survivor in Australia and invited him over for tea . The twin brothers had read books about the war at school, but it wasn't until they came across an article about the Royal Australian Navy that they discovered how interesting it was. They had never heard of Robert Harding before, but when they found out he lived near them in New South Wales and was 89 years old, they contacted him on Facebook to invite him over for a cuppa . Their mum Deborah told Daily Mail Australia, 'They're obsessed with naval history - it's the only thing they talk about . They always watch war documentaries together.' Robert Harding had been born in England and served onboard the HMS Prince of Wales during the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. He was also on board when it was sunk by Italian fighter aircraft in Alexandria, Egypt the following year . Now living in Australia he decided to accept their invitation and visit the twins at home - despite being a bit nervous about meeting his new friends . The boys were eager to hear Robert's stories of battle at sea and they chatted away as though they had known each other for years. Harding said, 'I can see them doing something like this in England or America but not here . It was great, I couldn't believe it.'
