Robert Harding served on board the HMS Belfast in the Royal Navy's Home Fleet during WWII and was stationed at Scapa Flow in Scotland for almost three years. The twins have been working closely with Robert to learn about his experiences while they write a book together.

They met through their school's friend of a friend, who connected them after hearing that the Harding brothers were interested in history. Robert agreed to meet them at their school in Northamptonshire and said he would be delighted to help with their project.

The twins had previously been helped by a historian to write about some of the local history and culture. They began working on their book at home but needed a fresh pair of eyes, so they reached out to Robert for his expertise.

Robert, who served as an Able Seaman, shared with them what he remembered from his time in the war. He spoke about some of the battles, such as the Battle of the Atlantic, and also told stories about daily life on board. The twins asked him questions about his experiences and were eager to learn more.

Robert Harding said that it has been a pleasure talking with them about these things, adding that they are bright young men who have so much in front of them, and he was happy to help them with their book. He said they made him feel as though he is back home again.

The twins have since taken Robert out for dinner at the school, where they all got along great. They are looking forward to working closely together in the future on their book about the Battle of Jutland and hope that it will help others understand more about WWII's naval history.

Robert Harding has encouraged other World War II veterans to share their stories with the twins, so they can help ensure that those who served keep their experiences alive for future generations.

The school said that this experience was a great opportunity for all involved and provided the boys with a unique learning experience. They hope that it will encourage other children to learn more about WWII history.
