Congealed waste blocks the drainage system in London
A 10 tonne 'fatberg' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of London's most exclusive streets. The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, is the biggest blockage to be discovered in the city since 2013. A spokesman for Thames Water said the fatberg had blocked a sewer at a location on Old Brompton Road - in Earl's Court, which was first identified on Monday morning by inspectors from the water company, and then removed. The firm said: "A team of engineers spent all day Tuesday clearing away the blockage with a vacuum tanker . It is likely to have been caused by household waste that had been washed down sinks or flushes."
