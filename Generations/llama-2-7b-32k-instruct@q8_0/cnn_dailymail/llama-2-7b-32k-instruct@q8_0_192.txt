Spanish artist Catalina Viejo, 31, has created a unique genre for herself with her colourful portraits of celebrity bottoms. The Spanish artist, who is based in New York, paints miniature pictures of famous people's backsides, which are often shown with the tagline "I know you're thinking it".

"I like to use my art as a tool to break boundaries and challenge societal norms," Catalina told MailOnline. The artist has painted bottoms of stars including Meryl Streep, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Angelina Jolie, with her work having been sold in galleries worldwide.

Catalina's work has become so popular that she is now selling miniature versions of her pieces for just $30 (£21). The Spanish artist has even started to sell her own T-shirts bearing the same taglines as the celebrity artworks, and they cost around $80 each.

"I want people to feel comfortable with their bodies and not be afraid to show them off," she said. "I think it's important for us all to embrace our individuality and celebrate our differences."

Catalina has also found a new audience in the LGBTQ+ community, who have embraced her work as a way of claiming ownership over their own bodies.
