ras for Liverpool's last match in India against Atlético de Kolkata at the YMCA Ground, the Italian coach had taken a short walk around his hotel and come across a boy playing cricket outside with a tennis ball. "I remember thinking back to when I was 12 years old," Ancelotti told the press conference. "The kid reminded me of myself."

Six months later, on May 25th, 2014, Atlético de Kolkata would lift the trophy at the first ever Indian Super League final at the YMCA Ground after defeating Mumbai City in front of a record crowd of over 87,000 fans. They had lost their opening match to Mumbai but recovered brilliantly to win nine out of their remaining eleven league games and finish top of the table as Ancelotti's team got used to Indian conditions and found some form. Their coach was a man with a special connection to India, who would later say "India is in my heart" after his time here ended.

In 1965 Carlo Ancelotti was born in Legnano, north-west of Milan, and grew up playing football on the streets and parks nearby before joining local side Pro Patria as a youngster. The club's president at the time, Gino Nestilli, noticed the kid with the curly hair and brought him to his house to watch Italy play England in the 1978 World Cup semi-final on television. Ancelotti went on to tell his grandchildren that this moment was what made him fall in love with football. "It was an amazing match," he said, recalling Giancarlo Antognoni's equaliser for Italy. Afterwards, Nestilli invited the family over for a barbecue and took them all around Milan to see famous landmarks before leaving Carlo at home with his mother after promising him he could go abroad.

Aged 12 in 1974, Ancelotti decided he would follow this up by watching Brazil play West Germany in the World Cup quarter-final. The match was played on a Saturday and afterwards the family took Carlo to a game between Milan and Bologna at the San Siro where they sat right next to the tunnel as the players walked out before kick off. "I knew then that I wanted to be a player," he said, recalling the excitement of seeing Brazilian winger Tesito running past defenders and hitting the crossbar.

In 1978, Nestilli took Carlo on his first ever trip abroad by signing him up for Pro Patria's youth team in a summer tournament in Lloret de Mar, Spain. Inspired by watching Dutch side Ajax play against Valencia at a pre-season friendly, Ancelotti decided to start playing as a striker rather than defender and went on to score 45 goals in 37 games for Pro Patria's youth team the following season, attracting attention from other clubs. He joined local side Varese before being signed by A.C. Milan at age 19 after impressing the club's scouts during a game against Lazio.

Ancelotti made his professional debut in the San Siro on January 3rd, 1980 and went onto score one goal in nine appearances for the Rossoneri before moving to Reggiana for €400,000 in July 1981. At age 21 Ancelotti was called up to Italy's national team for a friendly against Wales at Swansea's stadium where he made his international debut and scored the winning goal. He would go on to play two games for the national side before joining Parma in January 1983, scoring six goals in 27 appearances in all competitions that season as they won Serie C1, Italy's third tier of football.

In 1984 Ancelotti was signed by Napoli for €650,000 and helped the club to a second place finish in Serie A behind Juventus under coach Ottavio Bianco before joining Milan in August that year as part of a swap deal involving Franco Baresi. He would go on to win 21 trophies during his career including seven Scudettos, three Champions Leagues and two UEFA Super Cups. His final game for the Rossoneri was at the San Siro against Bari in the Italian Cup semi-final second leg where he came on as a sub for Massimo Ambrosini to a huge roar from the crowd and scored the winner with 12 minutes remaining, sealing Milan's comeback victory over two legs.

During his playing career Ancelotti also had spells in Germany at Bayern Munich and A.C. Ajaccio as well as returning to Italy for short stints with Parma and Napoli but it was at San Siro where he will always be remembered. His final game there as a player came in the 1992 Champions League final against Marseille when Milan won 4-0 after extra time, securing their third European title, and Ancelotti lifted the trophy while holding the hand of his two young sons.

Following his retirement from playing, he coached several youth teams at Milan including Under-16s before taking charge of Parma for the 1995/96 season where they finished in fourth place in Serie A and narrowly missed out on qualifying for the Champions League. After just a year with Parma he was offered the chance to coach Milan again by owner Adriano Galliani, who had become club president that summer, after replacing Silvio Berlusconi following his election as Prime Minister.

In Ancelotti's first full season at Milan in 1996/97 they finished second in Serie A behind Juventus and narrowly missed out on winning the title due to a goal difference of just three goals, which was then used to separate teams in case of a tie. In that same season he coached Italy for the first time against Saudi Arabia where the Azzurri won 3-1 at home but Ancelotti admitted "it wasn't easy" after his players had been disappointed with their performances in that year's European Championships.

During his four seasons at Milan, Ancelotti led them to two Serie A titles and a Champions League title before moving to Juventus for the 2001/02 season where he guided the club to another Scudetto after defeating Lazio in the final following a run of seven consecutive wins. The next season saw his side win the Coppa Italia against Perugia on penalties but it was an unhappy time at Turin and Ancelotti left the club, taking over at Chelsea for one season before moving to Paris Saint-Germain in 2004 where he led them to their first Ligue 1 title since 1994.

He then took charge of Milan once again for two seasons but had a difficult time with injury-ridden squads and struggled to get the best out of his players, only finishing in sixth place in Serie A each season despite spending €260 million on new signings. In 2011 he was offered the job at Bayern Munich where he took them to their first ever treble of the Bundesliga, German Super Cup and Champions League titles as well as winning the FIFA Club World Cup that year before moving back to Italy in January 2014 for one season with Napoli.

Ancelotti left the club due to a disagreement over his contract extension after helping them finish second place in Serie A but went on to be offered the job at Bayern again where he led them to another treble in 2015, this time winning the Bundesliga and DFB Cup titles. The next season was less successful for the club as they finished third place and were eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage but Ancelotti remained confident that he would be able to turn things around after bringing in his own players during the summer.

He then spent a year as coach of Bayern Munich where he led them to another Bundesliga title before moving back to Milan once again for the 2016/17 season, helping them finish in second place in Serie A and guiding them back into the Champions League for the first time since 2013. In his final year at the club in 2018 he would lead them to a record-breaking ninth Scudetto but was sacked in May 2018 after finishing third in Serie A.

In total, Ancelotti has coached for over thirty years and has won more than 50 trophies during his career including seven UEFA Super Cups, four Champions Leagues and three FIFA Club World Cups as well as numerous other titles, awards and accolades. He is widely considered to be one of the most successful coaches in football history having spent time coaching some of the biggest clubs in Europe and working for some of the biggest national teams around.

In 2017 he was offered the chance to coach Atlético de Kolkata at Indian Super League where he accepted before moving on to Real Madrid after being appointed by president Florentino Perez as successor to Zinedine Zidane who had been promoted to a director role with the club. Ancelotti has since spent time coaching Everton, Napoli
