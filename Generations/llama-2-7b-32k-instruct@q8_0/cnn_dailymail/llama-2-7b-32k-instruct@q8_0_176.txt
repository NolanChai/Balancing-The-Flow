Asked about the incident following the Final Four game Sunday, Kaminsky said that he had "forgiven" Harrison, adding, "I don't think it's worth my time to be angry."

Harrison and fellow freshman Devin Booker were asked about the slur in a news conference after Wisconsin beat Arizona. The two said they didn't hear what was said but both tried to downplay what happened as they talked to reporters.

"It wasn't intentional," Harrison said. "I don't think it was meant that way."

Booker agreed with his teammate.

"We were just playing basketball, so I don't know how you could take a game like this and make something out of it," Booker said.

Harrison later apologized to Kaminsky on Twitter: "I want to apologize to Frankie (Kaminsky) for my comments after the game yesterday," he tweeted Sunday. "I don't think there was any way that I intended to offend him."

Kaminsky responded by saying, "Thanks @A_Harrison34 . Don't sweat it"

Kentucky defeated Wisconsin, 75-73, in overtime in the Final Four on Saturday night to advance to Monday's national title game against Kansas. Kaminsky was called a racial slur by Harrison at the end of Kentucky's news conference afterward.

"It wasn't intentional," Harrison said. "I don't think it was meant that way."

Booker agreed with his teammate.

"We were just playing basketball, so I don't know how you could take a game like this and make something out of it," Booker said.

Harrison later apologized to Kaminsky on Twitter: "I want to apologize to Frankie (Kaminsky) for my comments after the game yesterday," he tweeted Sunday. "I don't think there was any way that I intended to offend him."

Booker also responded to Harrison's apology, saying "That's what you should do. It's not a big deal at all."

The slur came as the Kentucky players celebrated their win over Wisconsin. Kaminsky wasn't aware of what was said until his teammate and best friend, Sam Dekker, told him about it following the game.

"I just thought that it was funny," Dekker told USA TODAY Sports' Scott Gleeson earlier Sunday at the Final Four. "It didn't matter to me at all because I knew nothing had been meant by it."

Kaminsky brushed off the incident on Sunday, saying he had forgiven Harrison and that there was no reason for him to be angry at what happened.

"I don't think it's worth my time to be angry," Kaminsky said in a news conference on Sunday. "It is what it is."

What did the coaches say?

Wisconsin head coach Bo Ryan was asked about the racial slur called to his player by a Kentucky player in an interview following his team's Final Four victory over Arizona Saturday night. "I think it goes without saying that you never want anything like that to be said, and you address it," he said.

"In our program, we would have addressed that immediately with the players," Ryan added. "That's what I would have done."

Kentucky head coach John Calipari was also asked about the incident after his team's game on Saturday night but didn't say anything to reporters about it. After the Final Four game, he tweeted a photo of Kaminsky with him and his son CJ. He captioned the picture by writing that "This is what matters"

Kaminsky didn't seem to be bothered by what Harrison said and focused instead on his team's win over Arizona in the semifinals on Friday night. The Badgers defeated the Wildcats, 73-68, in front of a packed crowd at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.

"We wanted to go out there and play as hard as we can for our fans," Kaminsky said following the game on Saturday night. "Arizona had an unbelievable year and they were deserving of it. We just tried to take care of business."

Kaminsky scored 25 points in the win over the Wildcats. He led a group of four Badgers that reached double-digits scoring against Arizona, which lost its first Final Four game since 1947 when they were coached by Adolph Rupp. The Wildcats last played in a national title game back in 2012 under head coach John Calipari.

"We didn't start the way we wanted to," Arizona head coach Sean Miller said following Saturday night's game. "But we still fought and tried our best. We couldn't finish it out."

Kaminsky, Dekker and Ryan all said that they haven't heard what was said by Harrison. The Wisconsin players were focused on the fact that they beat Arizona in front of 70,529 fans at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.

"It feels great," Dekker said following Saturday night's win over Arizona. "We love playing for each other and we showed it today."
