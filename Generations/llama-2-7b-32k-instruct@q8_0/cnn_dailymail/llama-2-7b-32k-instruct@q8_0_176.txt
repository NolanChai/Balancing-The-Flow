Kaminsky, mother*****r,' as he walked past him while heading to a team huddle after his Wildcats' 74-73 overtime win over Wisconsin in the NCAA national semifinals on Saturday . The remark has created a firestorm of controversy, with many saying that it is indicative of racial insensitivity and an old school mentality of male athletes. Kaminsky says he's not paying attention to the issue or its repercussions.

"I don't think about any of those things," he said. "We have a team meeting before every game, so it's usually like three people go in front of everybody and talk about whatever they want - coaches, players, anybody that wants to say anything."

When asked if that situation was the most uncomfortable moment of his basketball career, he said: "No. I haven't had a lot of bad things happen to me on the court . If I did, I would let you know right now."

Kaminsky made 16-of-24 shots and scored a game-high 32 points to lead his team past the Wildcats in overtime. He was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four after leading Wisconsin to its first national title. The 7'0 center also had nine rebounds, six assists and two blocks during the championship game .

Kaminsky said he doesn't plan on speaking out about the incident as it would just bring more attention to an issue that isn't worth much focus: "I have no problem talking about basketball," he said. "But I don't want to talk about any other stuff."

As for Harrison, he is known as a fierce competitor who was mad at his team's performance and blames it all on Kaminsky .

"When we lost the game, I went in the locker room," Harrison said. "I told them that if we played Wisconsin again, it would be different."

The young Harrison also said he would have reacted the same way if a white player had made those comments to him: "That's not cool," he said.

"It doesn't matter who it is," he continued. "If I was playing with someone that did something like that, that wouldn't be cool. If he did say something like that, and I heard it, if I played against him the next game, I would let him know about it."

"I think that everybody knows who Frank Kaminsky is," Harrison said. "You just have to play him harder than he plays you. He's a great player."

Kaminsky made 5-of-9 shots and scored eight points against Kentucky in the national title game, which Wisconsin won 70-63 . After the win, Kaminsky was congratulated by his coach Bo Ryan and former teammate at Wisconsin, Devin Harris. He also had a lot of support on Twitter from players, journalists, analysts and fans:

"I've gotten nothing but love," he said. "I appreciate that."<s>
