According to a report from the Concord Monitor: "David Wihby was taken into custody by a police officer as part of an operation that targeted prostitution along Interstate 93 and nearby exits."

Wihby was booked at about noon Friday. He remained in the jail on Saturday afternoon and did not respond to a request for comment.""

The Monitor story also reported: "Ayotte's office said it is aware of Wihby's arrest and that he resigned on Monday morning, before his arrest was made public."

"Wihby, who has worked in Ayotte's Washington office since 2016 and previously served as the senior staff director for the Senate Health Education Labor & Pensions Committee from 2003 to 2007, is charged with "engaging in a sexual act in exchange for payment," according to his arrest record."

The Monitor story also reported: ""We are aware of Mr. Wihby's arrest and he resigned on Monday morning," Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said by email Saturday afternoon. He declined further comment when asked if the senator knew about Wihby's alleged conduct before his arrest."

The Monitor story also reported: "Wihby is scheduled to appear in Nashua District Court on Tuesday for an arraignment at 8 a.m., according to court documents."

The Concord Monitor article was published on August 5th, and the arrest occurred on Friday, Aug. 3rd, but neither the name of the person arrested nor his position in Ayotte's office was public knowledge until the publication of that article on Monday evening, as indicated by this Facebook post from an NH State Rep who is also a member of the Concord Monitor Community Group:
"The news report about the arrest of David Wihby in Nashua made it onto my Facebook wall at 5pm yesterday. The Concord Monitor story was published earlier today, but I had not seen the name or heard of him until this article came out."

It is unclear why the police officer chose to arrest Mr. Wihby and make his arrest public rather than issuing a citation for prostitution as has occurred in other similar cases in recent years. The Monitor article did not indicate whether or not he had been formally charged with any crime at that time of publication on Monday evening."

"According to the police report, Mr. Wihby was found soliciting a prostitute outside a business located at 305 Daniel Webster Highway in Nashua's South Middlesex industrial park near Interstate 93 . Police said they were conducting an undercover operation in which officers "acted as prostitutes" when Mr. Wihby arrived and solicited them, offering $170 for a sex act."

The police report states: "Once the transaction was consummated, he left with her in his car."

Mr. Wihby is scheduled to appear in Nashua District Court on Tuesday at 8am . It is unclear if he will be required to enter into a pretrial diversionary program as has occurred in several other recent similar cases . A pretrial diversionary program can result in the charge being dismissed if completed successfully."

"Senator Kelly Ayotte's senior aide arrested for soliciting prostitution"

"The Concord Monitor is reporting that Kelly Ayotte's Senior Policy Advisor David Wihby was taken into custody Friday afternoon in Nashua and charged with solicitation."

Ayotte's office said it did not know about the arrest until after Wihby had been arrested, but it has since accepted his resignation ."

It is unclear how long Wihby served as a senior policy advisor for Ayotte; a search of her website yielded no mention of him prior to June 2016."

The Concord Monitor article notes that "Wihby, who has worked in Ayotte's Washington office since 2016 and previously served as the senior staff director for the Senate Health Education Labor & Pensions Committee from 2003 to 2007," is also charged with "engaging in a sexual act in exchange for payment."

The article goes on: "Ayotte's office said it is aware of Wihby's arrest and that he resigned on Monday morning, before his arrest was made public ."

The Monitor story adds that Mr. Wihby will appear in Nashua District Court for an arraignment Tuesday morning."

"It should be noted that this is not the first time a person associated with Senator Kelly Ayotte has been arrested for solicitation of prostitution; however, it is the first public knowledge about it."

"On October 24th, 2017, a man identified by NH State Police as John R. Bransgrove, who at that time was an employee of Senator Kelly Ayotte's Washington office was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in Manchester . The arrest was announced in a press release from the Manchester police department."

"Bransgrove was ordered to appear in Manchester District Court for his arraignment Tuesday morning, October 31st at 8:45am. He did not appear on that date; however, it is unknown why he failed to appear ."

According to the police report of the arrest: "Bransgrove was found soliciting a prostitute in an area known for commercial sex activity."

Mr. Bransgrove has since resigned from his position at Ayotte's office, according to the Concord Monitor story."

"The Manchester Police Department press release about John R. Bransgrove's arrest did not provide any information about whether or not he entered into a pretrial diversionary program as is often done in these cases . The report did state that "This arrest was part of an on-going investigation, and there may be additional arrests.""

"Bransgrove remains listed as an employee at Ayotte's office website."

A search of the Concord Monitor story about Wihby yields no mention of the previous arrest of Bransgrove."

The Manchester police report on Bransgrove did not provide any information about how or why he was arrested, but it does state that "This arrest is part of an on-going investigation and there may be additional arrests in this case.""

No other media outlet has reported on either of these two men's arrests until the publication of the Monitor story Monday evening ."

The Concord Monitor article also reports: "Wihby is scheduled to appear in Nashua District Court on Tuesday for an arraignment at 8 a.m., according to court documents."
