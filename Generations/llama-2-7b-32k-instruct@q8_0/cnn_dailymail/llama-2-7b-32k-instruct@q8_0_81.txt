demeanor charge of "solicitation of prostitution". Mr Ayotte's office confirmed that Mr Wihby had resigned as his senior adviser for health care issues. He is due to appear in court next month, according to the Nashua Telegraph newspaper. The newspaper said he was arrested on Friday afternoon and released on $20 bail shortly after 6:00pm (2330 GMT). Mr Wihby's attorney has not yet returned a call seeking comment about the arrest. Mr Wihby, who began working for Senator Ayotte in May as a senior adviser to her Senate office, was quoted by the newspaper saying he planned to return home to Texas after leaving his job. He also said he had "made a mistake" and that it would not happen again, according to the newspaper report. The Associated Press reported Mr Wihby had been placed on leave earlier this week while an investigation into the matter was conducted, which the senator's office confirmed. The AP said Mr Wihby's arrest came just two months after Senator Ayotte's husband was arrested for drunk driving.

Kelly Ayotte is a Republican member of the Senate from New Hampshire who has served in the upper house since 2011, when she won a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Judd Gregg. She previously served as state attorney general and as a former deputy attorney general for the US Department of Justice. Mr Wihby's arrest comes as Senator Ayotte has been working hard in an attempt to hold on to her Senate seat, which she is defending against Democratic candidate Maggie Hassan.

Senator Kelly Ayotte said in a statement that Mr Wihby had "made a mistake" and that she had fired him from his post earlier this week while the investigation was being conducted."I have been deeply troubled by these reports, and I acted immediately to terminate David's employment," Ms Ayotte wrote.

In an interview with CNN on Monday, Mr Wihby said he planned to return home to Texas after leaving his job in New Hampshire and that the charges against him were "bogus". Mr Wihby was quoted by the newspaper as saying: "I'm a very private person and I think it was inappropriate for them (the authorities) to go public with this."

The arrest of Mr Wihby comes at an awkward time for Ms Ayotte, who is facing a tight race against Democratic candidate Maggie Hassan for her Senate seat. The two are neck-and-neck and it looks set to be a close call when the November election takes place."I think David's actions in this situation really underscore why voters have questions about leadership," Ms Ayotte told CNN on Monday.

The newspaper reported that Mr Wihby was arrested after police were called out by the management of an apartment complex in Nashua where he was staying following complaints from tenants regarding "a loud party"."His arrest, and his alleged conduct, is not consistent with our policies or community standards," the Nashua Apartments said in a statement.

According to police reports cited by the newspaper, Mr Wihby offered an officer $50 for sexual intercourse at about 4:27pm (2027 GMT) on Friday afternoon."After confirming that David Wihby was in fact soliciting prostitution, officers proceeded to arrest him," a statement from the Nashua Police Department read.

Mr Ayotte's office said Mr Wihby had been placed on leave earlier this week while an investigation into the matter was conducted. The Associated Press reported Mr Wihby had been arrested in May when he was allegedly caught taking pictures of himself and others at a local shopping mall."In May, we became aware of some very serious concerns regarding David's conduct," Ms Ayotte said in a statement.

"We immediately placed him on leave while the investigation was conducted, which is now complete," she added."I have been deeply troubled by these reports, and I acted immediately to terminate David's employment," the statement read.

According to a spokesperson for Ms Ayotte, the senator has not yet made a final decision on whether or not to seek re-election in November."As we have said from the beginning, this is an ongoing investigation," the spokesperson told CNN on Monday. "I think it's too early to tell how Senator Ayotte will handle her future campaign."

The arrest comes two months after Mr Ayotte's husband was arrested for drunk driving. The incident led to a public spat between the senator and her Democratic opponent, Maggie Hassan . The former attorney general was seen on surveillance video hitting a police cruiser with his pickup truck last month."She hit my car," Mr Ayotte told Fox News in an interview at the time.

"There's no excuse for that kind of behaviour," he added.Ms Hassan responded to Mr Ayotte, saying she was "disappointed" by his behaviour and called on him to step down from public office."We need someone who will serve us with dignity and respect in the Senate," Ms Hassan said at the time .

Mr Wihby's arrest comes just days after US President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his contact with a Russian diplomat."I was very glad to see that General Flynn had come forward," Mr Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this week. "And I think it's a sign of his courage and his integrity.""I hope people can feel comfortable talking to him," he added, referring to Mr Mueller.

Mr Wihby's arrest also comes as US Senator Al Franken, Democrat from Minnesota, has been accused of sexual harassment by several women over the past few weeks . The Senate ethics committee is investigating claims that Mr Franken sexually assaulted and harassed a radio host in 2016."I'm not going to go into all of the details," Mr Franken said on ABC News's This Week programme on Sunday."But I certainly want to apologise because there are no excuses for my actions, none whatsoever."

Mr Wihby's arrest comes as US Senator Al Franken is facing allegations that he groped and harassed a woman in 2010 while she was asleep in a hotel room."It was definitely inappropriate and I'm not going to defend it or make excuses for what happened," Mr Franken told CNN on Sunday ."But the truth of the matter is that I did not know I had done anything wrong at the time. And so, I feel bad about it now and I sincerely apologise."

Mr Wihby's arrest comes as US Senator Al Franken is facing allegations that he groped and harassed a woman in 2010 while she was asleep in a hotel room . The Senate ethics committee is investigating claims that Mr Franken sexually assaulted and harassed the radio host, Leeann Tweeden .She said the Democratic senator grabbed her breasts, forced his tongue into her mouth against her will and had written an explicit song about her for a radio station."I felt disgusted and violated by what he did to me," she told CNN in an interview last week . "And I was very afraid of retaliation."

Mr Franken's lawyer, Harland Braun, released a statement on Sunday saying his client was innocent and that the allegations were false . He also said Mr Franken would not resign from the Senate."We believe these accusations are completely untrue," Mr Braun told CNN in an interview on Sunday."My client is totally innocent of these charges, which are ludicrous.""These allegations come at a time when we are making progress towards confirming Brett Kavanaugh to be a Supreme Court justice. This is nothing more than a last ditch effort by the Democrats to derail that nomination and smear Senator Franken," he added .
