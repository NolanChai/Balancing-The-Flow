A man who boasted about plans for an armed robbery on Facebook has been jailed. Andrew Hennells, 26, posted a message saying: "I'm going to go raid the Tesco tomorrow night." He then made another post, which said he had been stopped by police and was "fuming". He was arrested an hour later outside his home in Greenhill Street, Sheffield city centre. Hennells, who admitted a charge of robbery when he appeared at Sheffield Crown Court, was sentenced to seven years and three months imprisonment .
