I have some stuff going on that will keep me away from the internet for a few days, and I don’t really have time to do anything except work and study.

I had an interesting talk with a friend about how people seem to be becoming more closed minded in general. People are starting to believe things without evidence or proof. It seems that these days, if something sounds good to you, it must be true. People also seem less open to changing their minds when presented with new evidence or information. I feel like the only thing people seem to want anymore is confirmation bias, and not really truth or knowledge.

I’ve had this discussion many times before but have always failed at convincing others that it was actually happening. But my friend agreed that it did appear to be a trend. He said that he feels like the media, especially on social media, only shows people what they want to hear and is pushing these narratives. People are really just eating this stuff up without thinking about whether it’s true or not.

I personally feel like it has something to do with the way people have lost faith in their own judgment and need someone else to tell them what to think. There’s a lot of distrust, and maybe that’s why so many people turn towards celebrities or influencers as though they know more than you ever could. I mean it is possible for someone to be famous and actually have useful things to say but most don’t really take the time to look into these people much deeper and see what kind of lives they lead, if any at all.

I’ve seen a lot of people in my own life turn towards this way of thinking recently and I try to be there for them and offer a different perspective but it usually goes unheard and ignored. Maybe the problem is that not everyone really wants their mind changed?

A lot of my friends are starting to become more conservative, or at least adopt a more traditional outlook on life. They’re becoming disillusioned by everything that has happened in the world lately. It’s hard for them to see things get worse and not lose hope, so they try to find something familiar to hold onto.

I don’t really know where all of this is going but I do feel like it will keep getting worse before it gets better. People are losing their sense of community and starting to turn against one another instead of trying to come together and fix things. Maybe that’s how humans have always been though, a pack mentality for the most part.

I just don’t know what we can do about it. I think we need more people like Jordan Peterson who are willing to speak out against these trends and call bullshit on them before they get too far. We also need more people to actually listen and be open to changing their minds instead of feeling threatened by it.

I guess only time will tell what happens, but for now, I’m going to keep doing my best to try to help people see things from different perspectives. Maybe some day we can change the course of this ship that has been set on its current path. Or maybe not, who knows? But at least I’ll know that I tried, and so will you.
