Governor Chris Christie got himself in trouble Tuesday night when he had a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting, which resulted in the New Jersey Governor being called out by the state's largest union for his lack of understanding and compassion for teachers and education. The altercation began after a woman asked Christie what his priorities would be for education reform if elected president in 2016, to which he replied that he would fire the secretary of education and start over. He then insisted that she raise her voice at him, and when she asked "Is this some kind of joke?" , he responded: "You want me to answer your question? Fine. I would fire you." The NJEA responded in a statement Wednesday that Christie's remarks are part of a pattern that shows his lack of understanding when it comes to education and teachers, arguing that they were representative of his lack of compassion for the communities he governs . When asked about this on "CBS This Morning" earlier this week, Governor Christie defended himself by saying that he had been passionate about education reform as governor because New Jersey had been at the bottom when it came to school funding. He insisted that he often had debates with teachers because they weren't interested in making changes."
