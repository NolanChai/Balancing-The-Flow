Christie Gets Heated Over Teacher Pay At Town Hall Meeting (VIDEO)   NJ Governor Chris Christie is interviewed by CNN's Jake Tapper at a town hall event in Monroe, New Jersey on Sunday. 
   The governor was in the midst of explaining why he has proposed reducing state aid to school districts when he was confronted about teacher salaries. Teacher Steve Gonnatti said: "You are not telling them [the teachers'] the truth that they deserve more money." Christie responded: "No, I'm saying you don't need to pay a million dollars for a starting teacher in this state anymore. You just don't have to do it." He continued: "But if you want to give your kid's teacher $140,000 so they can buy their second home in Cape May...I'm not going to tell them no, I'll let them make that decision...that's on them."   Christie added that he has never said he will take away teachers' collective bargaining rights. "I don't believe you should be able to have a union negotiate your paycheck for you," he said. Gonnatti replied: "I think you don't understand the public education system."   The governor interrupted and asked, "Is that why kids are failing? Is that because of the collective bargaining?" Gonnatti responded by saying Christie doesn't have to worry about teachers paychecks. 
   The governor told him again: "I think you don't understand public education." He then added, "If I had my way, I would give them none of it," meaning their $140,000 salaries. Christie continued his rant on the teacher pay issue and said there should be no more salary caps. Gonnatti argued that teachers in New Jersey are underpaid when compared to those in other states. He also noted that public school teachers have been doing their job without a contract since 2012, yet the governor has signed the pension and benefit changes into law.   Christie cut him off again: "But they didn't like it," he said of teachers' reactions to the benefits plan.   Gonnatti asked Christie if he knows how many kids go hungry in New Jersey schools? The teacher pointed out that teachers spend their own money on supplies for students, and don't get paid when school is closed due to snow days. 
   Christie responded by saying his budget will address these issues of teacher pay and benefits. He said there would be no more caps on salaries and the pensions would not be touched. The governor also said that he has asked teachers to contribute to their health care plans, but they have rejected his offer.   "But you can't do it with their money," Gonnatti replied. 
   Christie responded: "Yeah I could."
