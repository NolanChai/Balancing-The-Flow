Jurgen Klopp is set to return to his former club Bayern Munich when he leaves Liverpool. The German manager said last year that it would be an honor for him to replace Pep Guardiola at the Bundesliga giant once his contract with Liverpool expires in 2018, and now Bayern legend Franz Beckenbauer has backed Klopp’s appointment.

Beckenbauer is convinced Klopp would bring the kind of success he did as Bayern manager between 1996-2004, and thinks Klopp would be able to maintain the club’s dominance in German football when Guardiola leaves next year.

“Klopp will not leave Liverpool until his contract ends,” Beckenbauer told Sport Bild . “I think he will be in charge for a few more years yet. But it is clear that after 2018, there won’t be any other club that Klopp would go to.

“He could easily return to Bayern Munich because this club has always had and still has great significance for him. When Pep Guardiola leaves in the summer of 2019, Klopp should succeed him as Bayern coach.”

Beckenbauer insists that he is not close to his former teammate but believes they would be a match made in heaven . “I’m not friends with him,” Beckenbauer continued. “But if there was ever an opportunity, then I would be happy for both sides and would welcome Klopp back to Bayern Munich.

“There is nothing more important than continuity in sports like football.”

Klopp has been linked with the German job since Guardiola announced he would leave Bayern at the end of his current contract . And while Beckenbauer’s comments suggest that Klopp is a leading candidate for the post, other candidates are also rumored to be under consideration.

Guardiola has already said that it won’t be easy for him to leave Bayern, which he led to three Bundesliga titles and two Champions League crowns . And with the team still playing well in all competitions this season, there is no reason why Klopp couldn’t wait until next season.

But Klopp himself has ruled out returning as Bayern coach in an interview last year, saying: “I don’t know what will happen after my contract expires [in 2018]. I will never say that it is impossible for me to go back one day.”

Klopp could be ready to take on a new challenge and there are plenty of candidates who have been linked with Bayern Munich in the past. Two other leading contenders would be current Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, and former Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes .

Heynckes was in charge at Bayern between 2011-2013, but he left after only two seasons when his team finished the Bundesliga campaign with just 87 points. After a season as coach of Real Madrid, Heynckes is back coaching Bayern Munich on an interim basis for this season.

Both Tuchel and Heynckes are also expected to leave Dortmund and Bayern Munich respectively at the end of this season .

Klopp would bring a great deal of experience with him, having worked his way up through the youth teams of Schalke 04 before taking over as coach. Klopp then spent nine years coaching Mainz 05 and Dortmund, winning two Bundesliga titles in between .

While Bayern Munich may have been Klopp’s former club, he also knows how to win against the Bavarian powerhouse . In his time at Dortmund, Klopp led his team to a German Cup victory over Bayern in 2013.

His style of play is also expected to be well received by Bayern fans, and Beckenbauer believes it would be “perfect” for the club.

“The biggest challenge at Bayern Munich has always been to convince everyone involved that the coach knows what he’s doing,” said Beckenbauer. “But Klopp would have no problem with that.”

With all of these candidates in consideration, the decision is expected to be made soon . And while it won’t be an easy one for Bayern Munich, there seems to be a strong consensus that Klopp should be the choice .

Following his side’s 2-1 loss to Schalke on Wednesday in the Bundesliga , Guardiola himself admitted that the next Bayern coach should not try to emulate his style of play. “The next one mustn't look at me,” he said .

“He has to be who he is. There are many different ways to win.”

Beckenbauer also believes Klopp’s time in England and his experience working with players like Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge would make him the perfect choice for Bayern Munich. “There are a lot of great players who were not satisfied at Liverpool,” he added .

“That was one of Klopp’s biggest problems at Liverpool.”

This season has been a disappointment so far for Bayern Munich, with the club having struggled to find any sort of consistency. But with Klopp in charge, Beckenbauer thinks the club could return to its former glory . “Klopp would have no problem returning to Bayern Munich,” he said .

“The only question is whether it will be on a full-time basis or not.”

It’s clear that Klopp and Bayern Munich would be a good match, but only time will tell if it actually happens. For now though, fans are already looking forward to what could be one of the biggest managerial appointments in German football history.
