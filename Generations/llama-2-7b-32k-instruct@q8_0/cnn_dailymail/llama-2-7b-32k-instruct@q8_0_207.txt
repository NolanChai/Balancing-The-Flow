Zulu King Blamed for Violence Has History of Scandals 
  
  
  
  
 JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, the man South Africa's government has blamed for sparking the violence against foreign nationals that has erupted this week and turned the country's streets into battlefields, is no stranger to scandal. 
  
 Since his coronation in 1987 he has been accused of everything from sexual abuse of young girls to rape and incest - charges denied by him and his supporters. 
  
 The king was once arrested for refusing a breathalyzer test, after a night out drinking, but the case against him was later dropped in court. In 2016 he had his car impounded for driving under the influence of alcohol and it has been reported that he was seen getting intoxicated at public events in recent years. 
  
 Last year the king's nephew Mbulelo Zwelithini was arrested on suspicion of rape, but the case against him collapsed when the alleged victim failed to show up for a trial after her uncle paid her a dowry to withdraw the charges. 
  
 In 1987 Zwelithini was implicated in a scandal involving a local woman and two senior police officers when he was still known as Goodwill Ngwenya, his birth name. 
  
 His nephew, the current Zulu King's brother-in-law Nkosi Mpumlwana was accused of raping the unidentified woman after they were introduced to her by Zwelithini at a nightclub in Durban. At the time Ngwenya was a police officer. 
  
 The scandal led to calls for Zwelithini's coronation, which had been planned long before he was named as the successor of King Cyprian Mpaka who died in prison after being convicted on charges including rape and kidnapping. 
  
 "In my view it will not be possible for him to lead the Zulu nation successfully if he has these tendencies," said Sibusiso Moyo, a spokesman for the South African Council of Churches at the time of Ngwenya's arrest . 
  
 Since his coronation in 1987 Zwelithini has been involved in two more rape cases. In one he was acquitted and in another the case against him collapsed when the alleged victim did not appear in court. 
  
 On Sunday South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa denounced "the despicable attacks on foreign nationals" as un-African, saying they were fuelled by the king's call for Zulu warriors to take up arms against those he called invaders . 
  
 The king has denied being behind the violence but South Africa's ruling party has been left stung by his comments. Ramaphosa in a speech on Wednesday defended foreign nationals, saying they had contributed to economic growth and were part of the fabric of society. 
  
 South African media has reported that he told Zulu traditional leaders during meetings at the weekend not to respond to attacks against foreigners who were not from other parts of Africa. 
  
 "The king said, 'We will not respond to those people from Europe or Asia,'" one leader was quoted as saying . 
  
 Ramaphosa has defended the king's right to freedom of expression and asked him to use his position responsibly. Zwelithini is due to meet with Ramaphosa at his office on Thursday, a spokesperson for the president said. 
  
 The violence has left at least 38 people dead this week, including six foreign nationals shot by police, while nearly 600 have been arrested, according to South Africa's government.
