Terrorist organization ISIS has released a new propaganda video featuring an Australian doctor, who had gone to Syria to work for them.  The video was released on April 20, 2018 and is the latest in a series of videos that have been released by the group since its emergence in 2014. In it, the doctor, identified as Dr. Tareq Subhany, speaks about his experience working for ISIS and the group's commitment to providing healthcare to the people under its control.

The video is part of a larger propaganda campaign by ISIS to portray itself as a legitimate and effective governing body. In it, Dr. Subhany praises the group's leadership and its commitment to providing healthcare to the Syrian people. He also emphasizes the need for doctors and medical professionals to come to Syria and work for ISIS, stating that they will be "helping the Muslims".

The release of this video comes as ISIS is facing increasing military pressure from coalition forces in both Iraq and Syria. The group has been losing territory and its influence has been eroding over the past few years. The propaganda campaign, including Dr. Subhany's video, is an effort to counter these losses by portraying ISIS as a viable and legitimate governing body.

It is also worth noting that Dr. Subhany is not the only Australian who has gone to work for ISIS in Syria. In 2016, two other Australians were arrested for their alleged involvement with ISIS, including one man who had been working as a doctor in the group's healthcare system. The release of this video by ISIS is likely an attempt to attract more medical professionals to work for them and provide a sense of legitimacy to their healthcare services.

Overall, the release of this propaganda video highlights the continued efforts of ISIS to portray itself as a legitimate and effective governing body, even as it faces increasing military pressure from coalition forces in both Iraq and Syria. It also serves as a reminder that individuals who are drawn to ISIS's ideology may be willing to do harm to others in order to further their cause.

It is important for governments and law enforcement agencies to remain vigilant in monitoring the activities of individuals who may be involved with terrorist organizations, and to take action against those who pose a threat to public safety.
