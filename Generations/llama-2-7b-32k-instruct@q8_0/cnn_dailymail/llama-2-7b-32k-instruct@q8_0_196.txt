reported can often be infested by these toxic spores which cause symptoms such as headaches and joint pains.

While many people believe in ghosts, this new study suggests they may just be the result of a chemical reaction. The scientists involved have said that while there is no scientific explanation for why mould appears so often in haunted buildings, it does provide an alternative to the supernatural. They think the spores could cause paranormal activity by producing similar symptoms.

They also suggest the bumps in the night may not be a ghost at all but just mould. The study's lead researcher Dr Paul O'Connor told The Sun: "Often when we go to investigate claims of ghosts, we find other types of phenomena that can be easily explained by natural causes.

"There are noises and bumps in the night which could actually be mould." He continued: "The idea of ghost haunting may just be a by-product of our own biology and what we see when we have exposure to these chemicals."

Dr O'Connor added that they had found spores of Stachybotrys - the so called 'toxic mould' in 92 percent of homes tested. He said: "You don't need to be a scientist to know what it looks like, or where to find it.

"The presence of this type of mould can explain many of these ghost sightings and hauntings."

Many people have claimed that they have seen ghosts in older buildings such as castles, but Dr O'Connor says there is a more scientific explanation than paranormal activity. He also thinks it might be the case that modern technology has made people more aware of their surroundings and this may lead to seeing things that used not to exist before.

The scientists involved are now calling on people to have their homes tested for these spores if they suspect ghosts or hauntings, so they can rule out a natural explanation. Dr O'Connor said: "If you want to believe in the supernatural then great but at the same time we think it is worth getting your home checked and finding out."

Hallowe'en, the night before All Saint's Day - a time for ghostly encounters, witches and bats. The origins of this festival are thought to be linked with pagan feasts in honour of the dead as well as Samhain, an ancient Gaelic harvest festival celebrated at the end of October.

Over the years Hallowe'en has evolved into a more commercialised holiday when children go 'trick or treating'. Traditional costumes are replaced by masks and fancy dress - often with blood, gore or other scary themes. The American tradition of carving pumpkins and lighting bonfires to welcome in the spirits of Hallowe'en is also increasingly popular.

Those who believe in the supernatural say they have seen 'ghosts' on this night but what are these spooky apparitions? According to folklore, ghosts come in many different shapes and sizes: a grey lady, a black dog or even an old woman carrying a baby. They also appear at various times of day; some haunt only certain times of the night, others during broad daylight.

Their presence may be associated with a specific place such as a house, where they remain until their unfinished business is dealt with or sometimes even their name is said to protect against them.

Some people who claim to have seen ghosts say it has changed the way they live - one woman in London told The Mirror that she now does not go to haunted places and tries to avoid houses where there have been reports of sightings. She says her experience was terrifying: "I'm a firm believer, I used to laugh at them but after my own encounter it really frightened me.

"I had always believed in ghosts but after seeing one first-hand, you don't know if they are watching your back or not."

But what if these sightings and encounters with the supernatural have more scientific explanations? A study published earlier this year suggested that 75 percent of people who say they have seen a ghost had been exposed to Stachybotrys. It is believed to cause hallucinations, migraines and joint pains which are similar to paranormal activity symptoms.

This could also explain why many haunted buildings appear to have mould growing on their walls - perhaps these spores are causing the 'spirit' sightings? Another study published this year suggests people who watch TV shows or films featuring ghosts and paranormal activity may be more likely to report seeing a supernatural presence themselves.

It could be that our increased awareness of such things in modern times is encouraging us to believe these spirits exist - but what do you think? Is Hallowe'en just a fun holiday or are there actually ghosts lurking around the corner? Let us know your thoughts below!
