a popular tourist attraction

Scientists believe there is a connection between sightings of ghosts and mold in buildings. A team of researchers claims people who have seen ghosts may be experiencing the effects of exposure to mould, according to a study published Tuesday in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health . The researchers from University College London analyzed 270 cases where ghosts were allegedly spotted at a haunted location in Britain. They found that almost half of these sightings occurred at locations with mould growth or dampness, such as old buildings that had been turned into tourist attractions. "The study adds to mounting evidence suggesting the link between mould exposure and reported paranormal experiences," says lead researcher Professor Claudia Binder in a press release. Previous studies have linked the presence of fungi with feelings of sadness, anxiety or restlessness. But the latest study goes one step further, connecting these feelings to ghost sightings . The researchers acknowledge that it is unclear whether exposure to mould causes paranormal experiences, or vice versa. They also say their sample size was limited and could not account for people who did not see any signs of mould. A spokesperson from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health told the Daily Mail that the paper is a "pre-print" , meaning it has not yet been peer reviewed by other researchers. "Although it's interesting, I would advise people to take this with a pinch of salt," says Professor David Spiegelhalter from University of Cambridge.
