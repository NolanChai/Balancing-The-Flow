United beat bitter rivals City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium thanks to goals from Juan Mata and Robin van Persie, who was making his debut for United after completing a £24million move from Arsenal in January. And Cantona believes they have what it takes to win the title again next year.
'The Manchester derby was won by kings of the city, kings of the world,' Cantona said on Sunday evening on his personal Twitter account @Cantona7 . 'I hope that United will be able to start winning the league in 2014.'
Cantona also hinted at what Van Gaal would need to do for the club to have a good chance of being champions next season, as he wrote: ‘The coach has to change the philosophy. Players must have more freedom and confidence, they cannot wait for one player to make the difference. They can all make that difference.'
Van Gaal was appointed United boss in May and is set to bring an end to David Moyes' 10-month spell in charge at Old Trafford when he takes up his position next summer.
But despite Van Gaal’s success with Barcelona, the Dutchman will not have a easy job ahead of him if he is going to challenge for the title, as City are expected to be among the frontrunners once again this season after spending £148million on players since 2013.
United, meanwhile, finished seventh last season and will have a tough start in their first campaign under Van Gaal as they face champions City in August’s Community Shield, before playing the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur at home to begin their Premier League campaign.
However, Van Gaal does not believe his appointment will bring any fear factor back into United’s players or supporters, as he said on Monday: ‘I'm a positive person. I don’t think about my name is better than anyone else. But when you see the list of the clubs that have won the Premier League title in England, it’s not possible to go there without being afraid, because if you go to Liverpool and Arsenal and Chelsea and Tottenham, and then Manchester United, this list will scare you.
‘But I don’t feel afraid. So why should my players be afraid? They should enjoy the competition.’
United are currently preparing for their summer tour of Australia and China, which begins on Saturday at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium before the 32-year-old will take charge in July. He was also quick to stress that it would not be easy to get his side back up there with the likes of City and Chelsea, as he added: ‘The Premier League is always difficult - for everyone.’
