Detectives probing the suspected murder of a landlady who disappeared 17 years ago have dug up the patio of her pub. Deborah Steel, 37, who ran the Royal Standard pub in Ely, Cambridgeshire, was last seen alive on October 24, 1986. She has never been found. Officers from the Cambridgeshire Police's Major Investigation Team have now uncovered human remains - believed to be those of a young adult female - during their search of the pub's patio. Forensic experts were called in to excavate the site and carried out tests on the bones, but the investigation is at an early stage and they are still trying to establish what it means. The team also said that the remains could be from a person who has never been reported missing or whose identity had not previously been known. A spokesman for the Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have exhumed human remains that we believe relate to Deborah Steel.
