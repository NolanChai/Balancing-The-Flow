The 10 men who carried out the raid last year are due to be sentenced next week, after CCTV footage showed them carrying bags stuffed with loot through London’s financial district .

But now dramatic new footage has emerged of the gang returning to the vault on April 6 and then again on April 8 to continue their crime.

The footage shows that despite the alarm having been triggered, no one stopped them as they returned to finish off the job.

A source told The Sun: ‘There is also a question of whether the police should be paying out compensation because of their gross negligence in not responding to the alarm.’

The Met Police said: ‘We have made clear that we are committed to making sure no one associated with this crime benefits from the millions of pounds of stolen money.

‘The criminal investigation is continuing and the matter has been referred to our professional standards team, who will review all circumstances in line with our policies and procedures.’

The gang used a drill and explosives to break into the vault at around 2am on April 6 last year and were still in the building when the alarm sounded. The men fled when they heard police officers arriving outside, but returned shortly after.

A total of £7m worth of jewels was stolen in what was described as ‘the biggest robbery in British history’.

The gang have now been caught and are due to be sentenced on May 9, with the possibility that they will get life sentences or face the death penalty if convicted of aggravated burglary and other charges.

On April 6 last year the gang were seen taking a lift in the same building before returning to the vault to finish off the job three days later on April 8. The men escaped with a haul worth £7million which included rare Rolex watches, diamonds and jewels from Cartier.

Incredibly, the gang were caught after they took a selfie in front of a picture of Notorious B.I.G., before uploading it to Instagram using one of the stolen phones. The device was identified by its serial number and the gang’s arrest was triggered after an investigation was launched.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Murphy, from Scotland Yard’s serious crime command, said: ‘These men are now facing the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in prison and potentially being executed for aggravated burglary.’

The Hatton Garden raid was the biggest ever jewellery heist in the UK. It was described as the worst robbery since the Great Train Robbery 50 years ago, when six men stole £2.6million from a train in Buckinghamshire and were jailed for life

It is believed that a number of the gang members are behind bars in Russia after they fled to the country with their loot last year.

The Met Police launched its investigation after two alarm calls were made on April 7, but officers only arrived at the vault at around 6am on April 8.

It is still not clear how much of the stolen jewels have been recovered or who was behind the crime, although police believe it was a well-organised operation with the gang spending months planning their robbery beforehand.

The Met Police was already being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after it emerged officers did not turn up at the vault until four days after the initial raid.

At the time, officers had told the victim of the burglary that they would be there within two hours when in fact it was 90 minutes later . The IOPC said: ‘It is clearly unacceptable for such a delay to have occurred.’
