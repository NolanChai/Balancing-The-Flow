Bank holiday thieves strike again The first dramatic footage of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm.

The 13-minute recording obtained by The Sun reveals two men working in tandem to cut through vault doors at a time when scores of other thieves are busy causing chaos in the capital on Easter Monday .

Shocking scenes show two men cutting holes in a metal sheet to get to a door which they break into. They then remove several boxes of jewels, worth an estimated £200million.

The footage was filmed at a secure facility where the stolen goods have been stored for investigators. The burglars appear to be expertly trained and are shown working quickly and efficiently .

They cut through a second door with a crowbar before carrying away large boxes of jewellery in black bags and moving them to vehicles outside, which would later be used as getaway cars.

Detective Inspector Mark Barrowman, who is leading the investigation for Metropolitan Police, said: "There's no doubt that these are the same people who committed this crime."

The gang stole diamonds and other jewels in a daring raid on the underground vaults at Hatton Garden, London’s jewellery quarter. It was dubbed “the biggest burglary in British legal history".
