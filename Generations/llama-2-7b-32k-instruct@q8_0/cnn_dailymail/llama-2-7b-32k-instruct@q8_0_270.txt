"Take That's unpaid tax bill stands at more than £7million after the pop stars missed a £3million deadline in November,"

Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald have been ordered by HMRC to pay their overdue VAT bills .

They are expected to have paid it back last month as part of an agreed deal with tax chiefs.  
The trio's company Take That Entertainment Limited was hit with a £20million bill in September 2018, but has so far only repaid £9million .  
As part of their agreement with HMRC they had been given a deadline to pay the full amount by November 30 last year.

But now, one year after they were ordered to repay it in full, Take That have still failed to fully settle their debt .

The group are reportedly set to pay the outstanding £7million on January 25, according to a report by The Sun .  
A source close to the band said: "They will be making the final payment in full. They are now ready to do it and have been working with HMRC to find a date that suits everyone."  
HMRC confirmed Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald had paid back £3million by November 2018.

They added: "The amount is being settled through instalments in line with the terms of their agreement."  
Take That's failure to pay has sparked a fierce backlash from fans, with many taking to social media to criticise them for not paying what they owe .  
One wrote on Twitter: "I used to like Take That but I cannot respect anyone who doesn't pay their taxes."  
Another added: "Take That should be ashamed of themselves. Pay your bloody tax!"  
A third tweeted: "@TakeThat should all have been in jail a long time ago"

While some even went as far to say that they would never again support the group .  
One wrote: "I used to love Take That but I won't be buying any of their music ever again."  
The group were originally ordered to pay back HMRC in full in December 2016, after it emerged the three stars had not paid VAT on purchases between 2014 and 2017 .
