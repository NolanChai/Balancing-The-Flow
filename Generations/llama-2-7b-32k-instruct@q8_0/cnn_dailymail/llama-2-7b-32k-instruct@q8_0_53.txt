"Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma while walking home from school in Winnipeg, Manitoba."

A 10-year-old boy who beat a younger child to death in Canada went to his friends claiming that he had witnessed a 'big guy' strike the victim with a rock. Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma while walking home from school in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The boy said he was taking a shortcut through an alley to his home when a man came out of nowhere and hit Lee on the head with a rock, according to CBC News . "Lee Allan Bonneau's mother is devastated," RCMP Corporal Tammy Skot said. "She wants to know why her son was targeted."

The 10-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, has admitted he hit Lee in the head with a rock at least twice after being struck by the man. He then dragged his body into an alleyway and left it there for two hours before calling authorities, according to CBC News . Skot said the attacker was seen leaving the scene of the crime on foot. "We want anyone who witnessed this incident to contact police," she said.

A mother whose son lives close to Lee's home told CTV News that she believes her child may have been targeted because he has Asperger syndrome. She also shared how saddening it was that a child had to die for the boy responsible for killing him to face consequences. "He would get bullied all the time and I'm sure this has happened before, but you don't want your son to be killed," she said, adding, "You think he's got Asperger syndrome so that means he can do whatever he wants?"

A GoFundMe page created by Bonneau's family read, "Lee was an amazing kid. He had a huge smile and hugged everyone who walked into the house." The page also highlighted how much of a lover of nature Lee was. It said that he spent hours playing with his trucks in the yard or making bird feeders.

In a statement, Bonneau's parents said they are "devastated beyond belief" and thanked everyone for their support."
