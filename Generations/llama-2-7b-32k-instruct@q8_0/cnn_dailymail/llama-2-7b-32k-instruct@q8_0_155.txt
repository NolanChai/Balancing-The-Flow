ers, researchers say this isn't likely to be the case.

"It is not realistic that they would have climbed over such an incline," says Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Missouri in St Louis. "They probably wouldn't have been able to walk on their own." [Image Gallery: Dinosaur Feet]

Dinosaurs were certainly capable of ascending steep hillsides. Many had long legs and wide feet, which would help them balance as they climbed or descended a slope. But the angle of the rock face where these particular dinosaur tracks were found suggests that they couldn't have walked up it unaided, Fisher said.

"It's not like you can just walk straight uphill," he added. "There has to be some sort of pathway."

Another researcher on the study, Luis Chiappe of the National Museum of Natural History in Madrid, agrees that it would have been difficult for these dinosaurs to climb this rock face unassisted. But he noted that they may have traveled up a steep slope at an oblique angle and used their feet as a tool — something like "walking on a staircase," Chiappe said, without any help from other appendages or aids.

This dinosaur trail is also different than the many others known of these types of tracks because it has been preserved in such good condition. Usually, sediment fills up the tracks and buries them over time. In this case, though, the rock face was exposed by a landslide, which prevented such debris from covering the tracks.

The discovery shows that at least some dinosaurs could climb steep hillsides. But because these particular prints were found in Bolivia, rather than a region better known for its dinosaur fossils, researchers can't say whether or not this behavior was typical of all sauropods, or just a specific group of the large-bodied herbivores.
