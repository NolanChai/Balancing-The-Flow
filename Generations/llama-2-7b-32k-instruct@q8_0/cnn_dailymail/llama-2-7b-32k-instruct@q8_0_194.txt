The newly expanded Terminal 3 at Beijing airport will be able to accommodate about 105 million passengers per year when it opens in mid-2019, more than double its current capacity of around 45 million a year. This is enough to handle almost twice as many travelers as the second busiest air terminal in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia, which handles about 60 million travelers per year.

The expansion is designed to meet the needs of Chinese tourists, who now make up a significant portion of passengers at Beijing airport. In 2017 alone, more than 95 million domestic and international trips were taken from the airport, with an average daily capacity of nearly 64,000 travelers, according to reports from state media.

The expansion will include new check-in areas, more gates for aircraft to dock, and additional food options, including a special area designated for passengers who want to eat Chinese cuisine, such as Peking duck. Passengers will also have the option of taking an "elevated walkway" connecting Terminal 3 to its neighboring terminal, which has been built at a cost of 26 billion yuan ($3.78 billion).

This is part of Beijing's plan to build up infrastructure for the 2022 Winter Olympics in the city. The airport expansion will also allow more flights to be operated between China and countries around the world, which will facilitate trade and investment.

However, with the number of Chinese travelers expected to continue increasing, it is not clear whether Beijing's new terminal 3 will be able to handle even higher numbers in the future. It remains to be seen if other airports will follow suit and expand their terminal capacity to cope with the influx of Chinese tourists.

The rise of Chinese tourism has been significant in recent years, as the country's economy has grown rapidly. According to a report by the World Tourism Organization, China is expected to become the world's largest outbound travel market by 2030. The number of Chinese travelers abroad reached nearly 145 million last year, an increase of more than 10 percent from 2016, which means that Beijing airport may soon be handling even higher numbers of passengers than expected.

In conclusion, the expansion of Terminal 3 at Beijing airport is a response to the growing number of Chinese tourists eager to travel the world. The new terminal will allow more flights to operate between China and other countries, facilitating trade and investment and helping Beijing prepare for its upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics. However, it remains to be seen if other airports around the globe will also need to expand their terminal capacity in order to handle the growing number of Chinese tourists eager to explore the world.

Beijing, China - The Chinese government has announced plans to build what is set to be the largest and most powerful radio telescope in the world, capable of seeing 13 billion light-years into space. This ambitious project is part of a broader effort by China to become a leading player in the field of astronomy and advance its scientific knowledge.

The telescope, which will be built in a remote region of the country called the Jinghong Astronomical Telescope Station, will consist of 4,450 individual dishes, each measuring 25 meters (82 feet) across. When operational, it will have a total effective collecting area of over 1 million square meters - more than double that of the famous Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

According to Professor Peng Bo from the National Astronomical Observatories of China, who is leading the project, "This telescope will allow us to see farther into space and study celestial objects with greater detail than ever before."

One of the key advantages of radio telescopes like this one is that they can detect signals from objects in space that are not visible to optical telescopes. By studying the faint radio waves emitted by these objects, scientists hope to gain new insights into the early universe and its evolution over time.

The telescope will also be used for other purposes, such as monitoring solar flares and other phenomena in our own solar system, and perhaps even detecting alien life on other planets. "We want to explore the unknown and discover new things about the universe," Professor Peng said.

Construction of the telescope is expected to take around five years, with the first dish due to be installed in 2023. Once complete, it will be used not only by Chinese scientists but also by astronomers from around the world.

The cost of the project has not been revealed, but it is likely to be significant. China has invested heavily in science and technology in recent years, and this project represents a major step forward for its space program.

In conclusion, China's planned radio telescope will be a groundbreaking tool for astronomers around the world, allowing us to study the distant universe with unprecedented detail. The project is a symbol of China's commitment to science and technology, and it will no doubt fuel further innovation in this exciting field.

Beijing, China - China has announced plans to build what is set to be the world's largest radio telescope, with a dish that will span 500 meters (1640 feet) across. This enormous instrument, which will be built in a remote region of the country called the Jinghong Astronomical Telescope Station, represents a major step forward for China's space program and its ambitions to become a leading player in the field of astronomy.

The telescope's dish, which is being constructed using advanced technologies and techniques, will be composed of 4,450 individual panels that are each about 3.7 meters (12 feet) thick. When completed, it will have a total effective collecting area of over one million square meters - more than twice that of the famous Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
