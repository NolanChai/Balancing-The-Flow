imicking a 'manta ray' by swimming in a tight circle around another group, who act as decoys for the predators. This clever behaviour is known as "swarming". It's believed that the collective movement has been adopted to fool the sharks into thinking there are more fish to eat than actually exist. The pictures were taken off the coast of Brazil by photographer and biologist, Marcio Isensee e Sousa . He said: "The purpose is to stay together with the shoal in a compact formation so they can confuse the predators." Mr Isensee believes swarming is also used as protection against other fish that prey on them. As well as this, the photography enthusiast pointed out how swarming may have evolved to keep the group together and protect it from rougher weather conditions or potential obstacles in the water. The pictures were taken in May 2016 when Mr Isensee was out photographing sharks. He said: "I saw a shoal of fish close to the surface so I decided to take some photos - this is how I captured these fantastic images ." Mr Isensee explained that he took more than 8,000 pictures on that particular day and many were blurred or not properly composed. It was only when he reviewed them at home in his studio that he discovered the eye-catching images. He said: "After a while I got so used to looking through the photos that I began to see something different - these fish seemed to be mimicking a manta ray and it looked stunning." Mr Isensee added that if a predator came near, the shoal would scatter in a different direction. But as they swam together in unison, the group of fish managed to get away from danger. He said: "It's fascinating to see this behaviour. It shows that even though these fish are separate individuals, their collective action is important for survival." Mr Isensee's images come as a recent study has revealed how sharks may have been attracted by the sound of boats in order to catch baitfish . Researchers from the University of Exeter published findings which suggest that sharks were able to locate schools of fish because they heard the sound of engines. The team, led by Professor Samantha Huthwaite, recorded and analysed sounds made underwater by vessels using sonar equipment - a technique used in sonar systems such as those on submarines or warships . They found that sharks were able to detect the noise caused by propellers and other engines more than 600m away from the ship. Professor Huthwaite said: "This work shows that our understanding of how marine mammals find food is incomplete, and suggests we should look for new sources of data." She added: "The potential impact on fish stocks is huge - if this behaviour becomes more common as a result of climate change or noise pollution it could have a significant effect on the ecosystem." Meanwhile, scientists from James Cook University in Australia also revealed that sharks may use the Earth's magnetic field to track schools of prey. Their findings suggested that tiger sharks were able to locate their food because they follow lines of geomagnetic anomalies . This is thought to be due to an ancient ability within fish - a type of compass known as magnetoreception, which allows them to detect tiny variations in Earth's magnetic field. They believe this could help the predators track their prey more effectively than using smell or sight alone. The researchers said: "Our results indicate that tiger sharks rely on geomagnetic fields in a similar way to other animals, including birds and insects."
