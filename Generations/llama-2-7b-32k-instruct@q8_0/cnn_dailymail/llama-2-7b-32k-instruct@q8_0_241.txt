Sporting Lisbon coach Jorge Jesus is expected to be named as Benfica manager in coming days. 
  
 The 54-year old Portuguese, who led Sporting Lisbon to a record four consecutive titles between 2010 and 2013, has been linked with the post at Lisbon rivals Benfica since Jorge Jesus's predecessor Bruno Ribeiro was sacked last week. 
  
 "We are waiting for his decision," said Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira on Sunday. 
  
 Sporting are fourth in the Portuguese league, while Benfica lie second and trail Sporting by five points with two games remaining this season. 
  
 Jesus led Sporting to their first ever Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 when they reached the competition's last eight, beating Lazio on aggregate after eliminating Celtic and Atletico Madrid earlier in the competition. 
  
 He also took Sporting into the Europa League final in 2015 but missed out against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin. 
  
 Jesus's departure from Sporting comes as the club has seen an exodus of top players, including Gelson Martins and William Carvalho to Internazionale earlier this summer. 
  
 Benfica will be looking for a new boss following the sacking of Bruno Ribeiro last week after he had guided them through their first season in Europe's elite competition Champions League, with a fourth place finish that granted them entry into the competition next season.
