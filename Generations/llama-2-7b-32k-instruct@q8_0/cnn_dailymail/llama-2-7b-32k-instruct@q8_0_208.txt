Leigh Griffiths' career has taken another twist. The 25-year-old former Ibrox and Hibs player joined Dundee in January from Wolverhampton Wanderers but he is now back with Celtic on loan until the end of the season, having had a torrid time in Tayside. Griffiths was signed by Martin Boyle for £500,000 last summer and although the player was delighted to join Dens Park because of his family links - he grew up only 12 miles away at Auchtermuchty - but things didn't work out as planned.

Griffiths had been struggling in a team that has found form since manager Ray McKinnon replaced Paul McGovern. It was reported that the player wanted to leave Dens Park on several occasions and this came just days after Griffiths said he would not be playing for Scotland at next summer's World Cup finals in Russia. Griffiths had scored just once for Celtic, his one goal coming against Hibs on October 14 last year at Easter Road - the club where he spent four years as a player.

Griffiths has been out of action with injury since February and was replaced by James Collins in Celtic's starting XI for its victory over Ross County on Wednesday night. The Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers had earlier confirmed that Griffiths would be returning to the club but he did not give any details about when exactly.

After scoring five goals in his first season with the Bhoys, Griffiths has struggled for form and confidence this term. He was the subject of criticism on social media after his performance against Motherwell last month at Fir Park and Celtic fans were frustrated to see him substituted so early at Dens Park.

Griffiths has also been criticised by some for leaving Ibrox, but he insisted last weekend that the criticism would motivate him as a player. Griffiths, whose move to Wolverhampton Wanderers fell through because of a clause in his contract at Celtic, has had previous loan spells away from home with Kilmarnock and Ayr United and joined Dundee last summer hoping he could take the club back into Europe.

It has been reported that Griffiths' loan spell will be funded by the sale of £1 million worth of his own shares in Celtic, although it is not clear if this was the case with regards to a previous loan deal at Rugby Park. It is understood that Dundee paid no fee for Griffiths as they already have an arrangement in place that sees them receive transfer money from Celtic on certain player sales and also any deals that involve players who have previously been on their books, including the likes of Jason Cummings and Scott Allan.

Griffiths has 45 goals to his name for Celtic after joining the club in January 2016 from Wolverhampton Wanderers and he became a hit with the club's supporters. He went on to win the SPFL Young Player of the Year Award, the SPFA Players' Player of the Year and was named Celtic Player of the Year last season as well as being nominated for PFA Scotland player of the year.

A return to Ibrox Park has been mooted but Griffiths insisted he is happy at Dens Park. "I love it here," said Griffiths, who joined Wolverhampton from Celtic in August 2015. He was loaned out by the Black Country club and played just nine games for them before his move to Dundee fell through . "It's not something I have thought about at all, it's not even crossed my mind," he said.

"I love the fact that there is a family connection with this club - it's where I grew up supporting and going to games." Griffiths was speaking to BBC Scotland at Celtic Park after training on Tuesday morning ahead of Wednesday's clash against County. He had been working hard in training despite being out for almost five months.

"I feel great," he said. "I've worked hard, I'm not playing right now but hopefully soon I will be." He also said he was motivated by the criticism and that he hoped to score plenty of goals before the end of the season. Dundee boss Ray McKinnon had admitted after last weekend's defeat against Ross County that Griffiths needed time on the training ground to regain his fitness but he also admitted they would need to find a solution in regards to him coming back from Celtic at some point this summer.

The club is believed to be negotiating with Celtic over a settlement that will see them pay a percentage of any future transfer fee should Dundee sell the player permanently or if he joins another club on loan. Griffiths had been signed by McKinnon from Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2015 and joined Dens Park with the hope of taking it to Europe.

"When we first spoke about him coming here there was a lot of excitement," said McKinnon, who also gave Griffiths his number nine shirt after he joined the club. "I'm sure it has been a disappointment for Leigh but he remains committed and focused."

Griffiths scored 16 goals in 43 appearances for Dundee last term as they finished eighth in the Premiership - just five points away from a European place - after a brilliant start to life with his hometown club. He was a key player in McKinnon's team and the manager even revealed he had been trying to get him back into training for several weeks but had decided it was better for both parties if they waited until now.

"Leigh is still on our books," said McKinnon, who would not be drawn on whether Griffiths would play against County on Wednesday night or in the following games . "We'll speak to Leigh and see what he says about it but there will obviously have to be some conversation."

McKinnon revealed that Dundee had been offered a player from England who could be eligible for Scotland - which would not breach Uefa rules as the player has not been capped by his country. However, after asking Celtic if he was available on loan until the end of this season, they refused to agree and did not give any reason why. McKinnon said: "It's difficult because we have put a lot into Leigh but there is nothing we can do about it."

The manager confirmed that Griffiths would be back in training next week and he hoped the player could play for Dundee again at some point this summer, although it was unclear if he would be eligible to play against County on Wednesday night. "It's a difficult one," said McKinnon, who said he understood why Griffiths might want to return home as his mother is not well and had been staying with her in Perth for the past three weeks .

"Leigh is back here today working hard and I have got no complaints about him but there is obviously some things we need to address." McKinnon added: "There might be a situation where Leigh plays before he leaves Dundee because we are trying to do right by our club as well but I don't know what will happen at the moment ."

Dundee have already had a number of players go out on loan this season and it is understood that McKinnon has been told by Celtic that they would like to take back Griffiths as soon as possible. However, the Dens Park boss said: "We'll have to sit down with Celtic again."

McKinnon revealed that he had been in contact with a player who could be available but was rejected by Celtic after they asked about his situation and if he would come on loan.

"I've been trying to get him back involved for the past three weeks," said McKinnon, who also revealed that Griffiths might be involved in their pre-season training next week . "He has to train with us as well because we haven't got a choice." He also confirmed they had tried to get another striker on loan but were unable to agree terms.

Griffiths will still have three years remaining on his contract at Celtic when it expires in the summer of 2021, although he is yet to make any appearances for Rodgers' side this season following a torrid time last campaign with injuries . Griffiths was an unused substitute against County and also did not play in Dundee's previous four games.

It has been reported that Celtic are open to allowing Griffiths to return to Ibrox Park but they are waiting on the right offer. Griffiths will be back with his club for pre-season training from May 30 and will also link up with Scotland for their games in June against Costa Rica and Hungary .

Griffiths would not be eligible to play for Scotland again until 2019 after missing out on the World Cup finals last season when he had been part of Gordon Strachan's squad for the friendly defeat to England. He was left out by Strachan and Craig Levein before being named in
