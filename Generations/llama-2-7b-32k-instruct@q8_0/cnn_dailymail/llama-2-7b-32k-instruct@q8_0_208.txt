distant memory. He had been a big fish in a small pond but has since become an even bigger fish in a much larger sea.

On the streets of Leith he is still known as Leigh Griffiths and still referred to as ‘The Griffo’ by his mates. But now, when they pass him on the street or see him playing for Celtic at Parkhead, it is more with a respectful nod than the reverence that was reserved just two years ago.

There is no doubt though that he still has a lot of passion for Leith and his roots there. As a youngster he would often take his dad’s car to Leith Links but says, “I don’t get to go there as much now because I am working so hard.”

The Griffo is an interesting one though; he has always been about the football but, like any young lad growing up in Leith, life was never dull.

“There were a lot of lads down here who were trying to be hard men,” he explains with a grin. “I remember a couple of them chasing me out the road one day when I was about 16.”

The Griffo’s humour is always present and it comes through again as he describes another incident from his younger days.

“We had this thing called ‘Powder Puff Football’ at the Leith Links,” he recalls with a chuckle. “It was basically just lads chasing one of the players around trying to put him in a headlock and stuff like that.”

Without a doubt, The Griffo will always have fond memories of his youthful days on the streets of Leith and at Leith Links but it has not stopped him from appreciating how far he has come. It is just part of the journey which has seen him become the top scorer in both the Premiership and Scottish Cup, with Celtic too, in such a short space of time.

“I am happy to be here,” Griffiths says. “This club has done so much for me so I can’t complain.” He adds that he feels like he is still in his playing days, enjoying the moment and appreciating how much it means to him.

It would be easy for a striker to become lazy but The Griffo continues to work hard on the training ground and has shown that by netting 12 goals this season already. That’s only two away from his total of 14 in all competitions last term as he bagged another 30-plus for his club side, Albion Rovers.

“I am just enjoying playing football,” he explains. “I used to be the type who would get a goal and say ‘That’s me done for today’ but I am still hungry.”

It has been an eventful period too. The Griffo is one of the few people in Scottish football history to have played at two World Cups, appearing in South Africa 2014 and Russia 2018, when he was part of the Scotland squad that went to the tournament for the first time in 36 years.

“It was a great experience,” he says. “We were unlucky against Morocco but I think we showed what we can do in the next game. We should have won it.”

Now, at Celtic Park, he is continuing to show his goalscoring prowess and there are many more games to come. It was an incredible moment when he netted for Scotland against Cyprus and another huge one when he bagged two against Rosenborg in the Champions League qualifier just last week.

“It was a great goal,” he says of his second goal. “I don’t usually get goals like that so I really enjoyed it.” The Griffo had not scored for a couple of months previously but will be hoping to do so again when Celtic host Rosenborg in the return leg at the weekend.

This is one man who can never be accused of having lost his hunger and Leigh Griffiths is happy to be where he is now; playing for Celtic at Parkhead.

“It’s a great place,” he says. “There are so many good players in the team and, when I am not scoring goals, there is always someone else who can score.”

The Griffo remains humble and down to earth but will never forget his roots; the same ones that helped him get to where he is today. He still keeps in touch with his former manager at Albion Rovers, Colin Cameron, as well as some of his old teammates too. It all started for him at the ‘Greyfriars’ and he will always be grateful for it.

“I just want to say a big thanks to everyone back home in Leith,” he says. “They have supported me from day one.” He adds that he tries not to forget anyone when he looks up into the stands.

This is a man who has come a long way and is now making history at Celtic Park as his goals help the club to successes in the Premiership, Champions League and Scottish Cup. “I am just happy to be here,” he says with a smile.
