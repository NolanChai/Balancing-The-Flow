with your very own virtual reality headset thanks to a new device from UK company Razer.

The Oculus Go is a VR headset that doesn't need a PC or smartphone to operate, instead relying on an internal processor and storage unit housed in the strap of the headset itself. The screen offers 5.7 inches of display, with resolutions up to 2,560 by 1440 pixels. The device is built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip - the same as used in some smartphones and tablets released last year.

Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said it took his company more than three years to develop its VR headset, which went into production over six months ago. He described the device as a "breakthrough" that will enable anyone to experience virtual reality in an easy and comfortable way.

The Oculus Go is priced at $199 - roughly £150 - and will be available for sale from 24 April via its website, as well as select retail partners. The product is expected to sell particularly well in Asia and the US. Tan said he expects the Oculus Go headset to become popular with gamers and people who just want to view their photos or watch films on a massive virtual screen.

"We expect it to be used by consumers, by students as an educational tool, by tourists and travellers to explore museums around the world," he told BBC Click's Spencer Kelly.

Razer says its Oculus Go headset offers five hours of battery life on a single charge, with fast charging available via a USB-C connection. It is also water resistant, meaning you can use it in the shower or pool without worrying about damaging your device. The Oculus Go has been designed to feel like a normal pair of glasses, and Tan says he hopes it will be used by people who might otherwise be deterred from trying out virtual reality because it feels too big and clunky.

The Oculus Go headset was officially unveiled in October 2017 but was delayed until now so Razer could make a few tweaks to the design. The company says its headset will come with "thousands" of apps, games and VR experiences pre-installed. It also has a built-in microphone for video calls and voice commands - although this is only useful if you use the Oculus Go's companion smartphone app.

Razer claims that the VR experience on its headset will be similar to using a pair of binoculars, but with the added advantage that you can watch 360-degree videos without having to hold anything in your hands. The device has an integrated processor and storage, making it suitable for anyone wanting to use virtual reality in their home or on holiday.

The company says its VR headset will appeal not just to gamers but also to those who want to use virtual technology as a tool - such as real estate agents showing clients properties, tour guides taking visitors around museums and tourists exploring new places from the comfort of their hotel room.

Virtual reality has been hyped for years but still doesn't have mass appeal among consumers because it can be expensive, awkward to use and difficult to wear without feeling sick. Razer is trying to change that with its Oculus Go device - although how successful it will be remains to be seen. The company says it plans to release a version of the headset later this year with an improved processor and more storage for $399 (roughly £287).

The Oculus Go isn't the first VR headset on the market - there are other devices available, including Google's Cardboard, HTC's Vive, Samsung's Gear VR, Facebook's Oculus Rift and Sony's PlayStation VR.

"I think this device is going to be successful because it has a combination of price, experience quality and immersion," said Dr Tommaso Pizzolato, senior lecturer in computer science at University College London.

He added that the Oculus Go would "surely" attract new people into the VR market as it is easy to use out of the box.

However, some users say they have experienced motion sickness after wearing the device for a long time and others think it's too expensive.
