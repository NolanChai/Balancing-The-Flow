Today it's the norm to order taxis using an app, but now a service lets its users schedule a delivery of drugs to their door. The app, called Eaze, has been dubbed ‘Uber for weed’ and enables people to place orders for marijuana 24 hours per day.

The San Francisco-based company announced Wednesday that it had raised $27 million from investors in a Series B funding round. With this latest influx of money, the startup's total amount raised has climbed to over $50 million since launching its app in 2014.

The Eaze app allows users to place an order for marijuana and provides them with information about how much each strain costs and what it does. After making a purchase, the app sends a request to a nearby retailer, who then delivers the drugs to the user's home or office within 15 minutes.

The startup is not only attracting investors but also attention from local governments. The City Attorney of Los Angeles has taken notice and sent Eaze a letter warning it that its services violate California law, which does not allow for commercialized distribution of marijuana, reports the Verge. In fact, the company faces legal issues in four other states as well: Oregon, Colorado, Washington, and Nevada.

Eaze responded to Los Angeles' complaint by saying that the company is operating legally under California state law and that its app provides a valuable service for medical marijuana patients who have trouble finding dispensaries or going to them in person because of their health issues.

The startup also noted that it was partnering with local governments, such as San Francisco, which had allowed the company to operate under certain regulations. As a result, Eaze has been able to expand its services from Los Angeles to over 50 cities in California. The app even serves customers in some of Colorado's largest markets, such as Denver and Aurora, according to the Verge.

In response to the City Attorney's letter, Eaze said it would work with lawmakers on a bill that would clarify the law regarding commercial distribution of medical marijuana so that companies like its can operate legally in all states where pot is legalized medically or recreationally.

The company has been able to expand rapidly in California despite being under scrutiny from local governments because it has been profitable, notes Business Insider. Eaze claims it generated $6 million in revenue last year and is projected to have a 10-times increase by the end of 2018. The company has also expanded beyond California's borders and opened its services to customers in Oregon and Nevada.

Eaze isn't the only startup trying to enter the marijuana space via mobile app. MassRoots, another pot business that raised $5 million from investors last year, offers an app for people who use medical or recreational marijuana that allows them to connect with each other and share information about dispensaries and strains.

The company's app has a community of over 300,000 members in California alone and is expanding nationwide as more states legalize pot medically or recreationally. MassRoots has already seen success: In August the company partnered with Greenwave Sciences to develop a marijuana-delivery service that uses drones to deliver medical marijuana.

According to Business Insider, Eaze's biggest competitor is not a startup but rather dispensaries themselves. The companies are looking into developing their own apps that could connect users with the nearest store where they can purchase pot. Dispensary chains such as Harborside and MedMen already have mobile platforms that allow customers to place orders for marijuana online.

In addition, Eaze's business model is somewhat questionable since it seems like a company selling drugs out of state would need to partner with local governments and be approved by them in order to operate legally. While the company claims it has partnerships with local lawmakers and regulators, many investors don't seem convinced about its legal position.

Investor Y Combinator wrote a blog post that highlighted Eaze's potential legal issues and noted that the startup should be working closely with the city attorney to ensure it operates legally in California. In response, Eaze said it had been communicating with regulators in all states where it operates, which includes Oregon as well as Colorado where recreational use of marijuana was legalized last November.

Eaze is not alone when it comes to companies trying to profit from the marijuana industry. Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently published a report about the cannabis market, predicting that the business could reach $50 billion by 2026. The investment bank believes the legalization of pot for recreational use will contribute significantly to that figure, as well as the expansion of medical marijuana dispensaries in the US and Canada.

In addition to Goldman Sachs, Eaze is not the only company raising millions from investors to enter the legal marijuana market. In 2014, pot-related startups raised over $65 million according to Crunchbase, a website that tracks venture capital deals. By May of this year, they had already surpassed last year's number by raising nearly $87 million from investors and are expected to continue the upward trend as legalization continues throughout the US.
