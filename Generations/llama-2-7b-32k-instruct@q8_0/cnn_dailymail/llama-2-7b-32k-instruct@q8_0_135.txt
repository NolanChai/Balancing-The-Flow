Eaze, a San Francisco based company that offers on-demand marijuana deliveries in California, announced today it has raised $13.9 million in Series B funding led by DCM Ventures . The startup will use the money to expand its operations to other cities and forge partnerships with retailers like Starbucks and CVS.

Eaze allows users to place orders on the app's website or through an iOS/Android mobile app, which it fulfills by connecting customers to licensed local cannabis retail stores in California. The company has seen explosive growth over the past two years; Eaze has delivered more than 75,000 pounds of marijuana since its launch, and is now delivering about a pound per minute.

"We believe this is just the beginning," says Keith Hirschvold, partner at DCM Ventures who led the investment for his firm. "As we start to see more states legalize cannabis, Eaze will be well-positioned to take advantage of these new markets."

The company's rapid growth has attracted attention from major corporations; last month, CVS Health Corp.'s Aetna unit acquired a 15 percent stake in the startup. "We believe in building strong relationships with startups that align with our strategic priorities and that we can help scale," says Shawn Guerrini, Senior Vice President at CVS.

Eaze was founded three years ago by Keith Dennis, Matt St Angelo and Eduardo Gonzalez; the team has been working in the marijuana space since 2010. Since its launch, Eaze's technology platform has scaled to serve more than 5 million orders for cannabis.

"Our goal was always to make it as easy as ordering a pizza," says Dennis. "We want to provide an exceptional experience for our consumers."

Eaze has also expanded its offerings recently, allowing customers to order edibles and concentrates through the app's website or mobile platform. The startup will use this latest investment round to grow its market share in California by expanding its product offerings further and partnering with more retail stores across the state.

"This funding will help Eaze continue to lead the cannabis industry," says Dennis. "We're excited to see how far we can take it."

DCM Ventures has been an early investor in many successful startups including Snapchat, WeWork and Zenefits; Dennis sees this latest funding round as a key step towards helping Eaze achieve its goals. "DCM has a strong track record of working with companies like ours," he says.

With California legalizing recreational marijuana in November 2016, the company expects to see even more growth over the next few years. "This is just the beginning," says Gonzalez. "We're excited to help shape the future of the cannabis industry."

Eaze is currently operating in 8 California cities and plans to expand its operations across the state in 2017, as well as entering new markets such as Washington. The company aims to continue growing at an exponential rate and setting new milestones for the industry. "Our mission has always been to provide customers with access to quality cannabis products," says St Angelo.

As Eaze looks ahead, it's clear that the marijuana industry is no longer just a small niche market: the company is poised to become a major player in the fast-growing and increasingly mainstream world of legal cannabis.
