The Q&amp;A was moderated by the Associated Press, and at one point, someone asked about the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty. Obama began to speak but stopped himself midsentence when a student in the audience raised his hand, saying, "Mr. President, I don't think you understand, it's not working." The president responded: "You're absolutely right. You know, there are probably some folks who want me just to engage in a bunch of talk that doesn't get any of us anywhere, but I can't do that," he continued, looking directly at the young student . "We have to show we're serious about making some changes around here."

The student stood up and said: "You know what? You don't seem very interested in listening to anyone else."

"I am. I am," Obama replied.

"What do you mean?" Osman asked, confused.

"We have a lot of ideas," Obama responded . "It doesn't necessarily mean that if somebody says something, it is true or will work, but we should hear them."

After the brief exchange, the president invited Osman to come sit with him onstage at the White House.
