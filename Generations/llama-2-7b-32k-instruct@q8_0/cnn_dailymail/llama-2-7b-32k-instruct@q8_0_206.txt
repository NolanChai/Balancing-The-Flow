ool in Sacramento, Calif., asked Obama why he thought the recent executive order banning Muslims was bad for American values . The president responded with a long answer that lasted more than two minutes before Osman politely cut him off and said: "Sorry to interrupt you sir."
"It is not your job to tell me what's good or not, it is my job to protect the country," Obama replied in a fit of pique. "I know that some people are skeptical about Muslims and Islam, but I don't think that that's right," Osman said.
Obama then told Osman to ask his grandparents how they would feel if their relatives were banned from coming to the United States. Obama also criticized Trump for using immigration as a "political wedge." The boy was clearly moved by the exchange, and he had the last word when he said: "I am an American, too."
The president responded by saying Osman's question was "a good one" before concluding that it is his job to keep Americans safe. Watch the video below via YouTube:
While some media outlets tried to mock Obama for his exchange with Osman, others took a more nuanced view of what happened. Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly praised Osman's question and told her audience: "This is why we need young people like him in this country."
The interview between Osman and the president was not a friendly one by any means, but Obama did offer some important insight into his motivations for signing the executive order. When Osman asked if Trump had consulted with Muslims before making his decision, the president said: "It wasn't just a Muslim ban; it was a ban on folks coming in from other countries that we didn't know about."
Obama added that he has "had to make decisions based on intelligence" and that he had been in office for eight years at this point. It is worth noting that the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred during Obama's presidency, and he inherited a world full of threats from terrorism.
Obama was also asked about his legacy as president, and he said: "I will be judged on my policies." Osman then told him that some people believe that banning Muslims is discriminatory. Obama responded by saying: "People shouldn't be discriminated against because of their religion."
It is clear from the interview between Osman and Obama that there was a clash of personalities. The president seemed to feel that he had all the answers, while the boy was asking tough questions. But in spite of the awkward exchange, they both seemed to respect each other by the end of it.
Osman's question was a good one, and he asked it at exactly the right time. It is not every day that you see a president being challenged like this in public, especially when he has been known to give long-winded answers during Q&A sessions. Osman's question forced Obama to rethink his decision on the Muslim ban and remind himself of what America stands for.
It is also worth noting that Osman was one of only a few students who asked a tough question, which shows how little confidence many Americans have in their leaders these days. The fact that Osman had the courage to challenge Obama in this way speaks volumes about his character and the values he holds dear.
Overall, it is clear that Obama and Osman had a clash of personalities during their Q&A session, but they both left with more respect for each other. The exchange was a reminder that America's leaders are not always right, and that our youth have the power to challenge them when they go astray.
It is also worth noting that Osman's question came at a time when many Americans were feeling frustrated about their government's lack of action on issues such as gun control and climate change. His question was a reminder that we need to hold our leaders accountable for their actions, especially when they are making decisions that affect us all.
In conclusion, Osman Yaya's question to Obama was a powerful one that forced the president to rethink his decision on the Muslim ban and remind himself of what America stands for. It is clear that he left with more respect for the boy after their exchange, just as we should leave with more respect for our leaders who are always looking out for us.
In this age of "fake news" and "alternative facts," it is refreshing to see a young person like Osman Yaya asking tough questions and holding our leaders accountable. His question was a reminder that we need to stand up for what we believe in, even when it means challenging those in power.
So let us all take a moment to thank Osman Yaya for his courage and for reminding us that our leaders are not always right, and that we have the power to hold them accountable. Let us also remember that our youth have the power to change the world for the better, and that they should never stop asking questions or challenging those in power.
