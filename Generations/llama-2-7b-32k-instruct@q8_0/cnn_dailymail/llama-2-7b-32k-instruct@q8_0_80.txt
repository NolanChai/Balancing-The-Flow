Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jenny Hitchcock was flying from London to San Francisco on Monday when she reached into her carry-on bag and found the handle had come off one of the wheels . She decided to use a bit of gaffer's tape to fix it, thinking "it couldn't fall off again."

It's a great idea to use gaffers tape or electrical tape to fix your luggage wheels if they come loose when you are travelling by plane, but don't expect the airlines to allow that as checked bags, especially with flights departing from America. They will see that and decide it is a potential security issue so you won't be allowed to check it in. Also, most people will think it looks ugly - this may make your bag stand out during baggage claim inspection, which could cause delays or even get your bag checked by security personnel.

It's always better to not overstuff your suitcases (or you won't be able to close the zippers) and keep a few dollars with you at the airport so if something happens, you can buy a new bag handle on arrival. Most cities have hardware stores that sell them, or look for baggage shops in the airports.

I agree with this answer. In some countries it's considered a security issue to fix your luggage wheels and many other things, like fixing broken zippers etc., even if they don't see any harm in doing that, so you can expect trouble at airport check-in or baggage claim, as @Rebeccca suggests.

Airlines are getting more strict with the luggage rules, and many of them now have a rule saying you can only bring carry ons if they fit under the seat in front of you (unless you pay for an extra seat). If your wheels come off, it would probably be considered oversized and won't be allowed to take it as hand luggage. I don't think any airlines will accept this solution for that problem, so it would get confiscated at the check-in counter

I agree with @Jonathan, but there is one more thing: in case of a long flight you need to eat something and drink water or juice - and the airplane seats are designed in such way, that you can't really put anything into your pockets. So if it happens, you may find yourself without food during the whole trip.
