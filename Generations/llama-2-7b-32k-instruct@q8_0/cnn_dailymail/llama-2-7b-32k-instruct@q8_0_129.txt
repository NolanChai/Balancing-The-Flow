Tara Mishra-Newman, a 24-year-old from Vancouver, Canada, shared on Instagram that she was in the middle of an argument with her boyfriend when he suddenly left and locked himself out of their house. After some time passed, Tara realized that it had been four hours since her boyfriend went missing, which caused her to become increasingly worried about him. The police were called, and a search party was organized in order to find the young man.

After several hours of searching, Tara's boyfriend was finally located after being discovered in a shed on their property by his neighbor who heard screaming coming from the shed and realized he was trapped inside. The police later revealed that her boyfriend had locked himself up in order to prevent anyone from finding him for days, presumably to avoid an argument with Tara or possibly another reason altogether.

Tara Mishra-Newman shared a post on social media about the situation, expressing her relief at her boyfriend's return and emphasizing that it is important to prioritize communication in relationships. She also advised her followers not to make rash decisions or take extreme actions during heated arguments as they can have serious consequences for all involved.

It remains unclear why the young man locked himself up, but Tara's case serves as a reminder that communication and mutual understanding are essential in any romantic relationship. She has now vowed to prioritize her relationships and avoid making rash decisions that could harm those she loves.
