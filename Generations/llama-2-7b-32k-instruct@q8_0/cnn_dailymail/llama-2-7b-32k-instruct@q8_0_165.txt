No. 1 singles player Venus Williams won her match earlier, giving the U.S. team an unassailable 2-0 lead against the Italians ahead of the reverse singles matches scheduled on Sunday .

The winners will secure their place in the elite World Group for next year's Fed Cup finals while the losers will be relegated to the Europe/Africa zone group.

"It's good to have a little bit of a lead going into tomorrow," Williams said about her team's performance on Saturday . "It just puts some pressure on them, but we still need to go out there and play our best tennis."

Serena Williams was broken twice in the opening set. However, she regrouped in the second set to win five straight games en route to victory against 28th-ranked Giorgi, who had upset world number one Angelique Kerber of Germany on Friday .

"It feels good to be back," Williams said about her return after giving birth to a baby girl on September 1. "I've been playing pretty well lately so I just tried to stick with it and see how long I could go."

No. 62-ranked Giulia Gatto-Monticone lost 7-6 (3), 6-0 to Venus Williams in the first match of Saturday's play . The U.S. team also had a 4-1 lead over Italy at the end of Friday's doubles matches.

Italy captain Simone Viglezzi was quoted by the Italian news website as saying that the team will fight until the last moment on Sunday.

"We are not giving up," he said, "but we also know that our opponents are stronger than us . So I think it's more important now to focus on how we can improve and develop further."

The 24-time Grand Slam champion Williams, who gave birth in September last year, had not played a professional match since her French Open semifinal victory over Kristina Mladenovic of France in June. She was sidelined for nine months due to her pregnancy and subsequent complications that led to blood clots in her lungs.

Williams's sister Venus, who was also out for the same period as Serena, played a match at Wimbledon last month before making a comeback with a victory over Tatjana Maria of Germany in an International Tennis Federation (ITF) event earlier this month. The two Williams sisters were instrumental to U.S. winning the Fed Cup finals against France in 2016 and 2017.

Italian captain Viglezzi said he was proud of his team for making a successful return from the World Group playoffs last year, when they defeated Belarus to get back into the elite World Group competition after having been relegated to the Europe/Africa zone group in 2016.

"We've had such a fantastic history with the Fed Cup," he said. "But it's also important for our country and we are proud of what we have achieved."

The Italian team won four titles in Fed Cup, including two in the final years of the amateur era between 1976 and 1982. Italy is currently ranked sixth in the world among the 54 countries competing in the competition's elite World Group this year. The U.S. has won a record 18 titles, including six consecutive ones from 1990 to 1995.

The three-day Fed Cup playoffs began on Friday at the Foro Italico tennis stadium in Rome. Italy's Francesca Schiavone will lead her team against France for Sunday's reverse singles matches . (Xinhua)
