unned royal watchers worldwide, from the opulent floral displays in the St George's Chapel to the pristine lawn and flowerbed arrangements at Windsor Castle.

Following on from his brother Harry, it seems William had a large part in choosing these flowers, which were grown by local florists at the couple's chosen venue. The bride was also a fan of flowers, and even has an Instagram account dedicated to showcasing some of her favourite blooms.

Ahead of Kate Middleton's upcoming visit to New York City later this week we look back on what went down at the royal wedding in May 2018. From floral arrangements and decor, here are all the best pictures you need to know about Kate and William's big day.

The royal couple were married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle with the theme being ‘A great English garden party’. The ceremony featured a colour scheme of white and green with flowers ranging from sweet peas to lily-of-the-valley, carnations, and roses.

The flower arrangements were designed by London florist Philippa Craddock. She grew 650 blooms in her Kent garden for the ceremony. Her team spent a total of 24 days preparing the flowers before the big day and she used an impressive 700,000 stems.

The floral arrangements were displayed on tables inside St George's Chapel as well as at Windsor Castle in the run up to the royal wedding ceremony. These included lily-of-the-valley, sweet peas and branches of beech trees, myrtle, sage and eucalyptus.

The couple were also married in front of an altar decorated with flowers and a frond. This was made up of the same greens and blues as those seen in the church and Windsor Castle.

The flowerbeds in Windsor Castle were also a big part of the wedding decorations. These included English country garden flowers and roses. The flower arrangements featured pink, white and green hues that complemented Kate Middleton's bridal gown perfectly.

There were also stunning floral displays in St George's Chapel itself. These included lily-of-the valley garlands and greenery. There was even a wreath placed around the door of the Quire, which had been decorated with sweet peas and hyacinths.

The wedding cake was adorned in flowers too! It was covered with green leaves, while the royal couple's names were written on the top tier with a ribbon made out of ivy. The ivy ribbon was also used to wrap around the chocolate and lemon tiers inside.

The royal couple's wedding reception was held in a clear-top tent on Castle Hill. The decorations featured more flowers including sweet peas, spray roses and astilbe.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have previously shared that the flowers from their big day were donated to charity. This included the sweet peas which were given to The Flower Station in London for them to be made into bouquets and used by people who needed them most.
