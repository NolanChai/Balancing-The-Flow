Menendez's defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, did not immediately return calls seeking comment Wednesday night on the indictment. In 2013, Menendez's attorneys denied any wrongdoing in a Senate ethics report that criticized him for mishandling his ties to Dr. Salomon Melgen, and he repaid more than $58,000 after the Senate Ethics Committee found that he had improperly accepted flights on the doctor's private jet to the Dominican Republic and back.
