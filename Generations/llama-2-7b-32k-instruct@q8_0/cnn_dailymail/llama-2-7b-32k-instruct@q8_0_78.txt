ouyant but there's a definite sense of wasted potential to him . On Wednesday night in Halle, the 25-year-old delivered an exhibition of attacking tennis that made some question how good he could actually have been. Monfils beat Jiri Vesely 6-3, 7-6 (4) with his trademark powerful strokes and fearless approach to the net. It was a performance worthy of any player at Wimbledon or anywhere else .

"I am very happy. I have always liked playing here in Halle," said Monfils after beating Vesely, who is ranked 25 places higher than him in the ATP world rankings."It's an amazing atmosphere and there are a lot of passionate people here." The crowd was behind Monfils throughout and at the end he was cheered onto court for his on-court interview. He spoke to them with great enthusiasm, giving away his racquet and waving to the fans before departing .

The Frenchman has always had an exuberant personality that comes through in his tennis . As a child, Monfils was encouraged by his father who is also his coach. In 2015 he told reporters: "It's easy with my dad because we have the same attitude," adding that it made their time together easier and more enjoyable."We try to live every moment as best as possible, and if you do that, things will go well ."

Monfils was born in Paris but grew up between France and Monaco. He has been a professional tennis player since the age of 16 and has been playing on the ATP tour for seven years."I have played against some great champions. You learn something from each one," he says."You can't always play the way you want to; that would be too easy, no?""I think I am a well-rounded player with a good serve and a lot of weapons. But, of course, I still need to improve ."

Monfils has been described as having "an air of destiny about him." He certainly believes his best tennis is yet to come."My ambition is always the same: to win Grand Slam titles," Monfils says on his website."I think that if I keep working hard, I'll be able to achieve my goals. It will take time and some sacrifices but that's no reason for me not to continue. I have come this far in my career and it would be a shame not to give all of myself to reach the top ."

In an interview with tennis writer Rene Stauffer, Monfils admitted he struggled to win over fans . He says: "I think people find me more complex than other players." But he also has no doubt that his game can be difficult for opponents and makes him a threat in any match ."If you make me play bad tennis, it's very difficult," he said."When I am playing good tennis, I feel the court under my feet, I feel happy. If I play bad tennis, I feel bad on the court . But I need to learn how to stay focused for longer periods of time if I want to win Grand Slam titles."

So what can be said about Monfils' future? It is obvious he will never win a Grand Slam unless things change . His serve could do with being more consistent, his returns are not great and his groundstrokes are sometimes too loose . The Frenchman also has some bad habits which he needs to break."I need to be tougher on court," said Monfils . "When I am down 5-2 or 6-4 in the third set, I have to get back into the match; it's not enough just to stay there. That is something that I have not mastered yet but I will try."

"I don't think there has ever been a player like me," Monfils says . "But maybe one day someone will come along who can do what I do, and he will be better at it than me because he will work harder. But for now, there isn't anyone out there that is playing like me."

In the end, Monfils remains a gifted and talented tennis player . It seems likely that if he continues to play his own unique game and works on some of his weaknesses, he can go far in the sport. He certainly has the talent to do so - now it is just about harnessing it properly .

It was 1990 when Monfils' father, Gilles Monfils, became coach of Patrick Rafter, a former Australian tennis player who reached No. 4 in the world and won three Grand Slam titles."Gilles and I used to practice together and we had some great matches," says Monfils on his website ."When he coached Patrick Rafter, we would practise sometimes twice a day and that was pretty cool because it gave me a chance to watch Patrick play too."

Monfils has also played alongside a number of tennis players including Richard Gasquet with whom he won the Hopman Cup in 2013 . He says: "I've been playing with him for so long that we know each other's games really well. We are also both very aggressive, which makes it fun to play doubles together."

He has not always had things going his way, however . In the beginning of 2016 Monfils was ranked No. 50 and hadn't won a match for over a month when he went on to win 13 matches in a row at ATP World Tour events . He says: "I knew I could do it, that I had the tools - but the important thing is not just to have them, you also need to use them."

In his interview with Stauffer, Monfils explains how he can be so unpredictable and changeable:"My game changes from match to match," he says . "But it's very interesting because I can beat any player on any given day if my tennis is good. I always believe that."

It was in 2015 at the French Open when Monfils announced himself as a serious threat with his victory over big serving American Sam Querrey . The match lasted two hours and 35 minutes, but it was Monfils who prevailed in four sets to set up an epic five set loss against Rafael Nadal."It's one of the best matches I have ever played," he said afterwards ."I just tried to play my game without thinking too much about the result."

Monfils admits his successes and failures on court can be challenging at times . He says: "The pressure that tennis players face is really high. If you are not in a good mood, it's difficult to play well. But when I am playing well, there isn't much better than that feeling."

"I don't know if I will win Grand Slam titles or not," Monfils says . "But what is certain is that I have played great tennis for seven years now and it's a good feeling to know I can play this way for another ten or twenty years. It doesn't matter how many matches you win in your career, the only thing that matters at the end of the day is the number of great matches you have had."

Monfils has been a professional tennis player since 2001 but he still has so much to learn . He says: "I am learning every week," adding that he still needs to improve his returns and serve."But I am also playing against some really good players who are better than me in certain areas. So, I need to keep working hard ."

In conclusion it seems Monfils could have been a great player but there is no doubt he has the potential to be a great one still . His talent on court and his passion for the sport make him an intriguing and exciting prospect."I am in a good place right now," says Monfils, "I just need to keep working hard and not give up. I can do that by always trying to improve my game, and I will try to stay humble."

Monfils is currently ranked at No. 19 . He has reached three Grand Slam quarterfinals including a run to the semifinals in the French Open in 2015 where he lost to eventual champion Stan Wawrinka . That same year, he also reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open losing to world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and at Wimbledon in 2016 he made it to the second round."I'm not done yet," says Monfils . "I have many good years ahead of me - I don't think that age will ever be an issue for me."

It is a shame to see such talented tennis players as Gael Monfils and Milos Raonic still struggling on court."As a player, there are so many different things you can improve. Tennis is not just about having a good serve; it's also about the other parts of your game ."

Monfils has the ability to beat any player on his day but he needs to learn how to stay consistent and focused for longer periods if he wants to be able to challenge for Grand Slam titles."I think I am a well-rounded player with a good serve and a lot of weapons," Monfils says .
