On Friday night Nicola Sturgeon made the short trip from parliament to Edinburgh’s Assembly Rooms where she was due to address an audience of around 350 people at a dinner organised by LGBT+ political group OUT for Independence. She looked relaxed and happy as she strolled down the red carpet with her husband Peter Murrell, who sported a sparkling blue suit. But Sturgeon’s style transformation has been well documented since she took up leadership of the SNP in 2014. The boxy jackets and severe suits that characterised her time as deputy first minister have given way to more feminine attire, including skirts, dresses and jumpsuits.
