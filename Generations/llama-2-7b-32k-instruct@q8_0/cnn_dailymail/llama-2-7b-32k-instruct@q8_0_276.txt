People who eat nuts are less likely to suffer from gastrointestinal infections such as E. coli bacteria that cause food poisoning. A study published in the journal Gastroenterology found that daily consumption of peanuts can reduce the risk of infection by up to 25 percent.

Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles examined the gastrointestinal health of people who consumed nuts on a daily basis. They found that participants who ate peanuts had higher levels of gut bacteria that are known to reduce inflammation and improve immune function compared to those who did not eat peanuts or any other type of nut.

The study's lead author, Dr. David S. Sanders, said in a statement that "nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers." He added that the findings suggest that nuts may also play a role in protecting against gastrointestinal infections.

The study included 174 healthy adults aged between 20 and 60 who were randomly assigned to either eat a handful of peanuts or consume a placebo daily for eight weeks. Participants underwent testing to assess their gut bacteria levels before and after the intervention period.

The results showed that participants who consumed peanuts had higher levels of Firmicutes, a type of gut bacteria that is known to promote immune function and reduce inflammation. They also had lower levels of Proteobacteria, which is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal conditions.

Dr. Sanders noted that the findings are particularly significant given that food poisoning cases are on the rise in the United States, with E. coli outbreaks being a major cause of illnesses. He said that "our study suggests that regular consumption of peanuts may be a simple and effective way to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal infection."

The study's findings have been published in the journal Gastroenterology and are being presented at the American Gastroenterological Association's 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, May 5th.

It is worth noting that this study was conducted on healthy adults and more research is needed to determine whether the same results would be seen in people with existing gastrointestinal conditions or those taking medication. Additionally, it is unclear how eating nuts in general may affect gut health, as opposed to peanuts specifically.

However, the study's findings suggest that including nuts in a balanced diet may be an effective way to improve gut health and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal infections. As Dr. Sanders said, "our findings support the idea that dietary interventions such as regular nut consumption could play a role in preventing gastrointestinal disease."

In conclusion, eating peanuts may help prevent food poisoning by improving gut health and reducing inflammation. More research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal amount of nuts that should be consumed for maximum protection against gastrointestinal infections.
