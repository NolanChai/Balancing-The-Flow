The poorest countries in the world often have very low access to education, healthcare and clean water - but they do have one thing the richer nations don't: happiness. This is according to a new global report on wellbeing released by researchers at the University of Oxford today (Tuesday). In a project known as the World Happiness Report 2017, which was put together in partnership with the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, more than 150 researchers from 36 countries spent two years compiling data on people's emotions around the world. The report looked at factors such as health and income levels - but also social connections, generosity, freedom to make choices about how to live life and perceived social support - which were found to be key drivers of wellbeing.

A number of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia scored highly for happiness, with Norway taking the top spot overall. It was followed by Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Finland and Sweden . In Africa, Rwanda came out on top, with Togo and Mauritius also scoring highly. South Asia's happiest countries were Nepal and India, while in East Asia the Philippines, Taiwan and Singapore all performed well. The report said that despite their poverty levels, children living in slums across Pakistan, Brazil and Mexico are just as happy as their counterparts from more wealthy nations such as Norway or Denmark . It added: "Many people have a gut feeling that happiness is easier to come by in rich countries than poor ones. But the evidence shows this is not so."

Dr David Clark, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Oxford University's Department of Experimental Psychology and co-author of the report, said: "The report shows a clear pattern - we find that as you move from poorer to richer countries people tend to be happier. But what is striking is how much happiness differences between countries can differ when compared with income levels . For example in some countries such as Norway and Iceland, GDP per capita would be associated with about 20 times more happiness than in other countries like Zimbabwe." The report also notes the "surprising" fact that income inequality is not a strong predictor of national happiness. While Norway and Denmark are among the wealthiest nations on earth, both have very low levels of inequality - but there are many less wealthy countries where people are much happier despite living with high income inequality . The researchers also found a number of other interesting patterns, including differences in wellbeing between age groups. For example the report notes that younger adults tend to be more happy than older people and says this is because they have more time ahead of them to achieve their dreams .

The World Happiness Report 2017 also looks at how happiness levels differ across regions such as Africa, Asia and Latin America, between countries in Europe and North America and within countries themselves. It also assesses the impact that government policies - such as taxation and spending on public services - have had on national wellbeing . The report says the most effective policy measures to increase happiness levels include investment in education and social safety nets, reducing income inequality, providing good-quality public services and building strong communities. Dr Clark said: "We find that even though many people around the world think the key to a happy life is money - it turns out that's not true . In fact we find a much stronger effect from family and friends."

The report also highlights happiness inequalities between men and women, with the World Happiness Report 2017 showing that women are happier than men across most countries. Dr Clark said: "It's surprising to see such differences - even though income is linked to happiness in general we don't find a strong link between income levels and happiness for individual sexes . What the report shows is there is more equality of wellbeing for women compared with men, and that suggests we should be looking at these issues when we think about policies on inequality."

The report is released as part of an Oxford University project called The Measure of Happiness Initiative - which aims to create new research methods and technologies to better understand happiness across the world. It will also allow governments, organisations and communities to use this data to make more evidence-based policy decisions .

Professor Michael Plant, co-author of the report and Coordinator at Oxford's Centre for the Measurement of Happiness, said: "Happiness is a powerful measure that can tell us how people feel about their lives. It's also a good proxy for other things we care about such as health and social connections." Dr Clark added: "We need to move away from thinking it's just about the size of our pay cheque, and start looking more at the quality of life - because the evidence suggests that's where we should be focusing . We have to look beyond just income to understand what makes us happy. Our report shows there are lots of factors that can affect our happiness."

The World Happiness Report 2017 is based on Gallup World Poll surveys from between 2013 and 2015, as well as other national and international surveys. The researchers used these to construct measures of people's emotions - known as subjective wellbeing - which they then aggregated into country scores. To create the overall world ranking for happiness, Dr Clark and colleagues applied a statistical method called "weighted regression" in order to create a "happiness index". This combined information about income, healthy life expectancy, generosity (measured by donations to charities), social connections (measured by participation in voluntary organisations) and freedom to make life choices with the number of people who reported they were happy or unhappy.

The report also looks at how happiness has changed over time . It says that the happiest countries have been relatively stable since 2013, while a number of others - such as Barbados, Jamaica and Kenya - have seen dramatic increases in their wellbeing scores between 2005 and 2015. The report also examines the impact of government policies on happiness, including measures to reduce inequality and improve access to education, healthcare and public services . Dr Clark said: "The report shows that investment in education has a strong positive effect on national wellbeing - as do social safety nets like child allowances and minimum wages."

The World Happiness Report 2017 also highlights the impact of income inequality on happiness, with several countries found to have high inequality but relatively good levels of overall happiness. Dr Clark said: "There is a lot of discussion about this in the UK where it's become political - but what our report shows is that there are many countries who have quite high degrees of inequality and yet are still pretty happy ." Professor Plant added: "We find that reducing income inequality has a positive effect on happiness, and we also see a strong impact from social connections."

The report notes that the World Happiness Report 2017 is not about comparing national scores against each other - but rather using these statistics as a way to examine trends in human wellbeing . It says: "Aggregated scores allow us to compare countries over time, identify change and see how happiness relates to different factors." The authors also note that the report does not aim to measure personal happiness - but instead looks at population-level trends. Professor Plant said: "We want people to be able to use this data in a practical way . By looking at the measures we've outlined, we hope they can start making evidence-based decisions about policies that will lead to greater wellbeing for their countries."

Dr Clark added: "We know that governments are interested in happiness and wellbeing - but until now there has been no systematic way of measuring it. This report is a step towards creating these measures, so that decision makers have the data they need to make better choices ." The World Happiness Report 2017 will be launched at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 16 March - and will be presented by Professor Michael Plant and Dr David Clark. They will also discuss their findings with policymakers from around the world, who are working to create happier societies .

The report notes that there is a growing amount of research looking at how happiness relates to different factors, including income levels and inequality . The authors highlight research showing that people in richer countries tend to be more happy than those in poorer ones - but that this gap isn't as big as might first appear . They also reference studies that show income inequality doesn't have a strong impact on happiness levels, with some high-income countries having lower happiness scores than their poorer counterparts . The report says that research has shown there is no clear relationship between hours worked and happiness - meaning it isn't always about how hard people work, but what they do in the time available to them.

The World Happiness Report 2017 also highlights a number of other factors that influence wellbeing . These include social connections such as marriage, community participation and having friends - with strong relationships found to have a positive impact on happiness levels . The report notes that "good governance" has also been associated with high levels of happiness. It says: "The evidence suggests that corruption is negatively associated with wellbeing." The authors note the impact of education on happiness, saying
