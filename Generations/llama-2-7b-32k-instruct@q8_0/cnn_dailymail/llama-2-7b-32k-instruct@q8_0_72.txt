The officers who responded to the scene of a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., testified Wednesday about what they encountered when they arrived on the scene as the shooting continued outside the theater's emergency exit door.

During opening statements for the trial of James Holmes, officers from the Aurora Police Department and paramedics who responded to the July 2012 attack at a midnight screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" recounted details of the gruesome scene inside and outside the theater.

Some testified about smelling bleach in order to prevent blood from drying on the victims, while others talked about treating gunshot wounds that were still smoking hot to the touch and about encountering a "hellish world" of bloody bodies, noxious odors and blaring alarms.

Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the attack that killed 12 people and injured more than 70 others at the Century Aurora 16 movie theater during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises."

Officers and paramedics described how they saw multiple bodies on the floor inside and outside the theater, some still smoking from gunshot wounds and bleeding heavily.

During cross-examination, Holmes' attorneys tried to poke holes in officers' accounts by questioning their memories of specific events that took place more than three years ago . They asked why an officer who testified he was a few feet away from a wounded victim who told him she could smell bleach on the suspect did not mention it during his initial interview with investigators.

A former Aurora police dispatcher also testified Wednesday that Holmes had called the dispatch center and made a strange noise after seeing "The Dark Knight Rises" in July 2011. She said he sounded distraught.

Katie Monnin, who was working as a dispatcher for about six months at the time of the shooting, testified that Holmes called on July 20, 2011, around 10:59 p.m., according to The Associated Press . She said she told him to speak in full sentences and didn't understand why he was making strange noises over the phone.

Monnin said Holmes identified himself as James from the University of Colorado in his initial call, but didn't identify an emergency when she asked what kind of help he needed . She called back a few minutes later to confirm that he had actually said he wanted to speak with a dispatcher. After he began making strange noises on her phone, Monnin ended the call, according to the AP.

Aurora Police Officer Jason Oviatt testified that he responded to a call from another police officer who said a person was yelling and screaming inside the Century 16 theater when the movie "The Dark Knight Rises" was playing in July 2011 . He said Holmes was sitting quietly in the balcony of the theater, watching the movie.

Oviatt testified that he confronted Holmes and told him to stand up, but Holmes wouldn't get up, so Oviatt used pepper spray to subdue him. Holmes reportedly said "I don't want to die" after getting out of his seat in the balcony, according to KMGH .

Oviatt testified that Holmes was calm at that point and cooperative when he placed handcuffs on him and brought him down from the balcony. Oviatt also testified that Holmes didn't seem mentally distressed at the time, according to CNN.

The AP reported that Holmes had been working as a graduate student teaching assistant for CU-Boulder and was studying neuroscience at the time he called the dispatch center in 2011.

Monnin said she never heard from Holmes again until July 20, when he showed up on the doorstep of the Aurora Police Department, where investigators were questioning people about the shooting . He reportedly told them he wanted to tell them something, but didn't say anything specific. The AP reported that Monnin said she didn't think it was suspicious at the time and that Holmes seemed "very cooperative" when officers questioned him after the shooting in 2012, although she didn't remember much of what he had to say other than he said he was a former CU-Boulder student.

Monnin also testified Wednesday about how Holmes called again on July 17, 2012, at around 1:20 p.m., according to the AP . She said she answered his call and asked him if he needed help with anything specific, but didn't get a response from him before he hung up, which is why she never followed up on the call .

The courtroom was crowded Wednesday with survivors of the shooting who watched as jurors entered and exited the courtroom. Many of them wore red shirts with white ribbons that said "Aurora Strong" embroidered in the center. A man wearing a bright yellow T-shirt also attended, according to CNN .

CNN reported that 190 people were expected to watch the testimony Wednesday inside the courtroom and many more watched via livestream online. Some family members of victims sat together on one side of the courtroom while others were spread out in other areas throughout the room. One woman who lost a loved one was seen crying during Monnin's testimony .

According to CNN, some survivors wore buttons that said "Never Let Them See Us Cry" and several people had their faces painted with the same words on their cheeks. Some victims' family members wore shirts with the names of their relatives who were killed inside or outside the Century Aurora 16 movie theater during the attack, according to CNN.

Outside the courtroom Wednesday, some survivors talked about how they wanted justice for those who lost loved ones and for Holmes' victims. Some said they weren't afraid to go inside the courtroom as jurors heard testimony in what would be a five-month trial . One of them was seen smiling at the camera, despite being so close to the scene of her relative's death years ago.

The Associated Press reported that a prosecutor called Holmes' decision to carry out the mass shooting "a calculated, cold and callous act" during opening statements in the courtroom Wednesday morning . His lawyer said his client was mentally ill but did not know he would commit murder when he bought his gun and went to the theater.

According to The Associated Press, prosecutors played a 911 recording of Holmes telling investigators that he "did it" after the shooting . In the recording, the AP reported that Holmes said "I'm the real shooter," followed by "It was me, I did it."

In court documents unsealed earlier this year, a former FBI agent testified that an informant told him in 2013 that Holmes had boasted about killing people during the attack and also said he would have continued to shoot more victims if police officers hadn't showed up. The AP reported that the informant also said Holmes had spoken of wanting to go on a shooting spree since he was in middle school .

According to the AP, a psychiatrist testified earlier this year that Holmes suffered from schizophrenia and major depression at the time of the massacre. He told investigators that his symptoms had been progressing for more than four years and began worsening about two years before the shooting when he dropped out of school, the AP reported.

The trial is expected to last five months.
