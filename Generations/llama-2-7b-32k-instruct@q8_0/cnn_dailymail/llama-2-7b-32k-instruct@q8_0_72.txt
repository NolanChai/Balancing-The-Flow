DENVER (AP) — Officers who rushed to the scene of the Colorado theater shooting entered a hellish world of bloody victims, noxious smells and blaring sounds - a gloomy darkness pierced by bright flashes from a fire alarm, police testified Wednesday.

An officer who arrived first on the scene at midnight was met with "an eerie silence," said Jeff Poggi of the Aurora Police Department. He opened doors to let in other officers and found bodies in every row. There were 12 victims in a movie theater that could hold about 900 people, he testified at the start of a preliminary hearing for James Holmes, who faces 165 charges in the attack.

"Everyone was bleeding from gunshot wounds," Poggi said. "The air smelled like gunpowder and blood."

Another officer, Cassandra Ann Ainsworth, told the judge that as she rushed to the theater she could hear a steady stream of fire alarms going off. She found three unconscious women on the ground - one was breathing but had a large hole in her chest and another woman's face was "completely disfigured."

Ainsworth also testified that Holmes, a 24-year-old former University of Colorado student, looked like an actor and his hair resembled the hair of one of the victims. He had dyed his brown hair red in jail, she said, but when he was arrested on July 20 it was still brown.

Ainsworth said she and other officers tried to help wounded people outside the Century Aurora 16 movie theater by using cell phones as lights and placing blankets over them. She saw a woman's face "completely covered with blood" - and later, that same victim told police that Holmes had shot her in her chest.

Police officer Sam Wnec said he found three unconscious men outside the movie theater after the shooting, two of whom were able to speak. They gave him a description of Holmes as a white man with red hair wearing black glasses. He then went inside and found more victims in the theater - including one woman who was dead on the floor and another woman who was bleeding from her head.

Two other officers, Todd Mitchell and Brian Flynn, said they saw a gunman outside the front of the building wearing body armor. They ordered people to get down and put their hands up before Holmes fled in a car as officers chased him. One officer got a good look at his face through a window that was broken during the chase.

Another officer, David Jansen, testified that he arrived to find three victims lying on the ground outside the theater and later found three more wounded people inside. He saw Holmes sitting in a doorway of a building next to the theater with his hands up as officers surrounded him.

"He looked like an actor," Jansen said, saying that Holmes had red hair like the victim who helped identify him. "It was just odd."

Holmes is being held on $5 million bond and has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges that he shot 12 people during a midnight showing of "The Dark Knight Rises" on July 20, 2012, killing 12 in what was one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history.

It's expected that at least two psychiatric experts will testify during next week's hearing about whether Holmes is competent to stand trial. He has been evaluated by doctors and a psychologist and a defense lawyer has suggested he may have schizophrenia, depression or other mental disorders.

Police are expected to present evidence that they searched the former neuroscience student's home in Aurora, Colo., about three months before the shooting and found a notebook with details of how to make explosive devices, a list of guns, chemicals and bullets, and drawings of people in body armor holding weapons. They also discovered two assault rifles, a shotgun and a Glock .22 pistol at his former home.

Police have said that Holmes was arrested wearing the same clothes he wore to the shooting, with three magazines for an AR-15 rifle in his pockets. They also found his black backpack with hundreds of rounds of ammunition and two additional assault rifles inside, one with a high-capacity magazine that prosecutors allege could hold 100 bullets at once.

The preliminary hearing is expected to last about four weeks. If the judge finds Holmes competent to stand trial, it will begin in January.
