Astronauts Barry Wilmore and Terry Virts record stunning point - of - view footage of their spacewalk to repair a broken solar panel on the International Space Station in 2015. The footage was released by NASA last week as part of its initiative to make more videos available for the public.

According to NASA, "The agency is releasing more than 400 hours of footage from spacewalks on the International Space Station and other destinations that it has previously released only in short clips or edited highlights."

"We're excited to share this incredible view with the world," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "The International Space Station is a laboratory for discovery, and seeing these spacewalks through astronauts' eyes gives us all a sense of what it's like to explore the final frontier."

The footage includes stunning views of Earth and the universe, as well as close-ups of the space station itself. It also shows the astronauts working on repairs and maintenance tasks in zero gravity.

NASA has been releasing videos from spacewalks for years, but this latest release is particularly significant because it includes much longer clips that show more detail than before. The footage was taken using a special camera system called the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), which allows astronauts to control cameras mounted on robotic arms from inside the space station.

"This is an amazing opportunity for people all over the world to see what it's like to be an astronaut in space," said NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier, head of Human Spaceflight Operations. "We hope this release will inspire a new generation of explorers and help us all appreciate the wonder of our home planet from a unique perspective."

The footage is available on NASA's YouTube channel and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. It is also being shared on social media platforms to reach a wider audience.

Overall, this latest release of spacewalk footage from NASA is sure to capture the imagination of space enthusiasts around the world and provide a unique insight into the experiences of astronauts in space.
