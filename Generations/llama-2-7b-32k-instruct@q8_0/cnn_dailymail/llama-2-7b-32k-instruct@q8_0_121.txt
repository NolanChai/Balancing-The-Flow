(CNN)South Africa's King Goodwill Zwelithini has called on the nation to oppose attacks against immigrants from other African countries after at least four people were killed in Johannesburg this week.  
Zwelithini said at a memorial service for victims of recent violence that foreigners should not be attacked, adding he was shocked and saddened by the xenophobic attacks . "I'm here to say I am totally opposed to attacking immigrants," he told mourners.  
"We must respect other countries as well as our own country," added Zwelithini, who is based in KwaZulu-Natal province and serves as a figurehead for the Zulu nation . "The attacks against foreigners are unacceptable."     South Africa has been hit by violence since last month, with at least four people killed after mobs of locals attacked immigrants from other African countries. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba condemned the recent attacks and appealed for an end to hostilities .  
"We must make sure that we don't allow ourselves to be used by people whose only interest is to destroy our country," said Gigaba. "We are all equal in this country."     The violence has sparked protests across South Africa, with thousands taking part in a march in the coastal city of Durban on Wednesday .  
'Rally Against Xenophobia'  
In a video posted to Facebook and Twitter by journalist Carin Smith, who was at the rally, the crowd can be heard chanting "No xenophobia" and singing songs in support of refugees.  
Smith said people were angry about the attacks that have left foreigners fearful for their safety and made it difficult to travel around South Africa . "People are saying they're not going to stay silent anymore," she told CNN, adding some protesters had been crying out of frustration.     The protests come as thousands of people are set to take part in a rally against xenophobia on Saturday in Johannesburg's central Momentum Stadium .  
The event will be led by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has condemned the attacks and called for calm.     He tweeted Tuesday that "those who commit crimes against foreigners must face justice," adding: "We are a non-racial, non-sexist society.""
