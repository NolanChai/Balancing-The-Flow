Police have been called after a woman was seen driving through the streets with her young son on top of the car's bonnet. The video has sparked a fierce debate among viewers about whether parents who are caught endangering their children should be arrested. A video posted to Instagram shows the mother driving at high speed and with her child, believed to be around six years old, sitting on the hood of her vehicle. According to reports in India, the incident took place in Chennai city, Tamil Nadu state, where the woman was reportedly being chased by her husband's family for eloping with their son. The video has been viewed 32 million times and sparked a debate about whether parents who put children at risk should be arrested or if this is just another example of India's obsession with viral videos, with many claiming the woman was actually trying to get away from her family and not putting her child in danger. The mother could be seen weaving through traffic as she drives out of Chennai city to the suburb of Madipakkam, where a group of people are gathered outside an ATM. She slows down near them before driving off at speed again with the boy on her bonnet. A police car chases after her and several officers try to stop her car but she speeds away. The woman is heard shouting in Tamil as she drives, asking for water for her son. Viewers were divided over whether they thought the mother should be arrested or not, with many saying she was being "brave" while others said that it was a clear example of endangering a child's life. One commenter wrote: "This is madness. Who does that?!?" A second asked: "Do we really need to have police arresting women for this? What about educating them and creating awareness? How can you be so heartless, sir?" Another said: "People are going crazy these days." The Indian government's Ministry of Women & Child Development said it had ordered an investigation into the video. (Leadership Newspapers)
