â€‹Bolton, Greater Manchester last Friday (May 5). The officers ordered him out of the car after he failed to stop at an accident scene but Ali refused and sped off in a bid to escape. He managed to get away for around two minutes before the officers deployed stop sticks - spiky devices used to puncture his tyres. Mr Ali was eventually arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. The incident took place on Hall Lane, Bolton at 10pm on Friday night and was witnessed by dozens of terrified drivers and pedestrians. One person tweeted: "Absolute state of this guy trying to evade arrest in a car with no lights on #Bolton." Another added: "Wow, 80mph... that's quite some getaway! @gmpolice #Bolton #TasersAreForCriminals" The officers managed to arrest Ali following the incident. They said: "Incidents like this can be dealt with in a number of different ways by our officers, including Tasering and spiking vehicles - all of which are subject to strict guidelines and regulations."

This is one of those viral videos that you just have to see to believe. We're talking about the unbelievable scenes captured on a police car dashcam when a man drove at 80 miles per hour in a bid to escape arrest. It's like something out of a movie or TV show, but it's all too real.

The incident happened last Friday night in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and was caught on the police car's dashcam. Yassir Ali, 29, of no-fixed-abode, was stopped by traffic police after failing to stop at an accident scene. But when they ordered him out of the car, he refused and sped off in a bid to escape. It was quite the getaway, with Ali managing to get away for around two minutes before the officers deployed stop sticks - spiky devices used to puncture his tyres.

But the police weren't messing around. They managed to arrest Ali following the incident. They said: "Incidents like this can be dealt with in a number of different ways by our officers, including Tasering and spiking vehicles - all of which are subject to strict guidelines and regulations."

It's hard not to be impressed by the speed at which Ali was driving. 80 miles per hour is no joke, especially when you consider that he was trying to evade arrest! It's a miracle he didn't hit any pedestrians or other cars during his getaway.

But the police were prepared and knew what they were doing. They deployed stop sticks and eventually arrested Ali, proving once again that they are always one step ahead of the criminals.

It's videos like this that make us grateful for the brave men and women in blue who keep us safe every day. We can't wait to see what else they come up with next!

In conclusion, the unbelievable scenes captured on a police car dashcam when a man drove at 80 miles per hour in a bid to escape arrest is an incredible display of bravery and determination. The police were able to arrest Ali and show that they are always one step ahead. We're grateful for their service and look forward to seeing what other amazing things they can do!

This is one of those videos that you just have to watch again and again, and we're sure you will too. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride - or rather, escape attempt - in all its glory!
