"These are people who were not supposed to have voices, but it was important that they be heard," Lawrence said."The Migration" is owned by Phillips Collection in Washington, where the work has been displayed since 1941 . This year, Lawrence's seminal artwork will make its way around the United States as part of a traveling exhibition commemorating the centennial of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC)."The Migration" was created from 1940 to 1941, Lawrence's last year at age 38 in New York City."We want to let people know that the museum exists," said Kevin Straley, executive director of The Phillips Collection . "And also have this work be seen by a new generation and appreciated for what it was in its time."The exhibition, which opened Friday in Atlanta, Georgia, will visit 10 cities over six years."We wanted to try to hit all the major regions of the country," Straley said ."There's a real regional element that we're looking at."Following the opening in Atlanta, "Migration" will travel to Detroit; Houston; Chicago; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville; Washington, D.C.; and New York City."It is our hope that this exhibition will inspire a new generation of artists to continue the tradition of portraying African American life through art," Straley said ."We want to get people to go out and see it, experience it, live with it for as long as they can so they can be inspired by it."The exhibit, which features more than 100 artifacts, is presented in chronological order beginning with the first piece of artwork that was created at the time . Each painting measures about two feet tall and three inches wide, allowing viewers to see them all at once, Straley said."They're small -- you can hold one in your hand," he explained."The Migration" is a story about people who were living their lives during a very turbulent time."These are real people who did great things in the midst of oppressive circumstances," Lawrence wrote on his website ."Lawrence, known for his dynamic and abstract style, was born in 1917 to a family of sharecroppers in Columbia, South Carolina," according to his bio on Phillips Collection website."He began painting at age six and studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago."After studying at The University of Washington from 1938 through 1940, Lawrence went on to work as a teacher and received an assignment to paint murals for the Federal Art Project in New York City .The exhibit will also include some other notable works like "Black Cabin," which was inspired by the slave quarters at Monticello, where Jefferson kept his slaves hidden from public view ."It's about trying to tell a larger story about who people are and what their lives are like," Straley said .Lawrence's work has been exhibited in museums and galleries across the country and world."There is a growing appreciation for American Modernism, particularly African American modernism, so this exhibition will be important to showcase the breadth and depth of Lawrence's achievements," Straley said ."The Migration" is considered one of the first abstract works that depict black life in America."It was a time when we were really thinking about what it meant to have an American culture," Straley said ."There was no blueprint for how these people would be portrayed -- you can see some of that experimentation here."The Phillips Collection, which is also known as "America's first museum of modern art," was founded by Duncan Phillips in 1921 to promote American art and artists .In addition to hosting the exhibit, The Phillips Collection has created a book, an app, and an online exhibition about Lawrence ."We want people to really feel like they know this person and his work," Straley said."This is a very important time in America's history and it needs to be acknowledged .There's so much more for us to learn from the past, especially now with all that's happening in our country."
