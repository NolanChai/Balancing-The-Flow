Most Americans know little about Jacob Lawrence, the African American artist who died this month at age 94. But his most famous series of paintings remains one of the most important artistic contributions by any artist during the 20th century and beyond. The Migration Series, a collection of 60 panels created between 1940 and 1941, was inspired by research Lawrence had done on African American history and culture at the Library of Congress. It has been exhibited in museums across America for nearly eight decades.
