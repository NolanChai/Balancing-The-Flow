Henry wants Gunners to splash out on four new players this summer (Picture: Getty)Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, right-back, centre-midfielder and striker this season but says they will only be able to land those targets if they sell players.

Henry feels the Gunners have done enough selling over recent seasons to balance their books. He said: 'It's time for them to buy and I think it's important that they do so because, otherwise, you can forget about competing with Manchester City and Chelsea. You are not going to win the Premier League unless you have a good enough team.'

Henry says he does not want Arsenal to be like Liverpool or Manchester United who rely on their own youth system to produce talent - but he insists they must also help out their youngsters by loaning them out and letting them gain experience elsewhere. 'You cannot have two different strategies, you can't say, "I am going to bring players in" and at the same time, "We are not going to sell".'

The Arsenal legend continued: 'For me it is very clear - if they don't buy then we need to give them (their youngsters) a chance and loan them out. They need to know there is no way back for them at the club.'

Wenger insists that the pressure of being sacked does not apply to him because of the contract he agreed last year. He said: 'No, I don't feel under pressure. I am happy with what we have done so far and if we are not able to continue that in the second half of the season, then maybe it is a good question.'

The Gunners boss does, however, admit he needs to do a better job next year and says his side must start by beating relegation rivals Swansea on Saturday. Wenger said: 'We are going through a tough patch but that is the nature of the season sometimes.'
