, centre-back, winger, and striker, but manager Mikel Arteta should not be restricted when making any signings. Henry told RMC Sport: “You cannot limit yourself, you have to find solutions to get better. It’s the most important thing. I think everyone needs to change a bit. There are things that need to be improved at Arsenal, especially in terms of quality.” He also advised Arteta not to bring back any of his former players. “I don't recommend bringing back people who have been there for 10-15 years and haven't achieved much. You must give some new blood a chance. And the coach has to be willing to listen.”

The news Thierry Henry is criticising Arsenal's transfer dealings should not be surprising. Henry was one of the biggest names at Arsenal during his time with the club and he led them to many titles and honours, so it makes sense that people would be listening to what he says about the Gunners. However, it is interesting that he feels they need four new players in order to improve, as this would represent a huge investment for Arsenal. Additionally, Henry suggests Mikel Arteta should not limit himself when making signings and that he needs to give some new blood a chance. This seems to indicate that Arsenal could be set for a busy summer transfer window.

It's worth noting that Thierry Henry is not an insider at Arsenal, so it's up to Mikel Arteta what he decides to do with the information he has been given about his team. However, this information should give him something to think about as he considers what steps to take next for his club. Henry's comments about the need for new blood and willingness to listen to suggestions from outside the club could be seen as positive developments if they are taken on board by Arteta. Overall, Thierry Henry's opinions may not come as a surprise, but they do provide food for thought for those who care about Arsenal's future.

Thierry Henry is a French-Belgian professional football manager and former player. He was born on 18 August 1974 in Les Abymes, Guadeloupe. As a player, he started his senior career with Monaco in Ligue 2 before moving to the top flight with Arsenal in 1996 for £3 million. Henry then went on to score 220 goals and make 175 assists across all competitions during his time at the club, becoming Arsenal's record goalscorer with 297 goals. He was also named PFA Players' Player of the Year twice and won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, five FA Community Shields, one UEFA Super Cup and one UEFA Champions League title during his time at the club. After leaving Arsenal in 2007, Henry played for Barcelona, Juventus, New York Red Bulls and finally retired from professional football with Aston Villa in 2014. He was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2016 and was named French player of the year four times in his career. He was also honoured as the best footballer at the 1998 World Cup when France won the tournament. Henry holds the record for most goals in a calendar year in Ligue 1, with 53 goals for Monaco in 1994 and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players to have ever played football.

After retiring from professional football, Thierry Henry went on to become a manager and has been working for Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise since December 2022. He was previously working with the French national team in the role of assistant coach to Didi Degen and manager before his appointment at Union Saint-Gilloise.

In conclusion, Thierry Henry is a highly respected former player who went on to become a successful manager after retiring from professional football.
