wave of motivational junk’ aimed at teachers by management consultants and education companies

Mr Hendrick claims that these slogans are often empty platitudes which do not help students learn. Instead he suggests that schools should focus on the practical aspects of education such as literacy, numeracy, critical thinking and communication skills. He believes that this will lead to a more successful career in later life for pupils

Mr Hendrick has also criticized schools who use these slogans to ‘claim’ their school is ‘better’ than others in the area. He states that there is no evidence that such a tactic actually works and instead it could be detrimental to students as they are not taught what they need to know for exams

He says: “There’s lots of research showing motivational slogans don’t work. They may help some children, but the majority aren’t helped at all. They think it makes them feel better because they’re feeling more positive about their school or something, but it doesn’t necessarily make you do better in your exam.”

He believes that schools need to focus on the practical elements of learning rather than these ‘fluffy’ slogans which are often used. Mr Hendrick says: “We should be concentrating more on literacy and numeracy because that will help kids later on in life”

Carl is not alone with his view that motivational slogans are pointless, but do not benefit pupils as they need to learn the practical aspects of education. In a study by researchers at the University of Oxford and King’s College London, it was found that motivational posters did not improve student’s engagement or performance.

The findings also suggested that they may have had an adverse effect on some students. Dr Emily Daley, lead author of the study said: “It would be a better use of time for teachers to focus on practical aspects of teaching rather than trying to motivate their pupils using slogans and posters.”

She also added that these type of methods can actually have an adverse effect on students as they feel pressure to achieve when in reality they may not be ready. Mr Hendrick believes that this is the case in most schools. He states: “We don’t need motivational slogans; we need to teach practical skills because those are what will get kids into a job, and keep them there.”

The idea of schools using motivational slogans can also lead to ‘unhealthy competition’ amongst schools. Dr Daley believes that this is a problem as it does not encourage teachers to focus on the practical aspects of learning. She says: “If a school thinks it’s doing really well, and others are struggling because they don’t have these posters up, then there can be an ‘unhealthy competition’. It makes them feel like they need to outdo everyone else.”

Mr Hendrick agrees with Dr Daley on this point as he believes that schools should not be competing against each other but instead focusing on the practical aspects of learning. He says: “If there is unhealthy competition amongst schools, it’s because they are trying to get their pupils to do better in exams than another school. There shouldn’t really be a need for that.”

Mr Hendrick believes that if teachers put more effort into teaching practical skills rather than using motivational slogans then this will lead to a more successful career for students. He adds: “If we focus on the practical aspects of learning, and not these fluffy words and phrases, kids are better able to cope with the world when they leave school.”

However some teachers disagree with Mr Hendrick’s opinion that motivational slogans do more harm than good. One teacher who did not wish to be named believes that it is important to encourage pupils in this way as it gives them a boost for the day and can help them learn better. She said: “I think there should always be a bit of motivation in school as well because I don’t want my students to lose interest or not try their best.”

Mr Hendrick believes that his ideas are being ignored by schools and he feels they need to do more research into the practical aspects of learning. He says: “We need to look at what we’re actually doing in our classrooms. I think the evidence is starting to build up that motivational posters aren’t helpful, but it would be good to have some proper research.”

The Government also believes that there is a lack of evidence for whether these type of methods are successful or not as they don’t collect data on them. Dr Daley believes that more research needs to be done into the matter and she hopes this will lead to changes in how schools are run in England.

She says: “There isn’t much hard evidence about what actually works, so it would be great for there to be a proper study carried out.” Mr Hendrick believes that it is important that parents and teachers listen to him when he speaks as this is not something that should be dismissed lightly.

He says: “I’m just giving advice based on the evidence that we have, so I hope people will listen to what I have to say.” However some parents disagree with Mr Hendrick as they believe their children need the motivation of these slogans and posters in order for them to learn.

Mr Hendrick believes that it is important that schools teach practical skills rather than trying to encourage pupils in this way through motivational slogans or posters. He says: “I don’t want parents to take away from the message I have tried to give, but instead look at how they are actually being taught.”

Some teachers and parents agree with Mr Hendrick on his point that schools need to teach practical skills rather than using motivational slogans or posters. They believe it is important for children’s education that these type of methods are used. However the evidence seems to suggest otherwise which begs the question; do these slogans actually work?
