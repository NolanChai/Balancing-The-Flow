Staff who work for the Queen and her family have voted by an 83 per cent majority to take strike action for the first time in history over their 'ridiculously low' wages. Wardens at Windsor Castle said they were expected to carry out extra duties, including giving up weekends and evenings off to work as security guards in return for lower basic pay. They said: "We are not being treated with any respect." The ballot result by the GMB union could have an impact on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who now live at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor where the Queen has her official residence, because they will be expected to pay for their own security. A source close to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said: "There's no doubt this could impact on what we do. There is a chance that some of us might have to look at ways of reducing costs."
