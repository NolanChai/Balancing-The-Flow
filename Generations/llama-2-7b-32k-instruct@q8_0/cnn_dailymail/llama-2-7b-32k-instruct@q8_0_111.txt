psy-spotting and keeping watch on the swans at St George's Chapel during the royal wedding . The strike will go ahead on 1 May because of an ‘unacceptable delay’ by Buckingham Palace in negotiating over a pay rise . A ballot found that 87.4 per cent of wardens supported the action, and they have been given the backing of the union Unison for the strike to take place on what has traditionally been May Day . The unions say this is ‘the first time in history’ that members of Her Majesty's staff will be taking industrial action . It comes as Prince Charles is accused of interfering in a bid by two other wardens, John Dundas and Peter Francis, to get the pay rise they believe they are entitled to .

In a letter published on The Sunday Times website , Mr Dundas, 58, and Mr Francis, 61, said Prince Charles had tried to persuade them not to go ahead with an employment tribunal over their wages . They said the Prince of Wales told them they should be ‘proud’ of what they were doing at Windsor Castle - which was opened by Edward VII in 1830 after Queen Victoria died . He went on: ‘He then suggested we look to a future of stability and security, as he wanted our positions maintained . We did not want this.’ Prince Charles's office declined to comment yesterday but Buckingham Palace said the royal households had offered the two men the option of moving into ‘non-operational’ jobs if they felt unable to continue with their current roles . It is understood Mr Dundas and Mr Francis have accepted the offer and are now employed in maintenance at Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Wardens, who look after the castle, park and chapel and act as guards for the Queen on state occasions, get a basic salary of £21,950 . They earn an extra £486 if they work weekends or bank holidays, taking their annual salary to more than £30,000. Unison says the wardens should receive a pay rise because some have been working in their jobs for 25 years but are on the same rate as those starting out .

The unions say the pay rises would be ‘fair and affordable’ given Buckingham Palace has had an operating surplus of £4.9 million, before tax, over the past five years . The royal households were approached for a comment last night but said they could not discuss employment issues as it was a matter for the individual departments . It is understood that wardens will walk out at Windsor Castle from 7am to 2pm on 1 May - but their colleagues in London and York Caste will strike over three days, starting from 4pm on Friday until lunchtime on Monday .

Wardens are also due to take industrial action across the Queen's other homes at Buckingham Palace and Holyrood House, the official Scottish royal residence, but no dates have yet been set for those strikes . The union's national officer Unison said it was ‘a sad day’ when staff were forced to go on strike because of their boss's failure to negotiate over a fair pay rise'.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘The Royal Households recognise that our employees are entitled to be paid fairly for the work they do. They have offered all employees affected by this proposed industrial action an alternative job in another area of the organisation where their skills and experience would continue to be fully utilised. We believe these alternative roles will provide a sustainable solution and we hope those who take them up will be happy with them.’

A royal source said: ‘The strike is completely unjustified and unnecessary. The royal household is committed to ensuring our employees are paid fairly and will continue to do so through constructive discussions with the trade union.' A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Prince Charles had interfered in the wardens' pay disputes .

It comes just days before the royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which will be held at Windsor Castle on 19 May . The Queen has warned staff that they must ensure there are no ‘security risks’ as crowds gather in Windsor to celebrate the big day . Her Majesty is also set to attend a memorial service for victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, which will take place at Westminster Abbey on 23 May . The wardens have been working to improve security measures since the attack at Ariana Grande's concert in which 22 people were killed and more than 800 injured .

The unions say Buckingham Palace should ‘wake up’ to the fact that many staff are on ‘low pay’ and are not happy with their jobs . They say the wardens, who work for Her Majesty's Wardrobe Department, have been calling for a rise since 2014 but the royal households have repeatedly failed to engage in talks. Unison said: ‘We have now given Buckingham Palace more than enough notice of this action and they are simply failing to respond . We hope that once again, there is no repeat of what happened after last year's strike ballot at Windsor Castle.'

Wardens also went on strike in 2016 over plans to cut jobs at Buckingham Palace, but the dispute was later resolved without industrial action when a pay rise was offered . The union says this dispute ‘revealed’ that wardens had been working for as little as £17,950 after being told they should take on more duties and cover for colleagues in their spare time or risk losing their jobs .

The Royal Household said: ‘We are committed to ensuring our employees are paid fairly for the work they do. We believe that these alternative roles will provide a sustainable solution and we hope those who take them up will be happy with them.’

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Prince Charles had interfered in the wardens' pay disputes .

The wardens are entitled to 25 days' holiday a year, but their leave is not paid. The unions say this ‘unpaid time off’ means they earn less than the London Living Wage - which was set at £10.20 an hour last week . It comes after Prince Charles urged staff to stay at Buckingham Palace and become more efficient in a speech during his official visit to the Queen's home in 2016 .

In the letter published on The Sunday Times website, Mr Dundas said he was ‘surprised’ that the Prince had told them not to proceed with their tribunal when they had been unable to resolve the issue through meetings at Buckingham Palace and with a mediator. Mr Francis added: ‘I find it incredible that Charles would even consider getting involved in my dispute - after all, I have worked for Her Majesty's Wardrobe Department for 25 years and he has never before raised his head .’

The wardens say Buckingham Palace had asked them to come up with proposals for improving security at Windsor Castle following the Ariana Grande concert attack. They say they gave a detailed report but were not told if their recommendations would be put into practice . The unions said Mr Dundas and Mr Francis should be paid the London Living Wage because of what they had done to improve security .

They wrote: ‘The proposal contained 20 specific recommendations for enhancing safety at Windsor Castle, most of which we have been told will be implemented, including a request that officers are armed with CS gas sprays and that all staff working on the castle's grounds were issued with body armour .’

Mr Dundas said Buckingham Palace had made him feel ‘powerless to take action’ as he worked without pay during the strikes last year, when he was also unable to spend time with his family in Wales because of his shift patterns . He added: ‘It's not acceptable and I am just getting on with it because that is what I am paid for. However, this has got to be sorted out some time as we cannot carry on working without paying for childcare or missing our children growing up.’

A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said: ‘We have offered all those affected by this proposed industrial action an alternative job in another area of the organisation where their skills and experience will continue to be fully utilised. We believe these alternative roles will provide a sustainable solution and we hope that those who take them up are happy with them.’
