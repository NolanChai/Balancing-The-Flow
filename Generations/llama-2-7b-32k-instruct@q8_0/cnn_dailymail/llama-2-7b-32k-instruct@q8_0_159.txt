The governor's order came just days after President Barack Obama made a similar appeal to conserve water .

The governor said on Wednesday that "the magnitude of this crisis goes beyond drought" and called for the public's help.

On Monday, Brown ordered cities, towns and rural communities in California to cut their water use by 25 percent, but he acknowledged that the mandatory cut might be more stringent than necessary because many areas have already instituted voluntary cutbacks .

"It will be difficult," the governor said, but he urged Californians to accept the reality that "it is a new day." He said mandatory conservation was needed because of "the magnitude of this crisis goes beyond drought ."

Brown said he has been working for decades on ways to address California's water needs. Now, he said, the state needs everyone to pitch in with conservation efforts.

The governor called for Californians to follow rules that have already been put into place in many local communities: turning off faucets while brushing teeth, limiting showers and shutting down leaks .

He also proposed new requirements for businesses to conserve water at their facilities and encourage employees to use the least amount of water possible. He said there should be mandatory cutbacks in irrigation, landscaping and car washing -- not just residential usage.

The governor has faced criticism from environmentalists who say his approach hasn't been tough enough on polluting industries that threaten California's water quality .

But Brown told reporters he's taken action to curb the amount of wasteful discharge from industrial operations, and called for even more limits on businesses and other entities.

On Wednesday, Brown acknowledged that many Californians have already been trying to conserve water, but said it still isn't enough . He noted that many residents use significantly less water than those in other states, "but we have a lot of people here."

The governor ordered cities and towns in the state to report on their total water consumption. Officials will then figure out how much conservation is needed at each community by using a formula based on population size, climate, landscaping and the type of water source used .

California's drought has already had an impact on the environment and on the state's economy.

A number of Central Valley communities are struggling to get enough water from their reservoirs, forcing them to limit drinking water supplies for residents. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, also reported that firefighters have already seen more wildfires this summer than in any year on record .

California is not alone in facing a drought problem; Texas has had its own dry spell, while Colorado's water levels are low enough to cause concern for fish populations.

In Colorado, officials from Denver and Aurora announced new rules Monday that limit residential irrigation to just two days a week . Both cities also want residents to use sprinklers instead of hoses to conserve more water.

But Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said the state isn't likely to impose mandatory cutbacks anytime soon.<s>
