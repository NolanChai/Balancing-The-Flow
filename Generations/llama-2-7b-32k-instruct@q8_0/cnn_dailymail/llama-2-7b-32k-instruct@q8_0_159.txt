California's Drought: An Ongoing Crisis (PHOTOS)
Calfornia Gov. Jerry Brown ordered a 25 percent overall cutback in water use by cities and towns in the golden state on Wednesday but as these photos taken on Saturday show, the ongoing drought is already causing significant impacts around California, from increased wildfires to dying trees and fish kills.

Photographer Gary Reyes was at San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Fremont, Calif., where he witnessed a mass die-off of thousands of migrating birds on Saturday. The deaths are blamed on the drought as well as the fact that many birds were still swimming around despite the water temperatures being above 100 degrees.

"This is just the start of what will be an epic drought this summer," Reyes said. "It's not a pretty sight, it makes you sad for these beautiful creatures."

California has been hit hard by a severe three-year drought that has left hundreds of thousands of acres burned in wildfires and farmers scrambling to protect their crops as the Sierra Nevada snowpack drops at a record low rate.
