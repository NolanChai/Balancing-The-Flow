remain.

One of the most influential figures at the club has been president Enrique Cerezo, who took over when Jesús Gil’s death ended his 42-year tenure as president . Since then, Atletico Madrid have not spent nearly as much money as their city rivals and this policy has paid off with a string of successes in the Spanish league and Champions League .

Atletico Madrid are now one of Europe’s most successful clubs with six league titles (the last three all coming since 2014), a further two Copa del Reys, and two Europa Leagues . The only trophy missing from this impressive collection is the Supercopa which they lost to Real Madrid in August .

Enrique Cerezo’s philosophy has been built on four core values: humility, hard work, loyalty and responsibility. He has always insisted that he did not take over the club because he was a fan but as a man of business who wanted to make money through football . His vision is to build a powerful club at home and abroad, with teams playing in all five continents .

He inherited a small debt from Gil’s regime and this has grown dramatically over recent years. As Atletico Madrid have reached new heights, they are spending more money on players than ever before. The wage bill has also increased considerably to around €105 million with the best players in Spain being signed .

The club has a total debt of around €233 million and is owned by Cerezo himself (85%), who received it from his father, Enrique Cerezo Riaño as part payment for the business they had done together . The other shareholders include Atletico Madrid’s players (6%), and representatives of the city council and supporters.

As well as investing more in transfers, Cerezo has also spent a lot to improve facilities at Wanda Metropolitano stadium including increasing the capacity by 13,000 seats . Atletico Madrid’s training ground is one of the best in Europe and their youth team has seen its share of success too with players such as Iker Muniain and Óliver Torres coming through to play for the first team .

Atletico have also had success in the marketing department by launching new sponsorship deals and becoming a La Liga partner. Their shirt sponsors include Chinese company Wanda Group, who recently bought Atletico’s stadium naming rights for €1 billion over 20 years. Cerezo is hoping to replicate this deal elsewhere in the world .

The club is also going through a period of expansion, with plans to build new offices and hotels . As well as growing revenues from broadcasting, sponsorship and ticket sales, it has become a major revenue stream .

Cerezo’s policy at Atletico Madrid is clear: keep the debt under control while building a competitive team for future success on the field. He feels this is best achieved by doing things the Atletico way, which is to build a successful team based on good players and hard work .

It was Cerezo’s idea to get involved in the Chinese market when he received an offer from Wanda Group who wanted to become the sponsor of Atlético. He realised that this could help him achieve his ambition of becoming one of Europe’s major clubs and also become more powerful in the Spanish league by having a bigger shareholding in the club .

Another of Cerezo’s main achievements was the building of the Wanda Metropolitano stadium, which has been widely praised for its design and facilities. The decision to build this stadium was also influenced by his desire to hold future World Club competitions at Atlético de Madrid stadiums, as well as by the club’s desire to play in a stadium with more capacity .

Enrique Cerezo has been president of Atlético since 1992 and has overseen an amazing transformation for the club. In that time, he has transformed them from being a small regional team into one of Europe’s major clubs . His commitment to Atletico’s philosophy has ensured this and his vision has also helped him create an exciting future .

The club is currently at its most successful period in history but Cerezo knows that he must keep spending under control while continuing to invest in the team and facilities if they are to continue being competitive on the field and off it . His policy of working with a small budget has paid dividends for Atlético Madrid and he is determined to continue doing things the Atletico way .

The Chinese company Wanda Group sponsored the stadium naming rights which helped Cerezo achieve his ambition of becoming one of Europe’s major clubs and also become more powerful in the Spanish league by having a bigger shareholding in the club .

Wanda Group was named as the main sponsor of the club in a five - year partnership that would generate €45 million per season, making it one of La Liga’s most lucrative shirt deals . This is also known as the Wanda Metropolitano stadium due to its association with Wanda Group.

The stadium has an official capacity of 68,000 seats but this will be reduced to around 64,000 once the pandemic restrictions are over . It was built on a former industrial area close to the city centre and it also includes two hotels with 259 rooms between them and 13,000 square metres of office space.
