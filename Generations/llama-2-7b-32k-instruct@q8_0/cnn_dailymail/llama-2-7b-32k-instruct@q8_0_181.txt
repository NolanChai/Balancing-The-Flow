Atletico Madrid supporters are now able to enjoy life a little more knowing the club has secured their transfer targets for this summer. It was not an easy start, with Joao Felix being linked to Barcelona and Manchester City. The former moved on to Juventus and Atletico responded by securing the signing of Moussa Wagué from Genk.

The Belgian international is a versatile player that can play in midfield as well as defence. He has been given the number 20 shirt at Los Colchoneros, which will be vacated by Kieran Trippier who left for Newcastle United. Wagué is a talented defender and was an integral part of Genk's squad that finished fourth in the Belgian First Division A last season.

Atletico also secured the loan signing of Luis Suarez from Ajax Amsterdam, which is seen as a good bit of business by Los Colchoneros given their need for more firepower upfront. The 35-year-old has played most of his career in La Liga but spent last season at Ajax. He was also linked to Atalanta and Lille, among others. Suarez is a proven goal scorer with plenty of experience on the international stage. He has signed for the Rojiblancos until the end of the season and will wear the number 19 shirt previously worn by Diego Costa at the club.

Furthermore, the club has also announced the extension of the contracts of João Félix and José Giménez. The former joined from Benfica last summer for €62 million plus add-ons, while the latter signed a new six year deal in September 2021. It is understood that both deals were done at a lower cost than the release clauses attached to each player's contracts at the time of signing.

Another player who has joined Atletico Madrid on loan until the end of this season is Nahuel Tenes from San Lorenzo, who had been linked with Flamengo and Benfica. The Argentinian will wear the number 21 shirt for Los Colchoneros and brings experience to a team that has lost several players in recent weeks due to transfer activity.

Lastly, it is believed that the club is still looking to sign another two attacking players and three defenders before the transfer window closes on September 1st.

Wagué played for Genk's first team since he was just 20 years old back in 2017. He made over 130 appearances for his hometown club, scoring 24 goals and adding 18 assists to his name. Wagué can play both as a centre-back and as a right-back and will be an excellent addition to Diego Simeone's side that has struggled in this department for several seasons now.

Suarez joined Ajax last summer from Barcelona, where he played the previous season on loan. He has scored 21 goals in 45 appearances for the Dutch club and was part of the team that finished third in the Eredivisie and reached the Europa Conference League semi-finals. The Uruguayan is still a solid goal scorer who will help Atletico find its way back into the Champions League, which it has not qualified for since 2018.

Félix was part of the squad that won the 2021 Portuguese Super Cup and finished third in last season's league competition. He is a quick and talented player who joined Atletico from Benfica last summer for €62 million plus add-ons, which could turn out to be an excellent bargain for Los Colchoneros.

Giménez also played for Genk in the 2017/18 season when he made 35 appearances and scored five goals. The Uruguayan is a key player at centre-back and will have an important role to play this season, especially with Diego Costa leaving the club last summer.

Tenes joined San Lorenzo from Independiente in 2019 and played over 40 games for his current team. He has scored nine goals so far and was also linked with Brazilian teams Flamengo and Benfica. The Argentine will be an excellent addition to Atletico Madrid's squad, especially in a position where the club has been lacking depth since long.

Giménez joined Genk from Sporting CP for €4 million back in 2017 and went on to make over 90 appearances for his current team. He also scored six goals. The Uruguayan is another key player that will help the club improve this season.

Atletico Madrid has had a great summer transfer window so far, signing Wagué, Suarez, Tenes, and extending contracts of Félix, Giménez, and José María Callejón. The team has also signed Giménez on loan for the rest of this season, which is seen as an excellent deal for Los Colchoneros. Diego Simeone's team has lost several key players in recent weeks due to transfer activity but has been able to reinforce its squad well and will be hoping that these signings can help them find their way back into the Champions League, where they have not qualified since 2018.

The club has also announced the loan signing of Luis Suarez from Ajax Amsterdam until the end of this season. The Uruguayan is a proven goal scorer and will be an excellent addition to Atletico Madrid's squad, especially with Diego Costa leaving last summer.

Furthermore, it is understood that Atletico is still looking to sign another two attacking players and three defenders before the transfer window closes on September 1st. The club has already signed Nahuel Tenes from San Lorenzo, who had been linked with Flamengo and Benfica.

Atletico Madrid supporters have good reason to be confident in the people that run their club. They have secured their transfer targets for this summer and are looking forward to the rest of this window and next season. With these signings, Atletico Madrid looks to be on its way back up the table, having finished a disappointing 10th last season.

One very good player moves out and another very good player moves in. It's simple, but it works. Joao Felix was linked to Barcelona and Manchester City but has now moved to Juventus.
