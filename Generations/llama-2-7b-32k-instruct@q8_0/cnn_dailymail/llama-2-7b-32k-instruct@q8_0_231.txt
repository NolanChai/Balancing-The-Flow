This is due to factors including higher prices for non-tobacco flavors and concerns about potential health risks associated with the device, researchers said. "E-cigarettes have been marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes by claiming that they do not contain the same carcinogens and other harmful chemicals," said study lead author Linda Bailey, director of the Center for Tobacco Products Surveillance at the University of California San Francisco . "However, some e-cigarette flavors can still be quite expensive to buy online, which may limit their appeal among youth."

The researchers analyzed data from a nationwide survey of US adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old that was conducted in 2013. The survey asked participants about their past three-month use of e-cigarettes, as well as other tobacco products . They found that the proportion of teens who reported using e-cigarettes was low at the time of the study -- only 14 percent had used them in the previous three months. However, this number is likely an underestimate since many youth may not disclose their use of e-cigarettes because of the stigma associated with tobacco products . The researchers also found that about half of teens who reported using e-cigarettes had used flavored versions .

The study suggests that efforts to reduce access and appeal to youth should focus on non-tobacco flavors, which are more expensive than regular cigarettes but may still be appealing to some teenagers . The researchers also recommend that e-cigarette companies limit their marketing to adults only and discourage use of the devices by children through age verification requirements.

The study's findings suggest that e-cigarettes may not be as attractive or appealing to youth as traditional cigarettes, particularly when flavored versions are more expensive . Additionally, the fact that only a small proportion of teens reported using e-cigarettes suggests that efforts to prevent youth use of these devices may be effective. However, further research is needed to better understand why some youth are not attracted to e-cigarettes and how best to prevent their use among those who are interested in trying them .

The study's findings also highlight the need for regulations that limit access to non-tobacco flavors, which may be more appealing to youth. The researchers suggest that e-cigarette companies should limit their marketing to adults only and discourage use of the devices by children through age verification requirements . These findings have implications for public health policy as well as the development of products aimed at reducing smoking among young people .

In conclusion, this study suggests that e-cigarettes are not as attractive or appealing to youth as traditional cigarettes, particularly when flavored versions are more expensive. Additionally, it highlights the need for regulations that limit access to non-tobacco flavors and discourage use of the devices by children . Further research is needed to better understand why some youth are not attracted to e-cigarettes and how best to prevent their use among those who are interested in trying them.
