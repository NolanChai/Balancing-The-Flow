Researchers analyzed data from surveys conducted by the National Youth Tobacco Survey between 2014 and 2017. The research team included over 57,000 teens in their analysis . About one-third of teenagers reported ever using e-cigarettes or "vaping." That proportion is significantly lower than the number who tried conventional cigarettes: Around two-thirds had smoked cigarettes at least once. The study team found that 5 percent of participants used e-cigarettes on more than five of the past 30 days .
The researchers noted a significant decline in daily e-cigarette use among teenagers between 2014 and 2017: While about 1.6 percent reported using them daily in 2014, that number dropped to less than half of one percent by 2017 . The research team did not find a clear pattern for how gender or ethnicity impacted e-cigarette use among teenagers .
The study results were published recently in the journal Pediatrics . Researcher Dr. Jing Liu said, "Our data suggest that fewer and fewer adolescents are using e-cigarettes on a daily basis." She continued, "We hope that these findings will help guide policy decisions to promote healthy development among teenagers."
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, over 30 million adults currently use e-cigarettes . The devices are designed to heat a solution that typically contains nicotine and other chemicals into an inhalable vapor . Users can choose from a wide variety of flavors for the vapor, including fruits and mint.
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised against using e-cigarettes among youths. The organizations have argued that such devices could lead to addiction in young people, who would then be more likely to use conventional cigarettes as adults .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse also warns of the potential dangers associated with e-cigarette use . It notes that while some vaping liquids contain harmless flavorings, others can include harmful substances like heavy metals and formaldehyde. The institute warns that some teenagers may believe they are using a safer product than regular cigarettes -- but the opposite is actually true in most cases .
The American Lung Association has also expressed concerns about e-cigarette use among youths, as well as their overall effects on human health . It warns that some vaping devices can create potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde and other harmful chemicals . The group maintains that the products are unregulated in many cases, putting users at risk for injury or illness.
The lung association suggests a number of steps to protect against e-cigarette use among youths: Keeping vaping devices out of reach, raising awareness about the risks associated with these products and supporting policies that restrict their advertising and availability .
The study team acknowledged some limitations to their research. For example, it's possible that teenagers may have been hesitant to share information about e-cigarette use if they were concerned about being punished by family members or authorities, the researchers said . Another limitation of the current study is that it relied on self-reported data from participants -- which means some teens might not be entirely honest with their answers. The research team plans to examine changes in e-cigarette use among adolescents over time using additional methods, including surveillance and clinical data .
According to Liu, "Further investigations are needed to better understand the reasons why some youths adopt e-cigarettes as a daily habit while others don't."
