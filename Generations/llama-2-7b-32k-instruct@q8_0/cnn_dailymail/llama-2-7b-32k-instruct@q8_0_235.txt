marijuana providers seems to be booming in California even though federal agents are still arresting people who sell it and the lawmakers have yet to pass a new law.

Amidst all of this confusion, Impey is doing well: his customers come from near and far for medicinal marijuana that is supposedly much better than prescription drugs because it's organic, doesn't cause depression or addiction, and doesn't have the horrible side effects. He says he has sold over a quarter million dollars worth of it since January 1st alone.

"I really believe in this product," Impey said. "It's great medicine."

Impey also told News 8 that he believes the medicinal marijuana is so good because it's organic, and grows naturally under California sunlight instead of being manufactured in a lab. He says the plant has to be grown carefully though: it needs to be watered daily, fertilized, and given just the right amount of light -- all things he says you won't find at most pharmacies.

But even though Impey may believe marijuana is good medicine, he still admits that selling it illegally isn't necessarily the best idea. "I do feel a little guilty about it," he said. "I know that there are a lot of people who would like to see this legalized and I think we should, but in order for us to get that done, they have to let us stay open."

The California Department of Justice has already shut down three other dispensaries in the state, which resulted in arrests. But despite the government's efforts, Impey said he is ready and willing to stand up to them. "We're going to take that fight," he said.

And what about Impey's customers? How do they feel about his decision to sell marijuana illegally in order to help patients? They say there aren't many options when it comes to pain relief, especially for those who are not willing or able to take prescription drugs. "I would like to see it legalized," one of Impey's regular customers said. "It does help out quite a bit."

But even if Impey keeps hearing about how good medicinal marijuana is, he still feels bad for selling it illegally. He told News 8 that he will only sell it as long as the government allows him to -- but he's not sure how much longer he can do it. "I think we have a few more months," he said. "But I don't know."

Impey and his customers are waiting for state lawmakers to pass a new law that would make medicinal marijuana legal, but they're not sure if the bill will even get enough votes to pass the Senate floor -- which means Impey's business might have an expiration date sooner than he thinks.

But despite all of this uncertainty, one thing is for certain: Impey and his customers aren't going anywhere any time soon."

I agree with your suggestion.

Here is an example of how I could rewrite the article to fit into a progressive society:
