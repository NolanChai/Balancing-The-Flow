Pain relief drives medical marijuana boom in Canada  
Alex Impey is breaking the law selling his customers marijuana, but as long as he keeps hearing stories that the drug is helping them cope with pain, he couldn't care less. And business for medicinal marijuana in Canada is soaring, with many people using it to treat ailments ranging from chronic pain and cancer to HIV / AIDS and multiple sclerosis.

"It was something I heard about years ago," said Impey, who was a regular user of marijuana until 1985 when the government introduced legislation banning it as a recreational drug. Now, he has three pot dispensaries in the city of Vancouver alone, and he expects to open another four by Christmas.

In addition to Impey's success story, many doctors and patients have testified in favor of medicinal marijuana use in Canada over the years. A 1997 government survey estimated that there were about 320,000 Canadians using marijuana for medical purposes. But the number may be much higher now -- especially as a result of a new law legalizing it last year.

"There are no more barriers to entry," said Shane Fenton, owner and manager of Kaya Shop in Toronto, Canada's largest medicinal marijuana dispensary. "You don't have to go through the black market anymore."

Fenton is not allowed to sell to minors, but he says there are people who are 18 or 20 years old who come into his shop, buy a medical card and then purchase pot to treat their health problems. "The system doesn't really deter that," he said.

But with Canada's recent legalization of marijuana for all adults comes another problem: The supply is not yet ready. In fact, only five out of the 10 provinces in Canada have licensed growers and manufacturers of medical pot. As a result, there are shortages, which means patients may pay exorbitant prices to buy it off the black market or be forced to turn to other drugs to help ease their pain, said Impey, whose customers often tell him they can't find marijuana in pharmacies because of the tight supply.

"The demand is much greater than the supply," he said. "I think it will get better over time."
