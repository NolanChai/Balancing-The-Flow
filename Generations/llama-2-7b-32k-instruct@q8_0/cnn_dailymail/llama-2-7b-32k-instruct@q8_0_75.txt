When she was 15 weeks pregnant with her fifth child, Clare Van Santen was told she had breast cancer. 'I was pregnant with Elijah when I found out that I had breast cancer, so it was a bit scary wondered if the chemotherapy would have any effect on my unborn baby,' Van Santen says in an interview with TODAY Parents
The chances of survival from breast cancer were 80 percent after her diagnosis. However, when Van Santen had surgery to remove the tumor and lymph nodes under her arm, she was shocked to discover that she also has metastatic breast cancer. She'd never heard about this type of cancer before

When she was 15 weeks pregnant, Clare Van Santen found out she had Stage IIa breast cancer and that the chances of survival were 80 percent after surgery to remove the tumor. But just one week later, doctors found something more terrifying: metastatic breast cancer
But when Van Santen had surgery in June at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, they discovered that she also has Stage IIIb metastatic breast cancer after finding tumors under her left arm that have spread to 12 lymph nodes. The doctor who delivered the news told her she would not survive this type of disease
"I was in shock," Van Santen says. "We thought we had a plan, but then they came back and said it's metastatic."
She also didn't know how chemotherapy would affect her unborn child, which she'd just found out about at the beginning of the pregnancy
"I was scared for the baby because I didn't know what to expect from the treatment," Van Santen says. "I was afraid that it wasn't going to be safe."
Fortunately, doctors said she could still have a healthy baby and would only need an epidural injection when giving birth in October â€” the same type of shot given to patients after cancer surgery.
"I was terrified," Van Santen says of finding out about her diagnosis. "I didn't know if I would be able to have my baby at all."

In an interview with TODAY Parents, she talked about how scary it was when the doctor gave her the news . She didn't know what to expect during pregnancy because of breast cancer and if treatment would affect her baby
"I knew that I had to make some decisions," Van Santen says. "The doctor told me that we have a choice: We can terminate the pregnancy, or we can go forward with the chemotherapy, which is extremely risky."
She decided to keep the baby after meeting with her oncologist and learning about his expertise in treating pregnant women
"I was really nervous," she says. "I talked it over with my husband, and he was supportive of whatever I needed to do."

Van Santen didn't tell anyone about her pregnancy or cancer diagnosis until a few months ago, when she began sharing her story on Instagram to help other women who may be facing similar situations.
"I figured that I needed to share my story with people and give them hope," she says. "It's been a pretty awesome experience."
She has already received messages from several women saying they are dealing with the same situation or know someone who is
"So many people have reached out, and it's just been amazing how many people I've talked to that are going through similar experiences," she says. "I'm happy that I can help them."

Van Santen has been sharing her journey with others on social media since she was diagnosed in June. She posts about her chemo treatments, doctors' visits, blood tests, ultrasounds and mammograms, along with updates about how she and the baby are doing . Her story has also been shared by several news organizations
"I'm just trying to raise awareness for metastatic breast cancer," Van Santen says. "People need to know what it is because most people don't."
She hopes her story helps other women facing a similar situation feel less scared and more empowered
"Having hope that everything will work out OK has been huge," she adds. "I have hope for the future, even though there are many things to worry about . I know God is in control of my life."

Van Santen will begin chemotherapy on Oct. 15 and hopes the treatment will work to shrink or eliminate any remaining cancer cells in her body so she can deliver a healthy baby . She also wants others who are facing similar situations to know there is hope for them, too
"I'm scared to death," Van Santen says of chemotherapy. "But I have hope that it will work."
Her message for other women? "Don't give up."
"You can go through this," she says. "You can beat cancer and still have a healthy baby."
