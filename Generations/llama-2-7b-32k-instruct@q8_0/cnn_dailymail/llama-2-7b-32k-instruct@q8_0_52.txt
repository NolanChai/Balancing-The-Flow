The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the government agency that was tasked with assessing the impact of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on marine ecosystems, coastal economies and human health . The assessment began almost immediately after the rig sank into the depths of the ocean floor.

But it wasn't until January when NOAA released its initial findings. Its scientists found that the oil spill killed millions of birds, fishes, marine mammals and other creatures; corroded shorelines from Texas to Alabama; damaged wetlands; hurt tourism; and polluted wetland vegetation .

Now, NOAA's scientists have published a new assessment that looks at how the spill has affected ocean circulation patterns -- a crucial part of marine ecosystems -- over an extended period of time . They found that the oil spill spread in all directions, not just from Louisiana to Florida like many had expected.

"This report shows us that even though we're five years out from this disaster, there are still ways that it's having an impact," says Dr. Melissa Pistoll of NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration . "We can see the changes in how water is circulating around the Gulf today."

Here's a closer look at some of the main findings from this new assessment:The oil slick spread throughout much of the Gulf of Mexico, affecting all five of its subtropical gyres . Scientists have known that these gyres -- massive rotating currents with widths ranging from 50 to hundreds of miles -- play a key role in redistributing nutrients and pollution around the gulf. The oil slick spread within each one of them, causing changes in water circulation patterns .

The impacts were more significant near the surface than deeper waters . This suggests that the oil spill has had a direct effect on fish stocks and marine mammals . While most of the oil washed up on beaches or disappeared as it broke down into microscopic droplets, the slick's long-term effects remain uncertain."We don't know whether the water in this region is going to return back to its pre-spill conditions," Pistoll says ."

The oil spill led to a "patchy recovery" of seafood populations . Scientists documented an initial decline for several fish species, including redfish, red snapper and speckled trout. These species have not yet recovered significantly in certain areas."There are still some areas with patchy recovery of seafood populations," Pistoll says . "And we know there are other areas that will continue to be affected."

The spill created a "hot spot" where it spread, which is still visible today. Scientists have found an unusually large accumulation of oil in the area known as the "dead zone" -- a 1,000-square mile patch of ocean water with little or no oxygen that kills fish and marine mammals."There are indications that we might see similar hot spots where other parts of the oil slick accumulated," says Pistoll .

The assessment is part of a series of reports to be published over the next five years . The first one will focus on the short-term impacts from 2010."We know that there are still some short-term effects, and we're looking at those right now," Pistoll says. "There might have been long-term ecological changes as a result of this oil spill ."

Pistoll notes that it's critical to keep monitoring the Gulf in years and decades to come."This is not something we can study and say 'OK, here are the effects and let's go on about our business,' " Pistoll says . "We need to continue to monitor these impacts so we can understand them better."

(CNN) -- Five years after a massive oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, scientists are just now getting a better picture of what happened to marine life during the incident . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is tasked with monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts from the BP disaster, and has released several reports since 2013 that detail its findings."

It's been a tough road for marine life in the Gulf of Mexico since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion . Many experts believe the spill may have killed millions of fishes, birds and other sea creatures -- though a final assessment is still pending from federal officials."

We're looking at millions and millions of gallons of crude oil that sank to the bottom," says David Whitehead, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . "So it was a very different animal than you'd see if this were a surface spill in open water."

NOAA reports are based on years of work from hundreds of scientists across the country who used some of the most sophisticated equipment available to measure the impacts of oil on marine life . Whitehead says it will take another two or three years before NOAA can present a final report, which will be published in 2016."
