out for the two Australians who will face death by firing squad in Indonesia tomorrow, after losing their final appeals against the sentence at the highest level in the world's most populous Muslim nation. The two were sentenced to death by firing squad for smuggling heroin into Bali and are among 10 people set to be executed over a six-week period. Chan was convicted of leading the drugs ring, while Sukumaran was found guilty as an accomplice. They have been in prison since their arrest in October 2005 after being arrested with seven other Australians at Bali airport. The pair were initially sentenced to death by firing squad but their sentences were overturned and they instead given life imprisonment - which would have seen them released in nine years time. They appealed against the sentence on the basis that Indonesian law does not allow for a life sentence to be imposed for drug offences, a claim dismissed at the appeal court. The pair then lodged a final appeal with the President but it was rejected earlier this week, meaning there is nothing to stop them being executed tomorrow.

Chan and Sukumaran are both devout Christians and their families have spoken of their heartbreak over the death sentences that were handed down in 2006. Their parents flew to Indonesia to witness the executions but the pair were denied a last minute meeting before they faced the firing squad, which will be carried out at dawn tomorrow morning. It is understood they have been given a chance to meet with family members for the last time today but it was not known if this would happen as it had yet to take place. The Australian government has repeatedly pressed Indonesia to grant clemency to the pair and their families, who were also in Jakarta at the weekend to be close to their loved ones in case of a miracle reprieve that never came. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Friday night the executions would damage relations between Canberra and Jakarta, while Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia was doing everything it could to prevent the pair being put before the firing squad. "We are working very hard with Indonesian authorities to ensure they do not go ahead," Ms Bishop told ABC television on Friday evening. The men have been held in isolation since their arrest and are only allowed two visitors each a month, who are also monitored by guards for any contraband material. Australian law prevents the government from intervening directly with foreign governments over the death sentences of its citizens and Ms Bishop said they had to work within Indonesia's legal system, which she believed did not have provisions for life imprisonment as a punishment for drug offences . "We are doing everything we can," she said. A statement from Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs on Friday said the executions would be deeply distressing and were inhumane and cruel. They urged Indonesia to grant clemency to Chan and Sukumaran, saying their death sentences violated international law. "In line with our policy, we will not provide details about the process or conditions of the executions," it said . Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin has revealed how his officers are planning for Chan's and Sukumaran's last hours as they prepare to be executed . In a press conference earlier this week he explained that federal agents had been working with Indonesia's National Narcotics Agency since the pair were arrested in 2005. "We have had access to them, we have met them and we have had discussions about their welfare and what they can expect," Mr Colvin said . The men's lawyers also attended a meeting with federal agents where they discussed plans for how the execution would be carried out in an effort to prevent any mistreatment of Chan and Sukumaran, who are facing death by firing squad after being convicted of drug trafficking. Mr Colvin said the Australian Federal Police had been told about the process but that it was not possible for them to intervene directly because of the legal system in Indonesia.

Chan's mother Carol and Sukumaran's father Suryadi also gave emotional testimony when they appeared on camera this week ahead of the executions . Carol Chan broke down as she told how her son had been taken away from his family, while Ms Suryadi said Sukumarran was a victim of circumstance who had been "taken advantage of" and urged the Indonesian Government not to execute him.

The Indonesian Attorney General HM Prasetyo defended the pair's executions on Thursday, saying Australia is one of 67 countries that use the death penalty. The government has also been accused of trying to score political points off the executions after Mr Abbott told Parliament earlier this week that his "relationship with Indonesia would never be the same" as a result of them .

A statement from Chan and Sukumaran's families released on Wednesday night said the pair had been denied their final appeals to the President and Supreme Court of Indonesia, which meant the executions were imminent. "This has been an extremely difficult time for all our family members but they are being strong," it read .

"We ask you to join us in praying that there will be a miracle that will bring Andrew and Myuran home." The statement also said: "Thank you to the Australian Government, Embassy staff and all those who have been supporting our family throughout this time".

Sukumaran's mother Suryadi was allowed to visit her son for two hours on Friday and said he had looked healthy . She said it was up to God whether her son would be executed but that she wanted him to return home safely. "I am proud of my son because we always believe in God, so we will let what's best for Andrew," she told reporters .

Sukumaran and Chan had been jailed since their arrest at Bali airport in 2005 . The two men were arrested as part of Operation Ouija, which saw the arrest of nine Australians on drugs charges after authorities allegedly uncovered a large quantity of heroin being smuggled into Indonesia. The eight other Australians charged over Operation Ouija were all sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006 and served between five and twelve years before returning home in 2013 . Myuran Sukumaran was pictured with the heroin haul of almost 8 kilogrammes seized from him. It is understood that at least three other people linked to Operation Ouija had been executed in Indonesia, including one who died after being shot by police during a failed escape attempt .

In September last year it was revealed Chan and Sukumaran were offered the chance to plead guilty to drug trafficking charges in exchange for 20 years jail, which they refused . They had also been denied their final appeal because Indonesian law does not allow life sentences to be handed out for drug offences . Myuran Sukumarran has been pictured with a tattoo of a cross on his chest.

The pair's execution is likely to spark outrage from the Australian public and international human rights organisations, which have long campaigned against their sentences . The United Nations had earlier this week condemned the death sentences as "cruel and inhumane", while Amnesty International said it was a "grave violation" of their human rights to execute two men who were "convicted solely for drug offences".

Human rights organisation Reprieve said that if Indonesia goes ahead with the executions, Australia would be justified in taking diplomatic action against the country.

"The Australian government has a right to seek assurances from Jakarta that it will not execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran," said Reprieve's Director Clare Algar .

"If these assurances are not forthcoming, Australia should consider what diplomatic measures can be taken."

Reprieve had also obtained a letter sent by the Australian government to Indonesia in March 2014 asking for the two men to be given life sentences if they were convicted .

Chan and Sukumaran's families are now preparing themselves for the devastating news that their loved ones have been executed, with Andrew Chan's father Ray saying he was praying for a miracle.

"I'm very hopeful of a miracle," he told AAP . "But if it doesn't happen I've accepted it."

The Australian Government has previously refused to intervene directly in the death sentences and has only asked Indonesia to grant clemency . The government has not made any comment on whether or not they will seek diplomatic action against Indonesia.

A statement released by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin earlier this week said he had met with Chan and Sukumaran's legal representatives in Bali to ensure their welfare was taken care of ahead of the execution .

"We are working very hard with Indonesian authorities to ensure they do not go ahead," Ms Bishop told ABC television on Friday evening. "We have a policy that we will not provide details about the process or conditions of the executions."

Indonesia's Attorney General HM Prasetyo defended the death sentences for Chan and Sukumaran earlier this week, saying Australia is one of
