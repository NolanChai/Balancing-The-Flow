Alex Bowen and Sophie Monk have been married since 2013, but their road to matrimony wasn't smooth sailing. The Married at First Sight stars had a rocky start from day one when Alex admitted he was worried about being attracted to his bride after meeting her at the altar for the first time and seeing that she had "big teeth," "big hands" and "big feet." He even tried to leave Sophie at the altar, but the pair were eventually able to turn things around. Now, it seems Alex's concerns have been confirmed, as he revealed on his podcast that Sophie did in fact have a crush on him before they got married.
