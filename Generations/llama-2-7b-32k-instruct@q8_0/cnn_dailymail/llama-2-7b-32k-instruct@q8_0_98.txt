Reigning English Premier League champion Manchester City is reportedly planning to bid £ 105 million ($143.9 million) for Raheem Sterling, who plays for Liverpool. According to The Mirror, the transfer window will reopen in England on January 2nd and this could be the time when Sterling leaves his current club. Manchester City has been linked with a move for Sterling before but it never materialized. However, the reigning English league champions seem eager to make the bid for the forward.

Raheem Sterling has played in England’s top flight since 2012 when he signed for Liverpool from Queens Park Rangers, and he is one of the team's most important players at Anfield. He made his senior debut for Liverpool against Exeter City in August 2011 and went on to make over 100 appearances for them.

Raheem Sterling has scored 18 goals in 69 appearances for Liverpool, but the Reds have been interested in selling him due to his contract situation. The 27-year-old is out of contract at Anfield next season and Liverpool are not keen on offering him a new deal. This could be a good time for Sterling to leave.

Manchester City has shown interest in Sterling before but the transfer did not materialize due to various reasons. However, with the transfer window reopening, it seems that Pep Guardiola wants to strengthen his squad further. Manchester City currently sits atop of the Premier League table and they will look to build on their success from last season.

Raheem Sterling would be a good addition to Manchester City's team as he is a versatile forward who can play in various positions. He has scored 31 goals in his senior career for Liverpool, which makes him an attractive option for any club looking to bolster their attack.

Manchester City are planning to table a mega-bid for Raheem Sterling on the day the transfer window reopens. The reigning Barclays Premier League champions have made the Liverpool forward a primary target and they will look to make a move for him in January. It remains to be seen whether the deal materializes but Manchester City seems eager to make a move for the talented forward.

Overall, Raheem Sterling is an exciting prospect for any club looking to strengthen their attack. Manchester City has shown interest in him before and it will be interesting to see if they can finally lure him away from Anfield. With his contract situation at Liverpool and his desire to win trophies, a move to the Etihad Stadium could make sense for the forward.

The transfer window reopening gives Manchester City the chance to strengthen their team further and Raheem Sterling could be a key target in this pursuit. With Pep Guardiola's side looking strong in the Premier League, it seems that they are ready to take on all challengers as they aim for more silverware.
