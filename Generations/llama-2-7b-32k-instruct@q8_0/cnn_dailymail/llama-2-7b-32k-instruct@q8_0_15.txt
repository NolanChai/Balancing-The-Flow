Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero was among those who questioned why they would be playing in darkness as part of the 15,000th Premier League match, while Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe described the idea as "ridiculous". But now it is confirmed that the game will start at 16:30 BST with floodlights switched on for the first time in England and Wales.

"We've had a lot of meetings with stakeholders, including clubs," said Premier League managing director Bill Bush. "It was really important that we got this right because it is something new." The Football Association has also given permission to use floodlights for the first time in England and Wales on Sunday . It will be the 15,000th game of the top tier since its creation in 1992.

United have played in darkness before when they faced a number of teams including their cross-city rivals at Old Trafford in recent seasons but now all matches will be played under floodlights.

Bush added: "We've had some good conversations with the PFA and LMA [Leadership Team] - it was important that we got a positive outcome."

The Premier League has confirmed that 40 of its 20 clubs will be involved in a test match at Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Wednesday, starting at 17:30 BST.

Rangers and Hibernian are due to face off at the same venue at 19:15 BST. The Premier League has said that matches involving its bottom two clubs will be switched from their traditional kick-off times of 14:00 GMT/BST to 13:30.

Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur defender Jan Vertonghen insists the "stars have aligned" for his club after a season that has seen them sign one of Europe's most exciting prospects in Giovani Lo Celso and appoint Nuno Espirito Santo as head coach.

The Portuguese was only appointed last month but has quickly impressed at White Hart Lane, where he led Wolves to their first ever promotion to the Premier League."

"It happened very quickly," Vertonghen told Sky Sports News . "He came in and changed our mentality from a team that was maybe defensively solid - we still are but now offensive too - which is fantastic. The way he works, how he prepares us every single day has been brilliant."

"We've signed one of the top players in Europe," Vertonghen added . "He fits perfectly into our squad and will be a big help to all the players that are here already." Lo Celso had been heavily linked with Tottenham Hotspur in recent weeks, despite having two years remaining on his contract at Sporting.

But he completed his move to North London on Tuesday for around Â£45m - and after making his first appearance against Manchester United in a pre-season friendly, he has been speaking about the positive impact that Nuno's arrival has had.

"I am happy with everything," Lo Celso said . "He is a manager who knows how to work and I like it because he gets us involved, gets everyone talking."

Meanwhile, Tottenham have confirmed that they will be holding the first pre-season match of Nuno's reign against Mladost in Croatia on Saturday."

"I am sure you will hear more about our plans for the coming season," said chairman Daniel Levy . "Nuno has his own ideas and we are excited to see them play out over time." Spurs also face Wolfsberger AC at their Austrian training camp, as well as a second match against Mladost, before returning home on 1 August.

Spurs have been in talks with Levy about extending Nuno's contract and it is understood that the Portuguese will be staying for "two or three years". He was speaking to Portuguese TV station TVI before Spurs confirmed his appointment."

"It was an opportunity I had not expected, but one which I grabbed," he said . "With a lot of ambition. With a lot of optimism about this project and what we can achieve together in the future." Nuno added that the challenge of working with the likes of Harry Kane and Toby Alderweireld - who both have two years remaining on their current contracts at White Hart Lane - will be one of his biggest challenges.

"The players are ready," he said . "We just need to find the right way, find the right balance for everything because they deserve the best." Nuno also confirmed that Spurs' players will return to pre-season training in mid-July and there will be no more friendly matches until then.

"The important thing is that we work with all the squad," he added . "And we know how big Tottenham Hotspur is, how important it is for football and for the fans.""

"Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy has confirmed to Sky Sports News that the club will be holding the first pre-season match of Nuno's reign against Mladost in Croatia on Saturday. He also revealed that Spurs have been in talks with Levy about extending his contract and it is understood that he will stay at the club for "two or three years".

"We are delighted to welcome Nuno Espirito Santo as manager of Tottenham Hotspur," Levy said . "Nuno has already shown an ability to get the best out of his players, both on and off the pitch, and we believe he will be a great fit for our Club."

"Tottenham have signed one of the top players in Europe," he added."

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has called for greater flexibility when it comes to the length of contracts given to players . The 47-year-old said that the Premier League could benefit from giving more freedom to managers to get rid of players they do not want as easily as they currently can."

"I think if a manager is good, he has the possibility to decide when he wants to sign a player or sell him," Guardiola added . "For example, we have Alexis Sanchez now - that's our decision. He decided it was better to come here than stay at Arsenal."

"I am so happy because I don't know how many years I can manage in my career but the most important thing is to be good when you are young . If we have a good manager, he has the power to do whatever he wants." Guardiola also said that players should not feel they have no other options if they are unhappy at their club - and added that there needs to be more freedom in contracts for managers."

"In my opinion it's better to extend the contract of a manager who is good and has his own idea than keep him one year because the player wants," Guardiola told Sky Sports News . "In the future I'm going to have 28 players and if we are in the table, that means they were all good."

"The problem now is that if you want to sell a player it's so complicated but why should it be complicated? The manager knows he needs him - what happens with him? What is his life? You have to know everything about them - where they are going and what they are doing."

"The managers of the clubs need to understand better their players, you must know all the stories," he continued . "So if I want to sell a player tomorrow because I don't like him or another one comes, then it's not a problem - that's my life and the manager's life."

Guardiola also said that players should be given more power in contract negotiations . "The players have more and more money than they ever had but sometimes when you want to sell them, why? Why can't I decide?" he asked."

"We are a club and the manager has to do what is best for the club," Guardiola added . "When it's good for both sides, it's always better than if you don't have this power because sometimes clubs think they can sell them when they want. I understand why but we must know their lives, know their stories."

"It's not just the club that wants to sell a player," he added . "The manager has to say: 'No it's not good for us and if you don't have this power then you are going to lose him.'"

Guardiola also said that the length of contracts given to players was "a bit crazy" but also believes there is no right or wrong answer."

"We all know what happens when we sign a player and he doesn't do well," Guardiola added . "That happens. When I arrive at Manchester City, Raheem Sterling played 30 games in the Premier League, scored eight goals and assisted five - that's not good enough."

"I want to decide if it is good for me or not but sometimes you can't decide," he said . "The club wants to sell him because they want to buy another player. What about us? That's why we have the problem with the length of contracts."
