Manchester United host Manchester City on Sunday at 4:30pm (2230 AEDT), the latest time in English Premier League history that a derby between the two teams has been played. Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off, with plenty at stake for both sides as United and City challenge for a top four finish.
