Inside the experiment waking up dementia patients with movie scenes from their past (New York Daily News) 

A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care facility will give them a boost and allow them to have a conversation with their family members through an app on their smartphone or tablet.

"It's like having your own personal movie channel," said Dr. Mitchell Moss, director of the New York University Langone Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Center at NYU Langone Health, who created the program with his wife, Marla. "We are giving them back their lives."

Dr. Moss began working on the program four years ago while he was doing research on a drug for Alzheimer's disease. He asked patients in a clinical trial to watch videos of their childhood memories and found that it improved their cognitive functioning, according to The Times of Israel.

"It's just amazing," said Dr. Moss, who has also shown the videos to people with other forms of dementia such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. "They remember these scenes very well."

The videos are made by taking still images from old home movies, wedding photos or personal snapshots and placing them in a slide show that is then recorded into short film clips. The patients can also record their own messages for the video, which they can then watch on an app called Vividly.

Dr. Moss has used this program with over 100 patients at his clinic, but it's only available to those who have smartphones or tablets. He is currently working on a way to make it accessible to people without those devices.

"This will be the most important thing that I will ever do in my career," said Dr. Moss. "It could potentially change the world."

The program has received support from many celebrities including director Steven Spielberg, who has been working on a project called AI4ALZ to use artificial intelligence to help people with Alzheimer's disease. He has also donated $100,000 to Dr. Moss's research.

"It's amazing that we have someone like Steven Spielberg who is supporting us," said Dr. Moss. "It shows how far this technology can go."

The program is currently being used at the NYU Langone Health facility in New York, but Dr. Moss hopes to expand it to other care facilities across the country and even internationally.

"This is something that we all can benefit from," said Dr. Moss. "It's not just for people with dementia, but for anyone who wants to keep their memory sharp."

The program has been praised by many experts in the field of Alzheimer's disease research and care.

"Dr. Moss is onto something here," said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Center for Memory Health at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. "This technology has the potential to change the way we approach dementia care."

Dr. Moss's work is a prime example of how technology can be used in innovative ways to help people with Alzheimer's disease. It shows that even though we may forget, our memories are still there, and with the right tools, we can bring them back to life.
