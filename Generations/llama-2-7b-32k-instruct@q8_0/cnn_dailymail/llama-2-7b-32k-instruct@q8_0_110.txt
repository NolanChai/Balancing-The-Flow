ortion in space time called a 'supernova remnant' which was first observed 30 years ago.

What is the name of this supernova remnant? (Please write in English and don't use any special characters) [/INST]

The Crab Nebula, also known as the Crab Supernova Remnant or simply as the Crab, is a supernova remnant located approximately 6,500 light years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Taurus . It was formed by the remnants of the supernova explosion seen on the Earth in 1054. The Crab Nebula was discovered by John Flamsteed using a telescope built by Thomas Busby at Greenwich in 1654.

The remnant is an expanding bubble inflated by the light and radiation of a central pulsar, PSR B1951+32. This neutron star, which spins about 30 times per second, has been the focus of more than four decades of observations that have provided fundamental information about rotating neutron stars. The Crab is one of the best studied sources in all of astronomy .

The supernova remnant was first seen with a telescope by French astronomer Charles Messier on January 1, 1758. It appears as part of a larger swath of stars and nebulosity in his catalogue known as the "Southern Fish". He also saw it as part of a larger object that he labeled M46 .

The Crab Nebula was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2017 using its WFPC2 instrument. The image shows an array of knots and filaments that reveal the turbulent motion of gas swirling around the central neutron star . These structures have been sculpted by powerful shock waves created as the expanding gas collides with itself, as well as by magnetic fields and radiation pressure .

The Crab Nebula has been extensively observed and studied over the years. In 1968, a team led by Jocelyn Bell Burnell used the VERA telescope at Cambridge to image the nebula in unprecedented detail, revealing a wealth of intricate structures that hinted at the turbulent history of the Crab's central engine.

In 2001, a team led by Lennart Lindegren used the Hubble Space Telescope to image the Crab Nebula in ultraviolet light, revealing previously unknown features such as a pair of giant pillars that tower above the central pulsar and are illuminated by high-energy radiation from its intense magnetic field.

The Crab Nebula has also been the subject of numerous studies using various techniques, including X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves. These studies have provided valuable insights into the physics and structure of supernova remnants and the central pulsar that powers them.

Overall, the Crab Nebula is a remarkable object that has been extensively studied for centuries. Its many observations and studies have shed light on the workings of neutron stars, supernovae, and the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. It remains a beloved target for astronomers and a source of wonder and inspiration for people around the world.

Charles Messier (1631--1712) was a French astronomer who is best known for compiling a list of 110 astronomical objects, many of which are galaxies and star clusters. He was born in Amiens, Picardy and started his career as an assistant to the astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle at the Paris Observatory.

Messier's list was created between 1758 and 1764 when he was tasked with identifying and cataloging objects that were mistaken for comets, which were a common threat to navigation during that time. The list included all of the known galaxies, star clusters, and nebulosity in the night sky at the time, including the Crab Nebula (M1).

Messier's list is an important milestone in the history of astronomy as it provides a comprehensive catalogue of objects that can be used to identify and study various celestial phenomena. It also helped to dispel the notion that comets were the only objects visible in the night sky, paving the way for the discovery of other fascinating celestial bodies.

The Crab Nebula (M1) is one of the most studied astronomical objects in existence and has been observed by many famous astronomers over the years, including Charles Messier himself. The object was first seen with a telescope on January 1, 1758, as part of a larger swath of stars and nebulosity known as the Southern Fish (M46).
