20-page complaint against Vergara alleging that she refused to let him use the eggs and is trying to hide them from him, according to the New York Post. The 'Modern Family' actress was pregnant with his child when they broke up in January but Loeb claims her lawyers helped her cancel her fertility appointments before the split . In the documents obtained by Page Six, Vergara is accused of trying to get back at him after the breakup by refusing to let him have the eggs. She also allegedly filed a motion asking that he not be allowed access to her medical records for any reason - even though they would have included information about the frozen embryos . Loeb and Vergara met in 2013 and got engaged two years later but split in January when he found out she was having an affair with another man. According to the documents, Loeb claims that after the split his lawyers emailed her lawyers to get him access to information about their frozen eggs but she declined . Vergara's attorney did not respond to requests for comment from Page Six.

A lawyer who has represented Sofia Vergara and Nick Loeb in their legal fight over their frozen embryos says that the complaint filed by Loeb is "baseless" and an effort on his part to make Vergara "appear like she is unfit for motherhood." The attorney, Carla Minet, made the comments after Loeb's complaint was obtained by the New York Post . Loeb claims that Sofia Vergara hid the eggs from him when they split up in January but a lawyer for Vergara said that he never tried to contact her about it and had no knowledge of any eggs being frozen until much later on, after he broke things off with her. The New York Post article claimed that Loeb was seeking access to the medical records related to Vergara's fertility treatments in order to find out where the frozen embryos were stored . But Minet said that is not what is going on here and Loeb is just trying to make Vergara look bad. "This complaint is baseless," she said, according to People Magazine ."It's clearly an effort by Mr. Loeb to portray Sofia as unfit for motherhood." She also added that he has no legitimate reason to be able to access her medical records."
