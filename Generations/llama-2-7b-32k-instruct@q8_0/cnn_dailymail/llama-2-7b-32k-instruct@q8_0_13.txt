in his flats.
The materials included a pressure cooker, nails, a hand drill, screwdriver, gas canisters and chemicals such as acetone, sodium peroxide and nitric acid. He was found guilty of "possessing articles for terrorism purposes". Police had been tipped off after his mobile phone and internet usage were monitored by officers investigating a series of violent protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2020. Mr Al-Khori denied the charges but was convicted at Luton Crown Court on 15 October and jailed for six years. He is the first person to be prosecuted under a law brought in last year that gave police greater powers of surveillance. The new laws were introduced after the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017 where 22 people were killed and hundreds more injured at a Ariana Grande concert . Mr Al-Khori was not charged with offences relating to violent protests or terrorism, but had been subject to restrictions for several years under counter-terror laws. He has now lost his passport as well.
Detective Chief Inspector Mark Luton said: "Although there is no evidence that Dr Al-Khori was involved in planning any terrorist act or violent protests, it is clear to me that he possessed the knowledge and means to construct improvised explosive devices." A spokesperson for Counter Terrorism Policing North East said: "We will continue to monitor communications and activity of people like Dr Al-Khori so we can prevent harm. He was convicted of possessing articles for terrorism purposes in 2014, 2018 and now 2022."

He was found guilty of "possessing articles for terrorism purposes" on 15 October at Luton Crown Court. Mr Al-Khori denied the charges but was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.

Faris Al-Khori's lawyer described him as a "good man who fell foul of the law" and said he plans to appeal the sentence. The conviction has sparked concerns about the use of new laws and surveillance powers in the UK. Critics argue that it may lead to more innocent people being targeted and prosecuted for terrorism-related offences.
The case highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in preventing terrorism, while also ensuring that fundamental rights and freedoms are protected. As the government continues to strengthen counterterrorism laws and powers, it's important that there is a balance between protecting the public and respecting individual liberties.
