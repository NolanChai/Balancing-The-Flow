A former Syrian doctor has been jailed for seven years after being found in possession of chemicals linked to making homemade bombs at his home in London, UK.
Faris Al-Khori was also caught with instructions on how to make a pressure cooker bomb and had 15 litres (3.3 gallons) of petrol at his property, as well as other chemicals, in Edmonton, north London .
He pleaded guilty to 10 counts of having articles for terrorism purposes and one count of attempting to make a bomb.
Al-Khori's lawyers had tried to argue that the petrol was for use on his car but he had been found in possession of 13 litres more than he needed . The judge dismissed this as being "a sham excuse".
The doctor, who moved to the UK in 1968, was also a member of the now-banned Al-Muhajiroun group, which has been linked to terrorism. He had been arrested previously for breaching anti-terror laws when he was caught with materials including chemicals and a document on how to make improvised explosives .
The 62 - year - old was given an extended sentence of seven years in jail, plus four years on licence . Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: "You were not just found in possession of the articles but you had them for some considerable time and you knew what they could be used for."
Sentencing him, he also said Al-Khori's previous convictions showed "a clear intention to commit a terrorist act". The court heard that two of the litres of petrol were in his car and six were in a shed outside his home . He had bought 13 litres in one go but received an email from Asda confirming he only ordered eight.
The judge said this was "not the action of someone who made a mistake" and showed Al-Khori had been trying to keep his stock of explosive ingredients hidden . The court heard that another litre of petrol, which would have needed 10 times as much to make an effective bomb, had also been stored in his car but was found in the boot.
Al-Khori admitted he had documents about how to make improvised explosives on a laptop computer and printed out instructions on his printer . He was arrested at his home in June last year.
Det Supt Sharon Rowe, of Counter Terrorism Policing North East Command, said: "This case shows that the police have an effective investigatory strategy when it comes to tackling terrorist offences and preventing them from occurring."
She added that police will investigate all information they receive about suspicious behaviour.
Al-Khori was born in Aleppo and lived with his parents in Lebanon until 1970 . He studied medicine at the University of Aleppo, where he graduated in 1983 . His first job as a doctor was in 1994 and he has worked since then as an NHS general practitioner.
He had been a member of Al-Muhajiroun for more than 20 years but left the group last year, saying he wanted to "move on" after its members were linked to terrorism .
His defence lawyer Mark Ellison said that his client did not want to make any comment about the offences he had pleaded guilty to. He said Al-Khori was remorseful for the mistakes he had made in the past and said they should be seen as being "very small".
Al-Khori's neighbour, 26 - year - old student Nadia Najeeb, said she believed his arrest would not affect the community. She said: "There is no racial discrimination here or anything like that."
The court heard that Al-Khori was a family man who had been married for more than 30 years . He has two children and five grandchildren aged between seven months and six years old .
Although his lawyers had said there was no evidence he intended to make an explosive device, the judge said that it would have only taken "15 minutes" to construct a bomb with the chemicals Al-Khori possessed. The court heard he had been planning for two months and had printed out instructions on how to make improvised explosives .
Although the judge described his offences as being "not particularly serious", he added: "Given your previous convictions, there can be no doubt in my mind that you intended these articles to be used for terrorism purposes."
The court heard that Al-Khori was arrested after police searched his home and found chemicals including potassium nitrate, sulphuric acid, hydrogen peroxide and lithium batteries . The judge said he had also found two mobile phones which were linked to the mobile phone of Abdel-Majid Mahmoud Taylor, who was jailed for six years in 2016 after pleading guilty to preparing acts of terrorism.
He also admitted that police had searched his car and found a large bottle containing petrol inside it . The judge said the chemicals Al-Khori possessed were sufficient to make a bomb with "a very high death toll". He added: "I find this was a clear intention to commit a terrorist act."
The court heard that Al - Khori had been caught before for trying to leave the country and being in possession of materials linked to terrorism .
In 2014, he was arrested at Stansted Airport after attempting to board a flight to Jordan . He pleaded guilty to three offences including breaching an exclusion order by travelling abroad and possessing articles relating to terrorism. At the same time, police found he had two mobile phones with SIM cards linked to Taylor's number on them.
In 2015, he was arrested at Heathrow Airport after being stopped while trying to board a flight for Jordan . He pleaded guilty to breaching an exclusion order by travelling abroad and possessing articles relating to terrorism. Again police found chemicals linked to making explosives in his luggage .
He was given a total of 15 months in prison and ordered to be on the sex offenders register for five years.
In a statement, Al-Khori said he had "rejected violence" since the age of 20 after having been involved with anti-Assad groups as an activist . He added that it was "not appropriate or right" to blame him and his community for terrorism, saying: "I have done nothing wrong".
The statement said he had tried to move on from Al - Muhajiroun last year after its members were linked to terrorism in the UK. It also said he did not accept that being a member of an organisation was evidence of violent intentions and said he was trying to move on with his life .
It added: "I do not wish to make any comment about my conviction or imprisonment, nor will I be making any further comment."
The statement ended by saying: "I have always been a family man and have never had a criminal record". It also said he was working as a general practitioner with an NHS salary.
Al - Khori was one of the first Syrian doctors to move to the UK and in 1989 became a fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners . He is now the president of the Medical Defence Union, which represents more than 30,000 British doctors.
After his conviction for terrorism offences last year, he was removed from the NHS medical register and suspended as head of the union's ethics committee. In a statement at the time, the MDU said: "We are shocked by Dr Al - Khori's arrest on suspicion of breaching counter terror laws."
It added that it would be reviewing his conduct but insisted there was no suggestion he had been involved in any wrongdoing. The union also said at the time that Al-Khori "had not raised concerns about anyone or anything".
Although it is unclear what prompted the police to search his home, the judge heard that officers were made aware of his previous offences when they searched for Taylor's phone number . It was only then that officers found chemicals linked to making homemade bombs in Al - Khori's house.
The judge also said it was unclear how much of an influence Al-Khori had on the young man who owned the phone, but he added: "There is no doubt in my mind you were a member of the group and were in touch with the people involved in terrorism."
Al - Khori's arrest last year also came only days after two men from east London were arrested for trying to leave the country for Syria. One, 26 - year - old Aisha Khatib was jailed for three years and nine months at Kingston Crown Court in south west London . The other man is due to be sentenced next month.
Det Supt Rowe said: "We work closely with partners across the country to prevent terrorist related offences from occurring, including working closely with local authorities."
She added that officers also receive information about people who are suspected of terrorism offences and act upon it.
