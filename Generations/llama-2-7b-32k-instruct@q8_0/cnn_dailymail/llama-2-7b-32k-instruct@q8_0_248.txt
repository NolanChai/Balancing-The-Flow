Prehistory is a time that encompasses the study of pre-literate societies--that is, societies without a written history. These societies include hunter-gatherers and nomads as well as settled agricultural communities from around the world and throughout recorded human history . Although there are many ways to classify these cultures based on geographic or demographic factors, archaeologists often divide them into four broad categories: foraging, pastoralism, horticulture, and complex societies. The last of these is further divided into two periods - the first a time of hunter-gatherers and gatherers that gave rise to agricultural societies .

Prehistory includes the study of artifacts left behind by humans, such as tools, pottery, figurines, jewelry, ornaments, human remains, buildings, roads, bridges and other structures. Archaeology is a key source for understanding pre-literate cultures. In addition, anthropological linguistics and ethnohistory provide important sources of information on the evolution of cultural groups over time .

Prehistory covers the entire span of human history from the Paleolithic era to the Middle Ages; however, it is most often used to refer to the period before recorded history. It therefore excludes ancient Egyptian and Sumerian societies, as well as their respective written accounts, which have survived into the modern age . For example, a typical academic textbook may present prehistory as beginning with the end of the Pleistocene epoch--10,000 BCE--or even earlier. Some books, however, start at the beginning of recorded history (3200 BCE) to include the archaeological evidence for civilizations that left little material record such as those of the Minoan or Mycenaeans of ancient Crete and ancient Mycenae in Greece respectively .

A prehistoric culture is a human society or population which has left behind physical traces--such as tools, artifacts and structures--that permit archaeological investigation of its past. A number of scholars have attempted to identify the first prehistoric cultures; among those are: Çatalhöyük (7500 BCE), Jericho (9000 BCE), Tell Aswad (8600 BCE) and Göbekli Tepe (10,000 BCE).

Archaeologists believe that humans first evolved as hunter gatherers. They developed an understanding of the physical world through observation and experimentation, developing theories to explain what they observed; these were passed on through imitation. Over time humans learned new ways of doing things, such as hunting with spears or grinding grain using tools made from stone or bone . They also developed social hierarchies based upon skill sets that permitted the emergence of shamans, priests and kings who claimed a divine right to rule .

Many cultures were organized into villages and towns. These communities often grew around temples and shrines and sometimes traded with other nearby settlements or regions; for example, the great Incan city of Cuzco was built on an ancient religious site that had served as a center of ritual, trade and political power since at least 1200 CE . A village typically consisted of huts made from branches and mud. Sometimes villages grew into cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants .

Some pre-literate cultures were matrilineal; they passed inheritance through the female line only . In others, the head of state was often a tribal elder, who inherited his title because he was an accomplished hunter, warrior or shaman . Others had religious leaders with supernatural powers . Most of these societies practiced rituals to ensure that their community would always have access to food and other resources; they often developed elaborate religious ceremonies and rites to facilitate this process.

Agriculture is a human activity that began at least 8,000 years before the common era . The invention of agriculture was a pivotal moment in the history of human society because it allowed populations to become settled . Agricultural societies provided the foundation for the development of government and writing.

Farming involves cultivating plants and livestock . Most prehistoric farmers practiced mixed farming--they grew both crops (such as wheat, barley or oats) and raised animals (such as pigs, cows or sheep). They also hunted wild game such as deer and elk. They used their domesticated animals to help them till the soil and pull their wagons. Most pre-literate people were farmers .

Agricultural societies required more resources than hunting and gathering societies; they had to work harder for a living, but they could produce more food and develop technologies such as pottery that made life easier . They also developed more complex social structures since they were working together in large groups to perform tasks.

Writing is the recording of communication . The earliest known script was discovered in Catal Huyuk at the site called "Çatalhöyük", dated back 8000 BCE, and it evolved into an alphabet around 3200 BCE, which was developed by the Sumerians. In contrast to writing, speech is a form of communication that relies on the spoken word . Speech is a natural phenomenon in which the human voice conveys information through verbal sounds or words with a particular arrangement and sequence."

In most cultures religion plays an important role; it often provides cultural norms and beliefs . For example, some cultures believed that the gods gave them dominion over nature while others held to animistic notions in which humans were equal to all other animals . Some believed they could influence or predict natural phenomena using special rites while others saw religion as a form of control and social hierarchy.

Pre-literate societies had very complex religious beliefs, rituals and practices. For example, the Incan god Pachamama was worshipped with offerings of food, flowers and incense . They built elaborate temples to their deities--such as those at Cuzco--where they sacrificed humans, animals and even gold . The Aztec culture practiced human sacrifice; for example, in the year 1486 they killed up to 20,000 people during a single ceremony. Pre-literate societies often believed that gods or ancestors watched over them as they went about their daily activities and that these supernatural beings could influence nature .

The religion of most prehistoric cultures was polytheistic--they believed in many gods. They usually gave their gods human characteristics, such as a head, arms, legs and sometimes wings . For example, the Egyptian culture developed a polytheistic pantheon that included more than 100 gods: from Amun, the god of earth to Ares, the god of war . Some cultures believed in animism--they saw all objects as having spirits or souls. They would worship these spirits and try to ensure they got what they wanted through rituals such as human sacrifice.

Most pre-literate cultures did not practice medicine; they relied on the supernatural instead . For example, some believed that illness was caused by evil spirits . Others saw disease as a form of punishment from the gods for bad behavior. Some used herbs and plants in healing rituals, but these practices were often unscientific, magical or fatalistic; for example, ancient Greek physicians believed that bloodletting could cure a range of illnesses . The first systematic use of medicine began with Hippocrates (460-377 BCE).

In the past century archaeologists have unearthed vast numbers of human remains from prehistoric societies. They have learned that humans were generally healthier in earlier times; for example, the average adult was 1 to 2 feet shorter than modern people and their teeth and jaws were larger . The sex ratio was also different; men were slightly more common than women."

The study of prehistory is a young field . It was only at the end of the nineteenth century that archaeology became a widely recognized science--although its roots go back to ancient Egypt, where the study of inscriptions on monuments and artifacts had been practiced for thousands of years. Until 1896, archaeologists thought that people living in prehistory were "barbarians". But in 1859, Charles Darwin published his On the Origin of Species, which introduced evolution to a wide audience . He suggested that humans had evolved from less intelligent ancestors who lived before recorded history began . In this way he challenged the notion that people living before the advent of literacy were "barbarians".

The most important discovery in pre-history was the Neanderthal man, whose fossil was discovered by Dr. Schoeninger in 1856 at the Neander Valley in Germany . The remains showed a robust build and an advanced brain; they had been alive for nearly half a million years . They hunted mammoths and other large animals with bone - point weapons that were much more sophisticated than those of the earlier Pale
