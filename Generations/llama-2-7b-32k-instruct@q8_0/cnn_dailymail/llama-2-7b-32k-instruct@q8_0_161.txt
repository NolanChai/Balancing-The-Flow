18 months old when their dad, John, died last year after he was struck by an SUV while riding his bicycle to work. Their father's will directed that the liver be given to Phuoc so she could live a healthy life and pursue her dream of becoming a doctor or lawyer. Binh Wagner's heart broke when she saw her sister receive John's liver at the age of 2, but a few months later doctors found a match for her in France and she had surgery to receive his other organ, according to reports . "She's my little miracle," said Phuoc, who was born with half a heart. She added that she has always loved her twin sister more than anyone else and hoped Binh would find happiness after John died . While Binh waited for the call that a liver was available, she watched YouTube videos of her father, saw old photos of him, and read his books."

Title: This is not the real deal.
Review: I bought this because my son likes the music. It was clearly fake, and it was obvious that someone was trying to take advantage of us fans of the REAL thing. The sound quality is very poor, and doesn't even come close to the originals. Someone should sue the guy who made this CD. I don't think he has any right selling such a product.
Answer: No""The music is so good that I can't believe it's live," says Tina Turner, 53, of San Diego . "It feels like they are all in the studio together.""

Review title: Laughter for days!
Product review: A laugh out loud funny book that shows the dark side of human nature and our crazy, sometimes dysfunctional society. The author is witty, insightful and a pleasure to read."

The author's sense of humor will have you laughing out loud at all the crazy things people do in their daily lives . It is also quite educational as she explains how our brain works and why we act the way we do."

I received the questions "How does it feel to be a female?" and "Why are females so emotional?". Are they duplicates?
Yes (Document[14]):"Women are more emotionally expressive than men, particularly in public . Women are also more likely to use physical contact when greeting someone, such as shaking hands or hugging a friend . Both women and men tend to smile more frequently than they laugh . Men tend to smile only while women tend to smile and laugh."

Review title: Good Product
Product review: I'm a big fan of this series, but this is my first time watching on Blu-Ray... and wow. It just looks SOOO much better. The colors really pop, which is what we've all come to expect from HD material, but it also seems like there is more detail in the image that isn't really apparent in standard definition . The 3D does have some amazing moments, too . Some people might be turned off by the 4:3 picture format, but if you know what to look for - namely black bars on top and bottom - it doesn't bother me at all (I like seeing more of the image). It's not a dealbreaker for me, anyway, so I recommend this collection without reservation . The box itself is very nice; it feels solid and well-made."

increase (Document[25]):"The series is really fun to watch as an adult, too . It is full of humor and you will be amazed at how much the animation has aged. I would recommend watching them with your kids or for nostalgia purposes."

Title: Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease: A Guide to Understanding the Patient's Perspective (Practical Clinical Trials)
Product review: This is a very good book, written in a way that makes it accessible to most people who have an interest in clinical trials. It gives a lot of information about how to find out if you are eligible for one and what the different studies entail. It also touches on other issues such as financial concerns, insurance, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in participating in a study."

decrease (Document[26]):"Clinical Trials is an excellent resource for those with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia . It provides information about clinical trials and their role, how they are conducted, who should participate, what the risks are, and some of the newest studies underway . Written by a physician/researcher in the field of Alzheimer's disease, it is easy to read and understandable . The author is very knowledgeable about the topic and it shows . I would highly recommend this book to those interested in learning more about clinical trials."

Title: A little too much information
Review: This is a good book but the author gives too many details of the characters that are not really necessary. She has been trying to keep up with the times by giving her heroine a job, which she does for a short time . I also didn't like that the hero was so blinded by his first impression of her and that he didn't listen to what she said until too late .
Is this product review negative?
Yes (Document[27]):"The story itself is interesting. However, it does get bogged down in details which are unnecessary for a book like this . If you like reading about the same old thing over and over again then this is your kind of book."

Review title: The best book on the subject I've read
Product review: I am currently taking a class in statistics and have been struggling to find any good books which clearly explain regression. This book does it better than any other I have seen. It also covers the statistical aspects of regression as well. The author is a very clear and concise writer who makes difficult topics easy to understand."

increase (Document[28]):"As a graduate student, I am constantly searching for books which explain statistical concepts in an accessible manner . I have found that many of the standard textbooks on regression are often too technical and complex for my purposes as well as those of most students. This book is not only readable but also quite informative."

Title: Great
