 An Ontario girl whose father chose her needier twin sister to receive his liver donation has now gotten a lifesaving new organ of her own. Vietnamese Binh Wagner, 3, and her identical twin Phuoc were born in 2018 with a rare genetic condition that led to liver damage. The girls' father had been on the transplant list for several years when he got his chance in November, but instead of having it himself, he donated his liver to Binh, who was just eight months old at the time. His decision sparked a public outcry as well as criticism from medical experts. Binh is now two and has recently received an organ transplant that saved her life.   
  
 "In terms of survival, there's no question that she's doing better," Dr. Dmitri Vegni, Binh's physician at SickKids hospital in Toronto, told HuffPost Canada on Monday. 
  
 While the girls were both born with biliary atresia ― a condition whereby the intestines are unable to absorb bile from the liver ― only one of them needed an immediate transplant. The two sisters have different genetic mutations that affect the development of their livers.    
  
 Binh was too young to receive her father's liver when it became available, but she did get a new organ last month thanks to a donation from someone else who matched her genes and was a good match for her.   
  
 The girls are still recovering from the surgeries they've had so far. But Binh is thriving with her healthier liver, Vegni said. She has gained weight since the transplant, he added. 
  
 "She's doing well in terms of her health and she's growing," said Dr. Veena Singh, another physician at SickKids who has been caring for Binh. 
  
 The girls were born at a hospital in Vietnam and first arrived in Toronto on Nov. 28 after their father arranged to have them flown by private jet from his native country. They moved with him to Ontario as soon as they got off the plane, where he was put on the liver transplant wait list.  
  
 Binh's case gained international attention last fall when her father told reporters that he had decided to donate his own liver because Binh needed it more than her twin sister. He said at the time that she would likely die without a new liver. 
  
 The decision prompted an outcry, with critics saying the girls' father did not have the right to make such a life-or-death choice for his daughter and arguing that doctors should decide who gets priority on transplant wait lists based solely on medical need rather than family considerations.      
  
 A Canadian kidney doctor even publicly denounced him, writing in a letter to the hospital where Binh's father was waiting for a liver that he had not considered his daughter's future at all and instead appeared to be focused only on protecting himself and his other children. 
  
 Dr. Vegni said doctors did talk with the family about whether or not to have both girls listed as needing a transplant, but they decided that neither should go on the list given their age.   
  
 "We talked about listing them together," he said. But "that was not an option at the time."    
  
 The father has said he acted out of concern for Binh and would do it again if faced with a similar choice, but did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.   
  
 Binh's family could not be reached immediately for comment.      
  
 Phuoc also had a liver transplant in 2019 at just three years old, and is now doing well, according to her father. He has since separated from the twins' mother.
