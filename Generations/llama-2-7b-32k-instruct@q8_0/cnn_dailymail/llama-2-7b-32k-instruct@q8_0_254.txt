emies' endless bragging that they decided to come together and form a supportive community on the popular social media platform - for people who are tired of being told how "adorable" their children really aren't.

The Facebook group, called #BabysitterBingo, was created by 41-year-old mother of three Alyssa Duffy and has amassed more than 6,000 members who share pictures of the worst brags they've seen from their friends with children.

A sample post shared on the group reads: "The baby just rolled over for the first time. My kids have been doing that since last week." Another read: "My daughter is two and I just found out that she can name all the animals in her zoo toy. My 14-month-old son's favorite book was published before he was born."

The group even has its own hashtag, #babysittersneeded, for when parents need a break from their kids. But for some reason, the moms who are part of the group tend to feel more connected than they would with non-moms - and say that having a community of people going through the same thing makes them feel less alone.

Alyssa started the group after she got tired of her own mother's bragging on Facebook about their family trip to Disney World. She wanted to have a place to share the "ridiculous, eye-rolling" posts she sees from her friends and make light of them. And boy, has she succeeded.

So if you feel like your news feed is full of baby photos that are making you want to scream, maybe it's time for you to join a Facebook group where moms can complain about the same thing. It could be just what you need.<s> <|endoftext|> In 2016, The Intercept began reporting on the NSA’s warrantless searches of domestic emails and phone calls — spying that the government has kept secret for years. The reporting has led to a significant shift in how people think about surveillance in this country; it’s sparked intense debate inside the government over what needs to be done about it, including efforts to reauthorize Section 702 of FISA — the law that allows the NSA to collect and search these records.

But despite the extensive reporting on the problem, we know of no effort by the government to change the laws or policies that make this surveillance possible. On Monday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and FBI released a statement claiming they will “take additional steps” in response to The Intercept’s reporting.

The statement does not indicate what these steps might be. But we do know that it won't include a change to the laws or policies that allow this spying, because both ODNI and FBI have publicly defended those laws. It is also clear from the statement itself that the government is unlikely to actually make any changes; in fact, they are likely going to double down on their efforts to preserve these warrantless searches:

“ODNI/FBI will continue its outreach to Congress and other stakeholders to address concerns about whether any collection activities under Section 702 should be terminated or modified.”

The statement also does not explain how The Intercept’s reporting — which is based on leaked documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden that are verified by multiple sources and published over the course of many months in collaboration with other media outlets around the world — could possibly be considered “sensationalism.”

This statement from ODNI and FBI is not a serious response to our reporting. It is instead an effort to discredit our work, and to try to undermine public understanding about how dangerous warrantless searches of domestic communications are.

If you’ve read any of the articles that have been published over the past two years on this subject — and particularly if you’ve read them in their full contexts (which can be found here) — then there is simply no way to come away from them with a belief that they contain “sensationalism” or are otherwise intended to deceive or misinform.

The government may not like The Intercept’s reporting on this issue, but we stand by the accuracy of it, and we encourage ODNI/FBI to make any changes they believe necessary to protect civil liberties — and to publicly explain exactly what those changes are, why they are necessary, and how they will address the concerns that our reporting has raised.
