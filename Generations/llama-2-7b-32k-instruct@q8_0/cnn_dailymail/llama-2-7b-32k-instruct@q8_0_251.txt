The alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack which left 166 dead has been released on bail, Pakistani officials revealed. Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was allowed to leave Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi on Monday after spending three years behind bars for his involvement in the attacks. The court accepted a plea from lawyers defending Lakhvi that he should be released as he was not found guilty by any Indian investigation or trial, local media reported.
