indi, Pakistan and go home despite being a suspect in the Mumbai attacks of 2008, reported Express Tribune.

The court's decision has come under severe criticism from India which continues to accuse Pakistani authorities of harbouring terrorists as well as supporting terrorism, according to Hindustan Times.

"This is an act of state sponsored terrorism," said Sushma Swaraj, the Minister of External Affairs in a tweet on Tuesday. "The court's decision will embolden other terrorist outfits and encourage them to carry out more such heinous acts."

"We will not let this act go unpunished," she added.

In another tweet she added that India will take up this issue with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

"I have full faith in PM @ImranKhanPTI and am sure he will take prompt action to ensure the bail is not granted," Sushma said, referring to Lakhvi.

India's Ministry of External Affairs also condemned Pakistan over Lakhvi's bail in a statement on Tuesday. It said that Pakistan is harbouring terrorists and "continuously encourages terrorism."

"We have seen reports about grant of bail by Pakistani authorities to Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of 26/11 Mumbai attacks," read the statement. It added:

India has been consistently saying that Pakistan is harbouring terrorists and continuously encourages terrorism. We condemn this act strongly as it undermines our collective efforts to eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism...The 26/11 Mumbai attacks are the most heinous example of the nexus between terrorism and state sponsorship that was revealed by the investigation carried out by Indian law enforcement agencies. Pakistan has been asked to immediately re-arrest Lakhvi and all other accused persons in the case, and ensure that they face due process of law. We will continue to work with the international community for a comprehensive strategy against terrorism," it added.

The Indian government had sought Pakistan's cooperation in bringing Lakhvi and other suspects from Mumbai attacks to India for a fair trial.

In October 2017 the then Pakistani Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal was quoted by Indian Express as saying that the country is willing to take action against Lakhvi on the request of the Indian government.

"The issue has been raised and discussed with the authorities concerned," he had said, adding Pakistan "fully respects" India's concerns over terrorism and will do everything possible for cooperation in this regard."

Lakhvi is currently under investigation by Pakistani courts on charges of "waging war against Pakistan." He was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in April 2017.

The court's decision to grant him bail has been criticised by many, including the Mumbai Police which had urged the prosecutors to oppose his release. Lakhvi's lawyer had earlier argued that he was innocent and needed medical attention.

Apart from Lakhvi, six other suspects also face terrorism charges in Pakistan. Four of them are already under arrest while two others remain free. The Pakistani government has said they will be arrested as soon as the cases against them are over.<s>
