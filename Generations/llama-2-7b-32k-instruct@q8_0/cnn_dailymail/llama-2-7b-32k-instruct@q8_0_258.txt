ks with Cordoba but they must pay a significant fee for the forward, who scored 18 goals last season in the third tier of Spanish football.

Florin Andone may not be the only option at this price for Aston Villa. We have taken a look through our database and picked out five players that would fit Gerrard's bill, while also being available for a reasonable sum.


1/5
Cristian Pav√≥n - Boca Juniors / Argentina - ¬£6million
Pavon is the most expensive option on this list but he has proven to be one of the best players in South America after scoring 14 goals and providing 10 assists for his side in the Argentine league last season. He was also a key figure when Boca won the 2020 Copa Libertadores.

The winger, who is yet to make an appearance for Argentina at senior level, is still only 26 years old and has played a number of games at centre-forward despite being deployed on the wing most of his career. He would be able to play through the middle with Villa's lack of firepower.

Pavon will likely be available at this price as Boca Juniors are in financial trouble, having had their stadium taken away from them by the Argentine government because they failed to pay back loans for a new stadium.
2/5
Florin Andone - Cordoba / Spain - ¬£2.5million
Andone has been linked with Villa for some time and it is clear that he would fit into Gerrard's preferred system of three at the back. He scored 18 goals in 37 games last season but a number of teams, including La Liga side C√°diz and Portuguese outfit Braga, are said to be interested in signing him as they try to stay in their respective leagues for next season.

However, Cordoba are in such financial trouble that they may not have any choice but to sell Andone - and this would mean Gerrard has a chance of getting his man. Villa need to strengthen at the back, especially with Tyrone Mings likely out for the start of next season because of injury.
3/5
Born√© Ferreira - Famalic√£o / Portugal - ¬£2million
Ferreira is a 19-year-old centre-forward who has been tipped to make it big, and he scored six goals for the Portuguese side in his debut season after joining them from Benfica's Under-23 team. Ferreira would be perfect for Villa given they have not had much luck with young strikers in recent times and Gerrard was keen to bring in youth when he joined the club.

Famalic√£o are expected to be relegated this season, meaning they will also be under pressure to raise funds - and Ferreira could be available for a reasonable price if Villa can show their hand quickly enough.
4/5
Anthony Martial - Manchester United / France - ¬£36million
Martial has been the subject of much speculation this summer, with United said to be willing to let him go. Gerrard is an admirer of the forward and his ability on the ball could give Villa a boost in the final third as they look to play some exciting attacking football next season.

Martial has been at Old Trafford since 2015 for ¬£36million but has struggled to hold down a regular spot despite having occasional spells of good form - he scored 14 goals in his debut Premier League campaign, the following season he had eight goals and four assists. The former Lyon man is still only 26 years old, meaning he could be a long-term option for Villa as they look to rebuild their side after the coronavirus pandemic.
5/5
Jesse Lingard - Manchester United / England - ¬£18million
Lingard is another player that has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer, and it appears he could be on his way out of the club after being left on the bench for pre-season. Villa have shown interest in the 27-year-old before and Lingard would be able to fit into their system having spent time under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool.

He has played a key role for England in recent years, playing in all three of the Three Lions' World Cup matches, but has struggled with injury and inconsistency since joining United from Borussia Dortmund. He is an attacking option who would give Villa more firepower up front.

Lingard was also a key figure at Liverpool as Klopp took them to the Champions League final in 2018, winning it with a brace of goals against Barcelona - but he has had mixed fortunes since leaving the club. He scored six goals and provided four assists for Manchester United last season despite being unable to hold down a regular spot, starting just 15 times out of 38 matches.

It is not yet known which option Gerrard will choose from this list but it appears Villa are ready to strengthen the squad as they prepare for life back in the Premier League.

Gerrard has been impressed with Lingard's attitude and says he has 'done everything that he can' over the past week, adding: "He'll be a player that I have to assess going into next season, it was a difficult pre-season for him because of his injury.

"I haven't seen Jesse in training yet but we will give him an opportunity as with every other player and see where it takes us."

It seems unlikely that Gerrard would sign both Lingard and Martial, unless Villa have a change of heart about their plans for next season. They are not expected to make more than one signing, so Andone is most likely to be the choice at this stage - although Ferreira could prove an option if they need another forward in the summer.

Pavon has been linked with Villa before and will likely join a top team like Braga or C√°diz after his impressive form last season, while Martial is almost certain to be sold by United this summer as Solskj√¶r looks to strengthen elsewhere. Lingard may have to wait until January before he is given another chance at Old Trafford.

Gerrard has not yet decided on whether Villa will sign a striker or not, telling reporters: "We'll see, I don't think that we need a centre-forward but you never know."

Potential Aston Villa targets: Florin Andone, Cristian Pavon, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Born√© Ferreira. (Sports Mail)
