Florin Andone has scored 12 goals in his time at Cordoba, but could find himself moving to England if recent reports are anything to go by. It is understood that Villa have made an enquiry for the Spaniard and have been offered him as a potential replacement for Jonathan Kodjia who has struggled for form this season.

Aston Villa were rumoured in January to be interested in bringing Andone back to England, with Sportsmail reporting at the time how they had asked about his availability. The Spanish second tier side are now reeling from their own financial difficulties and could be forced to sell key players before the end of the season - with Andone on that list.

The 25-year old striker would represent a significant upgrade on Kodjia who is yet to find his form for Villa this term, despite the club having paid Bristol City £10million for him in January.

Villa are unlikely to pay Cordoba's full asking price and Sportsmail understand that they will be looking to negotiate a fee below the €5m (£4.2million) mark. The potential fee would represent a significant bargain for Villa, who could bring Andone to England at less than half his current market value, despite him having played in La Liga.

Andone is under contract with Cordoba until 2020 and has been tipped to join Portuguese side Sporting CP - but the Portuguese side are also in financial difficulties and have had their own issues with payments to players over recent weeks.

Villa could be one of several clubs chasing his signature, with other potential suitors including Spanish second division outfit Lugo who are on a promotion push. Andone is also said to be interesting Portuguese side Pacos Ferreira and Turkish club Kayseri Erciyesspor, who have been linked to the striker for some time.

The player himself has expressed his desire to play in England and would relish a move across the channel according to Spanish journalist Miguel Delaney who spoke on Sky Sports News this morning. He also revealed that Andone's agent is expected in England tonight, sparking speculation that a deal could be close at hand.

Aston Villa were believed to be interested in Andone in January and have been offered him as a potential replacement for Jonathan Kodjia who has struggled for form this season. The striker's market value is said to be around €5m (£4.2million) but Villa could pick the player up on the cheap, with Sportsmail understanding they will attempt to negotiate a fee lower than that.

The 25-year old Spaniard has scored an impressive 12 goals in his time at Cordoba, with most of those coming since joining them from Getafe in July 2016. He started his senior career with Sporting CP's youth academy before moving to Getafe at the age of just 19 where he went on to score nine goals in 35 games for the club over two seasons.

Andone was then snapped up by Cordoba and has continued to flourish there, with Sportsmail reporting that he is "a player who could be a real threat for England's top teams". He has attracted attention from Premier League clubs in recent years including Brighton & Hove Albion - and could now find himself on the radar of several more if Cordoba do indeed have to sell him.

Villa are unlikely to pay the full market value for Andone and Sportsmail understand that they will be looking to negotiate a fee below the €5m (£4.2million) mark. He would represent an upgrade on Kodjia, who was signed from Bristol City in January for £10million but has struggled for form this term.

A move to Villa could also give Andone his first taste of English football, with Sportsmail reporting that he is interested in playing abroad and would relish a move to England. The player himself has expressed his desire to play in the country on Twitter after following a number of clubs including Aston Villa last summer. He followed both Villa's official Twitter account as well as Kodjia who has since been linked with an exit from Birmingham City this month.

Cordoba are reeling from their own financial difficulties and could be forced to sell key players before the end of the season, with Andone one of those. Sportsmail also understands that they are expected to sell other key players including Argentine winger Nicolas Lodeiro in the coming days, who has been linked with a move to Wolves this month.

The potential fee would represent a significant bargain for Villa, who could bring Andone to England at less than half his current market value, despite him having played in La Liga.
