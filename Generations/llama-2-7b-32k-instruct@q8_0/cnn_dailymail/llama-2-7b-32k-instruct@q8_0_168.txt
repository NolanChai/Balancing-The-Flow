Clint Hill reckons the pressure is on QPR's relegation rivals and insists Rangers can survive if they keep their cool. Chris Ramsey's side are still in the relegation zone but the defender believes other teams below them will drop points between now and May and help drag his team clear of the bottom three. Hill told QPR's official website: "There are only six games to go and we know it is going to be difficult but I think we have got the players who can do it for us. If we don't get beat, you never know what might happen."

Hill believes there has been a big difference in mentality at Loftus Road since Ramsey took charge of the team following the sacking of Chris Ramage and John Gregory in October. He said: "The manager's done a great job with us and we have started playing like a team again and we are not getting beaten week-in, week - out . I think that is why you saw the reaction at Loftus Road because it was like it had been taken away from us. There's no point in just having one of those games every six weeks or so, we need to do it more often."

The former Manchester United defender hopes the fans will continue to back the team and keep up with what has been a remarkable turnaround since Ramsey took over from the previous management team. Hill added: "I think the manager's done an unbelievable job in the time he's had here but it is now up to us players to finish it off. There's no point talking about it, we need to go and do it."

QPR will have a chance to get closer to safety when they host Barnsley at Loftus Road on Saturday with their new manager having already led the team to victory in his first game in charge against Charlton Athletic. Hill said: "He came in, changed things around and it was like we had never had a bad run of form before - it was weird . It's not just him, it is everybody who has come into the club, people are smiling again. We need to keep that going."

The 36-year-old believes Rangers can keep their cool and remain calm for the remainder of the season as they chase a top half finish which would take them out of the relegation zone. He added: "We have got to stay in touch with other teams who are around us and we will know when the points start dropping off but it is not about us, it's about what we need to do and if we keep our heads down and finish the season strongly I think that is all you can ask for ."

QPR have three games in hand over a number of their relegation rivals including Rotherham United, Burton Albion, Bristol City and Millwall. Hill said: "We know it's not about us but we are still in the bottom three - if other teams start dropping points between now and the end of the season it will help us."

Ramsey has also been busy strengthening his squad during January with five new signings including midfielder Tomer Hemed who has already scored twice against Charlton. Hill said: "It's great, we've had a bit of a break and got some fresh faces in the team. You know what it is like when you have been playing for a long time, your body needs a rest so hopefully they can come in and help us finish off this season."

The former Republic of Ireland defender added: "We just need to keep doing our jobs and I think we are starting to see a reaction from the fans which is great. We need them behind us because you never know what might happen . If we keep going like that, hopefully it will all work out for us."

QPR have won four of their last five Championship games at Loftus Road with two victories and three draws while Ramsey's side have not been beaten in the league since October. Hill said: "The fans are right behind us now and that is massive because they want to see a reaction, they know we need it. We are doing everything we can."

Ramsey has also led QPR to their first competitive victory since February 2015 when the club beat Charlton Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup last weekend following a 3-2 defeat against Premier League Crystal Palace in the previous round. Hill added: "It was huge, you could feel it coming - we had lost some games that maybe we should have won . We knew it was going to be tough but we managed to dig deep and get through."

Ramsey has also been boosted by the news that Charlie Austin is set to return from injury sooner than expected when his side host Barnsley this weekend. Hill added: "That's great because it means he can give us a lift, he has done ever since I came here . He'll be one of our key players going forward and hopefully we will see him soon."

Ramsey also told the club website that he was pleased to have Hemed on board but said the player's first priority is helping Rangers secure survival. The manager added: "He's a good player, an experienced striker with lots of goals under his belt and I think he can help us in the games we've got left."

Hemed has been out of action for 18 months due to knee surgery but Ramsey says he is confident the former Brighton & Hove Albion player will be a big hit at Loftus Road. The manager added: "He has been fantastic in training, he's got an eye for goal and you know what it's like when you have had your operation . It can take a couple of weeks to get back up to speed so hopefully that won't be a problem."

Ramsey is looking forward to watching Hemed in action against his former club Barnsley who he was on loan at for two months in 2014. The manager added: "He can give us a lift, it will be interesting to see how he does and hopefully he will bring some goals to the team."

QPR will also be hoping Hemed is successful against his former club as they chase a top half finish this season. Hill said: "It's fantastic for him because I think we have got good enough players in that dressing room to get out of it and I am sure he can bring something."

QPR will be hoping Hemed can inspire his team to victory on Saturday as they aim to continue their impressive form at Loftus Road with three wins and two draws from five home games since the end of October. Hill added: "We know we have got a good record here recently, it's about us keeping our heads down now."

Ramsey has also been pleased with QPR's away form in recent weeks following four victories and three defeats on their travels this season . Hill said: "I think that is one of the big reasons why we have got out of relegation trouble because we haven't lost too many away from home. We need to keep doing it."

Ramsey has also been delighted with Hemed's attitude towards helping his side in their battle against the drop and Hill believes the player will be a big hit at Loftus Road . The defender added: "He is not worried about what people say, he just wants to come here and help us out. I think it will work for him because we know how good he is."

Hemed has scored 65 goals in his career and Hill believes the player has a big future ahead of him at Loftus Road . The defender added: "I'm sure he can add something to our team, hopefully that will be goals. If he gets us over the line it will be even better."
