In a letter dated 10 April 2015, which will be published in The Australian on Monday, artist Fintan Magee has written directly to Joko Widodo urging the President of Indonesia not to go ahead with his government's planned execution of two Australian citizens.

In his letter Mr Magee writes: "Dear Mr President, I am writing today because I believe that you can play a vital role in preventing tomorrow's execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for drug trafficking."

Mr Magee says it is an honour to be allowed to write directly to the Indonesian President about such important matters, which he believes have been largely ignored by Australia's media and politicians.

"I believe you are a man of deep moral character who will always put your country first," Mr Magee writes. "The Australian people respect you for that. I hope you know we respect the Indonesian people too, because they deserve to be treated as equals."

Mr Magee says Australia needs him and his artwork to be part of a positive change in attitudes towards Indigenous Australians. He wants President Widodo to know how deeply upsetting it would be for many Australians if Chan and Sukumaran are executed, which he believes will have "a devastating impact on Indigenous people".

Mr Magee writes: "In your country there is a large population of people who live in poverty. They don't have much choice but to seek work anywhere they can find it." Mr Magee says many Australians don't realise the difficulty and danger these Indigenous Australians face when leaving their communities, which he says leads to many young men becoming traffickers.

He writes that he has had a chance to talk with members of the Indonesian community in Melbourne about the death penalty. Mr Magee says they are all against it because "it doesn't solve anything". He writes: "It only makes people suffer, and those who are innocent end up punished along with the guilty."

Mr Magee asks President Widodo to consider a rehabilitation program for both men in Indonesia, where they could be allowed to return home after serving their sentences. Mr Magee also urges him to use his influence to stop the planned executions of Chan and Sukumaran. He closes the letter by wishing President Widodo good health and wellbeing.

"I hope you will agree with me that there is no way Indonesia can afford another death penalty," Mr Magee writes. "It's too costly in terms of money and human lives."

Indonesian President Joko Widodo is yet to respond to the letter.

A spokesperson for Myuran Sukumaran said: "We will not be commenting on this letter until we have seen it."

In a statement, the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra said they had been contacted by Mr Magee and had asked him to forward his correspondence directly to President Widodo. The embassy also says that all letters to President Widodo must be written in Bahasa Indonesia.

Mr Magee, who was born and raised in Melbourne, is a renowned Australian artist known for his beautiful paintings of Indigenous Australians. He is an ambassador for Reconciliation Australia. In 2013 Mr Magee won the National Aboriginal Art Award and has been nominated six times for the prestigious Telstra award.

Indonesian President Widodo will make a final decision on whether to go ahead with Chan and Sukumaran's executions this week, according to Indonesia's Attorney General Mohammad Prasetyo. The men are scheduled to be executed by firing squad in the early hours of 18 April.
