Morrisons has introduced a halal-only pick and mix counter where sweet lovers can fill their bags with a variety of confectionery without having to check the ingredient list for alcohol or pork gelatine. The move comes after Muslims complained about the inclusion of such foods at regular candy counters, according to The Independent. The new counter will only sell halal sweets and will be placed in a Morrisons store in Birmingham, England, which is home to a large number of Muslim residents. "We have decided to trial this service for our customers as we recognise that some of our shoppers prefer foods produced according to Islamic principles," said a spokesperson for Morrisons . The chain has also introduced a halal hot counter in a store in London, which serves food prepared under Muslim dietary guidelines.

A number of other chains have introduced similar products in the wake of increased demand from Muslim shoppers who want to eat and buy foods that adhere to their faith's dietary restrictions, including Burger King and KFC, both of which serve halal meat at some locations. "We know that many customers have an interest in our halal hot counter," said a spokesperson for Subway, the fast food chain where Muslim customers can choose a Muslim-friendly sub filled with halal meat. "We are working to increase the number of restaurants offering this option."

According to The Guardian, Britain's Muslim population has grown in recent years and is now estimated at 2.7 million people . In the wake of these changes, a growing number of chains have worked to offer more halal products or create facilities for Muslim shoppers who want to buy halal food.

The popularity of halal-only pick and mix counters seems likely to increase, as well, especially in areas with large Muslim populations . It's clear that the market demand is there."
