, jelly babies, fudge sticks, jelly cubes, and chocolate honeycombs - are available in three flavours: Original, Vanilla, and Raspberry. The new counters were created following a survey Morrisons carried out with its Muslim shoppers which showed that many felt "increasingly excluded" by supermarkets not catering to their cultural beliefs. Halal-only pick and mix will be available at branches across the UK in the next few weeks, Morrisons said .

The idea was originally suggested to Morrisons' head of marketing Stephen Watts by a customer called Mohammed Al-Sharifi. The father-of-four said he found it difficult to find halal pick and mix treats in supermarkets, which led him to take up the issue with his local MP. Mr Al-Sharifi was invited to speak at Morrisons' head office where he gave a presentation about how he felt as an observant Muslim consumer, highlighting that he would be happy for other Muslim shoppers to try out pick and mix sweets in return for feedback on the product. He also brought with him a selection of halal treats from a Turkish supermarket which were halal-certified but not halal-only as they contained alcohol. Mr Watts, who said he was unaware that Muslims had such specific dietary requirements until then, asked Mr Al-Sharifi to help him "bring pick and mix back into the mainstream" . A spokeswoman for Morrisons said: "We know some of our customers have concerns over what they can eat when it comes to food safety. They want to know if a product contains any ingredients that might not be suitable for them or their families, such as pork." She added: "The idea grew from there and we've been working closely with Mr Al-Sharifi to develop the range."

She said that Morrisons worked in partnership with a food labelling expert to ensure that Muslim shoppers would know whether the products were halal or not. The new pick and mix sweets are also being offered as part of an initiative by the Halal Food Authority (HFA) which wants to promote greater recognition for halal-certified food . The organisation has already teamed up with Tesco in a bid to get more Muslim shoppers interested in buying certified products.

A spokeswoman for the HFA said: "We are delighted that Morrisons has worked with us to develop a range of halal-only pick and mix sweets for Muslim customers. This is an excellent example of what can be achieved when companies work in partnership with certifiers." Mr Watts said he wanted to make sure that the new products were not only available for Muslim shoppers, but would appeal to everyone . He added: "The range has been well-tested with our customers and we've had some fantastic feedback from all ages so far. They've told us they enjoy having a mix of sweets as well as being able to choose exactly which flavours they want to have."

The spokeswoman for Morrisons said the halal pick and mix would be available in all stores where it is sold . The chain's head office in Bradford, which has a large Muslim population, will also receive the sweets. It comes after Aldi launched its own range of halal-only products last month, including meat and bread for Eid al-Adha - the most important festival of the Islamic calendar which takes place at the end of this week .

Aldi said it was the first supermarket to offer a range of halal products for Eid al-Adha and that its selection would be available in all stores across the UK . The chain said its meat would carry an "M" symbol on the packaging, indicating the product had been certified as halal - meaning the animal was slaughtered by a Muslim in accordance with Islamic law.

It said it would have its own range of halal products for Eid al-Fitr - the end of Ramadan and one of the most important festivals in Islam which falls this weekend . Aldi also launched a campaign encouraging British Muslims to celebrate "the power of pork" at this year's Easter by offering free miniature pork pies for children who eat halal meat over the holiday. The chain said: "We want to make sure that everyone, whether they are Muslim or not, is able to enjoy our products."

Halal-only pick and mix will be available in the next few weeks at Morrisons' 437 stores across the UK. The products are already available for online delivery .

They want to know if a product contains any ingredients that might not be suitable for them or their families, such as pork," she said .
