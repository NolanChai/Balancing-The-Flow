Sudhamali, the daughter of the famous captive elephant Kandy, was separated from her family when she was just three years old. Her father died in 2015 after collapsing due to a heart attack, and Sudhamali's mother was sold to another owner. But Sudhamali had other plans - despite being offered a new home with her own family, she set off on the long journey back to where she had spent most of her life.

The video was captured by wildlife photographer and journalist Suresh Kumar Rajendran, who has been working closely with the elephants at the Elephant Conservation Center in Sri Lanka for over a decade. He explained that Sudhamali's mother, Kandy, is now in her old age and can no longer carry Sudhamali back to their original home, so she had to make the journey on her own.

Rajendran said, "It was touching moment when I saw Sudhamali approaching her mother after a long time. It reminded me of my childhood days when we used to see our parents every day." He added that he hopes that Sudhamali's story will inspire others to respect and protect elephants in their natural habitat.

According to Rajendran, the relationship between elephant mothers and their children is incredibly strong, and it's heartbreaking to see them separated like this. He believes that Sudhamali's return home is a sign of hope for the future of captive elephants in Sri Lanka.

Sudhamali's story has since gone viral, with many people praising her determination and love for her family. The video has also sparked important conversations about animal welfare and the need to protect elephants in their natural habitats.

As for Sudhamali herself, she is now back home with her mother and seems happy and content. She serves as a reminder that even though humans have kept many elephants captive, they are still capable of great love and connection with their families.
