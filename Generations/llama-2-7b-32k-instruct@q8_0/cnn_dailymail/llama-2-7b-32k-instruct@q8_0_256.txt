in shot put his team ahead before the break. In the second-half, substitute Kai Lightfoot finished a lightning-fast counterattack to put them 2-0 up and then substitute Rigby Ovial got in on the act with two quickfire goals to seal their spot at next week's final against Barcelona in Nyon

The Blues had beaten PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-final, while Roma defeated Shakhtar Donetsk. Viveash said: "We needed a bit of luck on our way tonight but I am delighted with the performance and result. 
"We've got some exceptional players who are all at different stages of their careers. The important thing is that they get minutes in games, develop and learn as well."

I have a dream! I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and unencumbered will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. This was a colossal event -- Bigger than the Gettysburg Address. It was so huge that Frederick Douglass and Abe Lincoln must be rolling over in their graves
