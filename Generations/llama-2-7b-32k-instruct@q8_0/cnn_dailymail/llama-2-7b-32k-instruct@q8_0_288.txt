9th September 1889 was like, how he lost friends and colleagues that day, and what it was like to return to work just six days later

The Bradford City Disaster by John Helm

As we walked out on to the pitch of Valley Parade in front of a crowd of several thousand spectators, there were a few wisps of smoke hanging about, but nothing much else that would indicate what was to happen. I had been at work for just three hours and it was one of my first games as a junior reporter with The Yorkshire Herald when the tragedy occurred.

I had only covered two previous matches – City vs Grimsby and an Under 18s match, but the weather conditions were almost perfect as we gathered in front of the main stand. It was just after half past four on a fine sunny afternoon on 9th September and it looked like being another exciting game for the home side against Lincoln City

The ground had been renovated to bring it up to date, but there was still work going on behind the scenes, so I’m not sure how much of this work the supporters would have seen. In the main stand, however, the seats were all in place and looking smart enough – certainly compared with other places where I had been.

The weather conditions were ideal for football and it was a shame that we weren’t to see another game on the pitch at Valley Parade this season

As the match started there seemed no hint of any trouble, although the crowd was bigger than usual. It wasn’t unusual to have a fair bit of noise from the terraces when City played – they had a good reputation for that – and it was certainly louder than expected this afternoon as Lincoln took control.

The crowd began to get excited at times and there were more people around the pitch, but still nothing ominous in the way of smoke or flame. The referee blew the whistle three minutes into injury time, which seemed a little early, and there was some confusion as players tried to leave the field

As supporters tried to exit the main stand, they found that many doors were blocked by fences – although it wasn’t clear whether these had been put up for safety reasons or as an advertising hoarding

Smoke began to appear on all sides and you could see people coughing and spluttering. The stench of smoke became stronger and I recall hearing a loud bang before the main stand caught fire

As the flames spread, there was chaos in the ground as people tried to find their way out – many fell into the main stand

I can remember thinking that if the flames from the main stand were not put out quickly we would lose so much more than just a football match. The roof of the stand was certainly ablaze and it seemed likely that at any moment the whole building could come down

Suddenly, I saw men with buckets in front of the main stand – there were several pumps outside as well – but all to no avail. Fire engines began to arrive on the scene from nearby Keighley and Leeds but it was too late. The main stand would not be saved

As people ran for their lives, I was aware that this wasn’t just a fire at Bradford City any more. The flames were spreading quickly through the main stand – there didn’t appear to be any way of containing them

Within minutes, the other stands became engulfed as well and with little left to hold back the flames, it seemed likely that we would lose much more than just a football match. It was sad to see so many people running away from what had been their home ground for so long

As I tried to get out of the building, I was knocked to one side by someone running and suddenly fell over – the sight before my eyes seemed unreal as hundreds of people ran past me in every direction. A friend was shouting at me to follow him, but there were simply too many people for us to be able to escape

I tried to get away from the main stand as it became clear that no one could stop what had already started and the crowd continued to run out of the ground in all directions

The smoke got thicker – it was chest-deep by this time. It was difficult to breathe, but I didn’t know what else to do, so I stayed close to the main stand as I tried to find a way out

As I looked up at the flames coming from above me, it seemed that they were spreading quickly through the upper tier of seats. The whole stand was in flames by this time and there didn’t seem any way we could stop what had already started

It was like being caught in a massive tornado – I could hear people running around everywhere, but no one knew which direction to take. It seemed as if the fire was spreading faster than you could run away from it

Somehow I made my way down on to the pitch and out of the ground. It was very dark and difficult to see where I was going – there were people running in all directions, many of them shouting for help

Smoke continued to pour into the stadium as you can imagine – it seemed likely that we would lose much more than just a football match if something wasn’t done quickly

There was nothing to stop the fire now and it seemed certain to spread further. There were hundreds of people trapped inside and many more outside trying desperately to get away from it

I eventually made my way down the steps to the road outside the main stand, but there were so many people running that I didn’t know whether they would stop or not – the flames seemed like they could spread at any second

As I ran in front of the main stand, smoke billowed around me and I kept thinking about how many lives could be lost if we didn’t get away from it quickly. It seemed as if the whole thing was going to go up in a huge explosion

I finally made my way out on to the road and there were people everywhere – some running, others standing still. There was no time for reflection, though – I just kept moving away from what had once been our home ground for so long. It seemed likely that we would lose much more than just a football match if something wasn’t done quickly

As we got further away, we could hear people shouting and screaming in the distance as the flames continued to spread – there were some police vehicles on the scene but it was difficult to see what they were doing. It seemed as though this would be one of the biggest football tragedies of all time

As I looked back at the stadium, it was still on fire and smoke was rising into the sky – it was sad to see so much loss of life and devastation in one place

The whole thing happened very quickly. It seemed like a matter of minutes from when we first noticed the smoke until flames were coming out of every side of the building, engulfing everything within minutes

It seemed certain that this was going to be one of the biggest tragedies football had ever seen – there would certainly be many fatalities if something wasn’t done quickly

I was relieved when we finally got away from the ground and were able to stop for a moment and look back at what used to be our home. It seemed like the whole thing was going up in flames, with no sign of stopping any time soon

There didn’t seem anything else that could be done but I think many of us felt helpless as we watched it burn – there were hundreds of lives being lost before our eyes and there seemed to be nothing that we could do about it

As I looked back, it seemed certain to spread even further. It was like a giant bonfire with thousands of people caught inside it – if something wasn’t done quickly, many more would die

It seemed as though the whole thing was going up in flames and there didn’t seem anything else that could be done about it. There were hundreds of lives being lost before our eyes and it seemed certain that this was going to be one of the biggest tragedies football had ever seen – but I wasn’t sure how much worse things could get

As we finally got away, it seemed like a matter of minutes from when we first noticed smoke to flames coming out every side of the building. It was terrifying and sad to see so many lives being lost before our eyes. There didn’t seem anything else that could be done but I think many of us felt helpless as we watched it burn

I don’t know how long it took, but when we finally got away from the ground, there were people everywhere. We were just trying to get out of there and find a place where we could talk about what had happened. There seemed nothing else that could be done – the whole thing was burning, with no sign of stopping any time soon

It was sad to see so many lives being lost before our eyes. It seemed certain that this was going to be one of the biggest tragedies football had ever seen and it seemed as though there didn’t seem anything else that could be done about it – but I wasn’t sure how much worse things could get

It seemed like a giant bonfire with thousands of people caught inside. It seemed certain that if something wasn’t done quickly, many more would die

As we finally got away, there was nothing left to do but just stand and watch it burn – hundreds of lives had already been lost before our
