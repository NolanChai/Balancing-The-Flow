iled William and Kate with their enthusiasm for the royals.

"When we got married, I was surprised by how many people wanted to send us presents," says Kate . "We weren't expecting that." The Duchess says she had a particularly good time watching one fan dress up as an elephant and waving at her from Buckingham Palace on the day of their 2011 nuptials. She recalls, "I was just so thrilled to be out there meeting people. It was all very exciting."

The Duchess has also met some dedicated royal fans who've attended the palace gates in hopes of catching a glimpse of William and Kate on their way out to attend public engagements. She remembers one man in his 80s she spied outside Buckingham Palace before their engagement announcement. "He said he had been standing at the gate for two days," Kate recalls .

It's not just Kate who gets a kick out of meeting the fans, though. William tells Oprah that when he sees his own father in the crowd outside his palace home, St James's Palace, and gives him a smile, "I think I get as much joy out of it as he does."

One fan who got to meet Prince William was 5-year-old Abigail Tallon. The royal couple invited Abigail and her mom, Sarah, to a private tour at Buckingham Palace in August 2013. "We were thrilled," says Sarah . "It's hard for me to get over the fact that I got to meet him."

"He was so nice," adds Abigail . The royal couple also spent time with their tour guide, and Abigail said William was eager to learn about her favorite subjects - like dragons. And when she asked Prince William if he had any pets of his own, the answer was "No." But that's not stopping him from trying. He says he has been learning how to care for a snake as an early Christmas present from Kate .

William and Kate also reveal in their interview that they are looking forward to welcoming their first child next year, and the Duchess says she's ready to trade royal engagements for being with her baby full time. "It will be very different," Kate explains, but it won't diminish the importance of what she does as a member of Britain's royal family.

"I want to be a great mother and a consort," says Kate . "I am not going to miss out on those important moments." But she admits that the timing will be challenging - especially during William's tours abroad. She explains, "I have been lucky enough to have had some really good prep, but you can never be prepared for meeting your child for the first time."

When Oprah asked Kate what she is most looking forward to about motherhood, the Duchess says it will be her baby's first smile. "It is going to be so exciting," Kate says . She and William also tell Oprah that they hope their children will share some of the family traits - like a love of music and art.

William adds that he hopes his kids won't end up living in Kensington Palace with him, but he admits it would be fun. "You could just imagine what that would be," William says . Kate and William also reveal to Oprah how the duchess's father is helping them prepare for parenthood: by showing her how to change a diaper.

In addition to spending time with their first child, Prince Harry will have his own new family - if he and his girlfriend Meghan Markle choose to get married . The Duchess says she wouldn't be surprised if the couple decided to wed in 2018 or 2019. She says Harry is "going through that moment where you can see it as a real possibility" and admits that, even though they are not close in age like Kate and William were when they married, she knows he's eager to have children of his own.

"I think it would be so lovely if there was another royal wedding," says the Duchess . "We'll have to wait and see." She adds that Harry has a tough decision to make before he can propose - whether to take Meghan Markle out for dinner or for lunch, as her mother's birthday is coming up.

William and Kate also talk about how much they value their privacy, and say they hope their children will be able to live a normal life outside of the media glare. But, despite that, William says he wouldn't trade the privileges of being a royal for anything . "I'm very proud of who I am," he says.

"I think it is really important to have a sense of humor about yourself," says Kate . She and William laugh as they discuss what they would tell their children if they were to be bullied at school. "Just don't take any notice of them," the Duchess says, adding, "That seems like an easy one."

The Duke and Duchess also reveal some of the changes they have made in their official London residence since moving into Kensington Palace last fall . William says he likes to play practical jokes on Kate, but she admits that she's gotten him back by putting his clothes in the wrong drawers.

Kate adds that she has also rearranged one of the rooms to make it more feminine. She decorated with a new color scheme - white and gray - and a photo of her family, including William and Kate . "It was getting very masculine," says Kate . But, she notes, when Prince Harry visited he wasn't afraid to use the pink bedroom with ballet shoes on display.

When Oprah asks if they are happier since moving into Kensington Palace, William says yes. He admits that the palace "has got its pros and cons," but he feels "comfortable" there now . And, Kate adds, their living arrangements have also helped them get to know some of the neighbors better - like Queen Elizabeth II's corgi dogs, Holly and Lolly.

The Duke and Duchess are now able to keep up with their royal duties from their London residence and William says it has helped him and Kate feel more settled in London . And they say that having a home of their own also helps them keep some traditions alive - like holiday dinners at Buckingham Palace for the Queen's staff.

"There are always things to do," Kate explains, adding that even though they don't have a family yet, "I'm not sure we would be as busy." William says he wouldn't want his children growing up without knowing about Christmas traditions . The Duke says he hopes to spend the holidays with Kate and their children in Norfolk. He explains, "It has become something of a tradition that I go back down there for Christmas every year."

Kate adds that she is glad William has been able to keep up his beloved annual charity football match - even though he's had to do it alone since Prince Harry couldn't make it this year . She says they all miss playing on the same team together. But, William notes, that could change in a few years when their children are old enough to join him at the annual game.

When Oprah asks about whether or not William and Kate will have more than one child - as his mother had - both of them say they would love to have several kids . And, Kate says she feels like it's a "responsibility" to share their genes with future generations . But, if the Duke and Duchess only have one child, it'll be enough for them.

Both William and Kate are eagerly awaiting Christmas, which they say will be different since they are now married. The couple reveals that they plan to spend the holiday in Norfolk with William's family . They say that their first Christmas as a married couple last year was "really fun," but also very challenging - and not just because of the long drive from London to Kate's childhood home of Anmer Hall.

"I think we had both been looking forward to it for so long and then suddenly we were there and I think you are kind of thinking, 'This is our first Christmas together.' It was all very exciting," says William . "But then when you get there, it's a big family thing." He adds that they spent time at Kate's parents' house in Norfolk on Christmas morning.

Kate tells Oprah she is particularly excited about seeing her new nephew this year - who was born just before Thanksgiving . And, William says he will have his own family to spend the holiday with since his younger brother and sister-in-law are expecting their first child in 2018.

Kate adds that she has been doing some Christmas shopping already this year - even though it's only November . "It is getting quite tricky," she says, noting that she likes to do it early so as not to rush around when the holiday comes closer . She also reveals that her husband prefers to shop for clothes than gifts.

As Oprah wraps up the interview and prepares to leave Kensington Palace, Kate tells Oprah what excites her most about the future: "I can't wait to see
