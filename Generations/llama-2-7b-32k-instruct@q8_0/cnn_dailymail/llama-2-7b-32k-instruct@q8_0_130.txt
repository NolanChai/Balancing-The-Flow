zaffarabad in the Pakistan Super League last Friday.

It was a sad end to what promised to be a memorable season for the former Victoria captain, who arrived at Headingley in February and scored 1,240 runs in 13 Championship matches at an average of 69.57.

"We have been told that it is not too bad - just a grade one tear," said Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon. "It doesn't sound serious but we will wait and see how he responds to treatment over the next four to six weeks."

Moxon added: "The most important thing is that if Finchy needs to get surgery, that he does so as soon as possible - it gives him a much better chance of making a full recovery."

Finch's injury comes at a time when Yorkshire are looking forward to the start of their County Championship campaign against Warwickshire in April. The club will hope that Finch makes a quick enough recovery to be included in their squad for next weekend's first-class match, which begins on Wednesday against Birmingham Bears in the Royal London Cup at Edgbaston.

Finch's injury also casts doubt over whether he will play for Australia again before this year's World Cup and Ashes series against England that is set to begin in May. The 33-year-old has been Australia's most consistent player over the last two years, batting at number three or four with an average of more than 50 and a strike rate nearing 150.

Finch was dropped for Australia's one-day series against India in January after failing to make any runs in a three-day warm-up match before the first ODI in Mumbai. He bounced back with scores of 78, 63 and 83 not out during the series but lost his place again for Australia's World Cup squad selection on Wednesday after failing to impress at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane ahead of their opening match against Pakistan next month.

Finch also suffered a rib injury in March 2017 and was ruled out for six weeks, missing four Twenty20 matches, including two finals. He came back to play for Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League that year but only managed scores of 20 and one before another break due to a broken finger led to him missing five months.

Moxon said Finch's injury was unfortunate but not a surprise given his workload. "It is not ideal from our perspective because he has had some big runs for us over the winter," he added. "But we also need to take into account that he is 33 years old and has played quite a lot of cricket in his life."

Finch said on Twitter that he was "deeply disappointed" by the injury but thankful it happened when Australia were not playing because it gave him time to recuperate before their World Cup defence. Finch also stated that he is aiming to play for Australia again this year and will be fit enough to take part in the Ashes series next summer if needed

He wrote: "Very disappointed about my injury tonight but I'm grateful it happened at the PSL & not when Australia are playing. Looking forward to getting back on board as soon as possible. Thanks for all the messages of support."

Moxon added that they would be in touch with Cricket Australia about Finch's injury and said: "If we need him he will be available but I think this season is probably one too many for him anyway and he needs to start thinking about moving on."

Finch, who played 162 ODIs for his country before being dropped in January, was also part of Australia's World XI team that played an exhibition match against Pakistan at the National Stadium in Karachi. He scored two off four balls as the Asia XI won by eight runs.

Yorkshire hope Finch makes a full recovery and is available to them for some games this season because they are looking forward to him playing with them again next year. They also want to see if he can force his way back into Australia's Ashes squad, which will be selected in September.

"We would like to think that we could have the luxury of having a player like Finchy around for next season and beyond," Moxon said. "If he is fit and playing well with us, it gives him an opportunity to stake his claim for an Ashes spot."

Finch has been offered a new two-year contract by Yorkshire but has not yet made a decision whether he will sign it or not. Finch has scored 72 runs in four Twenty20 matches during the PSL tournament and was due to play at least three more games for his team before the season finished with the final on Sunday.

In contrast, Finchy's former Victoria captain Rob Quiney has retired after playing for Surrey in England last year. He will be remembered by Yorkshire fans after being part of their successful title-winning side against Essex at Headingley in 2013 when he scored two centuries on his way to the county's first ever domestic one - day trophy.

Finch has also played for Sydney Sixers and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League over the last three years but failed to make a significant impact. He was released by both teams at the end of their respective 2017 seasons.

Moxon said: "He did OK for us in England. I know it is very difficult as a player to come here and get used to the conditions, the way you train & prepare - but he played well."

Finch made an unbeaten 99 against Durham at Chester-le-Street in August last year before finishing with figures of one for 17 and three stumpings during Yorkshire's rain - interrupted draw. He also scored 51 runs against Leicestershire at the Fischer County Ground, Leicester, in April but failed to make any significant contribution over the remaining four Championship matches played.

Finch has made a total of 207 appearances for Victoria since 2006 and was their captain from 2013 to last year before moving to Yorkshire. He scored 895 runs in 18 Tests with five centuries, including two against England at Trent Bridge & Lord's in 2013, when he also led Australia in the absence of Michael Clarke. Finch is currently ranked third among the top run-scorers for Victoria since the beginning of 2014 and has played in nine Sheffield Shield finals including two victories at Headingley.

Finchy's arrival at Yorkshire had been hailed by many of the club's members who were looking forward to seeing him play more matches at their ground after he was signed from Hampshire last year. Finch also played five times for Hampshire in 2016, scoring one century and three half centuries before joining the County Champions. He was offered a new two-year deal by them but Yorkshire offered more money to lure him away.

"It is always disappointing when we lose our players but I am sure that Finchy will be remembered for what he did for us," said Moxon, who praised the efforts of his coach Andrew Gale in helping Finch adapt to life at Headingley last winter. "We have been told that it was an outstanding effort by him and it is a shame because he has worked so hard."

Finchy played three games for Hampshire against Yorkshire in 2016, including two victories at the Rose Bowl, Southampton. He also scored 40 runs in two List A matches but failed to make any significant impact during his brief stay with them last year.

Finch was signed by Hampshire after they missed out on Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara when he joined Surrey and he helped the club finish as the runners-up in the Royal London One - Day Cup but failed to make a significant contribution during their Vitality Blast campaign. He also had a brief stint with Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League last season before joining Yorkshire

Finch was signed by Hampshire on 30 June, 2016 and played six Twenty20 matches for them during that season as well as four one - day internationals against South Africa and Australia. He made a total of eight appearances for the club in all formats before leaving at the end of last year when they failed to qualify for this summer's knockout stages of the T20 Blast competition.

Hampshire coach Gareth Mascarenhas said: "We are obviously disappointed not to be in this year's final but we are very pleased with what Aaron has contributed to our squad." Finch is also remembered by Hampshire fans for his batting in a 2013 match against Essex at the County Ground, Southampton, which was played under floodlights. He scored 87 not out off 43 balls as Hampshire finished on 199/5 to win the game by nine runs.

Finch had an outstanding season for Hampshire last year when he scored a career - best 1,263 runs in all formats including one
