Finch must recover from a hamstring injury if he is to arrive on schedule to play for Yorkshire again this summer.  
The 30-year-old Australian was signed by the English county last year and made his debut for them in May, hitting an unbeaten 85 against Derbyshire at Headingley .  
However, after a series of appearances in the NatWest T20 Blast this season, Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon revealed that Finch had suffered the injury in his last match for them against Nottinghamshire on August 6.   
"Aaron injured his hamstring during the game (against Notts) and will be assessed further," said Moxon.  
Moxon revealed that he expects to hear more about Finch's recovery within the next two weeks, with Finch due back at Headingley on September 6 .  
"He is certainly still part of our plans but we have got a number of options in this position," said Moxon. "We are going to use him in some of the pre-season friendlies before he comes over for us."   
The Australian will be hoping for a successful rehab after his hamstring injury so that he can play against Sri Lanka at Headingley on July 9, but whether that is possible remains to be seen.  
Finch's arrival has given Yorkshire a boost in the shortest format of the game and it would be a shame if their top run scorer missed out on some more opportunities for them .   
"He (Finch) will need time but we are hopeful that he will make his mark this summer," Moxon said.   
Moxon also confirmed that Sri Lanka were due to arrive at Headingley on July 26 and they will play two warm-up matches against Yorkshire before the first Test match between them .  
The match is due to take place from August 3 to 7, with Sri Lanka's players expected to be involved in a pre-series camp at the club starting on Monday.
