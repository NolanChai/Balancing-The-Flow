In an Instagram post on Sunday night, 23-year-old Belinda shared a photo of herself wearing a tunic and holding a plucked bird aloft outside the butcher shop in Greenwich.

She wrote that she had visited the store to buy a chicken for her Game Of Thrones-themed dinner party on Sunday night, when two employees refused to sell the animal to her because they found it 'inappropriate' and decided instead to call police.

Belinda said they asked why she was cooking a chicken as part of her Game Of Thrones celebrations but added: 'I just told them I like eating chickens'.

'The police came and threatened me with arrest if the shop continued to refuse selling me a chicken,' she wrote.

Belinda said the police told her they were investigating whether or not it was an offence for a butcher to refuse to sell meat based on 'personal beliefs' and that officers also warned her she could be charged with trespassing if she returned.

The woman, who works as a model, said the incident left her feeling humiliated by having been questioned by police after simply trying to purchase chicken for dinner.

After Belinda posted details about the incident online on Sunday night, the butcher, Greenwich Meats, issued a statement via Facebook denying she was refused service and accusing her of making up the story.

'We would like to clarify that we did not refuse service to this customer,' they said in response to Belinda's post.

The shop added that it had simply informed her that chickens are available for purchase only in packages of six or more.

The butcher then invited Belinda to return to the store to discuss the issue and asked her to contact the store directly if she needed assistance.

Belinda responded to Greenwich Meats' statement by accusing them of lying and claiming they had admitted to police that they had refused to sell a chicken to her because she was having a Game Of Thrones dinner party.

In the post, Belinda said Greenwich Meats had refused to sell her chicken and called police when they found out about her Game Of Thrones party - and that officers asked why she was cooking a chicken for it. She also claimed an officer told her she could be charged with trespassing if she returned

But Greenwich Meats took exception to Belinda's claims and replied, saying: 'We would like to clarify that the police have not contacted us regarding this matter. We do however understand why it may seem that we were involved.'

The butcher said they had informed a customer of their policy on chickens in response to her question about whether or not one was available and never contacted police when she admitted the chicken was for a Game Of Thrones party

In its statement, Greenwich Meats added that they would be 'happy to engage with this customer to discuss any concerns' and apologised for any 'distress caused by our approach'.

The woman also added that she had called the police herself to report the incident, saying she felt humiliated by having been questioned and threatened with arrest for trying to purchase a chicken for dinner.

She said when officers arrived at Greenwich Meats they told her they were investigating whether or not it was an offence for butchers to refuse to sell meat based on 'personal beliefs'.

Belinda also claimed police warned her she could be charged with trespassing if she tried to return to the store.

Greenwich Meats, however, again denied any wrongdoing in their response.

'We would like to clarify that we were not involved in this matter. We have been made aware of it after the fact,' they said on Facebook.

Greenwich Meats also said they did not have any personal beliefs regarding their decision to refuse to sell chickens and invited Belinda back to the store with an offer for 10 per cent off her purchase as well as a free drink for both of them.

'We would be happy to engage with this customer to discuss any concerns, but we feel it is important to address that we did not refuse service,' they added.

In an interview with news.com.au, Belinda said she had been humiliated by being questioned twice - firstly by Greenwich Meats and then again by police.

'I think it's crazy that they called the police,' she told the publication, adding: 'They didn't have to tell me they were investigating whether or not it was an offence for a butcher to refuse to sell meat based on personal beliefs.'

The woman also said she had never before experienced being questioned by police when trying to buy meat.

When asked what the butcher could be thinking when she came in looking to buy a chicken, Belinda replied: 'I don't know.'

Belinda told news.com.au that officers asked if she was having a Game Of Thrones party when they arrived at Greenwich Meats and why she was cooking the chicken. She added that an officer also asked her about whether or not the butcher had refused to sell meat based on their personal beliefs

Police also told Belinda there was not yet any official policy regarding whether it is illegal for a butcher to refuse to sell meat because of a customer's personal beliefs.

They also said they had been asked by Greenwich Meats to investigate the incident, according to news.com.au, which did not name the officer who reported Belinda to police or give any details on whether she was charged with anything.

Belinda told news.com.au that officers told her there were no charges for trespassing or for having a Game Of Thrones party and added: 'It's crazy, it shouldn't have been an issue.'

Greenwich Meats told news.com.au they would not be commenting on the matter further as Belinda had requested privacy for her and her family.

A spokeswoman for NSW Police said officers attended Greenwich Meats following a report by employees that they were concerned about the welfare of the woman.

'Officers advised the woman that it was not illegal to have a Game of Thrones themed dinner party, and did not arrest her or charge her with an offence,' she said in a statement.
