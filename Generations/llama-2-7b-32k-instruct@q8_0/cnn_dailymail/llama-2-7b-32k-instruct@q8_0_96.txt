Title: Antarctica experiences its warmest temperature ever
A new climate study claims that Antarctica has just experienced its hottest summer on record, with temperatures reaching 6.4°C (43.5 °F) at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the continent in late January and early February this year. That was almost 3 ° C above average temperatures for that time of year. The previous all-time record, set back in the 1900s, stood at 5.7 °C (42.3 °F). According to the researchers, a number of factors contributed to this extreme heat wave: a strong high pressure system over Antarctica that lasted for days and allowed hot winds from the continent's peninsula to reach Esperanza Base; an anomalously warm ocean near the Argentine station that caused sea ice to melt in that area, making it possible for the warm air to move into the region; and a weakening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which made conditions more favorable for warm water incursion. The team also noted that 2020 is the hottest year on record for much of Earth's land surface . This extreme weather event serves as a stark reminder of the effects of climate change, says the report's co-author, Sergio Tachella, from Argentina's Instituto Argentino de Investigaciones del Antártico. "The heat wave in January 2020 was unprecedented and shows how vulnerable the Antarctic ecosystem is to climate change," he told CNN . He points out that this kind of extreme weather has likely happened before, but with much lesser frequency: "When it comes to Antarctica, there's a lot we don't know. We're just starting to understand how the climate system works in this region." This is not the first time that Antarctica has experienced an unusual heat wave. The continent has been warming up since the 1950s and its ice is melting faster than scientists previously thought possible . Last month, a group of international researchers published a study showing that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse sooner rather than later if greenhouse gas emissions aren't drastically reduced. This would lead to sea levels rising 10 times faster than they are now . The study was based on computer simulations and observations over the past three decades, but the researchers say that there is still much we don't know about how Antarctica will respond to climate change in the future. However, one thing seems certain: extreme weather events like this summer's heat wave will become increasingly common as the planet warms up .
