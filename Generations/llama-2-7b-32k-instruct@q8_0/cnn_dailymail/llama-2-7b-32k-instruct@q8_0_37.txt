Carlos played for Brazil on more than 175 occasions during an illustrious career which saw him win major honours in Spain, Italy and Brazil and he is now eager to get involved in management. "Coaching is something I have always enjoyed," said Carlos, who has been linked with a return to former club Madrid.

"I find coaching very easy after what I went through as a player." He added: "I think it's easier because you can spend more time with players one-on-one than when you are playing. As a coach, you have to take charge of the whole team but you cannot do that if you don't know each player well enough."

The Brazilian World Cup winner, who is currently coaching Qatari club Al Wakrah, admitted he was not certain about his future plans but said: "I will make a decision by January. I have to see what is going on in the market because there are still players around who need to be signed."

Carlos, who retired as a player at the end of last season after spells with Brazilian outfit Flamengo and Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal, said: "I don't know what I am going to do but for sure it will not be in Europe. There are too many coaches there."

He added: "Brazil is the most beautiful country in the world, so of course Brazil would be very appealing to me. But it is also a country that needs a lot of work done with its football and I don't know if the national team or the clubs are going to call on someone like me."

Carlos, whose father died earlier this month aged 77, said he had no preference over which Brazilian club he would coach. "I have always liked Sao Paulo but there are a lot of other good teams in Brazil," he said.

The Brazilian has been linked with coaching Sao Paulo and his former team Madrid, who are looking for a new manager after firing Bernd Schuster this week. The 42-year-old is eager to return to the Spanish capital but also interested in coaching in England or Italy if he gets an offer. "I would like to coach abroad," said Carlos.

"There's no doubt that there are things I don't know about and that I will learn, but what I am sure of is that I am going to have a good time." The 2006 World Cup winner claimed coaching was 'easier' than playing as the pressures were not so intense.

"When you are a player, it doesn't matter if you win or lose," said Carlos. "There is always something going on in the media but when I am coaching my team, that isn't there."

Carlos admitted he was still struggling to come to terms with his retirement as a player and said: "It has been really difficult for me because it came all of a sudden," he said.

"I have been preparing myself mentally the whole time but I didn't expect my body to react like this." The former defender said the most important thing was now to be happy. "I am not doing anything at the moment, just enjoying life with my family," he added.

Carlos also revealed his admiration for Portuguese coach Luiz Felipe Scolari who led Brazil to World Cup glory in 2002 and said it had been a joy working with him. "I have enjoyed a lot coaching with Scolari because you know, when you work well together, everything is easy," he said.

"He likes his players to be happy because if they are not happy then the team isn't going to play very well."

Carlos said he had not yet decided whether he would take on any other roles in addition to being a coach as he enjoyed spending more time with his family and that was something which coaching did not offer. "I have been playing professionally for 20 years and I have never spent this much time at home," he said.

"When you are a player, your life is all about the team because every day there is training or games, so I am just enjoying spending more time with my family."

Carlos also insisted that he had no problems working in Qatar as it was a football-mad country and one which was eager to see him succeed. "People here are very friendly and they want you to be successful," he said. "It's not like other countries where the players have their own agendas. Here, everything is about the team."

Carlos, who joined Al Wakrah from Saudi Arabia's Ittihad last summer, claimed his side would win a championship in Qatar and that it was only a matter of time before they began to challenge for honours elsewhere. "We are going to win something," he said. "The way we have been playing, I am sure that the team will be stronger next season."

Carlos has also played down speculation linking him with Sao Paulo coach Luiz Felipe Scolari as the Brazilian club look for a new manager following the sacking of former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri. "I am not sure that I will be coaching in Brazil next season," said Carlos, who dismissed the speculation linking him to Sao Paulo as 'fake'.

"People are saying Scolari has been linked with me but it's fake because they have never called me." The Brazilian said he had not spoken to anyone from Sao Paulo and that there was no truth in the reports. "The president of Al Wakrah didn't even know what I was talking about," he added.

Carlos also played down talk linking him with Madrid, who have been linked with a number of coaches since Schuster was sacked earlier this week including former Barcelona boss Luis Enrique and Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone. "It's not true because I haven't even spoken to them," said the Brazilian.

"I am just happy where I am because I have a contract until 2012." Carlos also dismissed the speculation linking him with English clubs Liverpool and Newcastle as 'fake'. He added: "My agent hasn't spoken about anything like that yet."
