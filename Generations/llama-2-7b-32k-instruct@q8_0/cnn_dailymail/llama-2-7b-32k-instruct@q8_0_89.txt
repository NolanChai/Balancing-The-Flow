"I don't want my brother to see me on television like that," a grieving Mary Jane said Tuesday, referring to her little brother who is now back home in Indonesia, where she grew up before coming to this country. Mary Jane was just 19 years old when she and her mother moved to the Philippines for work . Her father had already left the family after the couple separated when she was a child . Mary Jane worked as a housekeeper and had been living with another woman's husband at that time, who had raped her on many occasions. The victim later killed herself and left behind three young sons -- Mary Jane's nephews . The attacker fled to Indonesia after the murder and was never found or held accountable for his crime in court . In 2011, Mary Jane Veloso was arrested with two kilograms of heroin hidden inside her luggage while trying to leave the Philippines on a plane headed home to Indonesia -- her passport had been stolen at that time, which she did not know . The police were convinced that she knew about the drugs and set out to trap her into admitting it herself . She denied all charges until her arrest warrant was signed by a judge three months later in October 2011 . Her lawyer was present with her when the arrest warrant was served, but Mary Jane said he had not yet arrived that morning to represent her . When she was interrogated and asked if she knew about the drugs hidden inside her luggage, she denied it three times -- before finally confessing because she feared for herself and wanted to go home to Indonesia as soon as possible."
