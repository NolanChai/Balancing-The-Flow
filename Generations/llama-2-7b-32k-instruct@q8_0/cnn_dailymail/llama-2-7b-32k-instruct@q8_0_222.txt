 Sarah Stage's first photos of her newborn baby boy were released Friday. The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for having a child with no plans to give it up for adoption, but instead to raise it herself. However, Stage said she would never be able to give up a baby, telling the Daily Mail at the time: "I've always wanted to adopt and I think that as soon as you become a mother it becomes very easy to see why we need to protect these little creatures."
