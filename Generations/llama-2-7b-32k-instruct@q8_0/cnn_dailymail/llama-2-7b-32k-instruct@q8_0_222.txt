The the first photos of Sarah Stage's healthy newborn baby boy have been released.

The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for posing nude while carrying her child, who is now a month old.

"I was criticized heavily by the media for taking these photos," Stage told CBS News. "They were really aggressive in attacking me and my choices."

Her critics accused the model of being selfish, but she defended herself, saying "it's not hurting anybody to be happy, it's not hurting anybody to enjoy life."

"I don't want people to think that just because I am a mother, now I have to give up my body. I still want to live and do whatever makes me happy," she added.

"My son is the best gift I could ever ask for, but he doesn't own me."

The controversy even spilled over into Stage's relationship with boyfriend, 46-year-old actor Gary Busey, who also came to her defense on social media.

"I think it's absolutely amazing and beautiful," Busey said of the photos. "It's a very special time in your life."

Stage is known for her outspoken nature -- she was arrested in 2010 for protesting against animal testing -- but told CBS News that her pregnancy wasn't a choice, it was something she had to go through because of her lifestyle.

"I had no idea when I got pregnant I would end up here," Stage said. "This isn't an act; this is me."

But while Stage has been open about her decision to have a child, she still has some regrets.

"I wish that my son would not be the product of the lifestyle I lead," she told CBS News. "It would be different if I was just like everyone else."

Stage said that being in the public eye for so long has made it hard to stay out of the spotlight and let her son grow up private, but she's proud of who he is and how much she loves him.

"He will know who his mommy is," she said. "And hopefully when I am dead and gone, he will be happy."

Stage also said that her son has brought out a new side to her.

"I have never been happier in my life," Stage said. "He's the best thing that has ever happened to me."

She hopes to share him with the world through her social media accounts and appearances, but wants people to focus on his personality over his parentage.

"The last thing I want is for him to grow up in a fishbowl," Stage said. "I don't want anybody to stare at him all day long."

Stage's son will be joining the family business of Busey and Stage, who also run an animal sanctuary together called The Gentle Barn.

"It's a great place for my son to grow up," Stage said. "He has already been to so many rescue organizations."

As for her critics? She says they can do what they want with their lives, but she won't change the way she is living it.

"I am happy and that's all I care about," Stage said. "I will always be me."
