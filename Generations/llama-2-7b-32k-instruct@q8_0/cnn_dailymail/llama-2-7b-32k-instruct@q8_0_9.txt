The anonymous pupil, who attends St Mary's Church of England Primary School in the northwestern town of Blackburn, wrote the note after she learned that the pair were due to tie the knot this weekend and that there was nothing she could do to prevent it

In the letter, she asks her teacher if there is "anything I can do" as her parents have threatened to kill her should she try to escape the union. She wrote: "I hope you know what my problem is. It's marriage. I'm already married. You see in India girls are given away by their family so it makes them a part of that family

She added: "My parents are going to kill me if they find out, so please don't tell anyone, and you mustn't let my parents know what happened because I can't leave my husband. Please help me"

The girl wrote in the letter that her partner was 25 years old and did not care about her or their future together.

She says she does not want to live a "double life" any longer, going from school to home where she is abused by her partner.

According to the letter's author, there is nothing she can do as the marriage has already been registered and is recognized in India. The girl also asks why her father gave away his daughter in marriage in church if he did not want it to happen.

The school's deputy head teacher Chris Sutton said: "We take the welfare of our pupils extremely seriously, especially those who are vulnerable and we are investigating this letter"

A spokeswoman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said: "It is deeply upsetting to hear about any situation where a child feels they are in danger or unhappy. We will be working closely with the school, the Local Safeguarding Children Board and other agencies as appropriate to ensure we do everything possible to keep the young person safe"

Blackburn and Darwen Council is one of nine local authorities that make up Lancashire County Council, England's biggest county in terms of population. It was established on 1 April 2009 after the abolishment of Blackburn with Darwen MBC

The county has been governed by Labour since 2013 and is the only urban area to return a Conservative MP in the General Election held this month

The region also holds the world record for the world's oldest person, currently held by Charlotte Hughes, who is 116 years old. She was born in Blackburn on July 4, 1902. The current Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has been a council leader since his election in 2015

In the past the town played host to one of England's largest and most popular football clubs: Blackburn Rovers who won the league three times between 1890 and 1893 before being relegated at the end of the season. The town also hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1975

An Indian girl who was just 13 years old has written a letter to her teacher begging her for help in stopping her arranged marriage. The anonymous pupil, who attends St Mary's Church of England Primary School in the northwestern town of Blackburn, wrote the note after she learned that the pair were due to tie the knot this weekend and that there was nothing she could do to prevent it.
