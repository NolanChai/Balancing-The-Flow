Made in Chelsea Cast: How They Earn Their Millions

If there is one thing the Made In Chelsea cast are known for it's their love of shopping. In fact, barely an episode goes by where they're not filmed swanning around the boutiques that line the fashionable streets of London - whether it be at Jimmy Choo or in the supermarket aisles at Selfridges. But what do we know about how much they've actually spent on clothes? And just how rich are they really? Well, we've taken a look at their estimated wealth and salaries to find out...

He also caused an uproar when he accused his ex, Jessica Hayes, of cheating and called her a "drama queen" in the press.
