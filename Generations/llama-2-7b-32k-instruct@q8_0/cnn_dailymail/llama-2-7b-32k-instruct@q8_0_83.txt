the Gunners for 21 years, says he is under pressure to field a strong team ahead of tomorrow's FA Cup clash against Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium in London. He insists his decision on whether to start with Nicklas Bendtner or Robin van Persie up front is not made until the morning before kick off, after assessing their training session and how they are feeling. Wenger also reveals he is under pressure from outside forces to play a full strength team against United so that it does not suffer in the Premier League as a result of the cup tie - but he is determined to stick with his best XI for this match. The Frenchman said: 'We will see tomorrow morning at training whether we can start with him (Bendtner) or Van Persie, and that will decide it.' The Arsenal boss also reveals in an interview in the Daily Mail on Thursday how he has agonised over team selection for tomorrow's match against United. He said: 'It's always a nightmare because you can be accused of making bad decisions or not having the guts to make good ones. The pressure comes from within and without. We want to do well in this competition but at the same time we want to perform well in the Premier League . It is a delicate balance, which requires the right decision.' Wenger has also revealed that he did not get on with Sir Alex Ferguson during his early days at Arsenal and had trouble understanding his manager's strong Scottish accent. The Gunners boss said: 'When you start as a young guy in the game, you have to find your way around it . I was not really used to hearing a foreign accent - and he has a strong one! There were things that we didn't understand about each other because of language.'
