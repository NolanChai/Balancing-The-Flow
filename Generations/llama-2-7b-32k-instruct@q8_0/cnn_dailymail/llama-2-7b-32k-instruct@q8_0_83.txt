"The manager says he only decides in the morning whether it is time to play Aubameyang or Lacazette up front."

Lacazette was benched against Southampton while Aubameyang started and scored. But Wenger, who has revealed that he usually makes his final decision on a Saturday before kick-off, says he also agonises over the choice throughout the week. "The manager says he only decides in the morning whether it is time to play Aubameyang or Lacazette up front."

"He added: "When I make my selection I have a very good idea of what could happen but you always want to be surprised by the players."

Wenger also confirmed that Jack Wilshere, who has played in midfield for the last three seasons, will not play as a central defender. The 26-year-old is back from an ankle injury and has been linked with a move away from Arsenal this summer, but Wenger says he "doesn't think" about it.

The manager also confirmed that Laurent Koscielny will play at the back against Swansea on Sunday in the first game of pre-season following their trip to Australia and Asia."
