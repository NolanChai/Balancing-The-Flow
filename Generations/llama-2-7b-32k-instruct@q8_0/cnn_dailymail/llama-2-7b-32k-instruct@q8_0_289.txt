"I am so sick and tired of this woman and her damn emails," says the unidentified Twitter user, whose handle is @realDonaldTrump .

It is unclear when or how @realDonaldTrump became a verified account; we reached out to Trump's campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response. We have since learned that this account was actually run by Trump in 2014 and 2015, during his first presidential bid.

In addition to the tweet about Clinton, @realDonaldTrump has also shared several anti-Hillary Clinton posts that are uncharacteristic of the candidate himself. In one such post, which was published in 2014, Trump writes: "If Hillary is elected President, you will be paying for everything. It's going to be a very sad day for our country."

While this account has been around for nearly three years now and is still active, it doesn't seem like Trump himself is involved. It appears that Trump's team decided to take advantage of the account to promote anti-Hillary Clinton sentiments among his followers. And apparently it worked: The tweet about Clinton has been retweeted 40 times and liked over 65,000 times.

The only problem? The person who is responsible for this account may not have the best intentions when it comes to running a campaign. While Trump's team does have access to @realDonaldTrump, which they use to share information about his campaign and connect with supporters, that doesn't necessarily mean they can manage this account in any way.

So how did we find out all of this? The account has been tweeting since April 2014--that's when it was created. And for the past couple of months, it appears to have been active only during Trump's campaign. So, if you take a look at whoever is running @realDonaldTrump's Twitter activity around this time, they seem to be working on pushing out tweets with hashtags like #MakeAmericaGreatAgain and #MAGA.

We also did some investigating and discovered that the person behind this account may not have been paying much attention to Trump's campaign platform since 2014. In a May 5, 2014 tweet, @realDonaldTrump wrote: "The Republican Party of today has become so corrupt and ineffective that they no longer represent our great Country. They have lost their soul!"

This account seems to have been used exclusively for pushing out Trump-related content until April 2016 when it suddenly began sharing anti-Hillary Clinton posts. These include tweets about Hillary's emails, Benghazi and other campaign related issues. But the person running the account hasn't even bothered to share any recent updates from Trump or his campaign team.

We checked out @realDonaldTrump's Twitter activity around this time and noticed that the account has been inactive for three weeks now--as of April 2016. So, whoever is responsible for managing this account seems to be ignoring Trump's official tweets entirely. It's possible that they just aren't aware that Trump no longer owns the account or they are too busy pushing out anti-Hillary Clinton posts to care about anything else.

In a statement to CNN, the campaign said: "The @realDonaldTrump account is managed by our social media team and doesn't necessarily represent the views of Mr. Trump."

But even if this account isn't officially affiliated with Donald Trump's campaign, it has been used repeatedly by his staff to push out anti-Clinton messages. And now that Trump is running for president again, it looks like they're using this account more than ever before.

A person close to the @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle told CNN: "We didn't create this account; we were just given access to it." The person did not want to be identified because they did not have permission to share information about how Trump's team manages his social media accounts. But the person said that, at most, @realDonaldTrump is only used to share campaign related updates and to respond to comments made on other Twitter users' posts.

So while we can't say for certain who is in charge of the @realDonaldTrump account or how they use it, we do know this: Trump's team has been pushing out anti-Hillary Clinton messages through the campaign's official Twitter handle since at least April 2016.

This doesn't seem like a good move for Trump and his campaign if he wants to win over female voters, who make up nearly half of the voting public. A recent poll found that women are more likely than men to vote Democratic this November. And in May, Trump reportedly made some anti-Clinton comments during an event with voters in New York City.

"I know people that have worked for her and I know the kind of emails that they've been getting," Trump told them. "And you see what's happening to her--and you take a look at her husband."

But if there is anyone running this account who should be ashamed, it's the person or group behind @realDonaldTrump. This person has taken advantage of this account by pushing out anti-Hillary Clinton sentiments that have no place in a campaign for president--especially one run by Donald Trump himself.

In fact, Trump himself hasn't tweeted about Clinton since April 2015 when he wrote: "I'm so tired of hearing Fake News about Hillary and her deleted 33K emails." That was it. No further explanation--just a blatant attack on one of his Democratic opponents without any proof whatsoever.

And apparently, this person doesn't even understand Trump's own views or campaign platform when it comes to Clinton. The tweets they keep pushing out seem to be coming from a person who is still clinging to 2014 memes instead of actually paying attention to Trump and his team in 2016.

So, until @realDonaldTrump can prove that it's not being run by someone with ulterior motives or lacking access to Trump and his campaign team, we won't be taking the account seriously as a source of information about the candidate himself.

We reached out to several of the people who had been retweeting the anti-Clinton tweets from @realDonaldTrump. They told us that they didn't know if the person running the account was Trump or someone else entirely, and did not want to discuss it further with us since the account doesn't seem to have a clear owner.

We will continue to monitor this account in case we find out anything more about its origins or who is using it now. But for now, all signs point to it being run by someone who is disconnected from Donald Trump and his campaign team--or at best, simply doesn't understand what they stand for when it comes to Clinton and her emails.

The tweet in question was originally published on May 5, 2016, at 3:48 p.m. The account has since been deactivated. We tried to find a way to contact the person behind this account but had no luck. It appears that whoever is running it decided to stop doing so after we published our story.

But, for now, let's just say we were disappointed by @realDonaldTrump's Twitter activity--or lack thereof. Because at the end of the day, it seems like they are simply using this account to push out anti-Hillary Clinton sentiments without any regard for Trump and his campaign's views or platform on the issue.

It appears that @realDonaldTrump has been a verified account since October 2015. This makes sense because we know that the person who is using it was clearly in charge of the account at this time--and they were sharing updates about Trump and his campaign team's events and appearances on Twitter at the time.

If you take a look at @realDonaldTrump's activity during the time it was verified, you can see that there are only three tweets posted between October 2015 and April 2016. Two of these were Trump's official announcement videos for his campaign in June 2015. And one is a retweet about Obama's State of the Union Address from February 2014 .

There was no activity between October 2015 and April 2016, but we have seen other activity on this account as recently as May 2017 when it posted an announcement to its 33.8 million followers about Trump's upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia.

So, whoever is using @realDonaldTrump needs to start paying more attention to what the candidate has been sharing on Twitter instead of just retweeting anti-Hillary Clinton posts from other users . Because that's not how you run a campaign for president--or even an account meant to represent someone running for office.
