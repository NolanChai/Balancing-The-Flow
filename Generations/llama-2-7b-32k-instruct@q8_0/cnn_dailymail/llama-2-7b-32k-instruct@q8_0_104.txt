Hannah Campbell was an active 20 - year - old when she was injured in Iraq by a roadside bombing that killed three other soldiers and injured her seriously. She suffered shrapnel injuries to the womb from which a fertilised egg had been implanted. The wound became infected, but doctors did not know if it would be fatal or simply harmful. The infection was eventually cured with antibiotics and she went on to have surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to remove the damaged tissue from her womb . She also had a hysterectomy, which made it impossible for her ever to give birth again, but would not affect her fertility. Her fiancee was unaware of what she had been through until they were engaged and he asked if there was any chance of her having children someday. Campbell was able to hold down a full - time job as an Army officer at Fort Bragg while pursuing her education online . She graduated with an associate's degree in general studies from the Community College of the Air Force in September 2016. She then transferred to Fayetteville State University, where she is studying psychology and expects to graduate next year. Campbell's family has been supportive throughout her challenges and her fiancee took a few months off work when she had surgery for the infection . They are now preparing for a September wedding at Fort Bragg that will include their daughter, Lexi-River.
