al says: “I don’t want pity.” She added: “It was just luck I survived.”

Hannah, 28 and a single mom, was seven months pregnant when she was hit by mortar fire on April 17, 2017 in Ramadi. She lost her unborn child but miraculously survived. After several surgeries, doctors told her the chances of becoming pregnant again were slim to none and she would not be able to have any more children. “I’ll never forget that day,” she said. But she didn’t give up hope.

“My dad was like, ‘You can’t get your hopes up because we don’t know what could happen,’” Hannah recounts. “But I knew if God wanted me to have another baby he would make a way.” In 2018, she married her boyfriend of two years, James Rivera, 32, who now also calls her daughter his own. They celebrated Lexi-River’s first birthday in December.

Hannah has been dealing with PTSD since the incident and wants people to be aware that there are many women suffering like she is. She hopes people will see “you can have hope” and encourages others not to give up despite a traumatic experience. “I just want them to know it’s okay to struggle but never lose hope,” says Hannah, who served as an Army corporal for eight years.

Hannah was hit by shrapnel while on a convoy in Iraq during Operation Inherent Resolve, where she was stationed at the time. “We were coming back from another mission and we got hit by mortar fire,” she explains. She lost her baby at 36 weeks of pregnancy but survived with severe injuries to her head, neck, legs and womb.

“I had a hematoma the size of a basketball on my stomach, I broke both femurs, and I dislocated both knees,” she says. “We were rushed into surgery immediately. After two surgeries for the femur, they told me that we could lose the baby if they didn’t fix everything because it was so traumatic to my body.”

She underwent a third surgery that day but had to wait eight hours for doctors to finally extract shrapnel from her abdomen. “They pulled out over 35 pieces of shrapnel and I lost the baby,” she says, recalling that her doctor gave her about an hour left to live after telling him it was her last time to speak because he thought her injuries were too severe.

“I was bleeding so badly they told me my uterus had ruptured and there’s no way I could have another baby,” she recounts. “They did an emergency hysterectomy, took my ovaries out.” The doctors also performed a colostomy procedure because her colon was hit with shrapnel.

“I just remember being on the gurney and thinking ‘this is it,’” she says, recalling that she felt “a peace come over me,” despite the pain. She spent five days in surgery recovering but had to endure several other surgeries because of her injuries. After staying at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for two months, she was transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, where she stayed for another four months before being discharged.

But while on her way home from the hospital, doctors had a surprise for her: “They said I could have another baby if we wanted,” she says, recalling that they put her and James’ names together because “we knew we were meant to be.” She got pregnant about eight months after giving birth to Lexi-River in January 2019.

“I was so happy I was going to have another chance at motherhood,” she says, adding that it was hard to hear the news while still recovering from her first surgery. “It was hard because I had just lost a baby,” she adds, but also knowing there’s always hope is what gave her strength. She was five months pregnant when she came back for another round of surgeries and it was during this time that she realized she could have another child after all.

“It was a blessing to be able to be a mom again,” she says, noting that people might think she’s crazy but they just had to look at her face to see “how happy I am.” She has a message for other women who lost their children: “Don’t ever give up hope. It takes one person to make a change in your life and it could be anyone,” she says, adding that God has a plan for everyone even if things don’t seem easy right now.

“Just have faith because you never know what tomorrow brings,” she advises them. “You can always have hope.”

She hopes people who struggle with infertility will find inspiration in her story and to not lose hope despite the odds being against them. She also wants women like her who lost their children or had complications during pregnancy to know that it’s okay to struggle but “never give up.” “I am living proof miracles do happen,” she says, adding that people can make a difference in each other’s lives by inspiring hope.

“I know I can’t change the world, but just by me sharing my story it could touch one person to not give up on themselves or their families,” Hannah says. “It doesn’t matter what you come from, there is always a way.” She believes that people will always rise again even if they don’t think they can. “You have to believe in yourself and never lose hope,” she concludes.

Hannah said she was so excited when she found out she was pregnant after giving birth to her daughter and was also worried because of the complications that came with having a hysterectomy. But doctors told her everything would be okay, which it has been. She says she is just happy to have another chance at motherhood and feels blessed every day to be able to raise both girls.

The former soldier is also hopeful for the future because “there’s so much more we can do” for other women who lost their children during pregnancy or had complications. She wants to give back by encouraging those women to never lose hope and that she will help them get the care they need despite the odds being against them.

“I just want everyone to know you’re not alone because there are people out here rooting for you,” she says, adding that she is one of those people “rooting” for all women who lost their children and for others who may be struggling with infertility.

“Just keep pushing through the darkness,” she says, reminding everyone to always believe in themselves despite what they are going through.

Hannah is also grateful to God for bringing her family together by blessing them with another child. “I feel like I am blessed and that there’s a reason why I was able to survive both times,” she says, noting that she feels bad if people think she got lucky when it comes to having two children after everything she went through.

“If anything you just have to look at me and see how happy I am,” she says, adding that Lexi-River’s first birthday was also a miracle for her and that she had a lot of people who prayed with her to make it happen. “I feel blessed because we did it together.”

She is hopeful that other women who lost their children will find inspiration in her story and will not give up despite what they are going through. She encourages them to never lose hope and to always believe in themselves. “You’re not alone,” she says, adding that there are people out there rooting for them every day.

She also wants to make sure other women know that it is okay to struggle but not to give up because God has a plan for everyone, even if things seem difficult right now. “It doesn’t matter what you come from, there is always a way,” she says.

“I just want people to see they can have hope and keep pushing through the darkness,” she concludes. “Just believe in yourself because that’s all it takes.”

Hannah says she has faith in God and knows he will make everything okay. She also wants people to know that there is always a reason for everything happening in their lives, even if they don’t see it now.

“God makes a way out of no way,” she says, adding that everyone should have faith because miracles do happen every day and “we just have to believe.” She says people can make a difference in each other’s life by inspiring hope and reminds them not to give up on themselves or their families.

“We have to always remember there are others out here who need help,” she says, adding that they should never lose hope because there is always someone out there who will make things happen for them. She also wants people to know that it’s okay to struggle but not to give up and that God has a plan for everyone.

“I don’t want pity because I am blessed,” she says, adding that her daughter
