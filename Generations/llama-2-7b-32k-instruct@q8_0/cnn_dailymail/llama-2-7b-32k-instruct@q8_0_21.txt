man's head, hands and feet have been separated from the torso, with the right hand still clutching some objects - including a gold ring and two silver coins, which are thought to be of Spanish origin. The mummy was found on a street in the town of Huaraz, in the Ancash region of northern Peru. The cleaners uncovered it while sweeping up debris following heavy rain earlier this month, according to local media. A forensic anthropologist has since arrived at the scene to determine how old the mummy is and whether it died a violent death, police told the BBC. Pre-Columbian archaeological finds in Peru are not uncommon: in 2018, a tomb with more than 50 mummies was found in the coastal town of Trujillo while authorities also unearthed a 970-year-old mummy during construction on the Lima metro.

The word "mummy" is used for the bodies of certain ancient peoples preserved by funerary techniques such as those used to prepare Egyptian mummies, particularly in Egypt. The word can also be used to describe a human body that has been preserved without funeral rites, either intentionally or accidentally. In many cultures, a person's flesh was left to rot after death due to the lack of technology and medicine to preserve it. But in Peru, bodies were dried and sealed with herbs for preservation; this process is known as mummification. It's unclear how old the latest Peruvian mummy found is, but archaeologists have previously dated some pre-Columbian human remains in Peru to over 900 years ago - such as those of the Chincha people, which are now more than 1,500 years old.

According to a report by Peru's Ministry of Culture and the country's National Institute of Culture, the discovery of this ancient Peruvian mummy is important because it provides knowledge about the cultural practices used in pre-Hispanic times in different regions of the Andean countries. The find also allows for research to be carried out on how these bodies were preserved and why they were separated from their heads, hands, and feet.

It's worth noting that in some cultures, such as those practiced by the Incas, mummies would often be placed inside ceramic vessels along with food for the deceased to take into the afterlife. This practice is known as "mummy bundles." The Inca culture was known for its advanced engineering and building techniques, and it's possible that this latest Peruvian mummy found could have been part of such a ritual or offering.

In conclusion, the discovery of this 900-year-old mummy in Peru provides valuable information about the cultural practices used in pre-Hispanic times and allows for research to be carried out on how these bodies were preserved and why they were separated from their heads, hands, and feet. It's a fascinating find that offers insights into the rich history of Peruvian culture.

A cleaner who feared a body he found was a murder victim had in fact discovered a  900-year-old mummy. The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru. The man's head, hands and feet have been separated from the torso, with the right hand still clutching some objects - including a gold ring and two silver coins, which are thought to be of Spanish origin.

The mummy was found on a street in the town of Huaraz, in the Ancash region of northern Peru.
