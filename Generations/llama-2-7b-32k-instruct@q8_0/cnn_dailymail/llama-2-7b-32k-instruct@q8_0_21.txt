Moreno Flores, who is in charge of archaeology at the Museum of Archaeological and Anthropological Studies at the University of Piura in northwestern Peru, was called to the scene after a group of workers found the body while sweeping up rubbish outside an ancient tomb.

"We've never had such an interesting find," Moreno Flores said on his Facebook page.  "This is the first time we have seen these kind of mummified remains in Piura."
