The 34-year-old mother-of-three, who has millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube, opened up about her own struggles with body image in the new clip posted on Tuesday, which shows a compilation of nasty comments from trolls who have criticised Ho’s appearance.

“The biggest thing that I’ve dealt with is people are always telling me to lose weight,” she said at the start of her video titled ‘You Won’t Believe What People Say About Me’. “But when I lost 30 kilograms, they didn’t think I was skinny enough.”

Ho then revealed that viewers have often accused her of being too fat or overweight for the fitness industry and said she’s struggled with depression because of such negative feedback. She added that trolls also called her “pudgy” in a number of comments, which Ho said was particularly hurtful considering she has had body image issues since her early 20s when she first started working as a model.

“People have said ‘Hey Cassey you’re really fat and ugly,’ and I don’t even know what to say,” she continued. “I used to cry every night because of the bullying.”

The former Miss Australia has been candid about her struggles with self-acceptance in previous social media posts, revealing in 2018 that she was diagnosed with body dysmorphia and said it took her seven years to come forward after battling depression. She also revealed she had a “pretty low” self esteem as a teenager.

Ho’s latest video comes two weeks after she spoke about the abuse she received on social media while pregnant with her third child, Harper, whom she gave birth to in December 2018. She said that being bullied and trolled was particularly challenging when she was expecting as people accused her of not being able to lose weight or tone up quickly enough after becoming a mother for the first time at age 30.

Ho’s latest video has been viewed more than 25,000 times in less than 12 hours and has sparked praise from fans on Instagram and YouTube for her candid response to body shaming. “We need more women like you speaking up,” one person wrote. Another added: “Thank you Cassey for sharing this part of your story - it’s really important.”

In addition to her social media platforms, Ho is the founder of the global fitness company Blogilates, which has millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram. The mother-of-three also runs a successful online clothing line called Cassey by Me and recently announced a new partnership with the popular lingerie brand Adore Me.

In an interview with News.com.au in 2018, Ho said she has “always been confident” and never let bullying affect her personal or professional life. She added that her upbringing was also key to her self-esteem as a young woman. Her parents gave her the confidence and tools to stand up for herself from a young age.

“I had an amazing childhood where I grew up with my brother, so we used to fight all day,” she said at the time. “But my parents always told us to ‘fight fair’ because they didn't want any fights to escalate.”

As a result of her positive outlook on life and fitness empire, Ho has become one of Australia’s most successful social media influencers - but she has never forgotten her roots and makes it a point to regularly give back to the community through free classes for the underprivileged. She is also heavily involved with anti-bullying initiatives including the Blue Ribbon Foundation, which provides support services and education to children who have been bullied or are at risk of being bullied.
