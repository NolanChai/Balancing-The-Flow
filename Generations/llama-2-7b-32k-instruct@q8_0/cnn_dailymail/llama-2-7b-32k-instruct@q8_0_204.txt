I've always loved the look and feel of a well - made, hand - crafted wooden boat; you can imagine how excited I was when I heard about the concept of Boatel, where the same principles are applied to a unique kind of 'boatel'. They're not just a boat or hotel - they're a new kind of accommodation that combines the best aspects of both. Their aim is simple: "To bring people together and give them an unforgettable experience in a beautiful, handmade, floating home". You can find Boatel in Austin, Texas where it has been lovingly transformed from an old barge into a luxury getaway that offers all the comforts of land but with the excitement of being out on the water. There are 25 cabins and a large community space with dining table, communal kitchen, fire pit and hot tub. They have activities to keep you busy - kayaking, paddle boarding, sunset cruises, or just relaxing in the hammocks and loungers around the boat. And at night you can enjoy a cocktail in their bar before retiring to your cabin which has its own private bathroom with shower. It's the ultimate combination of luxury, comfort, and adventure!
