since he left the club in 2013, although it was a low key start to his comeback .

It is not clear whether or when Pietersen will make his return to match action at Surrey. The England batsman said earlier this month that he had been offered a two-month deal by the county and there have been reports of him being set for a first outing on 15 May in a T20 match against Hampshire .

Pietersen, who has not played professional cricket since his last international appearance against South Africa at The Oval in September 2014, was seen chatting to Surrey's coaches and having some batting practice before he left the ground. He declined to speak to media."

The former England batsman is yet to sign a contract with Surrey but it would seem likely that a deal will be signed in the next couple of days . Pietersen said earlier this month: "I'm hopeful I can get back out there and make an impact for the club I love."

Pietersen also tweeted on Monday evening: "Never seen so much excitement from 20 kids at a training session. The Surrey Cricket Academy is bubbling with talent."

England coach Trevor Bayliss said last month that Pietersen could return for the tour of South Africa in November but it would only be if he was playing well and gaining form . Pietersen has yet to play at a county level since leaving Surrey despite reported interest from several other counties .

"I am not sure where it (Pieterson's fitness) is because I haven't seen him in action," Bayliss said. "But if he was fit and playing well then he would certainly be on the radar."

However, the England coach admitted that there has been little contact from Pietersen since being named as coach last year .

"I think it is more one of 'you are doing fine and we're happy with what you're doing'," Bayliss said. "I haven't had anything (from him) apart from a text to wish me luck."

Bayliss has admitted that he could be open to bringing Pietersen back in to the England fold if he were playing well for Surrey, although he is not sure how he would fit into the current set-up. "That's what I need to figure out," Bayliss said."

The 34-year-old South Africa-born Pietersen was a member of England's World Cup winning team in 2007 but his last appearance for England came against India at The Oval in September 2014 . He was dropped by the ECB in October 2013 after breaching its player conduct policy following an alleged altercation with England's South Africa-born wicketkeeper Matt Prior."

Pietersen, who has played for Surrey since he left his native country as a teenager, said last month that he was still committed to cricket and wanted to play at the top level . The right-handed batsman had been linked with several other counties including Kent and Essex but Surrey were eventually able to persuade him back."

"I am excited about being part of the team," Pietersen said. "The club is in a good position to go forward and I'm excited to be part of it ."

Surrey are due to start their 2016 season against Essex at The Oval on 3 April."

Pieterson, who will be hoping to emulate England skipper Joe Root by scoring a century for his county in the match, has been given a warm welcome back . A picture of him was circulated on social media as it appeared he had been working with Surrey's training staff at the Oval ground."

"KP looks good to go," one fan tweeted after seeing the image. "Can't wait to see him in action for Surrey soon."

Another tweeted: "Glad KP is back where he belongs!" while a third said: "Great to have you back Kevin - we've missed your batting.""

Pieterson was not the only England star in attendance at Monday morning's training session. James Vince, another of the ECB's current crop of uncapped players who are on the verge of playing first-class cricket, was also seen chatting to coaches."

England have also signed South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock and left-arm fast bowler Vernon Philander ahead of this summer's four-match Test series against South Africa . Both players are in the country but have yet to be formally announced by Surrey."

Philander is due to make his competitive debut for Surrey when they play Middlesex at Lord's on 10 May, while De Kock is expected to make a first appearance in county cricket against Durham at The Oval on the same day.

Pietersen will be hoping that he can follow in the footsteps of England batsman Joe Root who has already played for Surrey before making his Test debut . Root was signed by the county last year and went on to play eight first-class matches for them ahead of making his Test debut against New Zealand at Lord's."

Pietersen is due to be in action for Surrey in a 20 over match against Middlesex at The Oval on 15 May . He was not named in the squad for the match."

England have been reeling from their disastrous Ashes series, where they were humiliated 4-0 by Australia Down Under and Pieterson has been linked with a possible return to the England set-up."

"I am excited about being part of the team," Pietersen said. "The club is in a good position to go forward and I'm excited to be part of it ."

Pietersen, who played 74 Tests for England before he was controversially dropped by the ECB last year, has been linked with a return to the international scene . He admitted last month that he was "hopeful" about returning but only if he was playing well."

The ECB have not yet confirmed whether or when Pietersen will play for Surrey . A spokesperson said: "Kevin is due to make his first appearance for the club on 15 May in a T20 match against Middlesex at The Oval . We're looking forward to welcoming Kevin back into the team."

"It's a great day for Surrey Cricket," said Paul Burstow, the club's chief executive officer . "Kevin is an exceptional player with immense ability and we are delighted he has chosen to join us at this time in his career. He brings enormous experience, both on and off the field, to our dressing room and we look forward to seeing him make his Surrey debut."

Surrey chairman Richard Thompson added: "Kevin is a true professional with a great passion for the game of cricket . His hunger to succeed at all levels is something that we want as part of the Surrey family. We have been working hard on putting together an exciting team that will compete in this year's County Championship and T20 Blast, but Kevin's addition will also allow us to challenge for honours across all formats."

Pietersen has previously admitted he is still "keen" to play for England again . He told the Independent last month: "I am hopeful about returning in a playing capacity. If I can get my form back and start playing well then it could be an option. At this stage, I don't know."

The ECB are yet to confirm if Pietersen will play for Surrey but he is due to make his first appearance at The Oval on 15 May when the county face Middlesex in a T20 match . Pieterson said earlier this month: "I am hopeful I can get back out there and make an impact for the club I love."

Pietersen's return to Surrey is also expected to be welcomed by England coach Trevor Bayliss who has admitted that he could consider bringing Pietersen back into the England set-up if he was playing well .

"I am not sure where it (Pieterson's fitness) is because I haven't seen him in action," Bayliss said. "But if he was fit and playing well then he would certainly be on the radar."
