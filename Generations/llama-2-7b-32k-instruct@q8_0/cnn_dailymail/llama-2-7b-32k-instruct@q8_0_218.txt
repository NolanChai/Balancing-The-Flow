The former England batsman spent two decades at the Oval as a player but left in September 2014, only days after an Ashes series defeat by Australia. Pietersen had said he wanted to return home to South Africa and was reportedly offered a job with Cricket South Africa.

However, he decided against moving his young family from London and instead signed for Surrey earlier this month in a deal until the end of this season that will see him take on coaching duties as well as play. Pietersen has not played at Surrey since 1996 but still holds the club's batting record having scored 23,408 runs over his career with them. He had a brief spell with South Africa in between leaving England for good, scoring 427 against Zimbabwe in 2015 and four Test matches for the country in 2016 but it was not enough to earn him a recall ahead of England's recent tour of South Africa.

Surrey chairman Richard Thompson said Pietersen had "the full backing" of his club's coaches, although it is unclear whether that includes current Surrey captain and England batsman Rory Burns. The 27-year-old has played under Pietersen for the past two seasons at Surrey but was a member of an England squad which he did not join until after his arrival in South Africa, leaving Burns out of the side to allow him to rejoin the team.
