Bendinska, 37, has been living on benefits and receiving free accommodation at a hostel for asylum seekers since October last year. He made an application to remain in the UK but when his appeal was refused earlier this month it meant he had spent around £105,000 in legal aid before he could be deported - despite the fact he has been detained for almost two years. Bendinska is wanted by Lithuanian authorities on suspicion of murder and attempted murder over a shooting spree in January 2013, which left two men dead and four injured. But while the Lithuanian government are trying to get him extradited back home, he has been living it up with his family in Leeds. Bendinska was detained at Yarl's Wood detention centre near Bedford on June 10, 2015 but released without being deported due to the complexity of his case. Since then he has been given free accommodation and legal aid while his appeal continued against his extradition. He was refused leave to remain in the UK on October 24 after a judge at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled there were “substantial grounds” for believing he would be tortured if he returned to Lithuania.
