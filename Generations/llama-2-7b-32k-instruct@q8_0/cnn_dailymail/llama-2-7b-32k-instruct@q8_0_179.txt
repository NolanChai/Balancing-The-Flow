Gangster Kestutis Uladzisas Dzheus, 37, was extradited from the UK to Lithuania last year, but is now back in British custody again after claiming he has become too depressed to return to his home country. Mr Dzheus told a judge that being returned would be "detrimental" to him and would cause "irreparable harm". Mr Dzheus was arrested last year on Lithuanian arrest warrant relating to two murders in his home country. He was extradited but within hours of arriving at Vilnius airport, he claimed asylum on the grounds that he feared returning due to his mental health issues, The Independent reported . A judge has now ruled he must be returned after ruling Lithuania had not violated Mr Dzheus' rights under European Union law. Lawyers acting for the Home Office told the court there was no doubt Mr Dzheus feigned mental illness to avoid extradition and added that there was a high probability he would commit further crimes if allowed to remain in Britain. Judge Stephen Kramer agreed, saying Mr Dzheus had made up his claims of depression "for tactical purposes".
