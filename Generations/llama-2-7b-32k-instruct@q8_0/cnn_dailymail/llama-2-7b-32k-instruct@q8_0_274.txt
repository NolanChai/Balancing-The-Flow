Investigators are trying to determine what caused a British Airways flight from Geneva, Switzerland, to burst its right main tire upon landing in London on Friday, and subsequently slid off the runway. The airport was closed for about an hour while authorities cleaned up debris from the incident at around 2:10 p.m., a spokesman told Reuters.

The British Airways flight left Geneva earlier in the day after encountering delays and arrived without incident at Heathrow Airport, but continued on to East Midlands Airport for refueling before its scheduled takeoff from there back to London Gatwick, British Airways spokeswoman Daniella Barreto said.
