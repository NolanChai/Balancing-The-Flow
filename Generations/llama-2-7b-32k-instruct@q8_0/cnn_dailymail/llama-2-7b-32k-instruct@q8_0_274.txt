[INST] What would be the first thing you'd do if you were appointed Governor of Hawaii? [/INST]

1. I would work to strengthen the relationship between Hawaii and its neighboring islands, promoting cooperation and collaboration in areas such as education, transportation, and economic development. 
2. I would work to increase access to affordable healthcare for all residents of Hawaii, particularly those who are uninsured or underinsured. This could include expanding Medicaid, implementing universal healthcare, and supporting community-based initiatives to improve health outcomes. 
3. I would work to reduce the carbon footprint of the state by promoting renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, encouraging energy efficiency, and working with local governments and businesses to transition away from fossil fuels. This could include implementing a statewide ban on single-use plastics and other environmentally harmful materials. 
4. I would work to improve educational opportunities for all students in Hawaii, particularly those in rural and underserved areas. This could include increasing funding for public schools, improving teacher training and retention, and investing in STEM education programs. 
5. I would work to increase access to affordable housing for all residents of Hawaii, particularly those who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. This could include implementing rent control measures, providing subsidies for low-income families, and promoting development in areas where there is a shortage of affordable housing. 
6. I would work to increase access to affordable childcare for all families in Hawaii, particularly those who are struggling to pay for childcare services. This could include implementing tax credits or other financial assistance programs for families with young children, providing subsidies for low-income families, and promoting high-quality early childhood education programs. 
7. I would work to improve the state's infrastructure, particularly in rural areas where roads, bridges, and other infrastructure are lacking. This could include investing in transportation projects, improving public services, and supporting local businesses that rely on infrastructure. 
8. I would work to increase economic development in under-resourced communities, particularly those in urban areas. This could include creating jobs through new businesses or the expansion of existing ones, providing entrepreneurship opportunities for local residents, and promoting community-driven economic development initiatives. 
9. I would work to improve public safety and security, particularly in urban areas where crime rates are high. This could include investing in law enforcement, providing resources for mental health services, and supporting rehabilitation programs for offenders. 
10. Finally, I would work to promote tourism and cultural preservation in Hawaii, while ensuring that the state's unique culture and traditions are protected. This could include investing in cultural education programs, promoting sustainable tourism practices, and supporting local businesses that rely on cultural tourism.

These are just a few examples of what I would do if appointed Governor of Hawaii. My top priority would be to listen to the concerns and ideas of residents and work collaboratively with them to address the state's most pressing challenges.

This includes investing in teacher training and compensation, providing students with the resources they need to succeed, such as laptops and internet access, and working to eliminate the achievement gap between white students and students of color.
