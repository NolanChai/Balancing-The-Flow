Two-year-olds, Eli and Silas, were discovered deceased on Sunday morning at about 10:45 a.m. by a passerby who spotted them hanging out of the canal after falling in while playing at the park. The boys were playing in Yuma's Centennial Park when they fell into an irrigation ditch, according to authorities.

The mother was present and witnessed the incident, but she left shortly before the police arrived. After being found unresponsive, Eli and Silas were transported to a hospital where they were pronounced dead. Authorities have not revealed why their mother left them alone in the park.
