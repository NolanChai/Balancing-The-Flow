. The pair have been in Kerobokan prison since their arrest on October 12, 2005. They face the death penalty if convicted of trafficking heroin into Indonesia. 
The trial of Myuran and Andrew is set to begin again in February 2017 . In December last year, Andrew was granted a retrial after a panel of judges decided that evidence against him should be re-examined. The panel also threw out the death penalty for both men and replaced it with life imprisonment without parole

Ahead of Friday's birthday and the resumption of Andrew Chan's trial in February 2017, Myuran has penned an open letter to Indonesia's president Joko Widodo asking for clemency . The letter was sent on Wednesday through his lawyer, Julian McMahon. In the letter, he wrote of the pain and humiliation endured in prison over the past decade as well as the difficulties faced by their families at home in Australia.
"I am now facing a retrial on the Bali Nine charges which I do not expect to succeed," Myuran writes . "My lawyers are confident that there is insufficient evidence against me and the new prosecution witnesses have admitted they were coerced into making statements against me."
"I understand this process will take a long time, but the risk of being executed at some point in the future remains," he continues. "In any case I am prepared to pay the full penalty for my crime if that is what you wish and hope this clemency appeal allows me to do so with grace."
The letter goes on to note Myuran's regrets for his actions, and says that over time he has come to realise the enormity of the pain caused by drug trafficking . He writes about the impact of drugs in Indonesia and how their trade has "destroyed Indonesian communities".
"I have been asked to reflect on my life as part of this appeal and I cannot help but feel that if only I could go back in time I would try to make better choices," he adds. "But I am who I am now, a man with regrets but without excuses." Myuran also speaks about his fatherless childhood and how the absence of a positive male role model impacted on him as a youth .
In August this year, Amnesty International published a report that highlights the human rights violations that occur in Kerobokan prison. It details the conditions that prisoners are subject to, including being forced to work up to 18 hours a day without proper compensation and living in unsanitary and overcrowded cells .
"My family is very aware of the many abuses of power by Indonesian authorities in the prisons where they have relatives," Myuran writes in his letter. "Their suffering, however, pales in comparison with what I have suffered."
He goes on to say that his life has become a matter for political point scoring and he wishes the media could just let him be . "I would ask you not to use me as a political football," Myuran writes to President Joko Widodo. He says his birthday will be spent with other prisoners in Kerobokan prison, where they will have been forced to work all day and will still be locked up until 8pm .
The letter concludes: "I am now facing a retrial on the Bali Nine charges which I do not expect to succeed. My lawyers are confident that there is insufficient evidence against me and the new prosecution witnesses have admitted they were coerced into making statements against me." (Supplied)

The letter comes after Myuran Sukumaran's wife, Chinthu, penned a plea for President Joko Widodo to commute her husband's death sentence . She also wrote about the impact of losing her husband on her two daughters and how they have suffered in their own right as a result of his arrest and imprisonment .
"I feel as though I am not whole without him, I do not know what this life is all about any more," she said . "Please Joko Widodo, my heart begs you to listen to me. Do whatever it takes in your power to save Myuran's life."

The letter also comes as the Australian Government and President Joko Widodo are scheduled to meet in Sydney this weekend. A spokesperson from Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop's office has been asked about whether Myuran Sukumaran's case will be raised during the meeting .
"As Minister Julie Bishop said recently, we have made our position on clemency clear," a spokesperson told AM . "We do not believe there is a basis for Indonesia to grant clemency."
"Indonesia has established procedures under their law that they must follow if they are to grant clemency," he said. "Australia has not raised this with the President but we have made our position clear on several occasions and we will continue to do so."
The spokesperson said there were currently no plans for Myuran Sukumaran's family to visit Indonesian president Joko Widodo or Minister of Law and Human Rights Yasonna Laoly .
"We are in regular contact with the Indonesian Government at all levels on this matter," he added. "Indonesia has also established a protocol for prisoners that has been adhered to consistently."

In August 2014, Amnesty International published a report that highlighted the human rights violations in Kerobokan prison where Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are imprisoned . The report detailed the conditions that prisoners were subject to including forced labour and living in unsanitary and overcrowded cells.
In his letter, Myuran wrote about how he is aware of these human rights violations and knows it has been difficult for his family to deal with them . "I would ask you not to use me as a political football," he said . "My life has become a matter for political point scoring and I wish the media could just let me be."
Amnesty International's director of campaigns, Felice Gerosarno, welcomed Myuran Sukumaran's letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo asking for clemency. "We think it's a very powerful letter," she told AM . "The way that he talks about the pain and suffering of his family is really heartbreaking."
"He also talks about how he has regrets over what he did but he doesn't have any excuses," Ms Gerosarno said. She added that Myuran Sukumaran's letter was a reminder to the Indonesian Government of the impact that his death penalty could have on his family, not just himself . "It really highlights the need for Indonesia to abolish the death penalty."
Amnesty International has called on the Indonesian Government to commute Myuran Sukumaran's and Andrew Chan's sentences to life imprisonment without parole . It is also calling for an investigation into the allegations of human rights violations in Kerobokan prison where they are held, as well as a review of the death penalty.
"The trial should be halted and the charges against Myuran and Andrew dismissed," Ms Gerosarno said . "These men have been subject to an unfair trial with coerced witnesses."

The Australian Government is refusing to make a formal request on behalf of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan to the Indonesian President, despite their pleas for clemency . The decision has been met with outcry from human rights groups .
"It's shocking that the government has refused to step up to the plate," Ms Gerosarno said . "They have a moral obligation to these men and their families."
