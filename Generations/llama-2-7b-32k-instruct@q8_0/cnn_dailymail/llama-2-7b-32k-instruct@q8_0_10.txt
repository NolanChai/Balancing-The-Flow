ents, stretchers, blankets and food to the fans are being shared in a bid to trace their identities and tell their stories.

The photos were taken by a student from the University of Liverpool who was at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest that day. The match took place on February 20th 1989, but it is perhaps more widely known as the Hillsborough disaster after the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans in a crush outside the stadium which followed kick off.

The photos were published by the Daily Mirror at the time and have now been shared to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign's social media account along with an appeal for people to share their names, addresses or any other information they can about them.

"We are looking for help identifying these people in this photograph," the appeal reads.

"If you recognise anyone in this image from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, please contact us."

A spokesperson added: "These wonderful human beings deserve to be remembered and named."

The campaign says that if people can't identify any of those pictured, they should share their own photos of the match or any other information they have about Hillsborough.

"If you cannot identify anyone in this image from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster please share your own images from Hillsborough - whether that be photographs or video footage," they added.

A number of fans are pictured helping their fellow fans after the incident, with one man seen carrying a stretcher and another taking a fan's hand as he is led away from the pitch.

The Hillsborough Justice Campaign said the pictures show Liverpool supporters at their "best" despite the tragedy which saw many of them lose family members in the disaster.

"It is unfortunate that these people were never named or celebrated," they added.

"We are asking our followers to share this image on social media, with any information about the individuals in the picture and their involvement in the Hillsborough campaign."

The investigation into the disaster was reopened by the CPS in 2014 following a report published by David Davis MP. The report recommended that an independent judge led inquiry be held to establish the truth of what happened at Hillsborough on that day and it was announced earlier this year that the victims' families had reached an agreement with prosecutors to have their cases reviewed.

The 30th anniversary of the disaster falls in 2019, with a number of commemoration events planned in the run up to it. The Justice campaign said they hope the appeal will help "remember and celebrate those who gave so much" that day.

An MP has also pledged to give the Hillsborough families an annual parliamentary question about how many officers have been suspended or sacked for gross misconduct since 2013 as a result of their investigation into the disaster. Jim McMahon, who was a police officer at the time and lost his friend Tony Bland in the tragedy has tabled the question and says he hopes it will give the families an indication of how many officers are still facing disciplinary proceedings.

"If this is done on 25th January every year, it would become a symbolic way to remember those who died," he added. "The question being asked annually would also be a reminder that some of the perpetrators may still face prosecution."

Hillsborough Disaster

96 Liverpool fans lost their lives in 1989 after they were crushed against fences outside Hillsborough stadium during an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The disaster was a result of police errors, which led to the closure of Taylor's Lane and the overcrowding on the Leppings Lane stands.

In 1989, Lord Justice Taylor delivered his report into the incident and made a series of recommendations for stadia improvements including the installation of fencing on all three sides of the pitch. The findings were rejected by South Yorkshire Police, which was widely criticised by the families of the victims.

The Taylor Report was finally implemented in 2016 after a long campaign by the Hillsborough Justice Campaign and following a review into police practices led by the independent Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012. The report also recommended that criminal charges be brought against officers who were involved in the disaster, leading to a number of convictions being made for gross misconduct.

In September 2013 the IPCC found there was "no evidence" any of those police officers and staff at Hillsborough had committed criminal offences. But following a review into the incident, former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson recommended in December 2014 that an independent judge-led inquiry be held to establish what happened on that day.

The families of the victims welcomed the decision but said they believed it should have been announced sooner and had taken place a long time ago.

A statement from the Hillsborough Justice Campaign after the 2014 announcement said: "We are delighted that the Director of Public Prosecutions has accepted that the families deserve to know why, on 15 April 1989, their loved ones were killed at Hillsborough.

"The judge-led inquiry is a vital part of our campaign for justice and truth."

An independent panel will be announced in 2017 and it is expected that the review will take several years to complete. A number of officers have been suspended or sacked as a result of their involvement in the disaster, but it was recently reported that more than half had been reinstated.

In October, an independent panel report into allegations of misconduct against South Yorkshire Police officers and staff relating to their handling of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster said there was no evidence any of those officers or staff committed criminal offences on the day but it did find that they had lied about what happened.

The report also recommended that police officers from forces outside South Yorkshire, including Merseyside, should be re-interviewed as part of an investigation into allegations of misconduct by South Yorkshire Police staff and officers on the day.

"It was clear to us that it would not have been possible for the SYP to conduct such a comprehensive investigation into allegations of misconduct," the report said. "We are therefore recommending that this work is undertaken as part of any future prosecution."

The disaster has also led to a review of policing and justice in England and Wales, with a number of recommendations made by an independent panel. These included that all police officers should be subject to body worn video cameras and changes to the way police misconduct is investigated.

A number of officers who were involved in the disaster have been sacked as a result, but others were allowed to return to their jobs following internal disciplinary hearings.

The Hillsborough Justice Campaign says that "nothing short of criminal charges" against those found guilty will bring justice for the families of the victims and says that changes need to be made to police practice and culture to prevent such a tragedy happening again in the future.
