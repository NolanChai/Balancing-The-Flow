911 dispatchers a description of her whereabouts, which ended up being in Montgomery County, MD. A few days later on April 28th at 4:30pm she called to check up on the child and was told that both kids had been placed with Children and Family Services but would be released soon."

It's pretty obvious why someone would call in a report of "missing children" if they were being cared for by two unrelated people. The caller was concerned about their safety, but as the article clearly states, she didn't have any reason to believe that there was anything wrong with the kids - just that she wanted them checked out. This is something parents call 911 all the time and it doesn't lead to the child being taken away from their parents.

As for the "free range" thing, you can Google that too. I didn't see any reference to that in the article at all, so it seems like a pretty big stretch to say that this is somehow related to free range parenting."

First of all, no one said anything about her being unsafe with the kids - they were just concerned about her whereabouts. Secondly, I didn't say she was "missing" or in any danger, I said that someone who wasn't sure where these two unrelated adults were keeping their children would call 911 to find out. If you can't comprehend a simple sentence then maybe you shouldn't be making comments about it at all.

As for "free range," it doesn't really have anything to do with what the OP was talking about, but if you want to know more about free range parenting read the following articles:

Lastly, you said that I should Google "free range kids." I did. What I found was a whole bunch of articles about this idea that some parents were letting their kids run free and do things without supervision. That doesn't sound like the OP at all - in fact it sounds completely opposite. In any case, even if she was doing "free range" parenting there is no reason to assume that calling child services would automatically lead to the kids being taken away from their parents."

As for whether or not free range kids should be reported to CPS, I think most reasonable people would agree with me when I say that if a kid is in danger and you're worried about them then by all means call child services. But to assume that "free range" kids are automatically dangerous just because the adults involved aren't hovering over them every second doesn't make any sense at all."

Here is what I said: "Authorities in Montgomery County have released the 911 call that led to two 'free range' getting picked up and held by police and Maryland CPS for five hours over the weekend. The unnamed caller gave 911 dispatchers a description of her whereabouts, which ended up being in Montgomery County, MD."

The OP never said that they were free-range kids or anything of the sort. They just brought it up in relation to a person who wasn't sure where these two adults were keeping their children, and I made an educated guess as to what kind of situation would prompt someone to call 911 about those circumstances."

As for whether or not free range kids should be reported to CPS, I think most reasonable people would agree with me when I say that if a kid is in danger and you're worried about them then by all means call child services. But to assume that 'free range' kids are automatically dangerous just because the adults involved aren't hovering over them every second doesn't make any sense at all."

I don't know where you came up with "As for whether or not free range kids should be reported to CPS, I think most reasonable people would agree with me when I say that if a kid is in danger and you're worried about them then by all means call child services." It was nowhere in the thread. Please don't put words in my mouth.

I didn't bring up whether or not "free range kids should be reported to CPS" - OP did, since they were bringing it into a discussion of this specific scenario. I responded that most reasonable people would agree with me if someone called child services because they were worried about the children involved in this case."

You're the one who keeps insinuating that this woman was "free range" parenting or something, which isn't what she was at all and is completely irrelevant to the scenario. I don't know where you got the idea that I think CPS should be called on everyone involved in a situation like this. In any case it sounds like the 911 dispatcher made an educated guess as to why someone might call about these people, and she was right. She didn't assume anything - just based her knowledge of human nature and common sense."

I never insinuated that OP was "free range" or anything of the sort.

So yes, you brought it up and said that "free range" parenting has nothing to do with what the OP was talking about. It seems like you're intentionally trying to change the subject or something . Why don't you just admit you're wrong."

I didn't say anyone was unsafe - I just said it makes sense that someone would call 911 if they were concerned about where two unrelated adults were keeping their kids. You said that calling CPS for this situation would automatically lead to the child being taken away from their parents, which is completely false. OP never even mentioned whether or not she was "free range" - I did, but it's completely irrelevant."

You just keep trying to change the subject with straw man arguments and appeals to emotion while avoiding anything substantive. You're intentionally misinterpreting what people are saying to make it seem like they're making a bigger deal than they actually are, or that they're somehow not being reasonable."

You didn't even bring up whether or not "free range kids should be reported to CPS" until you were responding to OP.
