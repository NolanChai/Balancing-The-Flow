Aussie Olympian Matthew Mitcham and model Sara Lee got hitched in Sydney, Australia this weekend. Mitcham, 27, took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo of himself kissing his new wife's hand at the airport while heading off for their honeymoon.

"Sara is my best friend and soul mate," he captioned it. "We are so happy and excited about our future together." The couple, who have been dating since 2017, tied the knot on Sunday in an intimate ceremony surrounded by close friends and family at St Mark's Anglican Church in Darling Point, Sydney Harbour, Australia. The newlyweds later celebrated with their guests at the picturesque beachside resort of Whale Beach, New South Wales. Mitcham shared a few more photos from his big day on Instagram Stories, including one showing himself and Lee posing together with their two dogs.

In 2016, Mitcham became the first openly gay male athlete to win an Olympic gold medal when he took out top spot in diving at Rio de Janeiro Games . In a heartfelt Instagram post after his victory, he thanked his family and supporters for their love and support. "This is my moment of being me," Mitcham said, adding, "I'm proud to be an openly gay man."

The 13-time national champion has since gone on to become a LGBTQ+ advocate and activist in Australia and is known for his passionate social media posts about the struggles of queer athletes. In February, Mitcham announced he was engaged to Lee after posting a series of photos on Instagram of them snuggled up together, with the caption "I love you always." The couple have been traveling around Australia and overseas since their engagement announcement in February

Lee has also had a busy year. In March, she became a face for Australian brand H&M's latest swimwear campaign. Lee took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo of her husband-to-be on the beach as they departed for their honeymoon. "You make me happy," she captioned it.
