igh deep in snow while trying to find help. His body was found by rescue services at the bottom of Le Tourneau, a 792m (2,500ft) peak, after an extensive search operation lasting two days.

Carwyn had been on holiday with his parents and brother in the resort of Meg√®ve in Haute-Savoie, eastern France, when he was reported missing by his father. Police said that Carwyn's body was found without a jacket and wearing only a T-shirt, suggesting that he became separated from his family after becoming disorientated in the snow. A police spokesman told The Guardian: "The boy had been on holiday with his mother, father and younger brother, but somehow got lost."

The French mountain rescue team (PGHM) was involved in a major operation to find Carwyn. The team searched for two days until the body was found 160ft below the cliff where he had fallen on Saturday evening. Police said that Carwyn's death could have been avoided if his family had followed instructions from the police and the British embassy about what to do in such an emergency situation. A French mountain rescue spokesman told The Guardian: "We are not sure how Carwyn died but we believe it was because he fell."

A Foreign Office spokesman said that its officials were in touch with Carwyn's family and would be offering any necessary support. He added that British Embassies all over the world give detailed advice to holidaymakers about what to do in an emergency situation while on holiday abroad. "The advice we give is clear - if you get lost, go to the nearest telephone booth and ask for directions or contact a local authority."

The French authorities are also investigating the possibility that Carwyn's death was accidental. According to The Guardian, French police believe that he may have been killed by avalanche. A spokesman said: "We are waiting for snow tests to see if it is possible but we think it is highly probable that this could be the case."

Carwyn's family has not yet commented on the tragedy. The seven-year-old had been enjoying a skiing holiday with his parents and younger brother at Le Tourneau when he disappeared from the slopes on Saturday morning. His father, Colin Scott Howell, told The Guardian: "We are devastated by what has happened."

Carwyn's death is not the first such tragedy to hit the Alps this year as a six-year-old French boy was found dead on Sunday in the resort of Avoriaz after falling 80ft (24m) down a mountain. A four-year-old girl, named by the media as Marie-Odile Boulay, fell to her death near the resort of Tignes on Friday evening.

The tragedies have prompted questions about what more can be done to prevent such incidents from happening in future. According to a report published by The Times newspaper last year, there were 13 children who died on French slopes between 2016 and 2017 after falling into crevasses or avalanches. In many cases the deaths occurred because families had been skiing together but parents became separated from their children as they attempted to find help.

The report suggested that more could be done to ensure that tourists are aware of the risks involved in such activities and what steps they should take if they become lost while skiing or snowboarding. According to a spokesman for the PGHM, it is important that families follow instructions from the authorities as well as listening to any warnings about weather conditions before going on holiday.

The report also suggested that more could be done in terms of improving safety measures on French ski slopes. The spokesman said: "It's important that families know what to do in an emergency situation and listen to any instructions from the authorities as well as listening to any warnings about weather conditions before going on holiday."

According to a statement by Carwyn's family, his father had been skiing with him when he became separated from the rest of the family. He said: "We are devastated by what has happened. We will miss you forever."

The tragedy has left many people shocked and disturbed at such a young age. A spokesman for The Times newspaper said: "It's a reminder that we need to be more careful when we take our children out on the slopes."
