outman asked, "The hormones that stimulate sexual maturation are referred to by this word that comes from the Latin word meaning 'to grow'".

The contestant answered, "What is a growth spurt?"

Unfortunately for the viewer and the host, he was right.

However, in true Jeopardy spirit, Alex explained how the term was originally used to describe what occurs during puberty and was later repurposed by a man named Dr. MacCracken to refer to the process of a child's bones growing faster than their muscles.

The host then asked the contestant, "That is true... but I hope that didn't cause you any distressing memories."

The contestant replied with a cheeky grin and said, "No, not at all," before adding, "I just remembered when I was a kid and my parents would take me to the doctor for growth hormone injections. It was always a good day."

Despite the awkwardness of the moment, the rest of the game went smoothly, with the contestant ultimately winning the round and going on to win the entire episode. The audience seemed to enjoy the moment, as they laughed and cheered when Alex brought attention to the situation.

Overall, it's clear that even in Jeopardy's world of knowledge, there are still some inappropriate answers out there. But as long as we can all laugh about it, everything will be okay.

It's a good thing Alex was there to handle the situation with his trademark wit and charm! üòÇüçø
