ovic's side had been on a 22-game unbeaten streak, winning their last nine matches . But for long periods Watford looked like being blown away by the wind and rain sweeping across Hertfordshire, as QPR - with four wins in nine games under Mark Bowen since replacing Steve McClaren - went toe to toe.

Bowen's team deservedly led 2-0 at half time, through goals from Ilias Chair and Luke Amos either side of a superb strike by Ismaila Sarr, but Watford came roaring back after the break with three goals in six minutes - two from Andre Carrillo, the other from Abdoulaye Kebano .

"The biggest thing that impressed me was how we reacted to the moment," said Jokanovic, who took charge at Vicarage Road last summer. "We were not ready for this type of game, but what I want is our players to show they are brave and show their character."

Watford are now one win away from clinching promotion, which would be an incredible achievement given that the club was relegated in May 2015. The Hornets will have the chance to secure a place in next season's Premier League when they host second-placed Leeds United on Tuesday night.

"We were not ready for this type of game, but what I want is our players to show they are brave and show their character," Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic told Sky Sports News. "Of course it was difficult in the first half but we reacted well in the second half and we deserved to win."

Watford captain Craig Cathcart, who has been at Vicarage Road since 2008, said: "We've had a lot of highs over the last five or six years. This is probably one of the lowest points we have experienced as well but I think that shows what kind of character and spirit we have got."
