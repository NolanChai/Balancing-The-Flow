The 30-minute clip starts off with a disclaimer: “This will not be for everyone.” Still, the narrator explains that he’s using his own “healthy lips” to demonstrate the proper way to use the Kylie Lip Suction Cup, which is manufactured by a company called Xtreme Lashes.

He then gives the device a little test drive before getting down and dirty with it. Using an old lipstick tube as a makeshift holder, he sucks up the air inside like a vacuum and blows it back into his mouth in order to create a “bubble” for the cup to sit on top of. This process helps the device get a good grasp on his upper lip.

The video continues with more step-by-step instructions, as well as some tips and tricks, like how to clean the suction cup before using it again: Just throw the air bubble out your mouth! It’s that easy, he says.

Aside from having to look at his face for 30 straight minutes, there are also a few risks associated with the Kylie Lip Suction Cup. According to an article on Buzzfeed, some teenagers have experienced painful bruising and discomfort after using it. However, the narrator in this video doesn’t seem to be experiencing any problems — yet.

In fact, he seems to be taking a page out of Kylie Jenner’s beauty playbook with his own lip-enhancement efforts: He finishes off the tutorial by doing a quick “lip-gloss” routine, using a product from the Kylie Cosmetics line. “You can never go wrong with lip gloss,” he says.

The video has nearly 2 million views and counting, as well as mixed reviews on whether or not it was worth watching. Some viewers thought the tutorial went into way too much detail; others applauded him for being brave enough to do something so unnatural-looking in a public setting, even if it did go viral on YouTube.

“I can’t imagine having this stuff done to me,” one viewer wrote. “It looks awful.” Another added: “There has to be more to life than looking like Kylie Jenner.” A third said the narrator looked just as creepy-looking as his counterpart in the “Creepy Girl” memes — if not even a little more so.

Check out the video below, and see for yourself how desperate teens are to look like celebrities:

Kylie Jenner’s Lip Suction Cup Is Getting Teens in Serious Trouble

The beauty world was thrown into a tizzy earlier this week when Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters and a model with her own cosmetics company, posted a photo on Instagram showing herself using a lip suction cup to give her lips a huge boost.

The device — which is manufactured by a company called Xtreme Lashes and appears to be exactly the same as the one used in the video above — works by creating an “air bubble” between your mouth and the lip suction cup before you start sucking it up. The device gets a good grip on your lips once the air bubble is gone, effectively plumping them up like a balloon with no end goal in sight (other than looking more Kylie Jenner-esque).

When news of the product spread on social media, teenagers started using it to post photos of their new pouty lips all over Twitter and Instagram. Of course, not everyone was pleased about this new lip-enhancement tool for young girls: The hashtag #lipsuctioncup is trending on Twitter right now as people express concern over the potential dangers.

“I hope that no teenager actually got a lip suction cup,” one tweeter wrote in response to Kylie’s Instagram photo, adding, “This looks unnatural and uncomfortable.” Another tweeted: “Lip suction cups will be the end of us all.”

The majority of comments on these posts agree with the first two — that using this type of device is unhealthy for your mouth. Even if it’s not a permanent solution like surgery, it can still have long-term effects, including nerve damage and scarring. Plus, people are already going through enough when it comes to self-esteem issues; they shouldn’t feel the need to suck up their lips just so they fit in with the latest beauty trends, right?

But that doesn’t mean lip suction cups haven’t been used before. A quick Google search will show you how some girls have gotten creative and turned the device into a make-your-own mask — or “suck-up,” as the case may be.

As for Kylie, she seems to think that these kinds of devices are totally fine if used responsibly. She defended her decision to use lip suction cups in an interview with People magazine on Wednesday: “I don’t do anything I wouldn’t show my mom. It’s a fun way to play with your lips, and it’s not a permanent solution.”

She adds that she has used other beauty products before that have lip-enhancing ingredients in them — but of course, this device doesn’t come with a warning label or anything. “I think as long as you know how to use your lip suction cup responsibly and don’t overdo it, then it is completely safe,” she says.

Whether or not this product can cause nerve damage and scarring isn’t entirely clear yet — but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future. Either way, it’s probably best to wait until you’re 18 before you start experimenting with plumped-up lips.

What do you think? Would you try a lip suction cup for yourself or would you leave it up to Kylie and her famous sisters? Let us know in the comments!<s>
