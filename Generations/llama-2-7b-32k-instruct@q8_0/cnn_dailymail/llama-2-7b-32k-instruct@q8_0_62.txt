ame, in space no one can hear you scream - at least not audibly. Scientists have found that in a vacuum, sound waves become distorted and stretched out beyond recognition. A team of researchers at the University of California, Riverside, took some pebbles into space to see what would happen to them. After blasting one off the International Space Station using a sledgehammer, they watched as it spiraled through space, gaining speed and energy, until it exploded 130 million kilometers from Earth - the distance between Earth and Mars. They then used special equipment onboard the station to listen for sound waves. To their amazement, after the pebble smashed into a boulder, they heard two distinct sounds - one when the pebble hit the rock, and another at the moment of explosion, as air pressure behind it collapsed inwards. "It's remarkable that we can hear anything at all," says astrophysicist Richard Ramond, who led the experiment. Scientists think these findings will help shed light on what happens when spacecraft crash into other bodies in outer space. The next generation of space telescopes - such as NASA's upcoming Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter - should be able to hear similar explosions from millions of miles away, providing researchers with valuable new data on how rocks and planets are formed.

In other news, scientists have discovered that a planet called Gliese 581g appears to be orbiting its star at the perfect distance for it to potentially support life as we know it . The planet orbits about 20 light-years away in the constellation Libra, and is one of more than 37 extrasolar planets that have been detected within a mere 15 parsecs - the width of our own solar system. While astronomers suspect that some of these worlds may be habitable, the chances are slim to none. After all, Gliese 581g is one of just 5 known extrasolar planets with a rocky surface, and it's still very early in our search for alien lifeforms . Yet if scientists can determine that the planet really does harbour intelligent life , it could change everything.

And finally, space fans have had their fill of new discoveries this week, as NASA has unveiled a new website designed to track the movement of asteroids and comets around the solar system . The site, called AsteroidSatellite, allows users to click on any object in outer space and find out how close it is to Earth. Users can also learn more about these celestial bodies by clicking through to individual pages for each asteroid or comet. "There are tens of thousands of asteroids flying around out there that have the potential to make a dangerous encounter with our planet," says AsteroidSatellite team member Tim Spahr. But don't worry - NASA has already been tracking all of these objects and knows just how close they come to Earth .

And on that note, it seems time for us to bid you adieu - until next week, anyway. Goodnight from London.
