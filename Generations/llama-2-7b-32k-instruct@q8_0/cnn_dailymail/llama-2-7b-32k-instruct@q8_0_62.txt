Sunless Planets Could Host Life (AP) AP - A new study suggests that even if a planet is rogue, without a central star like Earth's Sun to warm its surface and provide light for photosynthesis, it still could be home to life. 
  
 While previous research had concluded that only planets orbiting stars or brown dwarfs could support life, the new findings show that in some cases, solar systems with a number of rogue planets are more common than those containing planets orbiting their central star, said astronomers at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. 
  
 "This is an entirely new way to search for life beyond Earth," study leader and professor Gerard Mulders told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
  
 Astronomers believe that there are millions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone, some as large as Jupiter, the largest planet orbiting our Sun. They don't know exactly how many of these wanderers exist because they can't be directly observed; instead, their existence is inferred by changes in the motion of nearby stars caused by the gravity of a rogue planet 
  
 Mulders and his colleagues have devised an algorithm that shows what would happen if all planets were removed from a solar system. They found that it would take less than one percent of Earth-sized planets to produce enough light for photosynthesis 
  
 "Life on such a planet could be very different" compared with life here, Mulders said in an e-mail interview, but it's not impossible. He said the question is how many sunless worlds are out there, which is still unknown. 
  
 In an e-mail to the AP, astronomer Stephen Kane of San Francisco State University wrote that while this research "is a very interesting first step in assessing whether rogue planets can be habitable," he thinks more work needs to be done before one could say with certainty that such worlds are truly capable of supporting life. 
  
 Mulders agreed and said the new findings don't mean scientists will necessarily find life on these planets, just that it is possible for life to exist there 
  
 He noted that there has been recent research showing how a very early Earth might have supported microbial life even before photosynthesis. It would be "very exciting" if similar conditions were found elsewhere in the galaxy, he said 
  
 Mulders believes that astronomers will soon find other planets with their own light sources. He said if life exists on these worlds it could be detected by future telescopes, perhaps by using special instruments that can pick up faint signals from planets' surfaces or atmospheres. 
  
 "We're convinced that the discovery of another Earth or even another Sun is within reach," he said.
