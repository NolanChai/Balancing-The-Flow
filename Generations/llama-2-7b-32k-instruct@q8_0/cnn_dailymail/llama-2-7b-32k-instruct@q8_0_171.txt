lette van der Stegen, 19, said: ‘We had been travelling with my boyfriend for two weeks, it was an amazing time. We were flying on Monday but we switched our flights to Tuesday at the last minute.’

The couple are believed to have left Geneva Airport on Monday morning and transferred from a Swiss Air flight to a smaller aircraft operated by another carrier called Germanwings - which has been linked to Andreas Lubitz, 27, who is now suspected of intentionally crashing the plane. The couple were due to fly back to London Luton Airport, in England, on Wednesday afternoon, but instead returned home alone early, having missed the flight.

Asked if she blamed Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who is now being investigated for deliberately crashing the aircraft, Paulette said: ‘Not at all.’ She added that her boyfriend had not complained about the airline and was in high spirits as he took a taxi home.

Miss Van der Stegen, an Amsterdam student, was holidaying with friends when tragedy struck. The Dutch girl’s boyfriend - who has been named by family friends as Nathanael von der Leur, 21, and is from the Netherlands - had booked a flight to England in order to surprise her on Valentine’s Day at Heathrow Airport.

It was revealed last night that Germanwings co-pilot Lubitz deliberately crashed an Airbus A320 jet into a mountain, killing all 150 people aboard. Paulette and Nathanael were due to travel with the couple’s other friend who had stayed on at their hotel in Geneva before flying home alone after missing the flight on Monday

Her boyfriend is understood to have gone back to check his ticketing for Wednesday morning’s flight when he switched flights last minute. He was then left to wait overnight in a taxi and fly with two friends from Geneva Airport at 9am yesterday, while she flew home on her own from Amsterdam after missing the Monday morning flight

A source told The MailOnline that Miss Van der Stegen said: 'They did not fly together as they were due to have different flights. They had been travelling around Europe and stayed in Geneva overnight for Nathanael to catch an early plane.'

The 19-year-old added: ‘Nathaniel is a very happy boy, he was excited about coming home on Tuesday as it is Valentine’s Day. He never complained anything, he had been having such a good time travelling with me and our friends.’

Miss Van der Stegen was believed to have left Amsterdam at around 1pm local time yesterday but she missed the flight that would have taken her to Geneva Airport in Switzerland where Nathanael von der Leur was waiting. She travelled onward from Schiphol Airport, near Amsterdam, and checked into a hotel nearby

She added: ‘I am shocked because I had no idea something like this could happen.’

Her boyfriend of two years is still missing after the crash in southern France last night - but his family has received a message saying he was alive for several hours. A message from Germanwings on Facebook read: 'We have been informed that there are indications that one of our pilots, who is still unaccounted for, was among those registered on board Flight 9525.'

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve also revealed the co-pilot had not used his mobile phone and was last seen alive at around 10pm when the jet crashed into a mountain shortly after take off. He told BFM TV that investigations showed Lubitz locked himself out of the pilot's cabin for 'several minutes' before deliberately flying the aircraft into the ground

The revelation came as German authorities said they have found personal belongings from the pilot and co-pilot at a flat in Berlin - including bank cards, keys, and a mobile phone. The items were discovered on Wednesday morning at Lubitz’s home after investigators raided his apartment in the city

Investigators also recovered a letter from someone he had lived with at least one other person who has not been identified to say ‘I don't want to fly anymore’ - which is understood to refer to the co-pilot. The letter was dated January 18 this year, a day before Lubitz had checked into rehab

German authorities believe his psychiatrist informed police on Wednesday about him being under treatment and he was placed in involuntary detention after doctors feared for the welfare of himself and others. The prosecutor's office in Duesseldorf said it had opened an investigation into Lubitz, but did not specify what charges would be filed against him

Germanwings spokesperson Martina Fuchs also revealed on Wednesday that she was unaware until Tuesday that Lubitz had been receiving mental health treatment. She told a press conference: 'I know about the depression and that he had psychological problems but not the extent to which it has gone in the last few months'

Following the tragedy, Lufthansa - which owns Germanwings - revealed the co-pilot was grounded by the company for three weeks after complaining of being ill, but they had no suspicion that he could have been a risk to passengers. A spokesperson said: ‘We are a company that takes safety very seriously’

The pilot's union at Lufthansa has also revealed Lubitz was under psychiatric care for several months in 2014, which he had kept hidden from his employers and colleagues. The German Alpine Rescue Service confirmed on Wednesday that there were no survivors of the crash

The couple flew together on a flight to Geneva Airport where they met up with friends for their holiday in Europe. They then travelled around Switzerland, Austria and Italy before flying back from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, near London Luton

On Wednesday it was revealed that Lubitz's father Hans had said he had no idea his son was suffering from mental health problems and was unaware of any medical treatment. His brother also said they did not suspect he could have been a risk to the public

Paulette added: 'Nathanael was very excited about coming home on Tuesday because it is Valentine's Day tomorrow.'

It is understood Nathanael von der Leur booked a flight on Monday from Geneva Airport in Switzerland to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport - where Paulette van der Stegen was due to arrive at the same time. However, she missed her plane and he then went ahead of her to surprise his girlfriend
