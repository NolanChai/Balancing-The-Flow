Scottish independence would be a threat to jobs and prosperity, David Cameron will claim today, warning voters: "You have 11 days to save Britain". The PM is to tell an audience of business leaders in London that the SNP wants to break up the UK and cannot be trusted with the economic levers of power. He says they would threaten jobs and prosperity through higher taxes and the collapse of sterling, which he will claim would harm people's pensions.
