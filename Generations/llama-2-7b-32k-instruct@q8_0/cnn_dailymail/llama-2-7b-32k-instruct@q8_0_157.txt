aged a 'war on Britain' and is leading an independence campaign that would lead to the destruction of the NHS.

He also warned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has made his party into the political wing of the hard left movement Momentum, saying: 'Don’t you think he has made his party look like a bunch of unrepresentative extremists?', adding: 'There is something deeply worrying about what it means to have a Labour government which is led by people who are basically agents for an organisation that has called itself the vanguard of world revolution.'

The PM also attacked Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell, saying he would not hesitate to use his 'nuclear option' if the party formed government and did not back a Budget.

Speaking at an election campaign event in Peterborough, Mr Cameron said: 'I think what Jeremy Corbyn has done with Labour is unprecedented in recent years. I think he’s taken a mainstream political party which was actually a moderate party and turned it into a hard left organisation.'

He added that the 'vast majority' of people do not agree with this ideology, saying: 'People don’t want to see their country torn apart by another Scottish independence campaign'.

The Prime Minister said the SNP had been in power in Scotland for more than five years and had failed to create jobs or make housing affordable. He added that they were now trying to tear the country apart, adding: 'They don’t want the country to succeed - they just want to win an independence campaign'.

Mr Cameron said it was not too late for voters who were 'wavering' to back the Tories or Ukip if they wanted to save the Union.

He added: 'I say to people, there’s 11 days left and you can still make a difference - you can still have your voice heard in this election. You can help to save Britain from what we know is a disaster for Scotland.'

In an interview with LBC Radio later in the day Mr Cameron said he would use his 'nuclear option' if Labour were to form government and not support the Budget, describing it as a 'very strong possibility'. He said: 'I have no doubt I will have to use that nuclear option and make sure that they get behind their own Budget.'

The Prime Minister added that if he lost power this month the UK would be plunged into chaos.

He warned: 'We’d be in a terrible mess - we wouldn’t have a strong opposition, we wouldn’t have a government with a clear mandate and there is no doubt whatsoever that people up and down this country would say "What's going on? What are you lot doing?"

'I don't know why any sensible person would want to see the UK plunged into chaos. I think they should vote for stability, they should vote for a strong opposition, they should vote for a government with a mandate.'

Meanwhile Mr Corbyn has accused Cameron of being 'more interested in his party than the people of Britain' and insisted he will not allow Brexit negotiations to be influenced by Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

He added: 'Nigel Farage is no more qualified to lead Brexit talks than I am.'

Mr Corbyn also warned voters that if they do not back Labour they could end up with a hard-right government led by Theresa May and Nigel Farage.

He said: 'You can't trust her on the economy or the NHS, she's been in government for six years.'

The Labour leader also attacked Mr Cameron, accusing him of not doing enough to protect workers after the EU referendum result. He added: 'I think David Cameron didn't do nearly enough to prepare British industry and people for what has happened on 23 June'.

Corbyn also dismissed the idea that there was a Tory economic plan, saying they had only been able to govern with the support of Ukip. He added: 'All we know about this Conservative party is they can't get through a single parliamentary term without having to cobble together some sort of coalition or other arrangement in order to govern.'

As polling day approaches, Mr Corbyn said his message was for voters to back Labour on the basis that they would 'stand up for working people'.

Meanwhile shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said if Labour do not win power the UK will be in a recession.

Speaking at an event in Sheffield, he said: 'If we don't win on June 8th, what you could expect is a recession in this country.'

He added that there was a choice between Labour and Conservative which represented the interests of those who have 'succeeded' and those who are struggling.

On his party's economic policy, he said: 'We will deal with the issues and give people confidence to invest again in this country.'

Earlier, former Labour leader Ed Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of being 'more interested in his party than the people of Britain'. He told Sky News that voters should not be 'hoodwinked' into thinking Corbyn's election would mean a return to the old style Labour Party.

He said: 'People should take Ed Miliband and me at our word - this is an important change.'

On Friday, Mr Cameron announced that he would use his 'nuclear option' against a Labour party who do not support the Budget if they win power on 8 June

This will mean that if the party who wins power does not agree with the Government budget, then it will not be put into law until they have supported it. The Tories fear this would give Corbyn an excuse to delay a Queen's Speech and effectively block Brexit talks from starting

The move is part of a new strategy by Mr Cameron to win back support in the election campaign after his decision to hold an EU Referendum last year led to the Conservatives losing their majority.

However, it could also lead to a constitutional crisis as the party who wins power may not be able to implement changes because they have not supported them and therefore do not have the right to govern in Parliament

The Prime Minister was asked if he would use this 'nuclear option' on Thursday by LBC radio host James O'Brien, who said: 'Do you intend to deploy the nuclear option against a future Labour Government?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'I will have to. I mean the Budget is my Budget.' He added: 'If somebody doesn't agree with it then they are effectively saying that Parliament shouldn't work at all because the Opposition can't agree on anything. So yes, I will do so.'

Labour also responded to Mr Cameron's threat and said it is 'nothing to do with the public'. They also accused him of being 'held to ransom by a bunch of right-wing extremists'. A Labour party spokesman said: 'This is an extraordinary admission from David Cameron that he is prepared to hold Parliament hostage to his own ideology.

'It should be nothing to do with the public.' They also added: 'What this shows is how he has been held to ransom by a bunch of right-wing extremists like Ukip and it just doesn't work.'

The Tory Party have denied that they are in an alliance with Nigel Farage, as Mr Cameron made clear on Friday during an interview on LBC radio. The Prime Minister was asked if he would use the
