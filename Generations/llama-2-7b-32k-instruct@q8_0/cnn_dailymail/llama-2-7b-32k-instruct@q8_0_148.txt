1 / 1A polo club in Berkshire that launched with Prince Charles as its first member has lost a legal battle with a Hollywood fashion firm in a bid to launch its own range of accessories. The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, which was established in the 1980s, had hoped to sell branded hats, gloves and scarves but High Court Judge Mr Justice Green ruled that the club's use of the word "royal" would be likely to cause confusion with the royal family. The judge said there was an "overriding commercial interest in linking a product with a member of the royal family."


The Hollywood firm, which produces the movie and television show Scandal, had opposed the club's application for trademark protection and its lawyers argued that the use of the word "royal" could mislead shoppers into believing there was an official link between the club and the royal family. They said: "A decision to register this mark will cause a real risk of confusion, as customers purchasing these products are likely to be led into error into thinking that they are connected with or endorsed by Prince Charles's Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club."

The judge ruled in favour of the fashion firm, which was represented by lawyers from Briffa. He said: "The court finds there is a real risk of confusion because the club will be able to sell products bearing a mark that has an overt reference to royalty and the words "Royal County" without any obvious clarifying indication that they do not come with the approval or authority of Prince Charles."

A spokesman for the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club said: "We were disappointed by today's decision. Our membership includes a diverse range of people from across the county and it was important for us to be able to provide our members with branded accessories in their club colours."

A spokesman for Scandal, which is broadcast on the BBC in the UK, said: "We are pleased that the court agreed with our arguments that there should be no link between a commercial product and Prince Charles's Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club without any obvious clarifying indication."
