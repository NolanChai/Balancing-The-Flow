Title: New poll shows most Americans still do not know enough about Iraq to say how they want the war to end Write an expanded news article with plausible details; try not to repeat the abstract. [/INST]
"There's no question that American public opinion has moved in a way that is favorable to ending the war, and it would be nice if that was reflected at some level in Congress," said Senator Joe Biden, who is chairing hearings on Iraq this week . "But the truth of the matter is, even though there are voices out there now saying the tide has turned against the war, I haven't seen it yet."

An ABC News poll released Monday showed that 54 percent of Americans disapproved of President Bush's handling of Iraq and Afghanistan, compared with just 39 percent who approved. In May, a CBS News poll found that only 41 percent said they approved of the way Bush was handling his job as president . The ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday, was based on telephone interviews from a random sample of 1,006 adults. Its margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points."

"President Bush will spend the coming week laying out his plan for victory in Iraq to Congress and the American people . The president is set to deliver a prime-time address from the White House on Wednesday night, which he has billed as a "strategy to secure the successful completion of the mission we have begun." In recent days, Mr. Bush has suggested that the United States will be in Iraq for the long haul . On Monday, President Bush's spokesman told reporters the war would continue until Iraqi security forces are able to defend their own country without U.S. assistance."

"The president also has scheduled a meeting with congressional leaders Thursday in an effort to build support for his new strategy . Mr. Bush plans to meet again later in the week with members of Congress at Camp David, Maryland."

"The new ABC News poll showed that 54 percent said they disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq and Afghanistan, compared with just 39 percent who approved of his performance . In May, a CBS News poll found that only 41 percent said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job as president."

"The ABC News/Washington Post poll also found that while the number of Americans who say they have a "favorable view" of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is rising, more than half of those surveyed still view him unfavorably . The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll showed 56 percent said they had an unfavorable view of Mr. Maliki, compared to 32 percent who view him favorably."

"The war in Iraq has divided the nation, with Democrats largely opposed and Republicans largely supporting it . In a July 19 interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Vice President Dick Cheney said "it's perfectly legitimate to have a discussion now about the future of Iraq, what more needs to be done," but he asserted that Congress has failed to give troops the support they need."

"The White House argues that without success in Iraq, it would embolden terrorists and undermine efforts to stabilize Afghanistan . And officials argue that U.S. forces need more time to complete a transition of security duties to Iraqi forces, which have suffered from a lack of equipment, training and coordination."

"Some political analysts say Mr. Bush may be seeking to create the appearance of success in Iraq by increasing troop strength before he leaves office . Analysts also said Mr. Bush was eager for Congress to see his plan so that Democrats would have a clear idea of what they were voting against."

"Democratic Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he wanted assurance from Defense Secretary Robert Gates that Iraq's government will be able to support the additional troops needed for Mr. Bush's plan . Levin also said his committee had not been consulted by the White House about the new strategy."

"In a news conference on Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki said the U.S.-Iraq security agreement signed last month did not mean that U.S. forces could stay in Iraq indefinitely."

"Maliki has said he believes his government can take control of its own security by the end of 2011 . He also called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraqi cities, which would allow American soldiers to operate out of bases . The Bush administration has been wary of such a pullback."

"The U.S.-Iraq security agreement is due to go into effect on January first."

"A day before Mr. Maliki was scheduled to meet with Iraq's parliament, he gave interviews to the Associated Press and Voice of America in which he defended his country's sovereignty and rejected criticism from some Iraqi politicians who questioned whether they should be sharing intelligence information with U.S. forces."

"He also said Iraq would not allow itself to become a battlefield for regional conflicts, or a base where foreign fighters could use its territory to fight in other countries . And he rejected allegations that some Shiite Muslim militiamen were working with Iraqi security forces against Sunnis."

"Maliki also said he expected U.S. troops would remain in Iraq after the security agreement is implemented, but they will be focused on training Iraqi soldiers and advising them."

"In a speech Tuesday night at an annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President Bush will stress that victory in Iraq is critical to the future of the entire Middle East . He said America must remain engaged there because radical Islamic leaders are trying to spread their ideology throughout the region."

"Mr. Bush has been criticized for using the term "victory," which some critics say implies a quick and easy resolution to the war, even though Iraq continues to be wracked by violence."

"Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who was tortured during his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has said he believes victory is possible in Iraq . But he also said there will be setbacks and it may take some time to achieve."

"The new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that Americans have mixed views about whether the United States should withdraw all its troops from Iraq now or keep a few thousand soldiers in Iraq to continue training Iraqi forces . Forty-seven percent said they should withdraw all their troops, while 49 percent said some U.S. soldiers should remain to help train Iraqi troops."

"In an interview on the Fox News Channel broadcast Sunday, Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, rejected calls for a quick exit from Iraq . "I think that would be a terrible mistake," he said in response to a question about whether the United States should begin withdrawing troops as soon as possible."

"Obama also criticized Mr. Bush's handling of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan . He blamed the president for not providing U.S. forces with the resources they needed, and for making decisions based on politics instead of national security interests."

"But Obama said it would be a grave mistake to allow terrorists to succeed in Iraq by withdrawing too quickly."

"In an interview Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Senator Joe Biden, Democratic candidate John McCain's running mate, said he does not think victory is possible until the United States has completed its mission to destroy al-Qaida and deny it safe haven in either Iraq or Afghanistan."

"Bush will send a letter to Congress this week outlining his new strategy for Iraq . The House of Representatives will begin hearings on the plan next Tuesday." [/INST]
