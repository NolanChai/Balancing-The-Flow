later Diana, Princess of Wales is admired and loved by millions across the world - not just for her humanitarian work but also as a style icon.

Diana was born in Norfolk on 1st July 1961, the fourth child and third daughter of John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and Frances Roche. She grew up at Althorp, the family home where her grandfather had also grown up before becoming King George VI. Diana's mother came from a wealthy Irish family but it was her father who provided the sparkling touch of glamour to her childhood. In 1957, he married Frances Roche at the age of twenty - seven and two years later they had their first child, Lady Sarah Spencer. She was followed by three brothers, John Charles Francis, born in 1960; Charles Edward Maurice, known as Charles, who was born in 1962; and finally Diana Frances.

Diana was very shy when she grew up and struggled to fit in with her peers. She had been educated by private tutors since the age of five but at the age of twelve she was sent away to Riddlesworth Hall School where she remained for two years. However, she hated the school which was run on military lines. When Diana was fourteen she started boarding school at West Heath in Kent where she became more confident and popular with her peers but it was only after she left that she would start to make a mark on British society

In 1978, John Spencer was made Duke of Marlborough. Although he did not have any male heir it meant the Earldom had now been secured for the next generation and the younger Diana could marry more readily into royalty. It was during this time that her father received a letter from Queen Elizabeth II inviting her to lunch at Buckingham Palace which would give him the opportunity to introduce his daughter to the Prince of Wales.

In June 1980, she accompanied her father and sister Sarah for dinner with Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles at Windsor Castle. The following evening, Diana was introduced to her future husband in the Ballroom at Buckingham Palace by their fathers who had previously discussed the matter over drinks

After a four-month romance it became evident that Diana was to become the Prince's bride. A civil marriage took place on 29th July at St Paul's Cathedral, London, in front of 3,000 people including family and close friends . Her father gave her away and she wore a gown designed by Elizabeth and David Emanuel with a long train - the longest of any bride who had married in St Paul's. Charles was dressed in his full naval uniform. The Queen, accompanied by her husband, Duke of Edinburgh, was present at the service

After their marriage it was clear that Diana and Charles were very different people and it would not be long before the cracks began to show in what many considered an unsuitable match. After a difficult honeymoon, she took a holiday on her own where she met the heir of the Greek royal family, Constantine Onassis who was separated from his wife but still in love with her . However, their romance came to nothing and Diana returned home.

As time passed it became more evident that Charles had found other women he could be affectionate towards - Camilla Parker-Bowles being one of them. The Prince's affair was well known amongst the public and the newspapers would often print pictures of him on holiday with his lover . In 1986, Diana made a plea to her husband that they should try counselling but Charles refused. He also told her not to seek help from any of his male friends who may have been able to provide some comfort

In 1992, Diana and Charles separated for the first time after it had become clear to both of them that their relationship would never work . It was rumoured in 1986 that she had become pregnant but abortion was ruled out as there was a question mark over whether he could have fathered the child

In April 1993, Prince Charles and his mistress Camilla Parker-Bowles were engaged to be married. Diana became more depressed by this news as her husband had now clearly given up on their marriage. She made a plea to stay in the family home at Highgrove but it was denied . Her request for an allowance of 16 million pounds a year and an additional payment of 500,000 a year to pay off her debts was also rejected

In December that year Diana made public a list of demands she wanted from Charles before she would agree to divorce. She wished for financial support for herself and her two sons; the boys should be able to visit their father at his home at Balmoral on school holidays, as well as during any future Christmas or Easter breaks; and Diana also asked for the couple's personal items which she had left at Kensington Palace. The Prince was asked if he would like to comment but Charles kept silent

A month later a statement was issued by Buckingham Palace confirming that the royal couple were separating and that Diana had been granted an allowance of 16,000 pounds per week for life . Diana was also allowed to retain her title as Princess of Wales. She would not be able to claim any public funds if she remarried but neither did she lose her right to use the style 'Her Royal Highness' or the title 'Princess'. The couple were to share their children, Prince William and Prince Harry, equally

In March 1997, Diana was invited by Charles and Camilla to stay at his estate in Balmoral. She had a difficult time there with them both. During this period she would spend many hours crying alone

It is believed that the Princess's private secretary arranged for her to have an abortion on the 24th of August, two days after meeting with her husband and his mistress in Balmoral . It was claimed that her request had been granted as soon as she returned from Scotland. This allegation led to much controversy and it is still widely debated

On 31st August 1997, Diana and Charles met for the last time at a hotel near Heathrow airport before they separated permanently. She was due to fly out that evening with her sons but there was no sign of her husband when she left for the departure gate

The next morning, after not hearing from his wife for several hours, Charles contacted Scotland Yard and arranged for a search party to be sent out in order to find Diana. After nine hours she was finally found alive in a Paris underpass, having been involved in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Trevor Rees-Jones . She later died from the injuries sustained from the collision

Diana's death was one of the most televised events ever. The world watched as she lay in the hospital surrounded by photographers and press reporters who wanted to catch a glimpse of their beloved Princess before she passed away . She had suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead at 3:45 am on September 1st

The following day, her sons William and Harry stood beside the casket in which her body lay covered by a Union Jack as they said goodbye to their mother for what could be the last time . She was buried at Althorp where she had spent her childhood. On her coffin were placed flowers from friends and family including bouquets from Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Camilla Parker-Bowles and members of Diana's family

Her sons William and Harry have both grown up to be accomplished men but the shadow of their mother still hangs over them . The elder son is preparing for his role as King while the younger has just recently married and become a father. Both are often reminded of their mother through their own families whom they love dearly

Diana's legacy however, will live on forever. She became an icon to many who loved her warmth, empathy, humility and most of all her grace under pressure which saw her rise above the difficult situation she found herself in with the pressures of being a royal figure . Diana also continued the tradition of humanitarian work which had been started by Queen Victoria in 1840 and encouraged by both the Queen Mother and the Princesses Margaret. It is estimated that to date, her charitable efforts have raised over two billion dollars for causes she was passionate about

Diana's sons William and Harry will always be reminded of their mother through the people closest to them - Catherine Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan Markle who are both married into the family. Both women are strong, caring, and supportive partners to their husbands who in turn love them dearly

Their mother would have been proud of her sons and also proud that they continue with the charity work which she so loved . As for Diana herself, although she was a deeply religious woman, she would be pleased at how popular she has become worldwide. She is remembered fondly by many as an icon who became the most recognizable person in Britain

It has been said that all good stories have a happy ending and Diana's story was no
