in Belfast before the pair squared up on a pitch at the SSE Arena, home of ice hockey team the Belfast Giants.

McIlroy and Dornan were seen getting into position as they took to the field to show their skills for Circular Soccer. The game has been described by its creators as a “new football concept” that combines elements from American Football and Rugby but with only one rule - no kicking. It is played on an oval pitch using two teams of five players each, who play ball in hand until the referee blows his whistle at which point the ball is passed to the next player.

Dornan was seen doing a mock interview with McIlroy while the pair were dressed in football gear but with little touches that showed they knew of their reputations as golfers and actors.

The video has been viewed 106,000 times on YouTube since it was uploaded last week to the Circular Soccer channel and has received more than 36,000 likes and shares on social media.

Circular Soccer is due to be launched this summer in Belfast as part of the build-up to the UEFA European Championships 2016 which will be held across Europe from June 10 - July 11 .

McIlroy, who has been a keen golfer since childhood, was filmed throwing his first pitch for Circular Soccer in the video. The Northern Irishman has also featured on Golf Channel’s Morning Drive show as an analyst and co-commentator before returning to golf last month.

Dornan, who plays a serial killer called Paul Spector in hit TV series Fifty Shades of Grey, is no stranger to sports either. He played football for amateur side the Swindon Robins from 1994 to 2007 and still trains with the team . The star has also appeared as himself on American sports show The Apprentice.

McIlroy, Dornan and the Circular Soccer team will be in Belfast for a launch event of Circular Soccer at SSE Arena next week. They are set to face each other in a friendly match alongside youngsters from local football clubs .

Dornan said: “Rory is a great lad and I’m glad he agreed to do it. I knew it would be fun to film with him.”

McIlroy added: “I enjoyed the experience, Jamie is a good guy and we had some laughs doing this video.

“It was a bit strange for me though as I haven't played football in a very long time but I'm looking forward to taking part in the Belfast launch of Circular Soccer on Wednesday."

Circular Soccer is due to be launched this summer in Belfast as part of the build-up to the UEFA European Championships 2016 which will be held across Europe from June 10 - July 11 . It will also feature in a number of locations during and after the tournament.

Circular Soccer has been developed by businessman Chris McGaw, who said: “It's great to have Rory and Jamie involved with this project and I'm sure they had as much fun filming this video as we did making it.

"We are looking forward to launching Circular Soccer in Belfast next week and seeing how people react to the new game."
