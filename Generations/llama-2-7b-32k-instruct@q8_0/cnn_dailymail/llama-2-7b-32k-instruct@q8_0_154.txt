26 acres of enclosed exhibit space and will be accessible to visitors later this spring, zoo officials said Tuesday.

The male and female gorilla infants are the first babies born at the Bronx Zoo since its beloved gorilla Kijiji died in September . The pair are also the first Western Lowland Gorillas ever to be born at the zoo in over 40 years, according to zoo officials.

The zoo announced on January 18th that a baby gorilla was born and shared images of what they said were newborns lying together nestled against their mother's back . The news came just two days before another baby gorilla arrived at the Bronx Zoo, but it wasn't known until February how many infants there would be.

The first infant was born to 31-year-old mom Fiona while she was in her night house exhibit space on January 8th . The second infant was delivered to 26-year-old mom M'Nywa two days later on January 10th, zoo officials said Tuesday.

The Bronx Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the US and has been home to many famous gorillas over the years . Kijiji was known for her love of bananas and being a beloved attraction at the Bronx Zoo for many years, but she sadly passed away last year due to health complications related to old age.

A representative for the zoo told CNN that the newborns are doing well in their exhibit space with plenty of space to roam around. They said Fiona and her baby girl are "staying close by" as they all learn how to navigate this next chapter. The zoo also shared an update on the second pair saying M'Nywa has been very patient with her newborn son who is still nursing regularly.

The zoo officials were able to share an image of the two baby gorillas on Tuesday, showing them sleeping together in their exhibit space nestled against their mothers' backs . The post was met with cheers and excitement from fans who have been eagerly awaiting any updates since they were born.

Zoos around the world have been working hard to ensure that animals are living safe, healthy lives while closed during the pandemic . The Bronx Zoo says it has been working closely with experts in zoological medicine and conservation to keep its gorillas safe and healthy since their arrivals.

The zoo will be sharing updates on the pair as they grow up and become more publicly accessible. Fingers crossed that the next generation of gorillas at the Bronx Zoo will bring just as much joy and happiness to fans around the world as Kijiji did during her lifetime .

[INST] What were the names of the baby gorillas? [/INST]

The baby gorillas' names have not been released by the Bronx Zoo yet. It's possible that they will be announced at a later date, once the gorillas are more comfortable with their new environment and their names become better known among zoo staff and visitors.

It's common practice for zoos to name their animals, especially in cases where there is a special story or reason behind their names. For example, the Bronx Zoo previously had a famous gorilla named Kijiji, who was known for his love of bananas and became a beloved attraction at the zoo.

If the zoo decides to name these baby gorillas, it's likely that they would choose names that reflect their personalities or characteristics, such as Fiona and M'Nywa, which are the mothers' names. It's also possible that they could use names from the Western Lowland Gorilla species, such as Kwame or Lumana.

Until the zoo releases official information about the baby gorillas' names, it's best to wait for their announcement rather than speculating or assuming.
