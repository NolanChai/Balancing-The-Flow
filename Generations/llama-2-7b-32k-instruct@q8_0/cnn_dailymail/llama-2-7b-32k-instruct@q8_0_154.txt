The two new gorillas, born on January 2 and January 4 respectively, were given names by keepers based on their birthdays: Kibali, which means "sweet" or "pleasant" in Swahili, and Mubende, a city in Uganda where one of the zoo's gorilla troops originates from.

The Bronx Zoo is home to six western lowland gorillas, who share their habitat with a group of common chimpanzees, all living together under one roof. 

Bronx Zoo primate curator Jim Breheny said the two new additions would be a "real asset" to the zoo's population of endangered species and hopeful that they will help boost the number of gorilla births in captivity.
