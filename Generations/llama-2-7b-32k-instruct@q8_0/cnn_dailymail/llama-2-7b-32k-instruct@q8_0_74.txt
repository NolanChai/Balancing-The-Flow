The section of Arsenal and Liverpool fans who staged a protest against ticket prices by leaving their seats empty in the stadium are not the first to do so.
A similar protest was organized last year before a game between Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United at White Hart Lane, where around 30 Spurs season-ticket holders left their seats unoccupied for five minutes.
The idea is that by leaving their seats empty during the national anthem, fans can show they are unhappy about ticket prices and are demanding that something be done. However, it's not clear whether this type of protest will achieve anything meaningful in the long run.
One possible reason for the lack of impact is that these protests are usually seen as a publicity stunt rather than an effective way to pressure clubs or governing bodies into action. Another issue is that the fans who participate in these protests often have very different reasons for their dissatisfaction with ticket prices, so it's not clear whether they would all be satisfied if their demands were met.
Furthermore, these protests can sometimes create a backlash from other fans who feel that they are being disrespectful to the club or the game by not attending the match and thus missing out on what could be an exciting match.
In conclusion, while it is understandable that some fans may be unhappy with ticket prices, it's not clear whether these protests will achieve anything meaningful in the long run. They are seen as a publicity stunt rather than an effective way to pressure clubs or governing bodies into action and they can sometimes create a backlash from other fans who feel that they are being disrespectful to the club or the game by not attending the match.
