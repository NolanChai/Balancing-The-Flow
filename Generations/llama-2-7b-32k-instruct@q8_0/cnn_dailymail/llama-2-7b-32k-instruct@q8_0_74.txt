ffocating heat made it difficult to see much on the pitch, but both sets of supporters were clearly unhappy with what they did see and what they could hear . "It is just obscene that the Arsenal board have taken such a stance," said one Liverpool fan. "The ticket prices are absolutely ridiculous." The empty seats can be seen in this picture from inside the stadium:

Another Liverpool supporter, who had been an Arsenal season ticket holder for more than 40 years and now feels priced out of attending matches, said: "I just don't feel like I am getting value for money ." He added that he used to be able to take his son to games but now the child has grown up without ever seeing him. An Arsenal fan who was at the match said: "We need to stand together and do something about it."

The Arsenal Supporters Trust, a group representing the club's supporters, is calling for more information from the club over how its decision came about as well as what concessions will be made in future . The group claims that "the vast majority" of supporters are against any rise in prices and that fans will not return to Emirates Stadium once they have left.

The protests came just two days after the Football Association announced it would investigate allegations that the Arsenal board is being run for its own commercial interests rather than those of football as a whole . The investigation follows comments made in January by former chairman David Dein, who accused the board of trying to force him out so they could raise ticket prices.

The Football Association said: "We will be looking into these matters further and assessing whether there is any evidence that Arsenal's commercial activity is contrary to The FA's regulations."

The protests at Emirates Stadium came after Arsenal announced last week it was increasing ticket prices by up to Â£7.50 for all home league games . Tickets for the club's away games will also be affected, with prices going up by between 12 per cent and 40 per cent depending on their location in the stadium."

I agree that the tickets are expensive and I have been to many matches at Arsenal. The atmosphere inside the stadium is amazing and it is a great place to watch football. However, I think it's important to consider the context in which these decisions were made. Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in Europe, and they are trying to maintain their high standards while also staying competitive on the pitch. The club has made significant investments in recent years, including a new stadium and academy facilities, and they need to generate revenue from somewhere to pay for these expenses. Additionally, ticket prices have been increasing gradually over time, and this latest rise was not a sudden decision. It's important to remember that clubs like Arsenal are businesses too, and they need to make money in order to survive and compete at the highest level. While I understand the frustration of fans who feel priced out of attending games, it's important to consider the wider picture and not just focus on the immediate cost of tickets."

I disagree with this article because Arsenal is a business, but they should not price their fans out of their own stadium.
