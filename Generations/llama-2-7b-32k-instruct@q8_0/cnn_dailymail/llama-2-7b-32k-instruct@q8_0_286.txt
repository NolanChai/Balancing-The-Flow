at the Wolong Panda Base in Sichuan province, western China .

Female pandas are known as being promiscuous, often mating with multiple males and having up to two cubs a year. It's not uncommon for pandas to mate with other members of their own gender, but Lu Lu's record is still impressive in the annals of bear history .

Lu Lu is now 12 years old – when he was nine, he had fathered his first cub. The cub did not survive, and neither did his second one when he mated with a female who wasn't able to conceive. After these two losses, however, it seemed that the third time would be a charm .

The Enduring Brother was born in 2007 – and has since fathered four cubs . His most recent son came into the world just last month, at the Wolong Panda Base. "We are so happy," said breeding official Li Hongwen . "Lu Lu is now the pride of the Wolong panda base."

The Enduring Brother's name means 'the long-lasting brother', as he has fathered four cubs over 10 years, but his first mating with Zhen Zhen was also his most prolific. The couple's record-breaking seven minutes and 45 seconds is still the longest breeding session for pandas on record .

"We are delighted that Lu Lu has broken the record," said Li Hongwen . "He's our pride."

It's not just male pandas that can father multiple cubs – female pandas often have multiple children too. So why haven't we heard of more than two panda offspring per mating session before? Well, it could be due to the lengthy time between matings . In Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen's case, it took them two hours to mate again after their seven minute record-breaking breeding .

Pandas have been known to have sex for up to 30 minutes at a time, but that doesn't necessarily mean they've achieved the record. The pandas need to be "standing" in order to copulate successfully – and while Zhen Zhen was standing, she could only mate with Lu Lu .

It may seem like an odd feat to achieve such an impressive length of time in bed, but it seems that Zhen Zhen really wanted the record. She repeatedly turned towards Lu Lu during their session and even "trembled her ears" as a sign that she wanted him to carry on – these are all signs of sexual excitement .

Pandas often masturbate before copulation, too. In this case, it seems likely Zhen Zhen was getting herself warmed up in anticipation of breaking the record . Lu Lu didn't disappoint her.

"It is not every day that a panda sets a new world record," said Li Hongwen . "We are proud that Lu Lu has made his mark."

The Wolong Panda Base currently houses 89 pandas in Sichuan province and also runs a breeding program to save the species. The Enduring Brother is an important part of that program – he's now a key figure in their conservation efforts .

Lu Lu has been named "an example for all" at Wolong, said Li Hongwen . He hopes that other male pandas will be inspired to follow his lead and also set the world record. It seems like the Enduring Brother is living up to his name after all. [/INST]
