"The Enduring Brother," a panda in China, has set a new record for lovemaking with his partner, "Zhen Zhen," according to the South China Morning Post. The pair mated for an impressive seven minutes and 45 seconds, breaking the previous record of six minutes and 36 seconds held by another panda named Liang Xiang and his female companion, Meng Jiao.

The new record was announced on social media by China's State Forestry Administration (SFA) on Wednesday, which also shared a video clip of the mating session. The SFA stated that the pair had been housed together for three years before their first successful mating in 2021, and that they have since produced two cubs.

The announcement has sparked excitement and interest among panda enthusiasts, who are eager to see if the new record will be broken in the future. The SFA has also announced plans to open a research center dedicated to studying panda behavior, which is expected to provide valuable insights into the species' mating habits and reproductive patterns.

In other news, a study published in the journal "Animal Conservation" found that male pandas are more likely to mate with females who are not ovulating, suggesting that they may be able to detect ovulation through scent cues. This could have implications for panda conservation efforts, as it may help scientists better understand how to manage populations in the wild.

Overall, "The Enduring Brother" has made headlines with his record-breaking mating session, and his story serves as a reminder of the fascinating behaviors and adaptations of this charismatic species.
