Xavi makes record-breaking comeback appearance for Barca 

When Barcelona midfield maestro Xavi came on as a half-time substitute against PSG in the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday night he sent records tumbling. The former Spain international player had not played competitively since suffering an Achilles injury in October last year but his return was welcomed by the Nou Camp crowd and it quickly became clear why Xavi remains so highly rated . 

"It's amazing," said Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who used to play alongside Xavi at club level. "We knew it would be difficult for him but he showed how important he is to us."

Xavi was signed as a schoolboy by Barca and went on to become the captain of the first team and also led Spain to World Cup glory in 2010, with his passing skills at the heart of the success. Since then Xavi has won six Liga titles, four Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, three FIFA Club World Cups, a Europa League and many other honors, making him one of the most successful players in Barcelona's history. 

Guardiola says it was "a dream come true" to coach Xavi again. The Catalan tactician also played with Xavi for Spain from 1996 to 2008 and added: "He is a great player, the best I have played with." 

After PSG led 2-1 at half time, Barca fought back in the second half to beat the Ligue 1 champions by the odd goal in five. The victory was secured when Xavi drove down the left flank and put in a low cross which was tapped home by Jordi Alba for an equalizer just two minutes after being introduced from the bench . Barca then went on to score three times in eight minutes to seal its place in the Champions League semifinals, with Lionel Messi scoring four goals.

Barcelona will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the semifinals. 

Xavi's comeback was also welcomed by his fellow former Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets . The 28-year-old told Spanish TV: "He is one of the most complete players that has ever existed." 

Xavi, meanwhile, said it had been "an incredible feeling" to be back in action. He added: "I have missed so many things -- the team, the dressing room and now the fans . I am so happy to be here again." 

The veteran midfielder is a big favorite at Barcelona and his appearance against PSG has been highly anticipated after he was forced off with injury in October. Guardiola said the plan had always been for Xavi to play for half an hour . The Barca manager also revealed that Xavi had not even told him about the injury when it happened during a match against Malaga, saying: "I didn't ask him anything and he didn't tell me." 

Xavi has now committed his future to Barcelona until June 2024, although his new contract does not include any guaranteed minutes. The club said Xavi had been given the role of ambassador for its women's team as well as having a "strategic" position in the first-team squad .

Barcelona has also confirmed it is working on getting Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique back at Camp Nou. The club's president, Joan Laporta, said: "We hope they stay and continue with us." 

Barca has been under pressure because of its financial problems, which have resulted in the club missing out on a number of major signings this season . The Catalan giants are now looking to sell players to help reduce their wage bill, including Ousmane Dembele, who has already left for Lyon. 

Barcelona is also working on hiring former Barcelona player Jordi Cruyff as its new sporting director, according to reports in Spanish media . The club's current sporting director, Mateu Alemany, is expected to leave the Nou Camp side after his contract ends in June. 

In addition, Barca has also been working on signing a new sponsorship deal with the Qatar Investment Authority and is hoping to announce that soon . Laporta added: "We will close this agreement before the end of April."

Barcelona's financial troubles have led to the club needing to sell players, but Xavi said it was vital for the club to keep its star players. The Spaniard told Spanish TV: "It is essential that we keep our best players -- because when they are happy and motivated it is easier for them to win games."

The Catalan side's financial situation has also led to questions over whether it would be able to sign Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique, who have both been linked with moves away from the club. Laporta insisted he was confident that the two players will stay at Camp Nou, saying: "We are working on this."

The Barcelona president also revealed that the club is hoping to announce a new sponsorship deal with the Qatar Investment Authority before the end of April . He added: "This will be another big step towards putting an end to our financial problems." 

Barcelona has already announced it plans to sell players this season, including Ousmane Dembele, who left for Lyon on a loan deal. The Catalan side is also planning to sell Frenkie de Jong, but the Dutch midfielder's sale has been put on hold because of his impressive form so far this season .

Laporta said: "We will sell players and we will bring in some new faces too." 

Barcelona is also planning to sign a new sporting director, with former Barcelona player Jordi Cruyff being linked with the role. Laporta confirmed that talks are ongoing with the Dutchman, who played for Barca between 1978 and 1982 . 

The Catalan side has also been working to bring in a new sponsorship deal with the Qatar Investment Authority, which would help it reduce its wage bill . Laporta revealed: "We are close to closing this agreement."
