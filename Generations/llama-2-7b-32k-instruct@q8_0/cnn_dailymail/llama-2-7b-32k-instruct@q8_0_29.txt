Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?
Title: Faulty item
Review: The first unit I received had the power plug not seated properly, it didn't work as intended and would have been returned if Amazon hadn't insisted that there were no other options for a replacement product . It took about two weeks before a replacement was available. This replacement worked well but lasted less than 8 months after which the screen stopped working correctly . The item is now out of warranty so I will be replacing it again, this time with something different.
