The private chef, named as Leila Ali, is known for creating delicious and nutritious dishes tailored to Mayweather's needs. Ali was on hand to cater for the boxer ahead of his exhibition bout with Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, where he walked away victorious in front of a packed crowd on Sunday night. 
  
 But it appears that Mayweather may have let his guard down in terms of what he eats as the chef has revealed that the athlete does have some weaknesses when it comes to food. 
  
 'Floyd Mayweather is very strict and particular about what he eats,' said Ali, who was a professional boxer before going into catering. 
  
 The former world champion began his training camp in September but the preparations didn't get off to the best start when the fighter reportedly fell ill after being served food which had gone bad and was contaminated with bacteria. 
  
 Ali, who has been working closely with Mayweather for a year, said she took control of the meals from there onwards to ensure they were up to his high standards. 
  
 And that meant ensuring he stuck to his training regime and avoided any temptations like fast food or too much salt. 
  
 'I'm in charge,' said Ali about Mayweather's diet, who has previously admitted to liking his comfort food including burgers and pizza. 
  
 The chef revealed that he is a big fan of smoothies as well as salad. 
  
 She continued: 'He enjoys salads and I like to add some protein powder in the dressing.' 
  
 Ali, who has also previously worked with George Foreman before he came out of retirement for a final fight against Muhammad Ali at Rangers's Ibrox Stadium, added that Mayweather is very serious about his training regime and always makes sure to eat three times a day. 
  
 She said: 'He eats every two hours. He has a snack, dinner and breakfast.' 
  
 The private chef also revealed that Mayweather's favourite foods include shrimps and beef loin with some salad on the side. 
  
 Ali had previously worked as a chef at the famous Harlem eatery Soul Cycle, before meeting Mayweather in 2014 at Miami's exclusive Biltmore Hotel. She said that she was lucky to have been able to cater for him but admits that he has some weaknesses when it comes to food. 
  
 Ali revealed: 'He does have weaknesses, like pizza and burgers. He loves those.'
