Mason’s decision to kick Colin Duecy out of school was upheld last month by the university’s appeals board. His expulsion means he has been suspended from all college campuses in Virginia and won’t be able to get a degree from Mason or another state-supported university until 2023 at the earliest .

Duecy said he is asking a federal court judge to overturn Mason’s decision, saying it was wrongful. He alleges that his due process rights were violated and that Mason ignored evidence that supported his side of the case.

“I think this entire process has been unfair,” Duecy said in an interview . “When I first came forward, they didn’t even acknowledge my version of events or what happened . They just wanted to throw me out on the street.”

The lawsuit, which was filed Friday and is pending, alleges that Mason failed to provide Duecy with a fair hearing before kicking him out. It also accuses the university of misconstruing evidence about his interactions with another student, who had accused him of groping her .

Duecy said he wanted to take classes at Mason this fall but decided against it because he was afraid of running into the other student, who has filed a complaint about Duecy’s actions against her. He said the university did not provide any counseling for him or offer to help him find another college .

“They basically threw me out with nothing,” Duecy said. “And now they expect me to just accept it.”

In response, Mason officials released a statement saying that students who break its rules deserve to be kicked out of school and that they are not subject to the same legal protections as adults accused of misconduct in criminal cases . They also said the university did not ignore any evidence but carefully investigated Duecy’s case.

“The university will continue to uphold its zero tolerance policy regarding sexual harassment, including sexual assault,” Mason spokesman Brian Hemphill wrote in an email . “We are confident that we handled Colin Duecy’s case fairly and appropriately.”

Duecy’s lawsuit comes as several universities across the country have been accused of mishandling sexual misconduct cases, including some involving football players. The issue has roiled campuses nationwide .

In addition to his federal court complaint, Duecy said he is appealing Mason’s decision to Virginia’s State Board for Community Colleges . And he plans to apply elsewhere to get a degree in engineering.

“I haven’t given up,” Duecy said. “But it has been tough.”
