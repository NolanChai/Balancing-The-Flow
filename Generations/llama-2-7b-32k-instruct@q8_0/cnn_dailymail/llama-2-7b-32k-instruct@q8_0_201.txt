The student is named Joseph Perkovich.  The article provides a link to the lawsuit he filed against George Mason University and the Fairfax County Police Department.

According to the complaint, Perkovich and his girlfriend engaged in sadomasochistic role play on February 27th, 2021 at a hotel in Fairfax, Virginia. They communicated their desires and boundaries to each other before engaging in sexually explicit acts. However, when they returned home to George Mason University's campus the next day, Perkovich was expelled from school for violating its sexual misconduct policy.

Perkovich argues that he should not have been punished for his consensual sexual activity and that his due process rights were violated by the school's handling of the situation. He also claims that the university's policies and procedures are vague and unclear, leading to inconsistent and unfair enforcement.

The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and asks for a ruling that Perkovich was not guilty of violating George Mason University's sexual misconduct policy. It also requests that the university revise its policies to ensure fairness and consistency in their application.

It is unclear what the outcome of the lawsuit will be, but it highlights the complexities and challenges associated with addressing issues of sexual assault and harassment on college campuses.

Perkovich's case also underscores the importance of clear communication and mutual understanding between partners in any sexual activity, to ensure that all parties are comfortable and consenting to what is happening.

In summary, Perkovich's lawsuit seeks to overturn his expulsion from George Mason University for violating its sexual misconduct policy, arguing that the encounter with his girlfriend was consensual sadomasochistic role play and not assault or harassment. The case highlights the importance of addressing issues of sexual consent and fairness on college campuses, while also underscoring the need for clear communication and mutual understanding between partners in any sexual activity.
