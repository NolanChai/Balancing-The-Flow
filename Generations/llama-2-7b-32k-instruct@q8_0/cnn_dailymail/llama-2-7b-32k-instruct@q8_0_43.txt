ation that includes business owners hoping to forge partnerships with Cuban entrepreneurs. Cuomo was greeted at Havana airport by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez. Cuomo told reporters that he's "hoping we can reach out and find a common ground."

Cuomo is the first governor to visit Cuba since President Obama started normalizing relations with the island nation, following the release of Alan Gross in 2014 after five years in prison.

The Governor said that New York's close relationship with Latin America and Cuba make it a logical starting point for his administration's efforts at strengthening ties between U.S. states and Cuba. Cuomo also acknowledged the controversy around his trip, saying "it's no secret there are people on all sides who say 'this is not a good idea, let it go.'"

Cuomo will be accompanied by business executives including: Jose Eberst of Tres Conceptos; Renee Fertig of Lilybird Travel Services; Michael LaRosa of Aviation Management Solutions; and Stephen J. Smyth of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

A delegation led by Senator Jeff Flake visited Cuba in late June as part of a bipartisan group of Senators seeking to boost trade between the two nations. In an op-ed, Cuomo said he hopes his trip will "help build on the momentum" created by President Obama's visit last March, when the president met with Cuban leaders including President Raul Castro and released three members of the Cuban Five who had been imprisoned for espionage. The Governor also hopes to use his trip to address human rights issues in Cuba that have drawn criticism from the Trump Administration.

In an op-ed published by the New York Daily News, Cuomo wrote: "I'm not naïve enough to believe that business with Cuba will change the Cuban government overnight, but I do believe that economic engagement has a way of changing people's lives for the better."

Cuomo's office did not respond to inquiries about whether the Governor will meet with dissidents or members of the Cuban opposition during his trip.

A spokeswoman for the Cuban Interest Section said she could not confirm whether Cuomo would be meeting with dissident groups, but added that he is welcome to meet with anyone interested in talking business. She also did not provide any more details about the governor's trip. The governor will return home on Thursday.
