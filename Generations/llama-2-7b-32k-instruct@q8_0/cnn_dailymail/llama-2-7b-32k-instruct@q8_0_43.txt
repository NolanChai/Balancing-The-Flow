Gov. Cuomo (D-NY) announced he would be leading a group of New York businesses on the trip in a statement Wednesday, which comes just two days after Obama's new Cuba policy went into effect . In addition to meeting with Cuban government officials and entrepreneurs, Gov. Cuomo will also attend an NBA game between the Knicks and the Cuba national team at Havana's San Antonio Stadium on Friday night.

According to the governor's office, the group includes representatives from Coca-Cola, JetBlue and New York's Empire State Development Corp., all of whom would be interested in exploring potential investment opportunities with Cuba. Gov. Cuomo will also meet with Cuban entrepreneurs and innovators during a series of private meetings set for Thursday and Friday .

"Cuba is at an inflection point," the governor said in a statement. "The President's new policies open up a new world, presenting unprecedented opportunities for New York businesses to create jobs, promote economic growth and expand exports."

"I am excited to lead this delegation on behalf of the Empire State and meet with Cuban government officials, entrepreneurs and business leaders," Cuomo added . "It is a critical time to seize new opportunities for New York as Cuba opens its door to foreign investment, innovation, and economic engagement."

The trip comes as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has become the first mayor in the nation to visit the island in more than 50 years. Gov. Cuomo and De Blasio have been political rivals for much of their time in office, but on Wednesday morning both were united in their praise for President Obama's new policy toward Cuba .

"We need to work together with the Cuban government to build a better future," de Blasio said at an event in Havana. "This is what I came here today to say, and this is why we are traveling."

The trip comes as part of Gov. Cuomo's ongoing efforts to increase economic ties between New York state and Cuba . The governor has also met with Cuban President Raul Castro at the United Nations in 2015 and traveled to Havana in 2016 for a meeting with Cuba's then-Premier, now-President Miguel Diaz Canel.

It is unclear what exactly Gov. Cuomo will be focusing on during his visit, as the Cuban government has not yet finalized its own policies regarding U.S. visitors under Obama's new Cuba policy . It was also not immediately clear whether Gov. Cuomo would meet with dissident groups in Cuba.

In a statement, the governor's office said that he would be focusing on "the Cuban people and promoting economic growth and entrepreneurship" during his visit to Havana. A source close to the governor confirmed that the trip was not just about business, but also included meeting with dissident groups .

It is unclear whether Gov. Cuomo will have any direct meetings with Fidel Castro or Raul's brother-in-law, Miguel Diaz Canel."
