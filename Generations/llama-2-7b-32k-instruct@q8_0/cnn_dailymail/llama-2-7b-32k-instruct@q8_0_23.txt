men were within sight of what would be their first European title when a penalty in extra time was missed by fly-half Christian Lealiifano who then kicked a touchline conversion to bring Toulon back into the match and send it into sudden death, but all as referee John Lacey blew for full time with his assistant, on the right side of the field, having signalled for another five minutes.

The Wasps players were incensed by what they thought was a blatant mistake given that Lealiifano’s penalty went over the touchline and Toulon had used up all their five replacements in the match at this point. In fact Lacey’s assistant signalled for five minutes of injury time, which the officials seemed to be unaware of until it was too late. The incident prompted a furious outburst from Wasps’ coach Dai Young after he had been informed by his players and Toulon’s Laurent Travers, who confirmed to The Telegraph that Lacey had got the time wrong.

Young told BT Sport: “I don’t know what was going on with their assistant referee there. If we were going to be a bit cheeky, you have five minutes of extra time and he is signalling for five minutes so it should have been 105 minutes. We just wanted to get off the pitch quickly but our players weren’t ready. The lads are devastated in there.”

Lacey was not available to speak to media after the match as Toulon won a dramatic, if controversial, penalty shoot-out 16-15 on sudden death, and Young added: “We have been brilliant this year but I can’t fault our players for their application or effort. To come so close at a club like Wasps and then to be done by the officials is really tough.”

The incident sparked outrage among the Wasps faithful who vented their anger on Twitter and had called for Lacey to be sacked, but Toulon’s Travers told The Telegraph that he did not believe the penalty would have changed the result. “We wouldn’t have made it if we missed the touchline drop goal,” he said.

Lacey also admitted his mistake in an interview with the BBC’s French service. “I don’t know why I didn’t hear them [the assistant referees]” he said. He apologised to Wasps but explained that he was only able to signal for five minutes of injury time as there is no such thing as an extra, or sudden death, period in the Champions Cup regulations.

He added: “We were aware from last year when we played at Gloucester they had 106 minutes and it wasn’t possible but I didn’t know until now that you can’t have a second five minutes of extra time.” Toulon coach Guy Boucher told French television afterwards: “I don’t think if Lealiifano missed the drop goal that we would have won. We were tired in the end and they played well at the end there.”

The error, however, is a significant one as it would seemingly have allowed Wasps to win their first ever European title had they not been denied extra time. It will be interesting to see if this incident will cause any debate amongst officials and whether Lacey’s assistant referee should have had the power to signal an additional five minutes of injury time when Lealiifano missed his penalty.

“It is a shame because I don’t think it would have changed the result,” said Toulon’s Travers, who added that he could not fault Wasps for their application and effort. “It was just too bad.” Lacey may be in line to referee England against Wales next month at Twickenham but this will certainly make his job much more difficult given the reception he received from Wasps supporters.

Dai Young has called for a review of match officials after an assistant referee made an error at the end of the Champions Cup final against Toulon on Sunday.

Wasps went down 16-15 in a penalty shootout after extra time and had scored a last-gasp drop goal only to have it disallowed due to a five-minute mistake from assistant referee John Lacey, who failed to signal an additional five minutes of injury time.

Young is adamant that his team should have been awarded five minutes of extra time and called for a review of the match officials’ decision following the final at Bristol. The Wasps coach was furious when he learned of Lacey’s error after the final whistle, claiming: “We didn’t know whether we were playing 106 or 110 minutes and then our assistant referee signalled five minutes for Lealiifano to kick a drop goal.

“It was like a big game of cat-and-mouse and the players weren’t ready – I thought there must be something up with him. It is an embarrassing situation.” Young told BT Sport: “We have been brilliant this year but I can’t fault our players for their application or effort. To come so close at a club like Wasps and then to be done by the officials is really tough.”

Wasps lost the final after having won all home matches in the competition, including three games against Toulon. Young insisted that his team had been hard done by despite an impressive performance and felt it was important for rugby union to learn from the situation. “I know that I will have a lot of criticism because we are Wasps but this is bigger than us,” he added.

Wasps head coach Dai Young has called for an independent review into the officials’ decision that cost his team their first ever European title in Sunday’s Champions Cup final against Toulon at Bristol’s Ashton Gate. Wasps had a last-gasp drop goal disallowed after it was ruled that Christian Lealiifano had missed touch when attempting to convert the try, but assistant referee John Lacey failed to signal five minutes of injury time as per the regulations.

Wasps lost 16-15 on a sudden death shootout despite an impressive performance in the final stages. Following the final whistle, Young was furious and called for a review of match officials after his side’s assistant referee had signalled five minutes for Lealiifano to attempt the conversion which missed touch.

“We didn’t know whether we were playing 106 or 110 minutes and then our assistant referee signalled five minutes for Lealiifano to kick a drop goal,” Young said on BT Sport. “It was like a big game of cat-and-mouse and the players weren’t ready - I thought there must be something up with him.”

“I know that I will have a lot of criticism because we are Wasps but this is bigger than us,” he added. Toulon coach Guy Boucher was also not aware of five minutes being signalled, stating: “It seems to me there should be one extra minute at the end of the normal time and an additional three minutes at the end if you get into sudden death.”

Both coaches agreed that Lealiifano’s missed conversion would not have made a difference, with Boucher commenting: “I don’t think if he missed it we wouldn’t have won. We were tired in the end and they played well at the end there.” The assistant referee was subsequently interviewed by the BBC and admitted that he had got his time wrong.

“I didn’t know whether to stop it or not,” Lacey said. “I don’t know why I didn’t hear them - if we were going to be a bit cheeky, you have five minutes of extra time, but we can’t.” Young has also called for an independent review into the refereeing panel that had overseen Sunday’s match and has urged that the officials should be held accountable for their decisions.

Dai Young was not happy with his assistant referee after Wasps' loss to Toulon in the Champions Cup final.

Wasps lost 16-15 on a sudden death shootout despite an impressive performance in the final stages, but the team felt it was denied what could have been its first ever European title due to a five-minute mistake from assistant referee John Lacey, who failed to signal an additional five minutes of injury time.

Young said: “We didn’t know whether we were playing 106 or 110 minutes and then our assistant referee signalled five minutes for Lealiifano to kick a drop goal." Young also explained that his team was not ready when the players eventually came out onto the pitch after Lacey had signaled.

“It was like a big game of cat-and-mouse and the players weren’t ready - I thought there must be something up with him," he said, adding: "I know that I will have a lot of criticism because we are Wasps but this is bigger than us." The assistant referee was subsequently interviewed by the BBC and admitted that he had got his time wrong.
