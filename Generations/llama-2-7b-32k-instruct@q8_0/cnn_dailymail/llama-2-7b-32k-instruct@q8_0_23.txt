1 / 1Wasps made an honourable and defiant exit from the Champions Cup on Sunday as they took the holders to the wire and may have clinched a seismic upset, but for a glaring official oversight. Dai Young’s side had done enough to merit a 12-6 victory at Ricoh Arena against Toulon, only for referee Romain Poite to award the French club a bonus point on the grounds that their fly-half, Rory Kockott, was still standing outside his own 22 when the clock ticked over into injury time. The error has provoked widespread condemnation and anger at both clubs and from all quarters of the game, but the reaction has been especially fury in Waspdom where one supporter told the Guardian that the decision had “cost us a cup final”.

Title: Don't waste your money!
Review: I purchased this as an end table for my living room, thinking it would be good looking. I was wrong...it is really tacky and looks very cheap in person. Not to mention that there isn't a "feet" on the bottom so you need to add some yourself. Even if you did use the feet, it still wouldn't look right sitting against the wall. If you are looking for an end table...don't buy this one!

Title: One of My Favorites
Review: This movie was absolutely great, and I would recommend it to any person who likes movies that don't follow the "rules" of modern Hollywood. The storyline is original and well-executed, the special effects are realistic and believable (not overdone like most other sci fi flicks), and the ending left me with a warm feeling of satisfaction rather than disappointment. This movie has it all - action, adventure, drama, humor, love. Definitely a must see for anyone who likes science fiction!

Title: One of The Best Horror Flicks Ever!!
Review: I saw this movie at the cinema when it was first released and i've been a fan ever since,I just bought the DVD after seeing it on Sky Movies as it is one of my favourites,and as with most people who have seen it,you cant really put into words how good it actually is.It doesnt seem like 20 years since its release,the storyline is still fresh and new.A very well acted movie,a good cast and great music,this movie deserves all the accolades that came its way back in 1986.Its a shame there hasnt been a follow up,as this was one of those movies that you could watch over and over again without it getting boring or losing any of its magic

Title: Not bad for $12.95
Review: A little overpriced but not too bad for 13 dollars. The material has some weight to it and feels nice. The buttons are a bit on the small side, so it might be hard to close them with your pants buttoned up tightly (as I do). If you're OK with a loose fit then this would work out well for you. It seems like a good product but I can't rate the durability since I've only had it for 10 days now.

Title: A very informative book!
Review: This is a very informative book, with lots of information and pictures on the many different varieties of lilies. It explains where they come from, how to plant them, how to care for them in all stages, and what problems might arise. I have already used some of this knowledge when I purchased a large bag of bulbs at Home Depot recently.

Title: Not for everyone
Product review: This novel will appeal to those who are interested in the dark, sordid underbelly of what goes on between people when they're left alone too long - not just with each other, but also with themselves. The main character, a middle aged woman who has lost her husband and lives alone in rural Georgia, is an odd duck. She comes across as strange to all who encounter her; she doesn't have many friends. The story takes place at the time when the civil rights movement was occurring. It is set during this time because it relates to some of the character's issues - that of being left out and alone, and of her husband's passing. All in all, though not a book I would recommend for everyone, it does make you think about some of life's less pleasant aspects...those that we prefer not to think about.

Title: A good read if you can get past the writing style.
Product review: I bought this book thinking it was going to be something like The Tipping Point, but boy did that change. Although there are many great insights and anecdotes in the book, the author's writing style is pretty confusing and difficult to understand at times. It seems like he wanted to throw a lot of big words and hard-to-understand statistics into the mix, hoping they would give his book an air of authority and importance. This didn't work for me though - I found the book quite boring and full of pretentious wordplay that didn't really help make any points at all. If you can get past this, however, there are some interesting concepts in the book, so it might be worth taking a shot if you find it cheap enough on Amazon or somewhere else.

Title: Good for kids and parents
Review: We bought these books to replace our old worn out ones - we're not disappointed! These are good for children 8-14 yrs. The stories have good morals, which is nice. We also enjoyed them as adults because they were funny, interesting, and entertaining.

Title: Great book...bad printing
Review: The information in the book is great but there are several pages that have print that runs off the edge of the page and onto the next one. I don't understand how that would happen because all of my other books do not have this problem. It makes it difficult to read as you have to try and keep your place on the page by cutting away some of the text or folding over parts with print from the previous page.

Title: Very helpful book, but...
Review: I ordered this book based on a recommendation from a colleague. The first time I tried to use it, I discovered that it was not organized by date in the manner that it should be. While I can overlook some minor problems with it as being an old edition, there are some major problems with its organization and content. It is impossible to find any information about a specific month of the year without going back many pages and trying to remember where the months are organized. This book has been updated recently but the publishers apparently haven't changed this problem. I do not recommend it unless you can overlook these major flaws
