of Evertonians is finally wearing thin, with many wondering what has gone wrong.
The short answer - a combination of injuries to key players, bad decision making from managers and the failure to replace a number of first team regulars who have left for other clubs during the summer.
The Toffees' troubles started at the end of last season when the side was unable to secure any silverware despite being one of the top contenders for the league title, cup competitions or in the race for a UEFA Super Cup or Champions League spot.
A 2-0 defeat by Bolton Wanderers at Goodison Park on 16 April 2008 marked the end of Everton's hopes for honours for another season, although manager David Moyes had earlier been warned about the inadequacies of his squad.
Moyes was told he needed to recruit two strikers and a defender after failing to secure any major signings during the January transfer window . The 2008 summer transfer window failed to produce any real talent, with just three players arriving at Goodison Park - Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Alan Stubbs and Phil Jagielka.
Despite a strong start to this season, which saw Everton take seven points from the first three matches of the Premier League campaign, Moyes was again warned about the lack of quality in his squad after failing to secure any new signings during the January transfer window .
Everton have so far failed to produce any goalscoring talent from their summer recruitment drive - just three players arriving at Goodison Park - Tim Cahill, Jo, and Steven Pienaar.
With key players such as James McFadden and John Utaka set to be out of action for most of the season it's hard not to see where Moyes is going wrong in his transfer dealings . But that doesn't excuse his decision making on the pitch this season, which has also seen some disappointing results.
With a lack of options in defence, Moyes has had no option but to start Tim Cahill at centre-back for much of the campaign and it is clear that this is not the most effective position for him . He has been forced to play a number of other players out of their natural positions and there have also been some baffling decisions over team selection.
Another big problem for Moyes has been his reliance on injury time equalisers to get points from games - seven in total this season alone, although the first two goals against Burnley were questionable .
Everton's failure to secure a win against Liverpool at Anfield was particularly galling for Moyes and his players. The Toffees had the better chances throughout the game but failed to break the deadlock . A 0-0 draw meant Liverpool would claim the bragging rights after winning the Merseysiders' derby clash.
The Reds then went on to beat Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane to move up into fifth place in the Premier League, and that sparked an outbreak of fear and loathing from Evertonians who were already wary about their side's lack of quality . The Toffees were knocked out of both the UEFA Super Cup and Carling Cup competitions by Liverpool.
After a number of disappointing results Moyes was told to sign up for this summer, including an FA Cup final appearance and top four finish in the Premier League. He failed on all three counts and it is now clear that Everton have some serious questions to answer if they are not to fall further down the pecking order in English football.
The club's board must consider their manager's future, with Moyes under pressure after an indifferent start to his third season at Goodison Park . With Everton's European dreams over for another year there is no excuse for anything less than a top four finish in the Premier League and a trophy next season.
A failure to deliver would be disastrous for all parties involved - fans, players, manager and board alike, as well as Moyes being asked to pay back some of his large wage packet . He will also face the wrath of Evertonians if he does not secure a top four finish in this season's UEFA Europa League competition.
Without silverware Everton are likely to fall further down the pecking order, and it is difficult to see what kind of players Moyes can attract during the next transfer window . The lack of quality shown by his current squad is worrying and has become a major problem for the Toffees . With no realistic chance of European football in 2010 Everton fans will be looking at the top flight's riches from last season with envy.
Moyes was given an extended deadline to secure European qualification, but unless there are some impressive results during the Europa League competition he must come up with a strong set of signings in this summer's transfer window or face the sack . It is time for Moyes and Everton to wake up.
A good start to the season has been followed by an indifferent spell, which could lead to another relegation battle if there are no improvements on the pitch, so a strong set of signings must be made during this transfer window or it will be curtains for Moyes and Everton at Goodison Park.
