Sheffield United is a professional English football club, playing its home games at Bramall Lane. The nicknames for Sheffield United supporters are Blades and The Bladesmen. Formed as an amateur side in 1889 by the merger of Hallam and Sheffield United, the team joined the Football League in 1892. Although the club has won three major honours since, the Sheffield and Hallamshire County FA Cup (in 1896) and two League Cups (1993 and 1995), its history can be traced back to at least the 1870s. Its nicknames are The Bladesmen, a reference to its traditional association with the steel industry of Sheffield in South Yorkshire .

It won promotion from League Two in 2006 and has spent the majority of its history playing in England's second tier, finishing as high as seventh in 1986-87. Since then, however, the club has struggled to make any kind of impact at that level and was relegated from League One in 2015 before winning promotion back to that division the following season after beating Cheltenham Town in the playoff final . It played in the top four tiers of English football for its first 49 seasons, but since then it has been relegated six times and promoted five times. The club have spent just two years out of the Football League's bottom tier since 1973, when it joined from the Southern League after the restructuring of that competition .

It is currently in its third consecutive season in the Championship, which it has finished above once before (in 2016--17). Its biggest success came in winning promotion to the Premier League in 1992--93 after finishing as runners-up in the First Division. In 1995 it won its only other major honour, the Football League Cup .
