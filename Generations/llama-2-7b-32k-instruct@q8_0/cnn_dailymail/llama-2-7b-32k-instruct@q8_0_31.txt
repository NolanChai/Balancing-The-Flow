Botti as well as midfielders Chris Powell and Nick Barmby are all set to miss the crucial clash which could make or break Leeds' survival hopes.

Leeds boss George Graham has also said that he will be unable to name a full team tomorrow after complaining at his club's lack of support for this weekend's game and being denied permission to speak to players released from international duty by the FA on Wednesday night.

Graham said: 'We had a meeting with the board but they didn't listen, and now we have a problem which may lead to us losing the match. I don't know what will happen as it is unbelievable that this situation has arisen. What good does denying players international release do?'

Graham is also angry at Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale for his decision not to appeal against a Football Association ruling banning him from talking to players released from national duty in the middle of the season.

'It makes me feel embarrassed,' Graham said. 'I was told by people at The FA that I would be fined if I talked to any of my players who were due to return after playing for their country in mid-season. They didn't say I could be banned from doing so, and now it has happened.'

Leeds are due to take on Charlton Athletic this weekend looking for a positive result that will keep them in the Premiership. This is one of the most important matches in their history - failure at The Valley would mean Leeds being relegated into Division One after just two seasons in the top flight.

However, they are likely to be without key players Mirco Antenucci and Giuseppe Bellusci who have pulled out of the match due to injuries sustained in previous games. Also, Dario del Fabro, Marc Botti and Nick Barmby will not participate because of long-term injuries.

Leeds manager Graham is also angry that his team has been unable to field a full squad for this weekend's match, due to the fact that he was not allowed to speak with players on international duty after his side's FA Cup exit at Glossop last Tuesday night. The Football Association denied him permission to talk to the players.

Leeds United were given clearance by FIFA and the Italian FA to release Bellusci, Antenucci, del Fabro and Botti for Italy's friendly in Dublin on Wednesday night but Leeds chairman Ridsdale declined the chance to speak with them at his offices after the match. The players, however, were not told of this decision until they returned to the airport, leaving them to fly home from Ireland.

Ridsdale's decision sparked a massive row between the club and the FA, as both parties are now threatening legal action against each other.

Leeds will be without the Italian international quartet for tomorrow's match but they have been joined on the injury list by Chris Powell (knee), Nick Barmby (ankle) and Dario del Fabro (knee). Both players are expected to be sidelined for at least eight weeks.

The absence of these key players has led many people, including manager George Graham, to express fears that the team would not have enough firepower to survive in the top flight. It is believed that Leeds would need at least a 2-0 victory against Charlton Athletic or hope for other results to go their way if they are to avoid relegation from the Premiership.

'We are all very worried,' said Ridsdale. 'But we have got a duty of care to our supporters and our shareholders. It is better to get this out of the way now rather than go through the season without a clear runway policy.'

It seems that Leeds United will be forced to play on Saturday against Charlton Athletic, although they are expected to be weakened by injuries. The team has been depleted further with six players set to miss their match due to injury.

A statement released from the club's press office revealed that Bellusci, Antenucci and Botti will be missing for tomorrow's clash at the Valley, along with Del Fabro and Barmby who were not risked in Tuesday night's defeat away to Glossop.

The statement also confirmed that Powell and Barmby are unlikely to feature this weekend but gave no reason as to why the two players would miss out.

Leeds United have been hit by a fresh injury crisis, which has left their chances of staying in the Premiership in grave danger. The club's medical staff said that Powell had damaged his knee ligaments and Barmby ankle ligaments during Tuesday night's 5-1 defeat away to Glossop.

Both players were expected to be available for tomorrow's match against Charlton Athletic, however it would seem that Ridsdale has decided not to risk them in the crucial match which could make or break their hopes of survival in the Premiership.

The news was a huge blow to manager Graham and his team, as the absence of these two key players will surely weaken Leeds' chances even more. It now seems that they will be forced to play tomorrow's match without half of their starting line-up.

It has been revealed that both players are expected to be out for at least eight weeks and it is believed that Ridsdale will not risk them on Saturday against Charlton Athletic, who are currently in the relegation zone along with Leeds United.

Leeds will be hoping that other results will go their way over the weekend if they are to survive in the Premiership but it seems like a huge setback for their hopes of staying in the top flight and keeping Ridsdale as chairman.

It is believed that Leeds' chances of winning tomorrow's match have been depleted further by this injury crisis, which has left them with only six fit players available to play against Charlton Athletic who are currently in a relegation fight themselves.

Leeds United manager George Graham believes his team will be able to bounce back from Tuesday night's 5-1 defeat away to Glossop in their Premiership match against Charlton Athletic on Saturday, although they have been hit by an injury crisis which has left them with only six fit players available for the game.

The team will be missing a number of key players who are expected to be out for at least eight weeks because of injuries sustained in Tuesday night's match against Glossop, including Chris Powell and Barmby.

Graham believes that his team is strong enough to bounce back from the defeat but it will certainly make things harder for Leeds as they fight for their survival. He said: 'I don't think our injury situation will affect us too much in Saturday's match because we have got a good squad and the players who are available now can step up to the plate.'

It seems that Ridsdale has decided not to risk his injured players on Saturday, which could be disastrous for Leeds as they battle for survival in the Premiership. It is believed that he has ruled them out of the game because of fears that injuries may worsen and lead to serious problems in the future.

Ridsdale's decision will not only affect his team but also his job, as many Leeds supporters believe that it would have been better if he had allowed Graham to speak with players on international duty, as he was denied permission to do so by the Football Association.

Leeds are now expected to be weakened even further and could struggle in their crucial game against Charlton Athletic. It is believed that they will need a 2-0 victory or hope for other results to go their way if they are to avoid relegation from the Premiership, although it seems unlikely that this will happen now with only six fit players available to play tomorrow's match.

Leeds United have been hit by another injury crisis which has left them with just six fit players available for their crucial Premiership match against Charlton Athletic on Saturday.

The team is already depleted as a result of injuries sustained during Tuesday night's 5-1 defeat away to Glossop, with Chris Powell and Barmby joining Bellusci, Antenucci, del Fabro and Botti in the injured list.

The news has left many Leeds supporters fearing that the club will be relegated into Division One after two seasons in the top flight, as it seems highly unlikely that they would have enough firepower to survive without their key players.

Many people believe that Ridsdale should allow manager Graham to speak with the players on international duty but he has not been allowed to do so by The Football Association and it seems like a huge setback for Leeds' chances of staying in the Premiership.

It is believed that Charlton Athletic will be looking at this game as a must-win one if they are to stay in the Premiership, as they currently find themselves only three points above Leeds and with a much better goal difference.
