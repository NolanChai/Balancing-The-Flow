Leeds United were dealt a significant setback ahead of their Sky Bet Championship clash with Charlton Athletic on Saturday when six first-team players pulled out citing injuries. (1)

The Yorkshire club announced the withdrawals in a statement on its website, saying that Argentine pair Gus Poyet and Pablo Hernandez would be out for "a number of weeks" with thigh problems respectively, while loanees Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro and Marc Bola were all injured.

Five other players will also miss the trip to The Valley due to injury and illness. The club's statement said: "They are: Gael Kakuta (leg injury), Souleymane Doukara (illness), Lewie Coyle (knee problem), Chris Dawson (hamstring strain) and Patrick Bamford (groin issue)." (3)

Leeds are currently eighth in the Sky Bet Championship table, 15 points behind leaders Brighton & Hove Albion. Manager Uwe Rosler is under pressure to deliver some positive results soon after a dismal start to the season. His team has not won any of its seven league games so far and Rosler admitted that he was worried about his players' lack of confidence ahead of Saturday's match, when Leeds are hopeful of a response following Wednesday night's 5-4 defeat by Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup.

Leeds United are preparing to launch an appeal against their 12-point deduction for breaching financial fair play rules. The club was sanctioned last month after its application to be exempt from FFP regulations was rejected. The club is to make a submission on the decision to a three-member commission, and will challenge why Leeds was denied an exemption when other clubs in similar positions have been given one. (4)

"I don't think we were given any clear reasons for the decision," Rosler said recently." (5)

Apart from this, United are also facing a possible points deduction after the Football Association charged them with failing to control their players following an incident in Wednesday's match against Middlesbrough. The FA is investigating what happened when two of Leeds' substitutes clashed with one of the referee's assistants at full-time and has warned the club that action could follow. (5)
