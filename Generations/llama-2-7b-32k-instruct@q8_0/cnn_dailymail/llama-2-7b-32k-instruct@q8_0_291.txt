Vehicles powered by hydrogen gas (H2) will play an important role in the global fight against climate change, according to a new report commissioned by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report also states that renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are unlikely to meet the world's future demand for liquid transport fuels.

The IEA has released its annual World Energy Outlook report, which predicts that by 2045, almost all of the passenger cars on the road will be powered by hydrogen gas. In addition, it says that hydrogen-powered trucks and buses will account for more than a quarter of heavy-duty vehicles in service globally. The report also predicts that hydrogen-powered ships could carry over 15% of global maritime cargo by 2045.

The IEA's Executive Director, Fatih Birol, says the agency's analysis shows that "clean" hydrogen fuel can play a significant role in reducing carbon emissions and meeting future energy demand. He notes that while renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are important, they cannot meet all of the world's energy needs.

The report also highlights the potential for hydrogen to play a role in decarbonizing the industrial sector, which accounts for around 30% of global carbon emissions. The IEA estimates that by 2045, nearly 60% of total hydrogen production will come from renewable sources such as wind and solar power.

The report's predictions come as countries around the world are looking for ways to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. The IEA's World Energy Outlook is seen as an important tool for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders who want to understand the future of energy and its impact on the global economy.

It should be noted that while hydrogen fuel is considered a clean energy source because it doesn't produce CO2 when burned, it does require large amounts of electricity to produce. This means that hydrogen fuel production could still have an environmental impact if the electricity comes from coal or natural gas. Additionally, there are concerns about the safety and cost-effectiveness of producing and storing hydrogen fuel on a large scale.

Nevertheless, the IEA's report shows that hydrogen fuel is likely to play an important role in meeting the world's energy needs in the future, especially as countries look for ways to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. The report also highlights the need for continued research and investment in hydrogen technology to make it more efficient and cost-effective.
