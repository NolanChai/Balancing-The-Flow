"Parking Enforcement Officer" Writes Man Ticket for Helping Elderly Woman on Side of Road
A good Samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying. Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped in the first space available when he saw the person lying next to his car at an intersection near campus in Lafayette, Louisiana on Friday. He was not sure if she was dead or alive so he pulled over and asked someone to help him look after the woman. However, police arrived a short while later and issued Hollinshead a ticket for "improper parking"."They told me I couldn't park there because of her," he said about being issued the $94 fine. "I was just trying to help her in any way that I could, so it makes it really frustrating," he added. Hollinshead said he did not know if she was dead or alive until police arrived and began performing CPR."I knew she wasn't okay when the ambulance came and they took her away. She was on the ground for a good amount of time so I just tried to help as best that I could," Hollinshead said. He has since received an outpouring of support from people who are furious over his parking ticket."A lot of people have been talking about it and we've seen a lot of good comments on Facebook, too," he added. "The police officer was just trying to do his job in the best way that he knew how but I didn't think I was doing anything wrong at first," Hollinshead said."A ticket is a small price compared to her life if she were dead and now she's alive because of it, so I don't really know what else I can do," he added. "I have no regrets about pulling over or helping her out at all," he said. Hollinshead said the woman was later found to be OK."She walked by me when I got back in my car and she looked like a totally different person from when I left her on the ground," he said.
