ioner struggle into the parking lot and get out of her car. After making sure she was OK, he called for paramedics before getting a ticket from the driver behind him. He has appealed against the fine, but said he would have done it again.

A spokesman for Bristol City Council said: "We will be dealing with this case sympathetically and we will work out how to resolve it fairly."

Mr Hollinshead told a local newspaper that his 87-year-old grandfather had recently died of cancer, and he was reminded of the story when he saw an elderly woman having difficulty. "I think about my grandfather every day," Mr Hollinshead said in a post on Facebook. "When I pulled up to her car, she could barely stand."

He added: "She wasn't getting out, and I was getting worried that something serious might have happened." Mr Hollinshead said he had been trying to find someone who would give him a ride so he could take the woman to hospital himself, but when no one showed up after 10 minutes, he called an ambulance.

A council spokesman said: "The officer did not know about Drew's grandfather at that time and should have explained this was a good deed." He added: "We will deal with the case sympathetically as it is clear that Mr Hollinshead acted in good faith to help someone who might be vulnerable."

During his appeal, Mr Hollinshead told an officer that he didn't have enough money to pay the fine and was informed he could do community work instead. But a council spokesman said this wasn't true because people with disabilities can only do community work if they are employed or volunteer, but not in return for a parking ticket.

"We want our officers to be aware that there may be other circumstances where drivers stop when they see someone struggling and we will continue to try to raise awareness about this," he said.

Parking tickets should not be a punishment for helping others
18 hours ago	| 379 likes     Disabled bays are there so that people with disabilities can park closer to what they need. If you don't have a disability, it shouldn't matter if you're allowed to park in one.   Parking tickets should not be a punishment for helping others   264 comments
"You've done a good thing by parking there Drew Hollinshead. There are more good people like yourself than bad ones, even though they'd have you think otherwise."
18 hours ago	| 379 likes     Disabled bays should not be for disabled people only, it should also help the elderly who cannot walk far and need to park in a closer place to their destination. I have an elderly neighbour who has to take public transport because she doesn't drive and walks everywhere; even though she has never used a wheelchair or scooter, it is unfair that she can't use the disabled bays just because her doctor said she is at risk for health problems if she walks too much.

"You did exactly what any human being would do when someone in trouble needs help - you stopped to help them and called the paramedics. You've done something most people wouldn't have thought of doing. Congratulations to you! It must be hard for many disabled persons like me to reach their destination, so it's great that you helped her."
17 hours ago	| 380 likes     This should not happen because we live in a world where people are encouraged to help others and the only way to do that is by parking wherever they need. I don't understand why some people get upset about something so minor like this, but it seems like a big deal to them.   Parking tickets should not be a punishment for helping others   263 comments
"You did the right thing in my opinion and should be rewarded with a free parking ticket because you have done more than most would do by saving someone's life or preventing injury."
17 hours ago	| 380 likes     If you park in disabled bays, then that means you are either disabled or helping someone who is. It does not matter if the person you are assisting is old or young, it only matters that they have some sort of disability and you are parking there to help them. You did a good thing by stopping when you saw her struggling.   Parking tickets should not be a punishment for helping others   263 comments
"I've never understood why disabled bays need to exist, I mean how many people with disabilities drive? It's like the council are saying that if you have a wheelchair then you can't possibly drive. How stupid is that!?"
15 hours ago	| 372 likes     The same should happen for drivers who park in disabled bays when their car is not disabled - they are taking away a space that could be used by someone with a disability and leaving them no choice but to park illegally, which is very unfair!

"Drew Hollinshead did the right thing - it doesn't matter if the woman was elderly or disabled; she might have been having an attack and needed to get out of the car. People need to learn to help more."
15 hours ago	| 372 likes     If you see a person struggling, don't judge them and assume they are faking it because they want you to give them something for free - just stop what you are doing and ask if they are OK. I think this is so important because people don't want to be bothered these days."
15 hours ago	| 372 likes     It's not fair that Drew Hollinshead got a parking ticket for helping someone out, when it's supposed to be there to help disabled persons. I would like the council to let him off because what he did was the right thing."
