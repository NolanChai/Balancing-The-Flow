The Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry is overplayed, says Ronaldo as he eyes Portugal comeback (Daily Mail)

Ronaldo has criticised media and fans who have made a mountain out of the Argentina star and Portugal captain's ongoing battle for supremacy at club level.

The 34-year-old was speaking to Sports Illustrated when he claimed that both players are good sportsmen. He also added that neither player should be compared with Brazil legend Pelé.

"I think the Messi-Ronaldo rivalry is overplayed, it's been blown out of proportion," Ronaldo said. "They are great players, but there have always been many others throughout history."

He also suggested that both men should be judged on their own achievements and not compared with Pelé or other legendary players in the game.

"We need to judge them as they are, without trying to compare them," he added. "Ronaldo and Messi have done great things for football."

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has not played since May 2015 when his club, Juventus, were eliminated in the second round of the Champions League. Ronaldo is hoping to make a return next season with Manchester United and was spotted training with Portugal at their base in Oeiras earlier this month.

The former Inter Milan man's career has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he hopes his comeback will not be short-lived, like the one that saw him return to Manchester in 2018.

"I can assure you that I am very well prepared," Ronaldo said of his fitness levels. "I have a lot of energy."

Ronaldo also revealed his admiration for England winger Raheem Sterling and believes he would be able to compete with the best players in Europe if he were playing for one of the bigger clubs in England or Spain.

"He (Sterling) has a lot of potential," Ronaldo said. "If he were to play at Barça, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Bayern Munich or Liverpool, I think it would be very different."

The forward also praised the way Portugal coach Fernando Santos handled their Euro 2016 campaign and insisted that there is still room for improvement as they head into next year's World Cup in Qatar.

"We need to improve our defence a lot, we concede too many goals," Ronaldo said. "And also our final ball."

Ronaldo added: "I think Portugal have improved a lot since the last World Cup and I hope to be there at my best, with my team-mates, fighting for everything."

The forward ended by insisting that he will not take part in any friendlies during next year's tournament because his main focus is on helping Portugal succeed. "I won't play any friendlies before the World Cup," he said.

"My priority is the national team and I hope to be there at my best."

Portugal's squad for the upcoming international break includes just one uncapped player: 21-year-old striker Joao Felix, who plays for Atletico Madrid.

Ronaldo also spoke about his love for Portugal and claimed that playing in front of the fans is a "privilege".

"It's something special to play in front of our supporters," he said. "It's a privilege, it's an incredible feeling."

The former Manchester United player also praised Santos for his role as manager and claimed that the coach is the main reason why Portugal have improved so much since the 2014 World Cup.

"Santos has had a great impact," Ronaldo said. "He's changed everything in this national team."

The forward also spoke about how he tries to stay focused on the pitch, despite his off-field responsibilities as a father and businessman.

"I am very demanding of myself, I don't like to fail," Ronaldo said. "But at the same time, you have to accept that life is not always perfect."

Ronaldo also revealed that he has been working hard on his fitness in preparation for next season and believes that his body feels good despite being 34 years old.

"I train every day, I'm very focused," he said. "I try to stay at my best."

Ronaldo also praised the way Portugal have been able to integrate players who are not household names into their squad and insisted that this is a big reason why they are so successful.

"We have a great group, with many talented players," he said. "But we also have a lot of youngsters in our team."

The forward added: "They need to take their chance when it comes along and we're all confident that they will do well."

Ronaldo ended by saying that Portugal are determined to be the best version of themselves at next year's World Cup.

"We want to be our best," he said.

"We want to compete with the best teams in the world and we know that it won't be easy."

Portugal's World Cup campaign will begin on November 24 against Ghana, before they take on South Korea (November 28) and Uruguay (December 3).

Their group stage matches are all at the Lusail Iconic Stadium in Qatar.
