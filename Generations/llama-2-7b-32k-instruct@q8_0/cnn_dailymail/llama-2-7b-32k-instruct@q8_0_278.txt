Barcelona have had a busy summer transfer window so far, signing Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid, and bringing back Sergi Roberto from Bayern Munich on loan. With those two moves, Barcelona now have two players named Ronaldo in their first-team squad, which begs the question: who is the best Ronaldo?

Ronaldo was the name given to a baby born in 1985, which would go on to become one of the most successful sportsmen of all time. The name was chosen by his father because he wanted him to be as good as his older brother. In fact, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were once teammates at Sporting Lisbon . But while Cristiano became a football superstar who has played for some of the world's biggest clubs like Manchester United and Real Madrid, Messi went on to become a five-time Ballon D'Or winner.

Cristiano Ronaldo started his senior career with Manchester United at 18 years old in 2003 . At first, he didn't have much of an impact at the club as a winger and was used mostly as a sub. In fact, many people still believed that he wasn't going to make it big, despite the scouts raving about him. However, after he made his full debut against Bolton Wanderers in 2006, everything changed for him. He became one of Sir Alex Ferguson's most trusted players and started to score goals at will.

Cristiano Ronaldo is widely regarded as being the best player on the planet when he was playing for Manchester United. It was his ability to run with the ball that set him apart, along with his explosive pace and finishing. He also had an uncanny ability of knowing exactly where the goal was at any given moment. Ronaldo would often find himself in spaces between defenders, leaving them baffled as to how he got there.

Ronaldo went on to become Manchester United's top goalscorer and assist maker, but after nine years with the club, it was time for a change. In 2009, Ronaldo signed for Real Madrid in a then world record transfer of € 80 million . The move was seen as a bit of an anticlimax by some fans, given that he was moving from Manchester United to Los Blancos, who were struggling at the time.

Ronaldo's time at Madrid did not start well. He failed to adapt quickly and struggled to find the same form he had when playing for Manchester United. However, with a new manager coming in, things began to change for him. Ronaldo became one of Real Madrid's most important players once again, winning La Liga titles and the UEFA Champions League.

Ronaldo also set records along the way. He has scored more goals for a single club than any player since Ferenc Deak of Ferlach in 1924 and became the first player to reach 300 career goals . Cristiano Ronaldo has become one of the most decorated players ever, winning five Ballon d'Or awards, four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, and two European Golden Boot awards.

Ronaldo is widely considered as being one of the greatest strikers of all time, along with Pelé, Gerd Müller, Bobby Charlton, Didi, and Eusébio. Ronaldo's career has been characterized by his ability to score goals in any game he plays. His record for Manchester United was impressive; he scored 292 goals in 312 appearances for the club . He also holds the record of being the most expensive player in history when Real Madrid paid € 80 million for him . Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest players to ever play the game and his impact on football will be felt for decades.

Ronaldo's legacy was cemented in Portugal as well, where he made a record 172 appearances and scored 85 goals for them between 1995 and 2002 . Ronaldo also led the nation to its first ever major title at the European Championships of 2016.

Ronaldo's impact in Portugal was even bigger than his time with Manchester United, as he became a national icon. In an interview, Ronaldo said that playing for Sporting Lisbon and Manchester United were two different experiences, but they both had something to do with him."They are very important to me. Manchester United was huge," the forward said . "But my experience at Sporting was also very big because it made me what I am today . If I'd stayed in Portugal, who knows how things would have been?"

Ronaldo still holds a special place in Portuguese people's heart. He is widely regarded as being one of the best players to ever come out of Portugal. Ronaldo played for Sporting Lisbon and Manchester United but was born in Madeira. Cristiano Ronaldo is arguably the greatest Portuguese footballer, having won two Ballon D'Or awards and five Golden Boot awards.
