at the Hardware Hank on Crosse Avenue in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Judge Mark McGinnis told Lind: 'This is not something you should have done.' He sentenced him to 20 days in jail and ordered that he pay for all the coffee he used before admitting guilt. According to Lind's attorney, Timothy O'Leary, his client was motivated by his desire to make Maahs, who he was having a 'flirtatious relationship with', look at him. He said: 'It did not go as planned.' But prosecutor Dan Cheslock suggested that Lind had been trying to humiliate her because of what she was wearing when he committed the crime - which O'Leary denied. Maahs, who worked in the cash register area at Hardware Hank, said on Thursday: 'It was kind of a shock and a little bit scary. I don't want to go into too much detail about what happened, but it wasn't funny.' But she did say that she never even noticed it until after the police had interviewed her. In court documents, Lind told his attorney: 'I was just trying to get Pat's attention and thought this would be a humorous way to do it.' O'Leary added: 'He didn't have any evil intention, but he went about it in a foolish fashion . It wasn't like the guy who goes around raping women. This was an act of folly.'
