game that is set to be packed full of drama, tension and excitement.

Jamie Redknapp: It has all been going wrong for Aston Villa lately and it doesn't look like they can keep up with the big boys in the Premier League any time soon. They will hope to make a strong comeback here and this is certainly not too far-fetched as Liverpool are missing their first choice goalkeeper Alisson Becker (back injury) and Jurgen Klopp will have to play a makeshift defence with Nathaniel Phillips in for Joel Matip.

This tie could be decided by either team's strikers, and the Liverpool duo of Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah have been in fine form this season so it would be foolish to bet against them here. Liverpool will look to play on the counter attack though and they are a threat from set pieces too so Villa need to stay alert.

Villa, who are chasing European football next season, can't afford any mistakes with this game coming in the middle of an important run of fixtures for them. If they can come away from Liverpool with a positive result then it will boost their confidence and show that they belong at this level.

I would not be surprised if this were to finish 2-1 to Liverpool as both teams have players who can make the difference when needed. This game has the potential to be an absolute classic, especially considering these two sides haven't met in competitive action since 1985!

What will the scoreline be? Comment below...<s> <|endoftext|> The present invention relates to a device for measuring the concentration of blood constituents in samples drawn from human subjects. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for determining the concentration of blood glucose level (blood sugar) and other biochemical components of blood taken from humans.
The present invention provides a simple method using small volume (microliters) of whole blood that allows easy, rapid and accurate measurement of glucose levels in human subjects. The invented device is based on an improved, commercially available biosensor that uses a disposable test strip to determine the concentration of glucose in the sample drawn from the subject's finger by using an electrical current generated by the oxidase enzyme reaction.
The method and apparatus can be used for measuring the blood glucose levels of human subjects, particularly diabetic subjects, with improved accuracy, convenience and speed. It is designed to be portable, hand-held or bench top, easy to use, inexpensive to manufacture and operate, relatively reliable, requires very small sample volumes, produces results which are immediately visible on the screen of a simple microprocessor readout unit, and can be used without the need for trained medical personnel.
The present invention further relates to an improved method of calibration of biosensors that allows measurement of glucose concentration with high accuracy. This new procedure is easy to perform, provides reproducible results, and eliminates the need for extensive testing by the manufacturer or user prior to use. The improved calibration procedure also allows the user to determine whether a biosensor has become defective in its performance over time, so that it can be replaced well before a significant change in the subject's glucose level could have occurred.
The present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description thereof when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to designate alike structural elements throughout all the figures, and wherein:

Referring now to FIG. 1, an overall system layout of the blood glucose monitor of the present invention that uses a disposable biosensor is shown. In general terms, the system includes: (1) A hand-held, portable device for taking and reading finger stick samples from human subjects; and (2) A microprocessor readout unit to determine the glucose concentration of the sample obtained from the subject's finger using the disposable biosensor. The microprocessor readout unit is coupled to an electrical signal generator that provides a current output signal corresponding to the concentration of glucose in the sample, as detected by the biosensor.
In FIG. 2, one embodiment of the hand-held device for measuring blood glucose concentration using a disposable test strip is illustrated. The portable device generally includes an upper case enclosure that houses the electronics, display and mechanical parts; and a lower case that holds the battery compartment, electrodes and leads. It also has a finger stick pad at its top side for pricking the skin of human subjects to obtain samples of their blood. The finger stick pad is designed such that it can be opened easily and conveniently by the user for taking a sample from any part of a subject's body, e.g., finger, palm or ear lobe.
Referring now to FIGS. 3-10, various views of the disposable test strip and microprocessor readout unit that may be used in practicing the present invention are shown. FIG. 4 illustrates an exploded perspective view showing the components of the disposable test strip including: (1) a mounting portion 9 at which the electrodes and leads extend from; (2) a test strip substrate 25 with an electrode array printed or coated on one side thereof, to contact the blood sample obtained from the subject's finger; (3) a control layer 6 that controls the transfer of electrons across the electrodes and into the electrolyte in the absorbent pad when the biosensor is dipped in an electrolytic solution such as a buffered saline, or other liquid sample containing glucose; (4) an insulation layer 5 to cover the control layer and test strip substrate; (5) a carrier tape 30 for holding the components of the disposable test strip in place during manufacture and use.
