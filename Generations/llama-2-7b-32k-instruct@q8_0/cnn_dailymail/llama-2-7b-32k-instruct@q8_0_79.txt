week ago, as well as Barcelona's win over Malaga on Wednesday.

Barcelona have had an injury crisis at the back this season and Messi is hoping to help ease some pressure off the new recruits . "We all know that it has been very difficult for us in defense," he told Mundo Deportivo . "But I'm convinced that with our attack we can compensate. If we score goals, then defensive mistakes will not be such a big problem."

Meanwhile, Celta Vigo have had to make five changes from the side that drew 1-1 at Athletic Bilbao in La Liga last weekend because of injuries and suspension . "We're in the middle of a complicated situation," coach Juan Carlos Unzue said . "The team is playing well, but we are not getting results."

Barcelona are still top of La Liga by four points ahead of Real Madrid who have an extra match. The Catalans lead Atletico Madrid by three points with 10 matches left to play for this season.

Meanwhile, Celta Vigo are in the relegation zone in 22nd place, but Unzue insists his team still has hope of staying up . "We have nine games left and we need to win all," he said . "But if we don't then at least we will end up with a good image."

Barcelona have won 10 out of their 12 competitive matches against Celta Vigo in the last 40 years, although the Galicians did beat Barcelona when they were both playing in the Second Division in the early 1970s. Celta Vigo are also the only team to have beaten Barcelona in a competitive match at Camp Nou since 2013 .

Messi is expected to start, while the other changes to the starting lineup should see Gerard Pique replacing Jordi Alba and Munir El Haddadi coming into the side in place of Paco Alcacer. Jordi Alba had been playing well at left-back for Barcelona lately but Unzue says that won't change for this match . "It is not because we are playing against Celta that he has to play there," Unzue said on Thursday."

Barcelona will be looking for their third La Liga win in a row after being held 1-1 at Athletic Bilbao last weekend and will also be hoping to get revenge for its defeat by the Basque side in the Copa del Rey last month. Barcelona are unbeaten in the last 17 games played against Celta Vigo .

Barcelona, who had failed to win any of their first five league matches this season, have now won five on the trot and will be confident of extending that run as they look to regain their dominance at the top of La Liga. "We are at a stage where we can start making some distance between us and our rivals," Unzue said."

Unzue is hoping his side can build on a good performance against Athletic Bilbao in which it had 25 shots but could only score one goal . "At the moment, I feel good because of what we did against Athletic," he said . "The most important thing was that we were competitive and played well. That's the way to get back into La Liga."

Celta Vigo are yet to win a La Liga match this season but they do have a strong record in the competition when playing at home . The Galicians have won 18 of their last 24 games at Balaidos and Unzue said that will not change on Sunday either, despite Barcelona's superior quality . "We know we are up against one of Europe's best teams but if we want to stay in La Liga then we need to beat the best," he added.

Barcelona's 5-0 win over Malaga last Wednesday was their biggest ever victory in a competitive match at Camp Nou, although Celta Vigo did manage a 2-1 triumph when they visited in February 2016."

Unzue said his team must improve defensively but insists that Barcelona's attacking options will make it difficult for his side to defend . "They have the possibility of breaking down any defense," he added, looking ahead to Sunday's match. "It is not going to be easy for us and we are aware that it will be a hard game."

Barcelona are expected to stick with their 4-3-3 system which has served them so well this season, while Celta Vigo are likely to stick with the five at the back formation they used against Athletic Bilbao last weekend . Unzue said he would not be changing his system no matter how much Barcelona attacks down the wings."

Messi's presence will obviously bring a lot of attention to him and it will also draw players to him, meaning that Leo has more space to run into," Unzue explained . "But we know what we have to do against them. If we want to stay in La Liga then we need to beat the best."

Barcelona are also likely to be boosted by their victory over Malaga on Wednesday and they will hope that will give them confidence ahead of Sunday's match . "We are feeling good, both as a team and individually," Unzue said . "I am sure this win (against Malaga) will have given us some confidence and we can take it into the Celta game."

Unzue was asked about Barcelona's impressive record against Celta Vigo but he played down their strength as a team by saying they are not one of La Liga's heavyweights . "It is true that Barcelona have a good record in this fixture," he said ."We know the differences in quality between our teams, which we need to improve if we are to stay in La Liga. But it will be a difficult game."

Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde has been tightlipped about his team selection for Sunday's match but there is no doubt that he will make changes with two of the three matches he is likely to play each week coming up . "We are going to have a lot more games in La Liga, which means we need to rest players," Valverde said at a press conference on Thursday."

"The most important thing for us now is to stay in this competition and the Europa League (against Manchester United) will help us do that . The league is very demanding. We need to win matches, but we also have to take care of our players and give them rest because they have been playing a lot."

Valverde added that the match against Malaga on Wednesday showed how strong his team is when it is focused ."I am not going to change the way I coach," he said . "The important thing for me now is to keep working and resting players. The next two games are very demanding but we need to win both."

Barcelona have been boosted by their Champions League victory over Juventus in midweek, which put them through to the quarter-finals of Europe's premier competition . They will now face Man United in the Europa League and they must win the two games against Celta Vigo and Athletic Bilbao if they are to secure a spot in next season's Champions League."

Celta Vigo will be looking for some points as well but with just nine games left to play this season, they know it is too late to change their position . "We have no more than three or four points to play for and we can still finish in the relegation zone," Unzue said."But if we want to stay in La Liga then we need to beat Barcelona. They are a very good team but so are we, because they only have two games left before the season ends ."

Unzue is also hopeful that his team can end their recent run of poor form against Barcelona by beating them at Balaidos on Sunday . "We know it will not be easy but we need to win this match," he said."The most important thing for us now is that we play with confidence. We have to do what we can and try our best."

Celta Vigo's 2-1 victory over Barcelona in the Copa del Rey last month was a huge boost for Unzue and his side, who are looking to make a late escape from relegation . It also gave them some confidence going into Sunday's match against Barcelona . "That game (against Barcelona) was important," he said."We have been working on improving our performance levels every day. The players need to get back their confidence and show it against Barcelona, who will be very strong as always ."

Unzue added that his team will have a tough match but they must play well in order to stay up . "The most important thing for us now is to win against Barcelona," he said."We need to improve our defensive organization and we need to move the ball quickly . If we can do that then we can compete with Barcelona, who are still a very good team despite not being so dominant as in previous years. We have to play well against them if we want to stay in La Liga.

Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde is also confident of winning this match . "We know they are in the relegation zone but they need points just
