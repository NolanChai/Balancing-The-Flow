Body Of 5-Year-Old Girl Found In Water At Texas Marina   A body believed to be that of five-year-old missing girl Fiona "Kitty" Carroll has been found in water at a Texas marina.   
The body was discovered Tuesday afternoon near Kemah Boardwalk Marina, where she went missing on August 4 while playing with her father and siblings, Galveston County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Allison Harrell said.   The child's death is being treated as an accidental drowning and no foul play is suspected, Harrell said.   
Her family was at the dock to celebrate her father's birthday, she added.   
A boat that had been anchored nearby was used in the search for the girl.

The search for the girl will be scaled down now that she's been found.     Kemah Boardwalk Marina was shut down Tuesday afternoon as officers conducted a "water recovery," according to an announcement on its website.
