port where he was serving his 18-year jail sentence for murder.

Humberside police said they had arrested him on Wednesday evening.

Kerr, 34, of no fixed abode, was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years in prison last year after he strangled Sarah Bettley with his belt and then hid her body under his bed in the flat where they lived together in Leeds.

Sarah's body was found by police on Monday 29 December, almost five months after she went missing. A post-mortem examination showed that she had been strangled to death.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Moynihan, of Humberside Police, said: "We are delighted William Kerr has now been arrested and returned to prison. It was our intention all along to ensure he served his 18 year minimum life sentence for strangling Sarah Bettley and putting her body in a cupboard."

Police praised the efforts of family members who helped them find Kerr after his release from prison, which also sparked nationwide concern.

After arresting him Humberside Police thanked the community for their help. Chief Superintendent Mark Watson said: "We are grateful to the local community in Hull and surrounding areas for all of the information they provided us with."

The force has not yet disclosed where Kerr is being held or what he will be charged with, but added that it would be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service.

The National Probation Service said it had "failed in our duty" to prevent William Kerr from going on the run when he was released from prison last year and apologised to Sarah Bettley's family.

Sarah was 25 years old when she went missing, and her body was found under Kerr's bed at his home in Leeds. It is not yet known how long she had been dead before police were called but it was on Monday morning that officers first arrived to find Sarah. A post-mortem examination showed she had been strangled to death.

Police said Kerr and Sarah were known to have lived together in Leeds prior to her disappearance, which took place in June 2014.

A manhunt was launched by police on Wednesday afternoon, when officers tweeted asking for information about where he had been and urging people not to approach him or get into a vehicle with him. They also released CCTV images of Kerr in the city centre shortly after Sarah's disappearance.

"We would like to ask anyone who has seen William Kerr over recent days, or knows his whereabouts, to contact us on 101 quoting HU137620," a police spokeswoman said at the time.

A spokesperson for Humberside Police added that officers "are treating Sarah's murder as an unlawful killing" and stressed: "We are appealing to anyone with information about how William Kerr came by possession of her body or any information which may assist in identifying the exact circumstances surrounding her death."

Kerr was remanded into custody after being charged with Sarah's murder on 18 November last year. He was also recalled from prison to answer a warrant for failing to comply with an order, and sentenced to two years' jail time at Hull Magistrates' Court in September.

Police said Kerr had been arrested earlier that day by Humberside Police on suspicion of "attempted robbery" and taken into custody while officers made enquiries about him. He was sentenced to two years for breaching a bail condition. The judge also ruled he must serve his 18 year life sentence for Sarah's murder after his release from prison.

Sarah's father, David Bettley, said: "I can't believe it has been five months since I saw her and now the killer is behind bars. There are no words to describe what this means."

An online appeal for information about Kerr was viewed more than a million times and led to police being contacted by people who had seen him in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Manchester over the last five months.

Kerr's solicitor told the Guardian that he had spoken to Kerr while he was on the run and said "he is ashamed of what has happened". The solicitor also expressed concern about his mental health.

Sarah Bettley's brother, Sam, wrote an emotional Facebook post in which he praised officers for their work and added: "I hope this man gets punished to the fullest extent."

It is not yet known if Kerr will be recalled to prison after his arrest or if he will be remanded in custody. The force has also not said whether he was found at an address, apprehended by officers on the street or whether he handed himself into police.

Speaking earlier this week, David Bettley thanked Humberside Police for their support since Sarah's disappearance and arrest of Kerr but warned that "the nightmare has only just begun". He told Sky News: "Sarah would have been 28 on the day she was found. It is unbelievable what this man did to her."

"It will be a long road ahead for myself and my family," he added. "I don't think we will ever get over what has happened."

Sarah Bettley was reported missing on 24 June 2015 and her body was found on Monday morning at Kerr's home in Leeds. The force said the cause of death had not yet been determined but that there were "no suspicious circumstances".

David Bettley said: "I can't believe it has been five months since I saw her, she is only 28 and this man has taken my little girl from us."

"The man who did this to her needs to be punished for what he has done," he added. "If I had have seen him in the street I would have punched his lights out."

Speaking about Kerr's arrest, David Bettley said: "It is a huge relief that this man will never be able to hurt anyone ever again."

Sarah worked as an apprentice mechanic and was known to friends for her bubbly personality. She had previously been in a relationship with Kerr's brother, Gary Bettley, but the pair split up earlier that year. David said Sarah was due to visit him on 24 June when she went missing, and that he never received any contact from her since then.

He told Sky News: "I am just numb really, I haven't come to terms with it yet. It will be a long road ahead for myself and my family but we are getting there."

The National Probation Service has apologised to Sarah Bettley's family for its failure in monitoring Kerr after his release from prison.

In a statement, the organisation said: "We accept that in this case, we failed in our duty by not keeping sufficient control over William Kerr and ensuring he was complying with his licence conditions."

A spokesman added: "Our thoughts remain with Sarah Bettley's family. We are committed to learning from what happened so it can never happen again."

An inquest into the cause of death is expected to be opened and adjourned next week. The date has not yet been confirmed by Hull Coroner's Court but a spokesman said: "There will be an inquest - we are just waiting for dates from the coroner."

A spokesperson for Humberside Police said they were unable to comment on whether Kerr would be held at Hull Prison, where Sarah Bettley had been reported missing.<s>
