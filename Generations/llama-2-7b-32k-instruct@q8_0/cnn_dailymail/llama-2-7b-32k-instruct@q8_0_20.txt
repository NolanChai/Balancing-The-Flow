A convicted murderer who strangled a woman and put her body in a cupboard has been rearrested after three weeks on the run, police have said. William Kerr absconded from a bail hostel in Hull after he was released from HMP Stocken on 12 July.

The 48-year-old, who is originally from Scotland but has links to the north of England and Wales, was being held at a police station in Glasgow, where he will be returned for breaching his licence conditions. Kerr had previously been detained by officers in his home city before he fled prison, according to local media.

South Yorkshire Police said: ‘The force is seeking to return William Kerr back to South Yorkshire to answer for a number of offences and on Tuesday he was re-arrested at a police station in Glasgow where he will be returned for breaching licence conditions.’

Kerr, who has convictions dating back to the 1980s, murdered his girlfriend Linda Walker in Sheffield in May 2007. He was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 35 years for strangling her at her home on Carver Street, Darnall.

After he was released from prison, Kerr fled the UK and was arrested in Spain before being deported back to Britain by Spanish police. After his trial, Kerr said: ‘She would have me down on my knees for no reason. If I refused, she’d just go off on one. She even put my dog outside when we had a row.’

He added that he wanted to get away from Sheffield and move back to the area in which he grew up. ‘She was always getting at me because she knew how much I loved her,' Kerr told his trial, before saying: ‘I would have got out of there anyway…I’ve moved on with my life.’

Kerr said he went to stay with his son in Wales but that they had a row and Walker had gone into their kitchen. He added: 'I knew she was going to hit me because her face looked like it did.'

After murdering Linda, Kerr fled to Spain where he worked on a farm until officers tracked him down and arrested him in 2015. After being remanded in custody, he appeared at Sheffield Crown Court via videolink where he was sentenced for life by Judge Jonathan Rose.

He said: ‘You took away the love of my life. You took away a young lady who had done nothing to harm anyone and yet you strangled her to death in your kitchen.’ Judge Rose added that Kerr had been responsible for ‘one of the most shocking crimes imaginable’ and there was no indication he would not kill again, even when he said: ‘I wouldn’t hurt a fly’.

Det Supt Mark Ridley, from South Yorkshire Police’s serious crime unit, added at Kerr's trial: 'He is a dangerous man who has already served time for strangling another woman to death and that was the catalyst for Linda Walker's murder.'

After his release on licence in July, police said they were still trying to establish why Kerr absconded. A spokesman for Hull Prison, which oversees bail hostels across the UK, told the BBC: 'Kerr was placed at a bail address after being released from prison, and that's when he failed to return.'

Police said Kerr had been living in Hull but had been known to frequent Sheffield. They appealed to anyone with information about his whereabouts to come forward. Det Supt Mark Ridley added: 'We would like him to hand himself over to police as soon as possible because he has a number of outstanding warrants for breaching licence conditions.'

Kerr's victim, Linda Walker was 42 and worked at the Department for Work and Pensions when she died. Her family paid tribute to her in court where they said: ‘She is now reunited with our brother who passed away last year but we are left here without a mum.’

Their sister Susan said Kerr had 'completely changed' after he began dating Linda, adding that she was worried about his behaviour and the way he would treat her. She added: ‘She wouldn’t say anything to me because she knew it would set him off…I tried not to speak of my sister too much when we were together because he used to get upset over things.'

South Yorkshire Police have launched an internal investigation into the incident in order to assess why Kerr was allowed out on licence, while his family have issued a plea for him to surrender himself to authorities.

Detective Inspector Mark Ridley of South Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Team said: 'We are investigating how he came to be released on bail and we will be working closely with the Probation Service and Hull Prison to understand the circumstances.'

A spokeswoman for the Probation Service said they would not comment on individual cases. A spokesperson for HMP Stocken added: 'We are aware of the media coverage in relation to William Kerr who was released from prison on licence and have been assisting police with their investigation into his disappearance.'

Kerr, who has a string of previous convictions dating back to 1983 including an assault on a woman while armed with a knife, said in court that he had previously tried to kill himself by stabbing himself but that the wound was not serious and did not prevent him from leaving the UK.
