a hole in her heart when she was just a few days old but this was not picked up by doctors until Natasha was 20 months old and the hole was found to have been there since birth .

Dr Eileen Murphy, who treated Paula at the University Hospital Limerick, told the High Court on Thursday that she did not recognise signs of heart disease in her first baby . She said she also failed to diagnose the problem with Natasha.

Paula was told last year that neither mistake by Dr Murphy caused any harm to her children and that the hospital has apologised for both errors.

Her solicitor, Conor Dignam, said she is not satisfied with the response from the HSE, as it did not offer an apology until a court case was brought against them .

Paula McKay told how Dr Murphy delivered her daughter Natasha in 1990 and she was discharged three days later. She returned to hospital after two weeks when she began feeling unwell but was again sent home . It was only during a pregnancy scan that it was found she had been admitted with the wrong baby, who turned out to be her son Cian.

She said her daughter Natasha suffered severe brain damage and has cerebral palsy, is profoundly deaf and needs assistance in breathing . She also suffers from scoliosis . Dr Murphy was asked by Mr Dignam why she had not checked Paula's heart after the mix-up or if she had known about Natasha's condition. He said: "It seems to me that it would be a reasonable conclusion to draw that this could have been detected at the time of delivery .

"Your failure to investigate further in light of this unexplained phenomenon is something that you should have done," he added, as Dr Murphy remained silent during his cross-examination. The doctor said she did not know why she did not check Paula's heart after the mix-up but added that "it was a long time ago". She also told how Natasha would have died if she had been born with her own heart condition and this is what initially made her aware of the mistake .

Mr Dignam asked about another patient in Dr Murphy's care, a man who later sued over claims that he was born with a hole in his heart . He asked why Dr Murphy did not investigate further when she delivered Paula's son. The doctor said: "I think it would be a reasonable conclusion to draw from what happened to me and the fact that I had two children, both of whom were sick ." She added that her failure to detect Natasha's heart condition was partly due to herself being new on the job at that stage and not having enough experience .

Dr Murphy said she did not make any written notes about Paula's case but there was a file of papers available in the hospital for all consultants treating Mrs McKay . She also failed to alert a specialist doctor who would have been dealing with Natasha if her condition had been picked up earlier. Dr Murphy apologised for both mistakes and said she was sorry about how Paula's life has turned out but that there were no lasting effects on the children.

Mr Dignam told the court he did not believe his client would have suffered such severe complications if her heart had been diagnosed in time . He also asked how Dr Murphy could claim she was new to deliveries when she was a consultant from 1983 to 2002 . The doctor said: "I apologise and I'm sorry, but it seems that the HSE has taken the view that there is no risk associated with these two events."

He asked about what happened to Dr Murphy after the incident and she said she was not offered any training or counselling for either mistake . She also said she was not informed at all when Natasha's heart condition was discovered, even though her name appears on a letter sent from the hospital to Paula McKay.

Dr Murphy said there were other doctors in the maternity ward at the time who should have been asked about the mix-up but that they did not come forward . She also said she had "no doubt" that Natasha suffered brain damage as a result of the heart condition, saying: "She's severely disabled, it's obvious to me".

The doctor was criticised by Mr Dignam for failing to follow up on Natasha and added that he did not think this was something that could happen in other hospitals . He said Dr Murphy should have been held accountable for her mistakes at the time but she was merely transferred elsewhere in the hospital .

Mr Justice Kevin Cross asked if Dr Murphy had ever offered an apology to Paula McKay before and he told the court she had not. Mr Dignam also asked about why it took so long for Natasha's heart condition to be picked up but Dr Murphy said she had seen signs of the problem as far back as 1988 but that she did not have a "good enough view" at the time .

Dr Murphy told how she was taken out of her job after the mix-up and had to retire in 2003 due to ill health . She added that it has been suggested by another doctor that she did not want Natasha to be born with a hole in her heart because this could have meant an abortion.

The court heard Dr Murphy is now working as a private doctor in Limerick and is also involved in training doctors at the university hospital . Mr Justice Cross said he will give his final judgment on February 17th next year .

Paula McKay, who was present in court for the hearing, told RTÃ‰ News afterward: "I'm happy I have got my day in court. I think they are just trying to protect their own backsides".

"The hospital has said that it wasn't their fault . They have not been apologetic." She added that her children did not suffer any lasting effects because of the mistakes but she had spent years worrying about what could happen in the future .
