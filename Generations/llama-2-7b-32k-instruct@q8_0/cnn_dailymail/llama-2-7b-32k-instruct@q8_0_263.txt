Brother and Sister Left Severe Disability After Mistakes in Hospital Delivery (News Article)  
A brother and sister were left severely disabled after maternity staff at the hospital where they were both born, two years apart, made the same mistakes. Paula McKay was told her daughter Natasha had suffered severe brain damage during delivery and was given a 30 percent chance of survival but she said doctors were too focused on saving their son Nathan to check whether he also needed medical attention. The pair were born at Colchester Hospital, in Essex, and have cerebral palsy as well as epilepsy. They now need around-the-clock care and are unable to speak but Paula believes staff made the same mistakes twice when they delivered her son in 1992. The hospital admitted two years ago it failed to follow guidelines after it emerged an infant had been left with brain damage during labor in October 2013, which was not reported until January last year.


A brother and sister have been left severely disabled because maternity staff at the hospital where they were born made the same mistakes two years apart, an inquest heard.  
Paula McKay was told her daughter Natasha had suffered severe brain damage during delivery and was given a 30 percent chance of survival but she said doctors were too focused on saving their son Nathan to check whether he also needed medical attention . The pair were born at Colchester Hospital, in Essex, and have cerebral palsy as well as epilepsy.  
They now need around - the-clock care and are unable to speak but Paula believes staff made the same mistakes twice when they delivered her son in 1992 . The hospital admitted two years ago it failed to follow guidelines after it emerged an infant had been left with brain damage during labor in October 2013, which was not reported until January last year.  
The siblings' father Brian McKay said he was furious his children were being put through the same agony twice. He added: "They could have saved Natasha if they'd had more care."  
The inquest heard both babies suffered similar injuries to the brain during labor but their mothers did not receive any midwifery support at delivery . Both also received delayed intervention and neither was resuscitated after birth, despite suffering severe hypoxia, an oxygen deficiency.  
A post-mortem examination revealed Natasha died of a lack of oxygen to the brain . A pathologist said her death could have been prevented with adequate maternity care and that she would likely still be alive if staff had acted quickly enough once her condition was realized. The inquest heard Mrs McKay did not receive any support from a midwife at either delivery, unlike other mothers giving birth to children at the hospital on the same day .  
Mrs McKay said: "I can't believe it has happened twice. I never thought about the possibility of it happening again but if you had asked me in 1992 when Nathan was born I would have said there is no way I would let this happen." She added she did not think staff realized that her son needed help at birth because he was a boy .  
Dr Shona Dixson, clinical director for midwifery and women's health at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, apologized to the family and said: "We failed them both and we are sorry." She added staff had not reviewed the cases thoroughly enough after the October 2013 incident.  
Coroner Elizabeth Head ruled there was a catalogue of failures before and after delivery which caused Natasha's death . She criticized senior staff for failing to spot how many times mistakes were happening. Dr Dixson said: "We have made sure we have done our learning from that. We want to learn from this."  
Mrs McKay welcomed the apology but added: "We are left with a lifetime of pain and suffering caused by these failings ." She said her daughter had not been able to do anything without help for as long as she can remember, adding: "She's lost out on so much."
