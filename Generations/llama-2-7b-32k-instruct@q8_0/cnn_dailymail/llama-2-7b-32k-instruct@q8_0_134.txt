A total eclipse of the moon lasted less than 5 minutes on Saturday night, but people were able to see at least a partial version if they were in an area that had clear skies. (08-21)

I'm going to take you through what happened during this phenomenon and why it was only a short one . The total lunar eclipse of the moon on Saturday night was not particularly exciting, but still worth watching if you had the chance. (08-22)

The reason for its brevity is that Earth's shadow only touched the upper right portion of the moon, which means the rest of it remained bathed in sunlight . The lunar event began around 10:30 PM EST on Saturday night and lasted until about 11:00 PM. (08-24)

This short duration is not a one - off occurrence but happens quite frequently, every six months or so. Although it's rare for the Earth's shadow to touch only a portion of the moon, it's not that uncommon for there to be a partial lunar eclipse, which lasts longer than five minutes . (08-25)

In fact, two weeks before the total eclipse, on August 18th, another type of eclipse occurred - a penumbral lunar eclipse . During this type of lunar event, Earth's outer shadow touches part of the moon and can result in a reddish tint on its surface. (08-26)

If you missed Saturday night's total eclipse of the moon, don't worry - there will be another one in February 2023! The next total lunar eclipse will take place on January 12th and last for around 90 minutes, so we can expect a much longer experience. (08-27)

In conclusion, while this total lunar eclipse was short, it was still worth watching if you had the chance. You can catch up with what happened by reading through my article or by looking at some pictures online. The next one in February will be much longer, so make sure to save that date on your calendar!
