Did you blink? There was a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday - but it was an unusually short one. The lunar event - where Earth's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes, making it the shortest total lunar eclipse in 580 years . It also happens to be the last time Earth will block out the full moon until 23 January 2018.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun's light strikes the Earth's shadow and the Moon is caught inside it, but the next one won't happen until the 3rd of August .

This shortest total lunar eclipse in history was also visible from Europe on Saturday evening. But not all parts of Europe got to see the Moon totally disappear behind our planet, as some countries only got to see a partial eclipse .

In London, where I am now, we didn't even get to see Earth cast its shadow over the Moon - because it was too cloudy. The weather in the UK and Ireland on Saturday night was really wet and windy, so I was pleased I remembered my rain coat when I stepped outside for a while during the evening .

Astronomers say that this total lunar eclipse was an "eclipse of the heart", as the Moon's appearance changed completely and suddenly. And even though we only got to see part of it in the UK, at least we got to witness its beginning: the Moon just starting to disappear behind Earth on Saturday evening.

What did you think of this total lunar eclipse? Did you get a good look at it or were clouds getting in your way? What's the last full moon you saw? Let me know! And I'll have a new video up for you next week - about the Moon and all its phases. Bye now, take care and speak to you soon!
