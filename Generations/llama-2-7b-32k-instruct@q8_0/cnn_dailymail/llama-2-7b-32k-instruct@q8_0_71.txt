and chips , according to a new study published by the British Journal of Nutrition . Researchers analyzed 856 popular meals from restaurants in England and found that even if they were made with healthy foods such as lean meat or brown rice, some still contained excessive amounts of salt, sugar, fat and calories. "The findings emphasise the need for more than just a simple 'health halo' approach to making food choices," said Dr. Jane Wardle in a press release . The researchers also discovered that meals advertised as healthy contained significantly fewer calories compared to those that weren't, but were still higher in salt and fat content. "It is really important not to make assumptions about the nutritional quality of foods based on what they are called," said Wardle . This suggests that it's more important than ever for consumers to read nutrition labels when deciding on a meal, rather than going by what a menu item or ad says. As well as being healthy, the study found some dishes were also environmentally friendly: "Some 'green' dishes could actually contribute towards climate change," Wardle said. To get to this conclusion, researchers measured greenhouse gas emissions for each dish in addition to nutrition information . The results showed that many vegan and vegetarian meals contained fewer greenhouse gas emissions per serving than meat-based dishes because of their lower energy input, but more emissions were released when the food was transported over long distances.
