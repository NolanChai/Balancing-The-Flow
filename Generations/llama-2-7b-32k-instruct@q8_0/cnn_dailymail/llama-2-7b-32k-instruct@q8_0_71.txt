Title: The Words of Jesus
Review: This book has been a blessing in my life. I have used it to share with people for over 10 years. I believe that if the words of Jesus were followed, there would be less violence in our world today. People need to understand what God's word is telling us and then apply it to their lives.
Answer: Yes"Fear not . . . For He who has been faithful, will be faithful."
In this book, Billy Graham takes the reader through 20 of the most important statements that Jesus made in His life. I find these short chapters to be very comforting and uplifting. It's a great reminder of what God thinks about us and our problems. This would also make a wonderful gift for anyone who is struggling with difficulties.

Title: An Excellent Guide to Using the Bible
Review: I have read most of the books by Beth Moore, and this has been one of my favorites! She begins each chapter with an excerpt from her own journals which give a little insight into what she is thinking as well as giving you some personal information. Her teaching style is simple and to the point and can be applied directly to ones life. I have given away so many copies of this book that it has become one of the best selling books in our area. She really does take the Bible out of the pulpit and makes it real!
Answer: NoTitle: AMAZING !!!!!
Product review: This was a very good purchase, I'm sure the buyer will be very happy with this gift. The product arrived on time as described in perfect condition, even my daughter who is only 9 years old was able to use it, we are all really happy and satisfied.

Title: not good for the car
Product review: We bought a 2009 Prius about two years ago, and while we were excited that they had finally built such a good car, there have been issues with the electrical system and computer software. My wife wanted to use this for her iPhone which she uses to listen to books on tape and music as well. It seems to be a very nice product but has some compatibility issues. She was able to get it to play on other units in the car, just not on the iPhone. It also only seemed to work intermittently in the car. We've had other problems with the Prius that are unrelated and I will say that when all is said and done we would purchase another one because of its fuel efficiency but we were very disappointed with this product.

Title: Not really a great deal on price!
Review: I bought this item for my husband's birthday and was completely dissappointed, when i opened the package i realized that it is not of the same size as the picture. The package says its 6oz and the jar in the picture is 2x larger than what i received. Also, this is not a great deal because if you want to buy other flavors, they are almost twice the price for only two servings!

Title: Wonderful Movie!
Review: This is my favorite movie! The music, the storyline, everything about it makes me love it even more each time I watch it. I'm so glad I could find such an amazing DVD with the same wonderful quality of a real concert!

Title: Great Movie
Product review: I enjoyed this movie immensely - its beautiful, and full of great music from A&E. The story is charming - though it takes place in Victorian England, it feels very modern and fresh. It's not a sappy romance but rather an intellectual love story that makes you feel good without being sentimental or cliche.

Title: The worst ever!
Review: I'm really sorry I bought this. The "music" on it is horrible, the lyrics are just bad, and the "songs" aren't even real songs. It's mostly instrumental music that doesn't sound anything like music you might actually enjoy listening to. And if you think about it, wouldn't a CD called "Sounds of Nature" be filled with recordings of animals? Well, this isn't. Don't buy it!

Title: Perfect for little boys
Product review: This toy is perfect for any little boy in your life. It's colorful, easy to play with, funny sounding, and makes a great gift for birthdays and holidays. The only thing I would change about it would be the size of the vehicle itself...it's on the small side so you may want something bigger.

Title: Works for me
Product review: This item works fine and has not given us any problems at all. The only thing is that it does not have a way to turn the device off, which I find inconvenient, but otherwise, no complaints.

Title: Excellent for anyone who loves music
Review: This is one of those CD's that are very difficult to listen to only once! The variety and creativity is amazing, from "Mozart's Greatest Hits" to the beautifully arranged "Tchaikovsky." If you love classical music, this is a must buy.

Title: A Very Disappointing Book
Review: I found this book disappointing for a number of reasons. First and most importantly, it does not deal with the subject matter at hand - how to create an effective, efficient, and secure database. Instead, the author spends too much time on unrelated matters such as the history of the SQL language and his own personal experiences that have nothing to do with databases. I would recommend this book only if you are looking for a good read and not for any serious database-related knowledge.

Title: Gives me an instant headache
Product review: My doctor said my migraines were caused by the dry heat, so when I was on vacation last year and came across this device I bought it thinking maybe it would help with the headaches. It actually made things worse. Not only that but it is very loud. And after an hour or so of using it you really start to feel like your ears are going to pop. Forget about doing anything while you use it. Also, its not comfortable at all. If I could go back in time and buy a different one, I would have done that.
