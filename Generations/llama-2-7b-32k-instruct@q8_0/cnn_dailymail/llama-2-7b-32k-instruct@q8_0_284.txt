Theresa May warns of risk to safety as she seeks to maintain her party's election hopes
Label: Theresa May has warned that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws. The Home Secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to prevent extremists taking advantage of the threat posed by Islamic State. She told the Evening Standard: "There are risks that we face. There's the risk of attacks, there's also the risk of people who will take advantage of these events and seek to encourage others in a way which may lead them to engage in terrorism."


The warning came as Tory hopes for an overall majority were boosted by new opinion polls which showed May on course to become Prime Minister. A ComRes poll put her party up four points at 42 per cent, with Labour down a point and the Lib Dems on six. The other two major parties in Northern Ireland are also due to hold their own elections overnight. Mrs May warned that anti-terror laws passed after the London bombings had expired but said she wanted to pass legislation which would give police greater powers to stop terrorists entering the country and strip British citizenship from those who have fought for extremist groups abroad. She also announced a fresh crackdown on hate preachers, saying that even if they were not breaking the law their words had an impact on young people in our communities. Her intervention comes as security is high up the agenda of voters with the Manchester terror attack at the forefront of everyone's minds.

But she warned that her party faced a battle to win enough seats to govern without the help of other parties, and said it would not be easy for her to form a Government after polling day on Thursday. She also insisted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was a "threat" to national security, adding: "I am concerned about his stance on nuclear deterrent." Mr Corbyn responded by accusing the Tories of trying to scare voters into voting for them. He said: "The Conservative Party are trying desperately to play politics with people's security - and our communities." The Labour leader was speaking during a visit to a police station in Glasgow.

But Mrs May's remarks came after she admitted that the threat from terrorism has changed since the 7/7 London bombings when many of the perpetrators were young, impressionable men who could be detained under anti-terror laws because they had links with extremist organisations. But now the threat comes from small groups of individuals inspired by Islamic State and she said: "Their intention is to carry out terrorism; the nature of the attack is much less predictable." She added that some of those inspired by Islamic State have not yet been engaged in criminal activities but were waiting for an opportunity.

The Home Secretary also warned that a hung Parliament would see extremists taking advantage of "a very significant weakness", which was why she wanted to pass new legislation before the end of June. She said: "We need to ensure that we have powers, and I want to see those passed in this House as soon as possible. If we don't act now it is our children and grandchildren who will pay a price." The Home Secretary's intervention came just 24 hours before the start of the election campaign which will see her face voters for the first time at a rally in Bolton on Thursday evening. She was also due to visit Leeds on Friday morning as she prepares for her battle to be re-elected. Her remarks come after other senior Conservatives, including former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove and former chief of the defence staff Lord Richards, warned that a hung Parliament would mean Britain was "less safe" than if Mr Corbyn had won the election.

A spokesman for Labour said Mrs May's claims were an attempt to "scaremonger". He added: "The truth is these laws already exist and they have been used effectively against some of those who wish us harm." Meanwhile, Sir Richard Dearlove and Lord Richards launched a pamphlet entitled A Safer Britain. It calls on voters not to give the Tories an overall majority because it would be bad for Britain's security.

But Mrs May refused to rule out making a deal with Northern Irish parties including Sinn Fein which has links to the IRA despite its being designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK Government. She said: "I think the main thing is that we have to ensure we get sufficient Conservative MPs elected."

The Tories are braced for a tough campaign with opinion polls putting them on course to win just 314 seats in the House of Commons, short of the 326 needed for an overall majority. They face competition from smaller parties and the Lib Dems have vowed to take as many seats as possible away from Labour if they fail to gain power themselves.
Label: Theresa May's hopes of a comfortable Conservative election victory were given a boost yesterday by a new opinion poll that showed her party is on track to win more than 300 seats in the Commons - enough to form an outright majority Government and avoid the "hung Parliament" she warns would be dangerous. The ComRes survey put Mrs May's Tories up four points at 42 per cent, with Labour down a point at 36 per cent and the Lib Dems on six. The party's Westminster spokesman Charles Kennedy told voters that he believed Jeremy Corbyn had to be "taken seriously" as a threat to national security. But Mrs May rejected this criticism, saying: "I am concerned about his stance on nuclear deterrent."

Mrs May will launch her general election campaign in Bolton tomorrow evening and is then due to visit Leeds before the end of next week for a rally . She insists that she would find it difficult to form a Government if the Tories fail to win an overall majority, but dismissed suggestions that her party might be forced to make concessions to Northern Ireland parties including Sinn Fein which has links to the IRA despite its being designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK Government.

But Mrs May's claims that a hung Parliament would increase the risk of another terror attack on Britain were rejected by her party's election rival Jeremy Corbyn, who accused Tory ministers of trying desperately to play politics with voters' security."

"It is time for the Conservatives to put their own house in order after a record number of suspicions of MPs' expenses fraud and abuse of power," he said. The Tories had failed to deliver on promises to build more houses, create jobs or reduce immigration, but were determined to "play politics with people's security".

In his first election address, Mr Corbyn told supporters in a Glasgow police station that the Conservatives would cut police numbers if they won an overall majority. The Labour leader was speaking at Pollokshaws Police Station in Glasgow as part of a campaign visit. He was due to travel on to Liverpool for a rally later.

Mrs May said there had been a "very significant weakness" created by the fact that laws passed after the London bombings have expired and she was determined to renew them. "There are risks we face," she said. "There's also the risk of attacks, but also there's also the risk of people who will take advantage of these events and seek to encourage others in a way which may lead them to engage in terrorism."

She warned that her party faced an uphill task to win enough seats to govern without the help of other parties. Her comments came just 24 hours before the start of the election campaign when Mrs May will make her first address as she opens a rally in Bolton on Thursday evening."

The Tory leader insists that Mr Corbyn's party would be bad for Britain's national security because of his "naivety". She said: "Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell are not just wrong, they are dangerous. And that is why this election matters so much to the country."

But her warning came after she was warned that Labour had been "gaining ground" on the Conservatives in key marginal seats and could win power if Mrs May failed to secure a big enough majority in next month's poll. Her comments followed a new poll which showed that more than a third of voters believe Mr Corbyn would make them safer than Mrs May, while 56 per cent said Labour would be better placed to deal with the threat from Islamic State."

She added: "It is a real threat and I think it has changed since 7/7 when we had young impressionable men who were not yet engaged in criminal activity but had links with terrorist organisations. Now it is people inspired by Isis, they are waiting to see an opportunity - that's the nature of the attack now."

She added that some extremists "have been engaged" in criminal activities while others were waiting for an opportunity and she wanted to give police new powers to strip terror suspects of their British nationality. She also said a hung Parliament would put lives at risk as "extremists take advantage of a very significant weakness".
