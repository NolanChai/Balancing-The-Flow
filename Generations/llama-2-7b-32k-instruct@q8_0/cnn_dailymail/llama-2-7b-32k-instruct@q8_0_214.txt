35-year old man from South Africa who has been doing this kind of stunt for 20 years.

Al was able to perform his stunts by leaping and bouncing off huge inflatable balls that he carried around in front of him. He told Daily Mail Online: "I used to do tricks with cars before I could jump over them, so this is nothing new for me."

He said the sport has become increasingly popular all across Europe and America. The 35-year old explained that the daredevil sport has taken a leap of faith because of the fast car and a bouncy ball to prevent injury. He added: "It's an adrenaline rush for me, you can't beat it."

Al used to be a street performer who used his stunt skills to earn a living but when he saw a video online of someone jumping over a moving car with no protection, he decided to take the dare. He told Daily Mail Online: "I got hooked on that and now I'm always looking for new ways to make my act more exciting."

He used his savings to buy a bouncy ball and used it as an alternative to protect himself from injury while performing stunts like these.

"I was watching some videos of people jumping over cars when they were younger and I wanted to be able to do the same thing," Al said in his interview with Daily Mail Online. "So that's what I've been doing for the last 20 years."

Al is a father of two children and he wants them to follow their dreams just like he did. He told Daily Mail Online: "I want my kids to be able to do whatever they want to in life, as long as it makes them happy. That's what I did and now I have a great job."

His children are also helping him out with his act by keeping score while he is performing. They were surprised at their fatherâ€™s talent when they saw him on the video online. Al said: "They were amazed, but it wasn't until they actually watched me that they really understood what I did."

The stuntman added that he plans to continue doing this kind of performance as long as his health holds out. He explained: "I want to keep jumping over cars and trying new things for a while longer yet, but if it gets to the point where I'm not having fun anymore, then I'll stop."

The stuntman is also planning to take part in some local shows in South Africa where he will be performing his act. He told Daily Mail Online: "I have a few shows coming up that I want to do in South Africa, so I can show my friends and family what I do for a living."

"If I keep doing this well enough then maybe I'll get an agent who can help me find some work overseas," he said.

His goal is to have more sponsors come on board with him. He wants to have sponsorships from car companies, insurance companies and even energy drinks so that he can do more of these stunts and also make a living out of it. Al added: "I'm always looking for new sponsors, it would be great if they could help me do even more with this."

In his interview, the jumper said he had to overcome some challenges when he was younger but now that he has become famous, he is enjoying himself. He said: "There's definitely been a few challenges along the way, but I think it's all about being persistent and not giving up."

Al used to be a street performer who did tricks on a skateboard and had a small following. It wasn't until he started jumping over cars that people became interested in what he could do. "I was doing some shows locally here in South Africa, but I decided that I wanted to take it global," he said.

Al told Daily Mail Online: "It really took off after that, I started getting more followers and people started noticing me online." The stuntman is also planning to do more of his tricks with a skateboard in the future. He added: "I'm always looking for new ways to push my boundaries."

The stuntman was given some tips by fellow daredevils who have performed similar dares and has now become famous because of it. Al said: "There are people out there that do this kind of stuff, but I think it took me a while to get the recognition that I deserved."

He used social media platforms such as Instagram to share his videos with the world and gained popularity. His goal was to make his act more exciting and he did so by adding new elements like inflatable balls, fireworks, and even a live band accompanying him on stage while he is performing. He said: "I think it's really important to always be looking for ways to push the boundaries of what I do."

His act has attracted many sponsors including Red Bull who gave him cash to film some videos. The stuntman was able to use that money to get himself a nice camera and now he is using it to record more stunts on his YouTube channel. He added: "I'm hoping to be able to do even more in the future with this."

Al hopes his act will inspire others to follow their dreams no matter how crazy they may seem. He said: "If you really want something bad enough then just go out and get it, don't let anyone stop you." Al told Daily Mail Online: "I think it's important that people see what I do as a form of entertainment rather than some sort of stunt gone wrong."

He also wants to inspire his children to follow their dreams. He said: "It was a very simple idea, but if you really work hard at something and put all your effort into it, then anything is possible."

The father of two hopes to bring awareness to the South African township where he grew up in and has become famous for his stunts. He said: "I want people to see that it's not just a township that no one cares about, there are actually some very talented people who have come out of this community."

The daredevil hopes to inspire others with his stunt and make them want to try it for themselves. He told Daily Mail Online: "I think if more people knew what I did they would probably give it a go."

Al the Jumper has become famous thanks to his YouTube videos that have gone viral, making him an instant celebrity in South Africa. His fans love his act and can't get enough of him. Al said: "It really is a dream come true, I never expected anything like this."

Al the Jumper hopes his act will inspire others to follow their dreams and make a living doing what they love, just like he did. He said: "It's all about pushing the boundaries and trying something new that no one has ever tried before."

Al said: "I think it's really important that people see what I do as a form of entertainment rather than some sort of stunt gone wrong."

He hopes his fame will help him bring more attention to South Africa, not just for tourists but also for potential sponsors who might be interested in working with him. Al said: "I would love it if there was something that could benefit the people of my township as a result of me doing this."

Al's biggest challenge is overcoming the fear of what others may think about him performing such stunts. He said: "It can be scary, but you just have to overcome it and do it anyway." Al told Daily Mail Online: "It's all about putting yourself out there and taking a risk."
