and Kim marry before he died . And the family's heartbreaking wish came true last Wednesday when they arranged for a priest to marry them on their son's hospital bed. The youngster, who was diagnosed with medulloblastoma two years ago, had previously asked his mother if she would ever love someone else after he died . Crai said: "We had been talking about marriage and he brought the subject up himself, which made it easier to broach with Kim." He added: "Corey wants them to be happy. We all do - we just wish that he was here to enjoy it too. I asked him if he would like us to get married and his response was 'I don't care dad'. He didn't want to stand in our way, so the decision was made." Corey, 13, is currently in the final stages of terminal brain tumour cancer and has been told that he probably only has a few weeks left to live. His parents said they have always kept up his spirits as best they could by taking him on holidays and treatments. Kim said: "Corey has always known how much we love him, so this was our way of giving him what he wanted in the time that we had left." The family have set up a fundraising page to help Corey's mother pay for his medical treatment in the final days of her son's life. Crai said: "We are very appreciative and touched by everybody who has supported us, especially Corey. He is truly an inspiration to everyone."


Kim added: "He really wanted this wedding to happen and it was wonderful to see his wish come true. He loves both of them so much and we all love him so much too."
