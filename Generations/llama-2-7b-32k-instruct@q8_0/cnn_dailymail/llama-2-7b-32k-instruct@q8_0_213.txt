The former NFL tight end had been denied a change of plea hearing but on Wednesday was given a chance to reconsider his decision and now faces 30 years to life without parole for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player.

Hernandez was initially charged with first-degree murder before being indicted in August on two counts of second-degree murder by a grand jury.

In court today, Judge Susan Garsh confirmed that Hernandez had been given the new number and said: "We are here because he changed his plea."

The 25-year-old also admitted to being in possession of a firearm without an FID card - but this charge was dropped when the judge announced his verdict.

Hernandez's lawyers did not attend court, although the defense team and the prosecutors sat together at one table inside the packed courtroom. His mother Terri Hernandez was in attendance as was Lloyd's family - including his uncle who was seen crying in court during proceedings.

Asked to stand, he replied 'I do'. The judge then asked him if he understood what was going on and if he knew that by pleading guilty to second-degree murder he could get up to life without parole. Hernandez said yes and Garsh confirmed it would be 30 years in prison for the first count of killing Lloyd, and 20 to life for the second, with both sentences to run consecutive to each other and the two counts running concurrently.

Hernandez's mother sat stony faced as she left court, and was followed by Terri and Odin's uncle who did not say a word outside of the courthouse after his nephew admitted to taking his life in such a violent way.

The former New England Patriots player was initially accused of shooting Lloyd three times - once in the chest and twice more to the back as he sat in a car at his house in Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 June this year.

However, authorities later found that he had been shot six times with bullets fired from a .45 caliber Glock pistol which had been found buried in his mother's yard - and he was subsequently charged with an additional two counts of second-degree murder.

The Patriots released him on 6 July, after he was initially arrested at the team's training camp, where the player was seen being led away handcuffed before sitting sobbing in a police car.

Hernandez, who signed a five-year contract worth $40 million when he joined the Patriots in 2013, is currently waiting to be transported to Souza - Baranowski Correctional Center where he will serve his life sentence behind bars.

Following the hearing Lloyd's father said: "I don't believe you'll ever hear from me again until I see him in hell."

In court on Wednesday, Hernandez was also required to answer whether he had been treated differently due to his status as an NFL player. He said no and the judge replied: 'Then you shouldn't have.'

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in a civil lawsuit brought against him over Lloyd's death, and his attorneys argue that he was too young to be held criminally responsible for killing Lloyd. The family say they will now look forward to the start of a murder trial which is due to begin 23 February next year.

Lloyd's mother has since sued the NFL over Hernandez's involvement in her son's death and filed legal papers asserting that the league had long known about his violent behavior but failed to take any action.

Hernandez was arrested for beating a man with a gun just days after being drafted by the Patriots - and was later accused of shooting a friend, Alexander Bradley in the face at a nightclub in Florida in February 2013. In March this year he was charged over the deaths of two men who were shot in Boston following an altercation at a nightclub in April 2013.

Hernandez's attorney, James Patterson had previously said: "We will explore every legal option available to us in this case." The former NFL star has pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if the state decides to seek it.

Earlier today Lloyd's uncle gave his own victim statement outside the courtroom, saying that he did not know about Hernandez's past when he hired him but was certain after being charged for the killing that Hernandez had been 'in this life long enough to be able to make good choices'.

Lloyd's mother also spoke to reporters outside of court where she said: "I don't believe you'll ever hear from me again until I see him in hell."

Asked if she believed her son was murdered because he knew too much, Lloyd's uncle answered with an emphatic no - adding that his nephew had nothing to do with drug dealing or the underworld. He said: "Odin wasn't afraid of anything. He didn't have a fear in him."

The man who hired Lloyd at the warehouse he worked at when he was not playing football told reporters that his nephew was 'a good kid' but added: "I don't know if there was something personal or not".

He said: "All I can tell you is my uncle, and cousin are close to Odin Lloyd. And the family didn't do anything wrong."

Lloyd, who played semi-professional football for the Boston Bandits and the Florida Tuskers, had been dating Shayanna Jenkins at the time of his murder. The model was later seen weeping over his coffin as she walked alongside family members to a private burial following a funeral Mass on Monday this week.
