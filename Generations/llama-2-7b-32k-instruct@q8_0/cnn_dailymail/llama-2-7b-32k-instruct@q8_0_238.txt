Alain Robert, a French free solo climber known as "the French Spiderman", has scaled the world's tallest twisted skyscraper in Dubai without any safety gear. The 54-year-old free climbed Cayan Tower, which is also known as the Infinity Tower and is located on Jumeirah Beach Road. He completed the feat at around 8:00pm local time (16: 00 GMT), according to his official Twitter account. The tower's architecture consists of three spirals with a total of 254 curved surfaces, which make it one of the most distinctive buildings in Dubai.

Robert began climbing Cayan Tower on Tuesday at around 10: 30 am local time (07: 30 GMT) and was supported by a team of four other climbers during his attempt, which lasted for more than five hours. "The wind is so strong but I don't feel any fear," Robert told Reuters as he reached the top of the tower. He has previously scaled the Eiffel Tower without harness and also set a world record in 2017 by climbing the world's tallest building, Shanghai Tower.

Robert's feat comes just days after another French free soloist, Pierre Fajura, successfully scaled the world's second tallest tower - Jumeirah Emirates Towers in Dubai without any safety equipment on Saturday night. Both climbers are scheduled to make appearances at a press conference later today.

Robert's feats have sparked controversy in the past, with some critics arguing that free soloing is too dangerous and irresponsible. However, he has defended his activities by stating that it is important to push oneself and take risks to achieve greatness. "It's an art form," Robert said when asked about his feats by a French newspaper Le Parisien in 2017. "You have to do what you believe in."

In conclusion, Alain Robert has successfully completed the world's tallest twisted skyscraper without any safety equipment. This feat is part of his ongoing mission to showcase free soloing as a sport and inspire others to pursue their dreams without fear. Despite the risks involved, he believes that it is important to challenge oneself and take calculated risks in order to achieve greatness.
