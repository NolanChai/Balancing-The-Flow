Jen Psaki thought the offer to be President Barack Obama's communications director wouldn't last long. She figured White House chief of staff Denis McDonough hadn't heard she's expecting a baby girl in August and that would mean no one else would get the job. Then, the offer was extended, she told CNN's Erin Burnett. Psaki said her first thought when the White House called about the job was "this is too good to be true." She figured it wasn't meant for a pregnant woman and that "they'd make up some excuse" once they knew of her pregnancy, she said. But instead, McDonough offered to let her take six weeks maternity leave, which surprised Psaki and made her decide to accept the job. She doesn't plan to announce who is dad is until after his first child turns 18, but she did say it was someone in her "inner circle."

"I can't even imagine how the White House would have functioned without you," Obama said at a ceremony Wednesday as Psaki received an award from the New England Council. He told her that he wanted to tell her to take care of herself, but also that she had done "an incredible job." The president was introduced by his daughter Malia, who told the audience that her mother used to be her English teacher at Sidwell Friends School. In addition to being a communications director in the White House and State Department, Psaki has worked as an Obama campaign adviser and a White House traveling press secretary during the Clinton administration. She was born on Long Island but grew up near Washington after moving there when her dad's job kept him on the East Coast
