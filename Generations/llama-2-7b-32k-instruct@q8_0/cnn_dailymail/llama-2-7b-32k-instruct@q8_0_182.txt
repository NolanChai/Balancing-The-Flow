When news broke that Obama was offering his 2011 campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, the job of communications director at the White House, Psaki had thought that her tenure in the administration would soon end. Her due date is Oct. 3, and she didn't think McDonough, who hired her for a new post as associate director of the Office of Public Engagement, would have the stomach for having his own baby shower.

The White House spokesman doesn't seem to mind - in fact, he seems to relish it.  "I didn't think this was something I wanted to do," McDonough said, laughing about a communications director who would have to deal with all that comes with being the mouthpiece of the most powerful man on the planet. But he added, "She is going to be a tremendous asset to me and the rest of us."

Psaki, 29, said her appointment had been a surprise - she was just wrapping up an interview in early May with USA Today about the White House's communications office when McDonough called. "He asked if I could come down to see him," Psaki told the paper. After they talked for nearly two hours and he gave her the job offer, Psaki said that she was shocked and ecstatic. 

When it came to deciding between a job at the White House and her current post at Reuters, Psaki chose "family first."  "I thought I'd be back by October," she said of working on Obama's re-election campaign. But now that the baby is on the way, she plans to stay in D.C. full time.

Psaki will continue to work out of the West Wing for about a month and then move home with her husband, Greg Mecher - who works in the White House's Office of Management and Budget - and their 19-month-old daughter, Mila. She won't be leaving the baby behind at all, though: She said she will take maternity leave after giving birth this fall, but hopes to return before Christmas.

Psaki will inherit a job that is often in flux; McDonough took over from former communications director Jay Carney about three months ago, and Carney had only been on the job since November 2011. Unlike his predecessor, Psaki said she won't be trying to spin the president - she wants to make sure that Obama is getting credit for all the good things he has done.

The White House communications director will also have an office in the West Wing and a direct line into the Oval Office, which Psaki said she hopes will help her do her job more effectively. But she'll be up against formidable competition - this is an administration that often seems to be on defense when it comes to its actions with regard to foreign affairs, national security and politics in general.

McDonough had a similar feeling about his own appointment as chief of staff to the president earlier this year: He said at the time that he never thought the job would fall to him but was grateful for it when Obama asked.

"I didn't know what I was doing," McDonough, who took over from Jack Lew in January, joked about being chief of staff. "But you learn as you go."

Psaki said that she feels lucky to have landed the job at such a young age and added: "I never thought this would be my career path."  She started off working on political campaigns during her college years, first with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's lieutenant governor when she was still an undergraduate student at George Washington University. After that job didn't pan out, she got a job as press secretary to Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights icon who was elected in 1976.

"I just had the best seat in the house," Psaki said, adding that it was incredible to have worked for someone so dedicated and passionate about public service.  From there, she moved on to working for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a job she held while her daughter was born, then took over communications duties for former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland's unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2010 before moving to the Obama campaign as spokeswoman in November of that year.

"I never thought I would be sitting where I am," Psaki said, adding that she feels fortunate to have worked for four people who all changed her life in different ways. "It's been a crazy ride so far."

As for what Obama himself has told her about the job, he's said nothing at all - but his staff seems excited to have Psaki as part of it.  White House press secretary Jay Carney took to Twitter to congratulate his successor and wrote, "Welcome back to team WH! So glad @jenpsaki is coming on board full time!"

McDonough told USA Today that he expects the job will suit Psaki well since she's a big picture thinker who can be concise in her answers.  "Jen has always been good at seeing where the story is going and being able to put out information before we need to respond," McDonough said of his new team member, whom he called a "smart" and "hard-working" addition to the staff.

Psaki said she'll have some help from Carney in her transition - for example, she won't be answering press questions on her first day but will instead use that time to meet with different offices across the White House complex.  And though McDonough called Psaki's job "one of the most challenging jobs" in Washington, he also said it was a position that would allow her to have an impact on her community and make her feel good about herself as well.

"Jen has always been able to go after information quickly," McDonough told USA Today.  And he added: "I know she's going to do great."
