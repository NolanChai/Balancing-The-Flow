The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer.

Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers from a rare condition called 'Torticollis' and has been dubbed "India's Hang Seng' after the famous doll by the same name.

Doctors have been unable to cure Mahendra and his parents say he is now just "waiting to die".

His parents, Chhotelal Ahirwar, 40, and Malti Ahirwar, 35, said they do not wish for their son's death but would prefer he died than continue living in such pain.

They said: "We are happy that he is alive because we have to face people who look at us with pity or who ask questions about him and then run away from us."

Mahendra was born with his head twisted 180 degrees, so that one shoulder has become taller than the other. He now lives with a hunchback in pain and suffering which is caused by the condition.

Mr Ahirwar said: "He can't do anything. The only thing he can do is eat. He tries to stand but falls. When he cries, his eyes turn black."

Ms Ahirwar added: "We cannot go out of the house because everyone points at our son when they see him. They will not even shake our hand if they meet us on the street."

They said they have spent more than 20 lakhs rupees (£19,745) and taken loans for his treatment but there was no improvement in his condition.

"We are ready to take him out of India for any kind of treatment," Mr Ahirwar said. "But we have nobody to care for him when we are away."

A doctor treating Mahendra at Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital, Bhopal, Dr T S Rawat, said: "He is suffering from torticollis and he can only stand straight if someone supports his head from behind. He will not be able to lead a normal life."

The family are now waiting for a miracle cure that would free him of pain, although the parents fear this might not happen.

Dr Rawat said: "There is no permanent solution. In case he survives, he will have to face great sufferings ahead as the condition is lifelong."

Indian Hang Seng is a famous doll by Mattel that was named after an 80-year old Chinese man who had his head twisted at 17 degrees and lived for eight decades. The doll went on to become extremely popular in India, China and Japan.

A spokesman for the charity Sightsavers said: "We cannot comment on this individual case but it is vital that people with disabilities are not discriminated against."

The family were quoted as saying they would like to name him after the famous doll Hang Seng, who inspired an animated television series and a film in China. [/INST]
