180 feet (55 meters) away from Mount Sharp using its High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera, or HiRISE . Though Nasa has previously seen the rover in images taken by cameras mounted on other spacecraft, such as the Mars Odyssey and Reconnaissance Orbiter itself, this is the first time they’ve been able to get a shot of it from so close to the Martian surface. The HiRISE camera is also sensitive enough to pick out Curiosity’s tracks in the sand . “This image shows that we are beginning to really see details on the ground with HiRISE, which is part of what makes the mission so valuable,” said HiRISE principal investigator Alfred McEwen in a press release. “We have been getting pictures from the spacecraft for about three years now, and these new capabilities will be especially useful when we start to look at the Mars surface with much more detail than ever before.” Curiosity touched down on Mars on August 6th, 2012, and has since traveled over 9 miles (15 km).

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005 to help prepare for the first manned mission to Mars. The spacecraft is currently orbiting at a distance of approximately 176 miles (283 kilometers) from Mars' surface, snapping pictures every day with its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera. Curiosity itself has been on Mars since August 2012, and has driven over 9 miles (15 km) across the Martian terrain thus far. Though Curiosity has taken a number of close-up photos using other cameras aboard the orbiter and the surface rover, this shot marks the first time that HiRISE was able to pick out Curiosity's tracks in the sand . “This image shows that we are beginning to really see details on the ground with HiRISE, which is part of what makes the mission so valuable,” said HiRISE principal investigator Alfred McEwen in a press release. “We have been getting pictures from the spacecraft for about three years now, and these new capabilities will be especially useful when we start to look at the Mars surface with much more detail than ever before.”

This image shows that we are beginning to really see details on the ground with HiRISE, which is part of what makes the mission so valuable. We have been getting pictures from the spacecraft for about three years now, and these new capabilities will be especially useful when we start to look at the Mars surface with much more detail than ever before

The image was taken on July 16th, 2017 . It features Curiosity near Mount Sharp. This particular mountain is interesting because it contains a record of geological activity over millions of years, and scientists hope to learn about the evolution of Mars by studying it. To do this, they must first determine how deep the mountain reaches underneath its surface. The HiRISE camera was able to spot Curiosity in part due to its improved resolution, which has helped make out more detail than ever before
