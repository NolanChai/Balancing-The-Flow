a hill that it landed upon in August. The shot also shows the rover’s six wheels and one of its cameras, along with two dark spots which are thought to be rocks that were thrown up by the rocket when it touched down on Mars . Curiosity is now moving around its landing site, Mount Sharp, where Nasa believes there will be evidence of water and habitable conditions in the distant past. The robotic laboratory has already found some signs of water from an ancient lake, but not enough to answer if life ever existed on Mars. The rover’s chief scientist, Michael Meyer said: “I think we’ve seen hints that there was life at some point . But we don’t have direct evidence for it.”

Asked if he had been disappointed by the lack of findings so far, he replied: “We expected to see signs of life. We just haven’t found them yet”. The rover will stay on Mars for at least another two years and possibly longer. It will carry out experiments that could tell Nasa whether microbial life can survive in the planet’s freezing ground and if there was once enough water to create a habitable environment, or whether its surface has always been barren
