Egypt: Cairo court sentences 71 people to life imprisonment in connection with burning of Christian church  
A court in Cairo has sentenced 71 people to life in prison for their role in the burning of a Christian church in Egypt last year, state media reported on Wednesday. The defendants were also ordered to pay a total of $9 million (6.7 million euros) in compensation to the victims and their families .  
The attack took place on August 14, 2013 in Kafr Hakim village in Giza province and killed one person. The assailants burned down St. George Church following a clash between Muslims and Copts over the construction of a mosque next to the church, state news agency MENA reported .  
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for the investigation into the burning incident immediately after it occurred in August 2013. Sisi described the attack as an attempt to undermine inter-faith relations and stability in Egypt, saying it "will not pass without punishment."  
The defendants are accused of instigating a riot with the intention of looting or burning property, MENA reported . The defendants were arrested on August 15 and sentenced on November 6, state television reported.  
Coptic Christians make up approximately 10 percent of Egypt's population of more than 83 million people . They have suffered attacks and persecution in recent years that some have described as sectarian violence -- a charge the government has rejected .  
In 2011, at least nine Copts were killed after their church was burned down by mobs protesting the construction of a mosque next to it. The country's Muslim majority has accused Egypt's Christians of being disloyal to Islam because they have accepted aid from non-Muslim countries that support Israel .  
Sisi, who heads the military junta, took office in July 2013 following a military coup d'Ã©tat against former President Mohamed Morsi. The new president has been praised for taking a firm line on Islamist groups such as al Qaeda's Egypt-based affiliate Ansar Beit al-Maqdis and the Muslim Brotherhood, which was outlawed in December 2013 .  
However, he has been criticized by rights groups and some activists for cracking down on dissent since taking office.  
"This is not a justice system; this is a political decision," Ahmed Abdel-Meguid, a lawyer representing the victims in the case, told CNN.  
"The court ruling should have been issued at least six months ago but the delay was used to convict them and punish those who were involved with no respect for justice or legal process," he added . The accused are from Kafr Hakim village where the attack took place, according to state television.  
However, Abdel-Meguid told CNN that some of the defendants are not residents of Kafr Hakim. "Some of them were brought from other places for this case and we have no information about their backgrounds or identities," he said .
