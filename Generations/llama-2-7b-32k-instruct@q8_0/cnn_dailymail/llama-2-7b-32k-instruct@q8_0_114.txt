(NASM-B), a group that is demanding accountability for the deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement .
The demonstration was staged just as President Barack Obama released his task force report on police reforms in New York City. The report recommends independent oversight boards to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct, requiring mandatory training for all NYPD officers on racial profiling, and more police body cameras to document interactions between officers and citizens .
The demonstration was also part of a national day of protests in the wake of two fatal police shootings last month. Two Black men were killed by police officers in Minnesota and Louisiana. Their deaths sparked nationwide protests against what has been seen as racism embedded within law enforcement .
Police said they made 34 arrests overnight, all for disorderly conduct or obstructing a public highway and there were no reports of injuries to police officers. The crowd was also dispersed after about two hours. Demonstrators threw bottles at police and tried to block the street leading up to a police station in Midtown Manhattan as they chanted "No more silence!"
The protesters marched down Fifth Avenue before stopping outside Trump Tower, where some lit fireworks . Some also sat on the sidewalk near Central Park. Police say some officers were injured in scuffles with demonstrators. At one point, a police van was overturned and set ablaze, but it is not clear whether those arrests were related to that incident or an earlier confrontation between officers and protesters outside a courthouse .
A law enforcement source says there have been at least four times in recent weeks when NYPD officers have clashed with demonstrators. In all instances the officers arrested about 30 people, most of whom had criminal records. The police department's internal affairs bureau has also launched investigations into the incidents .
The mayor's office says there were about 250 protesters in total who attended Tuesday night's demonstration. Police Commissioner James O'Neill told reporters that officers "have a right to protect themselves" from people with criminal records and no regard for the law who seek to obstruct police business .
Officers had been on high alert since last week's shooting of five Dallas police officers by a Black man upset at recent deaths of African Americans at the hands of police. The New York Police Department has deployed an additional 1,200 officers to patrol neighborhoods in response to that attack .
Protesters also gathered Tuesday night outside City Hall and the Mayor's home on Roosevelt Island in Queens where about 50 people chanted "Black Lives Matter!" and "Shame On You, Bill De Blasio!" The mayor was not at home, but his wife was there .
The protesters also gathered outside of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office to demand that the district attorney investigate a grand jury's decision not to charge the officers involved in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in July 2014 when a police officer put him in a chokehold .
Police also arrested about 80 protesters last Wednesday night at another demonstration in New York City following the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two African Americans shot by police officers. Most of those arrests were for disorderly conduct or obstructing a public highway .
The task force report released Tuesday also said that it was not appropriate to use chokeholds by NYPD officers and recommended banning the technique outright. It found that Garner had suffered from heart disease, hypertension and diabetes -- but it did not say whether any of those conditions contributed to his death .
The city medical examiner's office ruled Garner's death a homicide, saying he died of "compression of the neck (asphyxia)" and that there were no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of his death."
