Alcaraz, who turns 35 next month, is out of contract at Goodison Park this summer and Distin has entered his last year of a deal.

Martinez said: "There have been discussions about Sylvain Distin's situation. I know he wants to carry on playing but also it depends upon how you see your career going forward. If you are not sure if you want to carry on, then that is the time when you decide it is probably the right time to finish."

He added: "Antolin Alcaraz has been a very good servant for this football club. I think he is still at the level to help us in different games but like Sylvain Distin, Antolin needs to prove that his future is here."

Romelu Lukaku scored his sixth goal of the season and Ross Barkley grabbed a brace as Everton beat Leicester 4-1 at Goodison Park on Wednesday night.

The win was Martinez's first in his fifth Premier League match in charge, while it also ended an eight-match run without a home victory for the club.

Everton have now beaten Manchester City and Leicester in successive league games for the first time since 2013 - and in doing so they moved to within four points of the top six.

The result also sparked joy amongst Everton's passionate fanbase who had called for Martinez to be sacked after a run of poor results, including Saturday's 6-1 defeat by Manchester City at Wembley in the League Cup final.

Martinez said: "I think there has been a lot of talk around the way we were playing and I don't need to explain about that. We are very pleased with the victory tonight, especially after what happened on Saturday, because it is clear that football can change in 12 days."

The Scot added: "It was really important for me that our players were strong enough to respond like this. They know how much we need them and they came up trumps, so I am very pleased with their performance tonight."

Leicester's Jamie Vardy opened the scoring but Lukaku equalised five minutes before half-time to ensure Everton entered the break level after an entertaining first 45 minutes.

Everton took control in the second period, however, with Barkley putting them into the lead shortly after the break and then adding a second just two minutes later.

Leicester pulled one back through Shinji Okazaki but Lukaku restored Everton's two-goal advantage soon afterwards before Distin wrapped things up on 75 minutes when he fired past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel after beating the offside trap to collect a pass from Barkley.

It was an easy night for Everton in front of their home supporters and Martinez said: "We played some fantastic football, especially during the second half when we had everything under control."

Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri admitted his players were not at their best and conceded his side looked a shadow of the team that beat Everton 4-1 in the reverse fixture back in August.

The Italian said: "We played some bad football, I am ashamed for our performance tonight because we have to be better than this."

Everton will be looking to build on this victory when they take on West Ham at Upton Park on Sunday in the Premier League.

Ranieri's Leicester are also in action at that time, but not until Monday when they host Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fifth round replay.<s>
