"Gibbon's whispering signals could be a way of saying 'don't worry about this,'" said Andrew Whiten, a professor at the University of St Andrews in Scotland who has spent decades studying primate communication. 
"It suggests that there are other reasons than just being polite."
The whispers are part of a more elaborate form of signaling called "allogrooming," which Gibbons use to build and maintain social bonds with each other, researchers said.
In the study, published in the journal Animal Cognition, researchers from Kyoto University in Japan observed four adult gibbons at an outdoor enclosure for eight hours a day over three weeks, taking note of their facial expressions, posture and gestures as well as when they performed allogrooming.
Although whispering was common among all gibbon pairs studied, only female duos were seen engaging in the activity, researchers said.
The two female gibbons would be touching noses or lips with each other while whispering softly into the ear of the partner at about 1 to 5 meters (yards) away from others.
"This finding suggests that allogrooming could be a way for female Gibbons to maintain social relations," said lead author Ryota Nakamura, who has conducted research on animal communication and facial expressions over two decades. 
The study's findings may also shed light on why humans have evolved the ability to whisper as well, Whiten said. "The evidence suggests that allogrooming signals could be a key factor in promoting social bonding among Gibbons," he added.
