Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy or SMA, the 32-weeker weighed only a pound when he was born. His parents were told by doctors that their son could potentially be paralyzed but they still opted to carry him full term. Malakai's parents have been with their baby since birth. They say that watching their son struggle for life has been hard on them both emotionally and physically. "We stay up in the middle of the night to feed him," says mother, Jamie Malakai, "so we don't miss anything." Doctors say SMA is a genetic disorder that affects nerves in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. The disease affects one out of every five thousand babies born in America. In most cases it happens when a gene mutation occurs in a fetus's cells during early fetal development or during birth. Because SMA is genetic, people who have the disease are unable to pass the faulty gene on to their children. There is no cure for SMA but doctors say Malakai can learn to breath and eat properly by working with a feeding specialist. His family says they're looking forward to spending Christmas together as a family
