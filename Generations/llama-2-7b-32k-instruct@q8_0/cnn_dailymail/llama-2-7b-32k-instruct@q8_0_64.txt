pered for the first time just three days ago, he's incontinent.

"He is a very happy baby," said his father, Mark Malakai."He has no idea what life is like outside of the hospital . And it's frustrating because I would love to have him home with me but I can't."

His mother, Tia Sutton, added, "I just want my son home. Period."

Baby Malakai was born on January 6 via Cesarean section at St. Thomas West Hospital in Nashville after a difficult labor that lasted more than 24 hours. The doctor who delivered him did so by pulling the baby out through Tia's vagina, a procedure known as "sunning."

"I was scared," said Sutton of the delivery. "But I knew he was coming fast and I had to trust my body. Mark (Malakai) and my mother were there to support me but it was all about him. It didn't matter what happened, I just had to have him."

Sadly, the baby's first few days of life were anything but easygoing. At birth, he weighed only five pounds, 12 ounces and measured 17 inches long. He was also diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA).

"We knew there was something wrong," said Sutton, a certified nurse's assistant. "He couldn't move his arms or legs. His arm had been curled up so tight that it caused his shoulder to fuse."

Doctors performed surgery on Baby Malakai immediately after birth to relieve the pressure on his spine and allow him to breath, a procedure he required three times due to infection . Sutton said she was afraid for her son's life. She felt guilty thinking about the fact that this would be her first child, but feared something had gone wrong with her body while pregnant.

"I couldn't sleep at night," Sutton told ABC News, "thinking I did something wrong because of how small he was and what happened to him."

Baby Malakai now needs round-the-clock medical care, including feeding tube support and a breathing machine. He's on an antibiotic regimen that will last for the rest of his life, along with weekly blood tests, which Sutton said can be "rough."

Despite these challenges, he is still able to smile, laugh and enjoy life in spite of all he's been through. His father, who works as a musician and says he plans on being by his side no matter how long they need him, said Baby Malakai has taught the family about hope and perseverance.

"I want my son to be an inspiration," Mark Malakai told ABC News . "I've learned that life isn't always fair but you can still live a happy life."

For Tia Sutton, she said she hopes people see Baby Malakai as more than just a patient.

"He is our son first and foremost," she said. "We don't let the hospital define who we are or what he is. We will always love him unconditionally."

The family has been forced to use every resource available, including the Baby Malakai Fund on YouCaring.com to help pay for medical bills and other costs associated with caring for their son. So far, they have raised over $53,000 of a $120,000 goal, which has allowed them to purchase a specialized bed for the baby's room .

Both Malakaai parents said that although Baby Malakai's condition is life-threatening, they feel grateful he can at least see and hear. They are hopeful that one day soon he will be able to come home with them.

"He brings joy in the darkest times," Tia Sutton said, "because we have to believe he'll get better."<s>
