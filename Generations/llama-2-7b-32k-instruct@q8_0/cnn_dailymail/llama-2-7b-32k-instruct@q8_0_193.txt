The case has many echoes of a previous incident involving former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who was accused of killing unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August 2014 . Like Slager, Wilson shot someone running away and claimed that he felt threatened; both men also alleged they believed the suspects were armed with a gun .

They both involved white police officers shooting unarmed black suspects2 / 3Darren Wilson was a white Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August 2014 .

"In both cases, the suspects ran away from officers and were shot as they fled. The details of each case are different:"

"Michael Brown's death sparked nationwide protests that became violent at times . The city of Ferguson was the epicenter of these protests and was criticized by some for how it responded to protesters."

"In contrast, Walter Scott did not have a criminal record or any known history of violence . He had been released from prison in December 2013 after serving four months on drug charges. A witness who filmed the incident with Slager said she did not see Scott brandish a weapon before he was shot."

"Wilson was cleared in Brown's death by a grand jury, though civil rights activists and critics questioned whether he should have been charged at all . In North Charleston, prosecutors decided to charge Slager with murder for killing Scott."

"3. They both involved officers claiming they feared the suspect had a weapon"

"Officer Wilson said Brown reached toward his gun when he approached him . Investigators later found no evidence that Brown was armed and concluded that Wilson's account of the incident was not true . The video shows Slager never asked Scott if he had a weapon."

"Both officers claimed they were afraid for their own lives or feared being injured during the encounter . Both also claimed to have been in fear before firing shots, but investigations and witness statements cast doubt on those claims."

"In both cases, there was a delay between the shooting and arrest of the officer . Brown's death prompted protesters to ask why Wilson had not been taken into custody immediately following his killing. Scott did not survive his shooting, so there is no footage of him being apprehended."

"4. They both sparked controversy about how police deal with black people"

"5. They both had video evidence of the shooting"

"In Brown's case, video showed him running away from Wilson after the shooting and appeared to show him grabbing for something on the ground . The police department eventually admitted that this did not prove Brown was armed and said the video was not clear enough."

"In Scott's case, a witness recorded Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he fled . This video has been widely shared across social media . It shows Scott running away from Slager after getting out of his car . The officer can be seen dropping something to the ground before firing again at Scott."

"6. They both sparked questions about whether officers are held accountable for their actions"

"Brown's death led to an ongoing national conversation about police shootings, including those that did not result in the death of the suspect . A number of investigations were conducted into his death and how the Ferguson Police Department handled protesters."

"In North Charleston, Scott's death sparked a local investigation and grand jury indictment against Slager."

"7. They both had to do with broken taillights"

"Both Brown and Scott had their cars pulled over for a broken tail light . Brown was shot by Wilson after a struggle that left him dead . Scott's death stemmed from an encounter in which he fled from Slager, who arrested him."

"8. They both sparked questions about whether the suspect was armed or not"

"Brown's body was found to be unarmed when investigators searched for a gun at his home after his death . It was later revealed that Slager planted a gun by Scott's body."

"It is unclear if Brown had any weapons on him the day he was killed . In North Charleston, Scott did not have a weapon when he was shot."

"Both Wilson and Slager claimed that they were scared for their lives during the confrontations . Their departments responded to public criticism with promises of changes, including more training for officers in use of force."

"10. They both sparked a national conversation about police behavior"

"Brown's death was seen as representative of how black people are treated by law enforcement across the country . His shooting spurred protests and led to calls to change how police deal with minorities, including ending the use of deadly force in questionable situations."

"In North Charleston, Scott's death sparked a local conversation about police behavior. Slager was charged with murder as part of a nationwide debate over whether officers who kill unarmed suspects should be held criminally accountable . Some experts and activists say the charges are a good first step, but that more change is needed."

"The cases have many similarities and differences . Both resulted in outrage among protesters and sparked national discussion about race relations and police behavior. But Brown's case was marked by tensions between law enforcement officials and the community where he lived, while Scott's death sparked controversy within his own local community."

"The cases are not identical, but both involve white officers using deadly force against black suspects who were unarmed . Both have led to criminal charges being filed against the police officers involved. The North Charleston case is still ongoing and will likely be in the news for some time."
