Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder on Friday night in connection with his fatal shooting of Walter Scott, a black motorist who had fled from him during a traffic stop last weekend.

Slager's arrest came hours before the release of surveillance footage showing that he shot Scott as the man ran away. The video shows officers approaching the car and then Slager firing eight times at a person on the ground, five of those shots hitting him in the back, authorities said.
