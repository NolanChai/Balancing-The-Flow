Manchester City's manager, Manuel Pellegrini, says his team must prove itself worthy of the huge amount spent on it by winning matches like its visit to Crystal Palace, which will be a difficult game and could result in a loss.

Output: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace to avoid losing yet more ground to their rivals. Fading champions City had to watch in fury last season as Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur all won the silverware they craved, while it could only manage a third-placed finish in the Premier League. Pellegrini's future at the club is also uncertain with some fans calling for his head following last weekend's 4-2 defeat by Leicester City and reports suggesting that he could soon be replaced by compatriot Jorge Sampaoli. However, after a dismal start to the current season in which it has lost three of its opening four games - two against promoted sides Hull City and Middlesbrough as well as one at home to West Bromwich Albion - City's Chilean boss is still confident they can regain their form and beat Palace on Saturday. "I hope that we can win the game," he said, adding: "But if not, I don't think there will be any problems with me because when you start to change a team you are always in a difficult situation." Pellegrini is hoping the return of key players Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and David Silva from injury will help his side get back on track after an embarrassing defeat to newly promoted Leicester. The former Malaga boss also wants to see more consistency in City's play, as well as better defence work - particularly at set pieces - to improve their chances of winning the game. "We must continue working," he said. "The important thing is that we are a team that has very good players and this is one of the most difficult games for us but if we continue to work in this way I think we can win."
