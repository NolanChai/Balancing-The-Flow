ury last weekend as bitter foes Liverpool pulled clear with victory over Leicester City .

The 3-1 win for the Merseys at Anfield was Pellegrini's former club's fourth straight win, leaving Manchester trailing the Reds by seven points . Palace have been a bogey team for Pellegrini in recent seasons and he has lost all three of his visits to Selhurst Park. But he still insisted there is no reason why they should not win at Crystal Palace on Sunday .

"It's always difficult, but I believe that we have the potential to beat them," Pellegrini said in an interview with his club's website on Saturday ahead of their trip to south London . "I think it will be a tough game but it's a game against Crystal Palace at home and I think we are able to win."

Palace have had mixed fortunes under new boss Frank De Boer, winning 1-0 over West Bromwich Albion before being trounced by Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 . They currently sit one place above the relegation zone after collecting only four points from their opening nine games.

Meanwhile, former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been linked with a return to Anfield, but Pellegrini insisted the Portuguese coach was happy at Eastlands and he would be staying put . "He's not going anywhere," said Pellegrini . "I have not seen that news yet but I know for sure that it is not true."

Pellegrini also praised Liverpool, saying they had been a good example of how to manage teams in the Premier League . The Portuguese coach admitted he was happy his side were also doing well on the pitch despite their disappointing start .

"It's important for us to win," Pellegrini said . "We have improved our performances compared with last season, even though we are not winning. We need to keep working."

City will be without Wilfried Bony who has been ruled out of the trip to Palace because of a groin problem and Raheem Sterling is doubtful for the game due to an undisclosed injury .

City face Manchester United in their next Premier League match at Old Trafford on November 5. The Red Devils have not won against City since 2013, when they beat them 3-0 at Old Trafford but Pellegrini is not underestimating the threat of Louis van Gaal's men . "It will be a tough game," he said . "They are an important team, and they have started to win some good results."

The Chilean was also asked about Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur who had been leading the way this season with five wins out of nine games but Pellegrini dismissed their chances of winning the league . "It's too soon," he said .

"If they continue to win, I think it will be good for the Premier League and if they finish in the top four, that will also be good."

City are currently second bottom in the table with nine points from their opening 10 games but Pellegrini is still confident his side can make a comeback . "We have to keep working," he said . "It's not easy but I think it's important for us, as we cannot lose another game and continue to work."

Pellegrini also discussed the decision by referee Mike Dean to award Palace a penalty in their defeat against Tottenham at Selhurst Park on Saturday . It was the second time that this season he has controversially given Roy Hodgson's side a spot kick and Palace boss De Boer did not hold back in his criticism of the referee .

"It's difficult to make comments, but it is a bit frustrating," Pellegrini said . "We need to continue working and keep our performances up. I think the most important thing for us now is we must recover for Sunday."

And when asked what he had told his players about the penalty decision, Pellegrini replied: "I have not spoken about that, but they know very well what happened."

The Chilean also expressed his delight at the performance of his team's new signing Claudio Brazão . The Brazilian was a surprise start against Leicester City and managed to create two chances for Sergio Agüero before being substituted in the 74th minute as City went on to win the game with two late goals .

"I think he did very well," Pellegrini said of Brazão's performance . "We need all our players and we have a lot of competition for positions so I'm happy that Claudio did well."

But despite his side's poor start to the season, the Portuguese coach insisted they still had time on their hands . "It's important," Pellegrini said . "We need to keep working and not lose our confidence because we are a good team with good players and I believe that we have enough potential to win titles this season."

Pellegrini also discussed his relationship with De Boer, who is one of the manager's former players at Malaga . The Palace boss was asked if there had been any friction between him and the former Ajax coach . "We talk a lot," he said . "I think we are working very well."

Finally, Pellegrini admitted City must be better than they have in the past to catch Liverpool who he described as his club's main rivals at the moment . "Liverpool is our rival for now," he said . "But if Chelsea and Tottenham finish above us then we will start thinking about them."

Pellegrini was also asked about the impact of Brazilian striker Fred, who has been linked with a move away from City in January but Pellegrini insisted they were not selling their players to rivals . "I think it's important that the player feels good," he said ."We are always happy when we sell our players but I don't know if there is a possibility of him going. It depends on Fred."

In terms of City's future, Pellegrini insisted the club would not be in financial trouble as they have enough resources to buy new players and he did not rule out making a move for Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil in January . "It's important that we keep our squad," he said .

"We have enough money to improve our squad because when you spend some money, you also sell." Pellegrini was asked if they could sign a player like Özil and also keep hold of their key players who are wanted by other clubs. "It's not easy but I think it is possible," he said .

City play host to Crystal Palace on Sunday with the kick-off at 16:00 BST (15:00 GMT). The match will be shown live in the UK on Sky Sports Premier League and in India on Star Sports, which has exclusive rights for this season's Premier League games.

Pellegrini also had a message for his team's fans who were disappointed with their side's poor start to the season . "I hope they can keep working and continue supporting us because I think we are a good club and we have players who want to win titles," he said .

Manchester City currently sit in 12th place in the Premier League with nine points from their opening 10 games. They will be without Wilfried Bony due to a groin injury and Raheem Sterling is doubtful for the game against Palace because of an undisclosed injury.
