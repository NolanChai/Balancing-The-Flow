A British Fashion Awards 2015 event was held last night at the London Coliseum. The event, which celebrates the best of British fashion and designers in the industry, attracted a star-studded audience including Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne .

In terms of style, the ladies didn’t disappoint either – with models strutting down the red carpet sporting some pretty outlandish ensembles. The overall winner for best dressed was model Georgia May Jagger who donned a white lace dress that featured ruffled sleeves and a thigh-high split .

Another standout look of the night was courtesy of Miriam González Durántez, who wore a particularly colourful ensemble to a fashion show and award gala in central London tonight. Miriam Gonzalez Duranetez is not one to blend into the background and has been known for her bold and sometimes unconventional style choices.

Miriam was photographed leaving The Dorchester Hotel earlier that evening sporting a floral dress with a fitted waist, which she styled with a pair of white heels . She teamed this with a stunning orange clutch bag, a white scarf and silver jewellery.
