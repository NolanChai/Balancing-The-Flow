the World Solar Challenge (WSC) 2017, which will take place between Darwin and Adelaide in November .
The competition sees teams of students from around the world drive vehicles that are powered by solar energy. While this isn't a new challenge – the first WSC took place back in 1987 – it does showcase some incredible innovation, not least because the race is held across such an extensive distance.
Drive eO says its car will be able to travel approximately 500 kilometers (310 miles) per day, if all goes to plan . The team wants to achieve this by focusing on lightweight materials, low rolling resistance and advanced aerodynamics – the latter of which is essential in the car's quest to attain a drag coefficient as low as possible.
Drive eO hasn't released any information about its vehicle's battery yet, but says that it will be able to charge the pack using solar panels . The team plans to test the vehicle on a racetrack before the competition starts in October. "After that we will start improving our car and increasing its speed," the company said on Facebook.
The World Solar Challenge is open to all electric vehicles, whether they are powered by solar energy or not. However, cars without solar panels must be able to charge their batteries from an external source . The event has been won by teams from Japan in each of its first seven competitions and Drive eO is hoping to make it eight out of nine with its new car, which will also go by the name e-Racer.
The team says that not only does it want to win the World Solar Challenge but also inspire young people about electric vehicles in general. It hopes that afterward they will use this experience to bring knowledge and ideas back to their university or faculty .
You can watch the team's progress on its website, where it is sharing details about the car and documenting its journey towards WSC 2017. There's also an Instagram account to check out if you want updates in your feed .

The Latvian firm says that the race will see vehicles travel across Australia with no charging stops, as well as limited food and water . It will be an incredible challenge for any vehicle, let alone one powered by solar energy.
Drive eO is taking part in the WSC because it wants to inspire people about electric vehicles and show that they are a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. The team says it wants to prove that sustainability doesn't have to come at the cost of speed or performance .
There aren't many details available for the car yet, but Drive eO has shared some images on its website of how its car will look like once it is built. As you can see from the renderings above, the company plans to make use of lightweight materials to help the car attain a low drag coefficient and increase its range .
The team says that after WSC 2017, they plan to improve their vehicle in order to get an even better time next year. The challenge will be a great way for Drive eO to test out some of its ideas before it launches a production version of the car.
Drive eO's website says that if you are interested in collaborating with the team, or would like more details about the World Solar Challenge competition, please contact the company via email . It also has an open call for sponsors and volunteers to help them build their car.

Drive eO plans on testing its electric race car before October so that it can improve its speed in time for the World Solar Challenge 2017 . It says the competition is about inspiring people, not just winning .
Drive eO is taking part in the World Solar Challenge because it wants to prove that sustainability doesn't have to come at the cost of performance. The company plans on building a production version of its race car after competing in the 2017 competition as well, so it can encourage people to buy electric cars .
Drive eO isn't alone in wanting to inspire young people about electric vehicles either. Another team from Lithuania called EcoMotion has also entered the challenge with a car that will be powered entirely by solar energy and won't need any charging stops during its 3,000 kilometer (1,864 mile) trip across Australia .
Drive eO says it plans on documenting the build process of its electric race car leading up to the World Solar Challenge so that people can follow along with the team's progress. It will also share details about how it is able to achieve a low drag coefficient and other innovations that help the car reach such high speeds .
The company has also opened an open call for sponsors if any companies want to get involved in the project before WSC 2017. You can contact Drive eO via email or phone if you're interested in collaborating with the team . It also accepts volunteers, which are always a great way to help out a company that's doing innovative things and pushing the industry forward.
