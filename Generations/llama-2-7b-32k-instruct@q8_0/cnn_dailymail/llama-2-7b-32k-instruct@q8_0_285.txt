Locusts could form basis of future food 

An Australian scientist is proposing that locusts - the scourge of farmers for centuries - should be harvested, milked for their protein and processed into food. Professor Peter Sutton says he has received a patent on his technique which involves cooking the insect in salt water to tenderise it before squeezing out its protein rich fluid, The Australian reports . 

"The protein content of locusts is higher than that of most other sources including beef and lamb," said Sutton. "I've been saying for years now, if we want food security then we need to look at things like insects."
