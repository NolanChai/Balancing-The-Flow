QPR boss Chris Ramsey believes Sunday's west London derby is more crucial to his side than it is to title-chasing Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's Blues visit Loftus Road looking for a win that will maintain their five - point lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table, but Ramsey believes Sunday's encounter could be equally important for his team.

"It is not just about our local pride," said Ramsey. "It is also about the fact we have had to deal with a lot of stuff against us in this campaign. It is one way of responding." (AS)
