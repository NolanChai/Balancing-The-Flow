Yes, there are devices available that can prevent a UK plug from being used. One option is a surge protector with a built-in voltage converter. This will convert the UK 240V to US 110V, so your electronic equipment will still work as usual, but it will be protected against the higher voltage.
Another option is a plug adapter that has a built-in voltage converter. These adapters are designed to convert the voltage and protect your equipment from damage caused by high voltages.
Finally, you can also use a voltage converter that converts the UK 240V to US 110V. This will allow you to plug in your electronic equipment using the UK plug, but it will be converted to the correct voltage for your device.
It's important to note that not all devices are compatible with these types of protectors and adapters, so make sure to check the compatibility before purchasing one. Additionally, it's a good idea to read the instructions carefully to ensure you're using the product correctly and safely.
