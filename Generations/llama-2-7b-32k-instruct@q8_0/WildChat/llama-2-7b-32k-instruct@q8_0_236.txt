You can run the `node` command to start the express application on port 3000, and then you can access it in a web browser by going to `http://localhost:3000`.

Here are some additional steps you may want to take:

1. Install the dependencies for the express framework using npm:
```
npm install express --save
```
2. Start the server by running the command `node server.js`:
```
acer@LAPTOP-TA0QKCOO MINGW64 /c/rest_api1
$ node server.js
Start server at port 3000.
```
You can then open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to test the application.

3. Verify that the application is running correctly by using a tool like Postman or cURL to send a request to the API endpoint you've defined in your code. For example, you can use Postman to send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/books` and see the list of books returned from the server.
4. If you want to deploy the application to a production environment, you may need to set up a reverse proxy or load balancer to handle incoming requests to your API endpoint. You can use a tool like NGINX or Apache to configure this.
5. Consider adding authentication and authorization to your API endpoint using a library like Passport.js or JwtAuth. This will help protect your application from unauthorized access.
6. If you want to add additional functionality to your API, such as creating new books or updating existing ones, you can use Node's built-in `fs` module to read and write files on the server side, which can be useful for storing data.
7. Finally, if you want to test the API using a framework like Jest or Mocha, you can write unit tests that exercise different parts of your codebase and ensure it's working correctly.

Sure, here's a solution to the problem you described:

Firstly, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install express:
```
npm install --save express
```
This will install express as a dependency of your project and save it to your `node_modules` directory.

Next, create a file named `server.js` in the same directory where you ran the previous command (usually `C:\rest\_api1\`) and open it in your preferred text editor.

Inside `server.js`, add the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html'); // replace "index" with your actual file name
});

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```
This code creates a simple server using express that listens for incoming requests at port 3000 and sends the index file from the current directory (`index.html`) as a response to any request to the root URL (`/`). You can customize this code to suit your needs by replacing the file name or adding additional routes.

Finally, save the changes to `server.js` and start the server by running the following command:
```
node server.js
```
This will start the server on port 3000, and you should be able to access it in your web browser at <http://localhost:3000/> . You can also use a tool like `curl` or `wget` to test your server by running commands such as:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```
This will send a GET request to the root URL and display the index file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
