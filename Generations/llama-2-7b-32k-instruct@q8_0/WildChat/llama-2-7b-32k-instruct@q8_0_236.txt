The Political Advisory Council was established in accordance with Articles 56 and 57 of the Constitution of China (1935) on October 29, 1940. It was officially inaugurated on December 18, 1940. The Council's purpose was to provide advice to the President and the Executive Yuan.

The Political Advisory Council was composed of thirty-five members, including fifteen representatives from the National Government, ten from the Provinces, and ten from municipalities or autonomous regions. These members were elected by the National Assembly, which had been established in 1940 to replace the Provisional Legislative Yuan.

The Political Advisory Council played a vital role in the governance of China during World War II. It was responsible for drafting laws and regulations, as well as advising the President and the Executive Yuan on policy matters. The Council also helped to oversee the implementation of various policies and programs, such as those related to taxation, finance, and public works.

In addition to its legislative role, the Political Advisory Council also served as a check on executive power. It was responsible for reviewing the President's proposed laws and regulations before they were enacted into law, and it could recommend changes or modifications to these proposals. The Council also had the authority to investigate allegations of corruption or malfeasance against government officials and to make recommendations for disciplinary action.

The Political Advisory Council was abolished on December 10, 1949, following the establishment of the People's Republic of China. However, its legacy lived on in the form of the advisory role played by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which was established on April 13, 1956, and continues to play a significant role in China's governance today.

In conclusion, the Political Advisory Council was an important institution in pre-Communist Chinese politics that played a vital role in the governance of the country during World War II. Its establishment marked a significant milestone in the evolution of China's political system and contributed to the development of democratic institutions in the country. Despite its short lifespan, the Political Advisory Council left a lasting impact on Chinese politics and paved the way for the CPPCC, which continues to serve as an important consultative body in modern-day China.
