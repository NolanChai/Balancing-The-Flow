Prompt 1: A futuristic city with towering skyscrapers, sleek metallic structures, and advanced technology integrated into every aspect of daily life. The setting should be at sunset, with a pink and orange sky illuminating the skyline. The cityscape should be bustling with activity, with flying cars whizzing by, robots assisting pedestrians on the sidewalk, and holographic advertisements shining in the streets. The composition should focus on a group of people gathered around a large window, enjoying a meal at an upscale restaurant while observing the city's breathtaking views.
Prompt 2: A cozy and welcoming farmhouse surrounded by lush greenery, with a front porch overlooking a peaceful valley. The scene should be set in springtime, with trees draped in bright yellow blossoms, freshly plowed fields stretching into the distance, and birds chirping happily in the background. Inside the farmhouse, there's a warm and inviting atmosphere, with vintage decorations, old-fashioned cookware, and family heirlooms on display. The composition should focus on a mother nursing her baby while looking out the window at the picturesque scene beyond, with a soft focus effect to make the image appear dreamy and ethereal.
Prompt 3: A dark and atmospheric urban environment, lit by neon lights that cast an eerie glow over the streets. The setting should be at night, with abandoned buildings looming in the shadows and graffiti-covered walls adding to the city's grimy charm. The composition should focus on a group of people gathered around a table in a dimly lit bar or club, drinking and conversing with each other as if they were the only ones alive in this desolate world. The lighting should be dramatic and moody, with shadows and highlights adding depth to the scene.
Prompt 4: A stunning winter wonderland, with snow-covered trees and mountains, glistening icicles hanging from buildings, and frozen lakes reflecting the sky's colors. The setting should be at sunrise or sunset, when the sky is aglow with pink and orange hues. The composition should focus on a couple sharing a romantic moment in front of a roaring fireplace, with a large window letting in warm light and framing their faces beautifully.
