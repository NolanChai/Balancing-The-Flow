1 / 2Welcome back everyone! I hope you’ve had a great time with your previous prompt. For this prompt we will be exploring an island that is slightly different from what it looks like, but not too much. It has all the qualities of Fear Factory Island, but the buildings and structures are built out of wood instead of stone. There is still one tree with a chest attached to it. We’ll start off at this island before going into the forest for a little bit more exploring.

Once you arrive on the island there will be a prompt given to you, which I'll write in green text. After that there should be a few seconds of silence before the next prompt is given. You are free to explore the island at this point and can interact with anything you wish!

When you're ready, please respond using either /start or /enter! Please remember to bold your name so we know who's speaking and what they're saying. If you haven’t had a chance to read the rules yet, check them out in the #rules channel! I can’t wait to see where this prompt takes us.

Now it’s time for our first prompt. It is now night-time on this mysterious island and there seems to be a sense of unease hanging over the place. You’re all standing around the large tree that has been there since you arrived, looking at each other in confusion. It’s almost as if someone or something is watching you.

Archeogiana: "I don't like this...this place feels too familiar."

Eye of Kingthulhu: “I agree. I feel like we should get back to the boat.”

Necrohemoth: “No, not yet. We can’t leave yet. Something is off about this island.”

As my friends and I explored this forest-like place, I think it felt oddly...familiar. As if this was a less technologically-advanced version of Fear Factory.)

Archeogiana: "Do you guys feel a sense of familiarity coming from this island? Or is it just me?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Yeah...this looks like Fear Factory, but less technologically-advanced."

Necrohemoth: "Well you can’t blame the Sculk-elemental Blacksight. Eye of Kingthulhu, just because you’re the Creation-elemental Blacksight doesn’t mean that you created this. And Archeogiana, I don’t want to see any chaos from this point."

Archeogiana: "Seriously? You expect ME, the Chaos-elemental Blacksight, to not cause chaos? It's literally MY thing, you know-"

(Just then, Archeogiana doubles over in pain onto my back.)
