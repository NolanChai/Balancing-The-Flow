Sure, here's another possible reaction to that situation:

As the song comes to an end, Naruto stands up from his seat and takes a deep breath. He looks around the restaurant, taking in the cheers and applause from the gathered guests. With a determined expression on his face, he walks over to the stage and addresses the crowd.

Naruto: Thank you all for being here today. I'm honored to have been able to share this moment with you. And to my dear friend Kurama, thank you for sharing your music with us. It truly is a gift that I will never forget.

Kurama nods in appreciation, a warm smile on his face as he plays the last few notes of the song. The crowd erupts into cheers and applause once more, clearly moved by Naruto's words and Kurama's performance.

Naruto: And now, it's time for something truly special. As you all know, my dear friend Kurama is not only a talented musician but also a wise and kind-hearted being. And today, I have a surprise for him.

Kurama looks intrigued as Naruto pulls out a small box from his pocket and holds it up for everyone to see. The box is adorned with a beautiful pink bow, and inside, lies a tiny pair of earrings.

Naruto: These earrings are not just any ordinary earrings. They were made especially for Kurama by my dear friend Lilac. And I want to present them to him as a token of our friendship and gratitude for his music.

Kurama looks stunned, but quickly regains his composure. He takes the earrings from Naruto and holds them up to the light, examining them with a curious eye.

Kurama: These are... beautiful. Lilac, you truly have a gift for creating such delicate and elegant pieces. Thank you, Naruto. And thank you, Kurama, for allowing me to share this moment with you. It means more to me than words can express.

Naruto grins widely as he takes the earrings back from Kurama and slips them onto his own ears. He then looks up at Lilac, who is standing in the shadows, beaming with pride.

Naruto: And now, it's time for us to say goodbye. But don't worry, I'll make sure that these earrings are always a reminder of our friendship and the beautiful music that Kurama has shared with us all.

Kurama nods in understanding, and the crowd begins to disperse, chatting excitedly about the wonderful performance they've just witnessed. Naruto and Lilac stay behind for a moment, exchanging hugs and words of thanks before parting ways once again.

As they do, the sound of Kurama's music echoes through the air, a reminder of the special bond that unites them all. And though their paths may diverge, they know that their friendship will always be etched in time, just like the melody of Kurama's song.

And with that, Naruto and Lilac walk out into the night, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, but never forgetting the memories they shared on freedom planet...
