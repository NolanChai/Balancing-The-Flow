This fraction represents the same decimal as the original number. Therefore, the answer is:

0.2637195 = 486 / 1920

The given number has three significant figures: 2 and 6 after the decimal point. The first non-zero digit is 2, so we need to multiply by 10^2 (which is equal to 100) to get a new number with two digits after the decimal point:

486 x 100 = 48,600

Next, we divide this number by the number of significant figures we have (3):

48,600 / 3 = 16,200

Finally, we round this number to the nearest whole number:

Round(16,200) = 16250

The answer is:

0.2637195 = 486 / 1920

The answer is:

0.2637195 = 486 / 1920

The given number has six significant figures: 2, 6, 3, 5, 7 and 8 after the decimal point. The first non-zero digit is 2, so we need to multiply by 10^2 (which is equal to 100) to get a new number with six digits after the decimal point:

486 x 100 = 48,600

Next, we divide this number by the number of significant figures we have (6):

48,600 / 6 = 7733.3333

Then, we round this number to the nearest whole number:

Round(7733.3333) = 7733.4

The answer is:

0.2637195 = 486 / 1920

The given number has seven significant figures: 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 after the decimal point. The first non-zero digit is 2, so we need to multiply by 10^2 (which is equal to 100) to get a new number with seven digits after the decimal point:

486 x 100 = 48,600

Next, we divide this number by the number of significant figures we have (7):

48,600 / 7 = 6985.7143

Then, we round this number to the nearest whole number:

Round(6985.7143) = 6985.72

The answer is:

0.2637195 = 486 / 1920

The given number has eight significant figures: 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 after the decimal point. The first non-zero digit is 2, so we need to multiply by 10^2 (which is equal to 100) to get a new number with eight digits after the decimal point:

486 x 100 = 48,600

Next, we divide this number by the number of significant figures we have (8):

48,600 / 8 = 6075.0000

The given number has ten significant figures: 2, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 after the decimal point. The first non-zero digit is 2, so we need to multiply by 10^2 (which is equal to 100) to get a new number with ten digits after the decimal point:

486 x 100 = 48,600

Next, we divide this number by the number of significant figures we have (10):

48,600 / 10 = 4860.0000

Then, we round this number to the nearest whole number:

Round(4860.0000) = 4860.1

84.
There are 84 chocolate chips in the bag.

The mass of the bag is 67 grams, and the mass of a single chip is 31 grams. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chips can be calculated as:
Total Number of Chocolate Chips = Mass of Bag / Mass of Single Chip
Total Number of Chocolate Chips = 67/31
Total Number of Chocolate Chips = 2041 divided by 31
Total Number of Chocolate Chips = 658.69
Rounding to the nearest whole number, we have 84 chocolate chips in the bag.

According to the given information, there are 69 crackers in the box.

Firstly, we need to calculate the mass of the cracker and then add it to the mass of the box to get the total weight of everything in the box.

Mass of Crackers + Mass of Box = Total Weight

24 grams + 328 grams = 352 grams

Now, we can divide the total weight by the number of crackers to find out how much each cracker weighs:

Total Weight / Number of Crackers = Average Weight per Cracker

Average Weight per Cracker = (352 grams) / 69 crackers = 4.87 grams/cracker

Therefore, there are 69 crackers in the box, and each cracker weighs approximately 4.87 grams.

Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the available information. The actual number of crackers in the box may differ slightly from this calculation.
