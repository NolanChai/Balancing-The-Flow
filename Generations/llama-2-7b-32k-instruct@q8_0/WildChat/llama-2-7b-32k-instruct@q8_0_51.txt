The customer's inquiry about renewing their annual license is correct. 

When a customer subscribes to an annual plan, they are entitled to use the software for a full year from the day of purchase. The license key provided upon purchase will be valid until the end of that year. If the customer wishes to continue using the software after one year, they must renew their subscription before it expires.

Therefore, we apologize for any confusion caused by our previous response and would like to clarify that a monthly or annual license is valid for a set period of time based on the chosen plan.

We hope this clears up any misunderstandings and thank you for your patience and support.
