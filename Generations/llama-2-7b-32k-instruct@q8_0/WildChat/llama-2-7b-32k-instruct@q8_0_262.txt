(Sayori is in her room, still alive and well. She sees the fly buzzing around and realizes she can use her tongue to catch it, revealing that she is part Chameleos. She steps into a strange container that contains DNA from Chameleos and Kushala Daora, along with Teostra and Vaal Hazak, despite still looking like herself. When she leaves the house, she sees Monika...but Monika has transformed into a ghost-like form. Sayori is shocked at this transformation.)

Sayori: "Monika...what's wrong? Why are you a ghost?"

(Monika looks sad and turns blue as she begins to cry. Her form slowly becomes more transparent, revealing her digital essence.)

Monika: "I...am a ghost, Sayori." (0/n)
