1 / 1In the tundra biome, a snow golem gives birth to a baby snow golem with blue eyes and blonde hair. The snow golem looks up at the player with gratitude as they approach.

"I owe you one," she says. "If there's ever anything I can do for you in return...just let me know." 

The player smiles and nods, feeling a sense of connection to the snow golem and her newborn baby. They leave the tundra biome with a renewed sense of wonder and awe for the mysteries of nature.
