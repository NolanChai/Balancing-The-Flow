Sure, here's an example of how you could create an event that happens every 30-60 minutes where a plane flies over the map and drops a supply drop using Fivem scripting in Lua:
```
-- Define the event
function on_event(event)
    if event.event == "aircraft_landed" then
        -- Check if the aircraft is carrying a supply drop
        local aircraft = game.Workspace.Aircraft
