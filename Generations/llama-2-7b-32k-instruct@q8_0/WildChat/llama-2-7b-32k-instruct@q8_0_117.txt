1. The critics claim that his methods have no scientific basis or evidence to support their effectiveness, which has led some experts to question whether they actually work. 
2. Some critics also argue that his methods are too aggressive and may cause more harm than good, especially for patients who have chronic conditions or injuries that require long-term care. 
3. Additionally, there is a concern that his focus on manipulating the body can lead to unnecessary surgeries or interventions when other, less invasive treatments would suffice. 
4. Some critics also claim that he promotes unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved with physical therapy and may discourage patients from seeking more effective treatment elsewhere if his methods do not work.

Zac Cupples, a physical therapist, uses an evidence-based approach to treat pain and dysfunction. This means that he bases his treatment plans on scientific research and clinical guidelines, rather than relying solely on personal experience or tradition. He also places a strong emphasis on patient education and empowerment, encouraging patients to take an active role in their own recovery by learning about the underlying causes of their pain and how they can manage it effectively.

One specific approach that Cupples uses is called "functional movement assessment" (FMA). FMA involves analyzing a patient's movements in different planes of motion to identify any limitations or imbalances that may be contributing to their pain or dysfunction. This helps him develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses the specific needs of each patient, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.

In addition to FMA, Cupples also incorporates other techniques such as manual therapy, exercise prescription, and education and training in pain management strategies into his treatments. He works closely with patients to help them understand the underlying mechanisms of their pain and how they can best manage it through movement and exercise.

Overall, Zac Cupples' approach to physical therapy emphasizes evidence-based practice, patient education, and a focus on empowering patients to take an active role in their own recovery.
