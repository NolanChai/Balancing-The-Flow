Julia Fairbanks came to school and all of the kids were there. She was rich like her family's department store, "Fairbank's". Everyone knew her and they all thought that she was going to be a spoiled brat. But when Julia walked out on the stage everyone saw how sweet and humble she really is. Her father was with her at school today. She calls him daddy instead of dad because he is such an influential figure in her life.
