Sure, here's an example of how this might work:

Let's say you have a grey 18% object and you want to take a photo of it using your camera. The object is not white because it reflects very little light, but you still want the final picture to be white. To achieve this, you can adjust the exposure compensation on your camera to +2.

When you do this, the camera will underexpose (make the photo darker) by 2 stops in order to get the proper balance of light and dark areas in the picture. This means that the grey object will be exposed for a longer period of time, which will help it to appear whiter in the final image.

Here's how the process works:

1. You point your camera at the grey 18% object. The object appears as a grey colour on the LCD screen or viewfinder because the camera has not yet taken the photo and is still calculating the exposure settings.
2. You press the shutter release button to take the picture. The camera's metering system reads the light levels in the scene and calculates the proper exposure compensation setting (in this case, +2).
3. The camera takes the photo, but with a darker exposure (by 2 stops) than normal. This means that the grey object will be exposed for longer, which should help it to appear whiter in the final image.
4. You review the picture on your LCD screen or viewfinder and see that the grey object looks more white than before. However, it may still not be completely white, depending on the lighting conditions and other factors.
5. You adjust the exposure compensation setting as needed to get the perfect balance of brightness and contrast in the final image. For example, if the picture is still a bit dark, you might want to increase the exposure compensation to +2.5 to lighten up the grey object even more.

Overall, adjusting exposure compensation to +2 when photographing a grey 18% object should help it to appear whiter in the final picture, although there may be some further adjustments needed for perfect results.
