To make a smoke bomb for use in a car event, you will need to gather the following materials:

* Baking soda
* Cornstarch
* Dry ice (optional)
* Alka-Seltzer
* Matches or lighter

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make your own smoke bomb:

1. Gather all the materials you need for the recipe.
2. Mix equal amounts of baking soda and cornstarch together in a large bowl.
3. Add a pinch of dry ice, if using, and stir until it is fully incorporated into the mixture.
4. Take out two Alka-Seltzer tablets and crush them up with your fingers or a sharp object.
5. Place the crushed tablets in the middle of the baking soda and cornstarch mixture.
6. Pour water over the top of the mixture, covering all the ingredients completely.
7. Stir the mixture thoroughly until the baking soda and cornstarch are fully dissolved and there are no more dry spots.
8. Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap to trap the fumes and prevent them from escaping.
9. Place a match or lighter near the edge of the bowl, away from the mixture itself, and light it on fire.
10. Wait for the smoke bomb to fully combust before removing the lid. You may need to hold the bowl at an angle to allow the flames to reach all areas.

Once the smoke bomb is fully combusted, you can place it in a safe location away from people and vehicles. It will continue to produce smoke for several minutes.

Remember that making a homemade smoke bomb can be dangerous, so use caution when handling the mixture and follow all safety precautions. Additionally, it's important to note that the use of smoke bombs in cars is not recommended, as they can cause damage to the vehicle and put passengers at risk. It's always best to use fireworks or other decorative items that are specifically designed for car events.

Also, keep in mind that making a homemade smoke bomb may require some trial and error, so you may need to adjust the recipe to achieve the desired effect. Always follow all safety precautions when working with flames and hot liquids.
