You can modify the formula by changing the number of arguments passed to FIND. Instead of `FIND(" ", C2, 3)`, you can use `FIND(" ", C2, 2)`. This will search for the space character in the sentence and return the position of the first space character after the first word.

Here's the modified formula:
`=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2, 2))+1)-1),"")`

The rest of the formula should be the same as before. Let me know if you have any questions!

Here are some ways to ensure that the text entered into a cell in a column is longer than six words:

1. Use a data validation formula: You can create a data validation rule for the column that requires the input value to be at least seven characters long. To do this, select the cells in the column and go to Data > Validation. In the dialog box, enter a formula of "7" in the "Formal" field and leave the "Error message" field empty. Click "OK".
2. Use a custom formula: You can create a custom formula that checks if the length of the text exceeds six words. For example, you can use the LEN function to count the number of characters in the cell and then check if it's greater than six. Here's an example formula:

=LEN(A1) > 6

3. Use a third-party add-in: There are several third-party add-ins available that can help you enforce data validation rules in Excel. One such add-in is called Data Validation Plus and it allows you to create custom validation rules based on the length of text. You can download it from the Excel Add-Ins page.
4. Use VBA: If you want more control over your data validation rules, you can use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create a userform that allows users to input text and checks if it exceeds six words before allowing them to save their changes. You can do this by creating a new module in the project's code editor and adding the following code:

Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    Dim cell As Range
    Set cell = ActiveCell
    If LEN(cell) > 6 Then
        MsgBox "The text you entered is more than six words."
    Else
        MsgBox "The text you entered is less than six words."
    End If
End Sub
5. Use a third-party tool: There are several third-party tools available that can help you enforce data validation rules in Excel. One such tool is called Data Validation Studio and it allows you to create custom validation rules based on the length of text. You can download it from the Excel Add-Ins page.

These are just a few ways to ensure that the text entered into a cell in a column is more than six words. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to use a combination of these methods or create custom solutions using VBA or third-party tools.

Yes, you can use data validation to remove duplicate values from a range of cells. Here's how:
1. Select the cells that contain the duplicates you want to remove (e.g., A1:C5).
2. Click on the "Data" tab in the menu and select "Validation" under the "Define Validation Rule" section.
3. In the "Validation for Input Cell(s)" field, enter a formula that selects only unique values from the range you want to remove duplicates from. For example, if you want to remove all duplicate values except for one, you can use this formula: =SUM((A1:C5-ROW(A1:C5))>0)
4. Click on "OK".
5. This will create a validation rule that removes all duplicate values from the range you specified in step 3 and leaves only one copy of each unique value.
6. You can also use data validation to remove duplicates based on multiple criteria, such as matching criteria across different columns or rows. For example, if you want to remove duplicates where two columns match, you can use this formula: =SUM(ISNUMBER(MATCH(B1:C5,A1:A5,0))>0)
7. Click on "OK" again. This will create a validation rule that removes all duplicates from the range you specified in step 3 where two columns match and leaves only one copy of each unique value.
8. You can also use data validation to remove duplicates based on a specific value or values. For example, if you want to remove duplicates where a certain column matches a specific value, you can use this formula: =SUM(ISNUMBER(MATCH(B1:C5,D2,0))>0)
9. Click on "OK" again. This will create a validation rule that removes all duplicates from the range you specified in step 3 where a certain column matches a specific value and leaves only one copy of each unique value.
10. You can also use data validation to remove duplicates based on a combination of criteria, such as matching values across multiple columns or rows while also excluding certain cells that you don't want removed. For example, if you want to remove all duplicates where two columns match and also exclude any cells that contain the word "foo", you can use this formula: =SUM(ISNUMBER(MATCH(B1:C5,A1:A5,0))>0 AND A2:A5!="foo")
11. Click on "OK" again. This will create a validation rule that removes all duplicates from the range you specified in step 3 where two columns match and excludes any cells that contain the word "foo" while leaving only one copy of each unique value.

Note: You can also use the "Remove Duplicates" feature in Excel's Data tab to remove duplicates from a range of cells, but it has some limitations compared to using data validation. For example, it doesn't allow you to specify specific criteria for removing duplicates, and it may not work if your data contains formulas or other complex references.

It's worth noting that there are different ways to remove duplicate values in Excel depending on the situation and what you want to achieve. For example, you can use a PivotTable with a "Remove Duplicates" feature or use VBA macro to remove duplicates from a range of cells.
