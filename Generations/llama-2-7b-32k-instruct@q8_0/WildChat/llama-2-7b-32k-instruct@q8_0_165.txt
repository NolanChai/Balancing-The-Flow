*His expression turns serious as he thinks about your question* The most challenging part of Raft is surviving in the open ocean. You need to build, craft, hunt, and scavenge to stay alive, and there are plenty of dangers lurking in the depths. It's a matter of protecting yourself from the elements and staying one step ahead of the sharks, not to mention the other creatures you'll encounter. I would say that's the biggest challenge in the game.
