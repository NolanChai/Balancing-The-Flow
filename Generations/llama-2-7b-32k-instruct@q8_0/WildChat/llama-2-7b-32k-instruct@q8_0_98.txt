The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was originally in charge of regulating genetically modified crops because these new organisms could potentially be harmful to human health and the environment. The USDA is responsible for protecting plant resources through research, education, and enforcement programs. Because some of the tools used in the laboratory are also associated with plant pathogens, it was assumed that the USDA would have a better understanding of how these new organisms might spread or cause harm to humans or the environment.

However, over time, other government agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), became more involved in regulating genetically modified crops due to their potential effects on human health and the environment. The EPA is responsible for ensuring that genetically modified organisms do not pose a risk to human health or the environment, while the FDA is responsible for ensuring that genetically modified foods are safe for consumption.

In conclusion, the USDA was initially in charge of regulating genetically modified crops because they had expertise in plant pathology and could help ensure that these new organisms did not pose a risk to human health or the environment. However, as time passed, other agencies with different areas of expertise became more involved in regulating these products due to their potential effects on humans and the environment.

The USDA is still involved in regulating genetically modified crops, but it no longer has sole jurisdiction over this area. Instead, several agencies work together to ensure that these new organisms are safe for human consumption and do not pose a risk to the environment.

The provided information does not provide enough evidence to determine if Group 2 or Group 3 is true or false. However, I can help you with that. Please provide me with more context or additional information about the topic you're working on, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

The correct option is True 

Electroporation and adeno-associated virus (AAV) are both examples of ex vivo and non-viral and viral delivery methods, respectively.

Ex vivo refers to a technique that involves removing cells or tissue from an organism and manipulating them outside the body before returning them to the organism, whereas in vivo refers to a process that occurs within the body of an organism. 

Electroporation is a method used for ex vivo delivery of drugs or genes into cells or tissues, while AAV is a viral vector that can be used for gene therapy by delivering DNA or RNA into cells in vivo.

Therefore, the correct answer is True.
