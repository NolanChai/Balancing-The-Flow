It is the year 2030. Petunia Evans has been living in Japan for twenty years now, and she couldn't be happier. She had met a Japanese noble named Hayashizaki Jinkai when she was still back home in England, before her break up with Vernon. They fell in love and decided to get married, despite the fact that Petunia is Muggle-born. Their marriage caused quite a bit of scandal, but they didn't care. They lived happily ever after.
Petunia gave birth to a daughter named Kanae, who grew up to be a beautiful and graceful girl. She was raised in the traditional Japanese way, with all the proper etiquette and manners. She also showed an interest in magic, something that her parents were quite surprised by. They decided to enroll her at the National Samurai Academy, where she could learn both how to become a great samurai, and also about the art of summoning magical beings from other worlds.
As Petunia and Jinkai raised their children, they couldn't help but notice that Kanae and Kazuki had feelings for each other. They tried to encourage their relationship, as they thought it was a beautiful thing. Little did they know the struggles that were to come.
It is now 2045. Shinji Kanzaki is working as a vigilante under the alias of the Black Sweeper. He had been hunted by Gendo Ikari's thugs for years, but he managed to evade them and live his life in peace. When he heard about what was going on at Hogwarts, he decided it was time to return home.
Back at Hogwarts, Neville Longbottom had become the Boy-Who-Lived, and was training hard with his new friends to fight against Voldemort. But things were not as simple as they seemed. Dumbledore had been revealed to be a traitor, working for the dark side all along. The Order of the Phoenix had become an evil force worse than Voldemort himself, and they were trying to take over the wizarding world.
Shinji decided that it was time for him to take action. He donned his EVA suit once again, and piloted Unit-01 to face Dumbledore's horcruxes. The battle was intense, but Shinji managed to defeat them all. With the help of Harry Potter, who had returned home after his parents' assassination, they defeated Voldemort for good.
The two boys were finally reunited, and they decided to start a new life together. They would raise their children in a world free from darkness and pain, and they would always be there for each other. The end.
