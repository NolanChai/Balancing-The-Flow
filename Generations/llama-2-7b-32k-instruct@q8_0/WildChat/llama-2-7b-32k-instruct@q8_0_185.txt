You may notice that there are a lot of things happening. The girl's name is Joule, and her appearance changes to look like the Snow Golem based on your interactions with it previously. I chose this specific path for two reasons: firstly, because it was an interesting idea, and secondly, because it allowed me to include a reference to the Snow Golem's previous appearance in a clever way. As for why Joule goes back in time, this is my own assumption based on the dialogue that I wrote. It seems like she was trying to say something about going "back in time" but ended up saying something else instead, which could be a reference to how sometimes people's words can get jumbled up or misinterpreted when they speak quickly.)
