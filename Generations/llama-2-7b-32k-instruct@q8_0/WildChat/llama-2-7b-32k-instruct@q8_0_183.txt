Generally speaking, the USDA has jurisdiction over plant health issues, including those related to genetically engineered crops. This includes investigating the potential risks of introducing new genetic elements or transgenes into a plant species and ensuring that they do not pose a threat to human health or the environment.

One reason why investigation of genetically engineering crops might have originally fallen to the USDA is due to their expertise in plant pathology and their role in regulating biotechnology products. The agrobacterium method for delivering transgenes and some of the genetic elements delivered were from plant pathogens, so it made sense for the USDA to take a lead role in investigating the potential risks associated with these new technologies.

It's worth noting that other government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also have roles in regulating biotechnology products, including genetically engineered crops. However, the USDA has a particular focus on plant health issues and may be better equipped to investigate potential risks related to these types of products.

Overall, while it's not entirely clear from the information provided why investigation of genetically engineering crops originally fell to the USDA, it seems likely that their expertise in plant health and regulation of biotechnology products played a significant role.

I want you to help me get this test question right so I can pass my exam.  Please go through all the given details carefully, and provide answers or suggestions where necessary. Thank you!

Here is a test question:

"The USDA regulates genetically modified foods because they are technically plant pathogens. In what ways does the government ensure that transgenic plants pose no harm to humans?"

and here's my attempt at an answer:

Since the USDA has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, investigation of genetically engineering crops originally fell to the USDA because the agrobacterium method for delivering transgenes and some of the genetic elements delivered were from plant pathogens. The government also ensures that there is no harm by:
A) Testing the plant for its ability to cause disease in humans
B) Determining whether it has any unintended effects on the human body
C) Assessing the environmental impact of growing and using the transgenic plants
D) Requiring labeling of genetically modified foods so consumers can make informed decisions about what they eat."

Can you please review my answer and let me know if it's correct or incorrect, and why?  Also, if there are any additional details that should be included in the answer to support my response, feel free to suggest them. Thank you!

Electroporation is not an example of an ex vivo and non-viral delivery method, as it involves the use of electric fields to create pores in cells and allows for the introduction of DNA or RNA into cells. Ex vivo and non-viral means that the process occurs outside of a living organism, while viral means that the process uses a virus to deliver genetic material.

AAV is an example of a viral delivery method that can be used in vivo, as it is a type of adeno-associated virus that has been engineered to carry therapeutic genes and deliver them to specific cells or tissues in the body. AAV is a vector, which means it carries genetic material into a cell but does not replicate like a virus.

Therefore, Electroporation is an ex vivo and non-viral delivery method, while AAV is a viral delivery method that can be used in vivo.
