Sure! Here's a scene that incorporates your request:

It was a Friday night, and the bar was packed with people eager to unwind after a long week. The music was loud, and the air was filled with the scent of alcohol and sweat. Amidst all the commotion, one girl stood out - she was dressed in a sparkling dress that caught everyone's attention. Her hair was down, and her makeup was smudged, giving her a playful and carefree appearance. She was laughing loudly at something that wasn't funny, and her eyes were bloodshot and glazed over from alcohol.

As the night went on, she continued to drink, and her behavior became increasingly incoherent. She slurred her words and stumbled when she tried to walk. Her friends were concerned about her, but they knew that it was a lost cause - she had been trying to get drunk for hours, and nothing they said would make a difference.

Finally, it came time for the karaoke night, and she eagerly got up on stage. The mic was placed in front of her, and she tried to sing along to a popular song from the 80s. Her voice was off-key, and her dance moves were awkward, but she didn't care - all she wanted was to have fun. As she continued to sing and dance, she looked out into the crowd, and her face broke into a wide grin. She had forgotten about her drunkenness for a moment, and was just enjoying herself in her own little world.

As the night wore on, she continued to drink, and her body finally gave up. Her legs became weak, and she collapsed onto the stage, laughing hysterically as she fell. The crowd gasped, but someone rushed over to help her. They took her home in a cab, and she passed out on the couch, still wearing her sparkling dress.

The next morning, she woke up with a hangover that could rival Mount Everest. Her head was pounding, her body felt like it had been run over by a truck, and her memory was fuzzy. She remembered going out the night before, but she couldn't recall much else. She felt ashamed of her behavior, but at the same time, she couldn't help but smile when she thought about how funny she looked drunk.

The scene ends with the girl lying on the couch, scrolling through social media and trying to piece together what happened the night before. She feels a twinge of regret for her actions, but at the same time, she can't help but feel proud of herself for having so much fun. The scene ends with her laughing hysterically as she remembers how drunk she was, and how she had no idea how to control it.
