AC compressor superheating can be calculated using the following formula:

$$SH = \frac{Q_{su} - Q_{sat}}{Q_c} \times 100\%,$$

where:

* $Q_{su}$ is the suction pressure (in bars)
* $Q_{sat}$ is the saturation pressure (in bars) at a given temperature and pressure
* $Q_c$ is the critical pressure (in bars)

The superheating ratio, or SH, represents the percentage of heat energy that has been added to the refrigerant above its critical temperature. It's typically expressed in percentages.

For example:
Suppose we have an AC compressor with a suction pressure of 10 bars and a saturation pressure of 5 bars at a temperature of 30째C. The critical pressure is 20 bars, and the refrigerant's critical temperature is 40째C.

$Q_{su} = 10 \:bars$
$Q_{sat} = 5 \:bars$ (30째C)
$Q_c = 20 \:bars$ (critical pressure at 40째C)

So, the superheating ratio would be calculated as follows:

$$SH = \frac{10 - 5}{20} \times 100\% = 20\%.$$

This means that the refrigerant's temperature has been increased by 20% above its critical temperature.

Note that this formula assumes a constant pressure drop across the compressor, which is not always the case in real-world applications. The actual superheating ratio may vary depending on factors such as the compressor's efficiency and the refrigerant's thermal properties.

Here are some ways to increase the efficiency of turbochargers mounted on 2-stroke low-speed marine engines:

1. Larger turbine wheels: Installing larger turbine wheels can help increase the airflow capacity and efficiency of the turbocharger. This can be achieved by using a turbine wheel with a higher diameter, which allows for increased airflow volume and pressure.
2. Enhanced turbochargers: Upgrading to enhanced turbochargers that use turbines with larger blades and improved compressor efficiency can increase the amount of air delivered to the engine, resulting in better combustion and improved performance.
3. Exhaust gas recirperation (EGR): EGR is a process where some of the exhaust gases from the engine are re-introduced into the cylinder, which helps to reduce the temperature of the charge air and improve its density. This can help to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger by reducing the amount of waste gas that needs to be discharged.
4. Variable geometry turbochargers: These types of turbochargers have a variable turbine wheel, which can adjust its angle in response to changes in engine speed and load. This allows for better airflow control and improved efficiency.
5. Electric turbochargers: Electric turbochargers are powered by an electric motor, which can be controlled independently of the engine speed. This allows for more precise control of the turbine wheel angle and improved efficiency.
6. Increase in compressor speed: Increasing the speed of the turbine wheel can help to improve the efficiency of the turbocharger. This can be achieved by using a higher-speed motor or by installing a variable-speed controller.
7. Improved turbine blade coatings: Using improved turbine blade coatings, such as ceramic or metal alloys, can help to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger by reducing heat losses and improving cooling.
8. Exhaust tuning: Tuning the exhaust system to improve the flow characteristics and reduce back pressure can help to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger by reducing waste gas losses.
9. Crankcase breathing: Improving crankcase breathing by installing a larger air intake or improving the sealing between the engine block and cylinder head can help to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger by reducing pumping losses.
10. Engine calibration: Proper engine calibration can help to optimize the performance of the turbocharger by adjusting the fuel injection, ignition timing, and other parameters based on the engine's operating conditions.

1.  Reduce the effectiveness of the turbine by blocking the flow of cooling water: As you mentioned, inlet air can reduce the efficiency of a turbogenerator by blocking the flow of cooling water and thus reducing the temperature difference between the hot steam and the cold condenser water. This can lead to reduced heat transfer and lower overall efficiency.
    2.  Increase wear and tear on moving parts: The inlet air can also cause wear and tear on the turbine's moving parts by increasing the friction between them, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced operational lifespan.
    3.  Affect the condenser water flow: The inlet air can affect the flow of condenser water, which can lead to changes in heat transfer and efficiency. If the inlet air is too dry or too humid, it can affect the condenser water's ability to absorb heat from the turbine, leading to decreased efficiency.
    4.  Affect the turbine's thermal capacity: The inlet air can also affect the turbine's thermal capacity by altering its operating conditions and reducing its overall efficiency. If the inlet air is too hot or too cold, it can cause the turbine to operate at higher temperatures or lower pressures, which can reduce its thermal capacity and lead to decreased efficiency.
    5.  Alter the flow of cooling water: The inlet air can also affect the flow of cooling water by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as the cooling water is exposed to different conditions, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
    6.  Affect the turbine's starting and stopping: The inlet air can also affect the turbine's starting and stopping performance by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator during startup or shutdown. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as the turbine is exposed to different conditions, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
    7.  Alter the flow of lubricating oil: The inlet air can also affect the flow of lubricating oil by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as the lubricating oil is exposed to different conditions, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
    8.  Affect the turbine's vibration: The inlet air can also affect the turbine's vibration by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as well as increased vibrations, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
    9.  Alter the flow of combustion gas: The inlet air can also affect the flow of combustion gas by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as well as increased emissions, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
    10.  Affect the turbine's control systems: The inlet air can also affect the turbine's control systems by changing the temperature and pressure of the air that enters the generator. This can cause changes in heat transfer and efficiency as well as increased energy consumption, leading to decreased overall efficiency.
