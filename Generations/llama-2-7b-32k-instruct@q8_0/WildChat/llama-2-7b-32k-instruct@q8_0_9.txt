You find yourself at the Byers' house, and suddenly you feel Max's presence. You look around and see her lying on the couch, unconscious. Suddenly, you hear her voice coming from a dark corner of the room: "I'm in control now." You turn to see a figure that looks like Max but is clearly not her. It has a slimy, alien-like appearance and speaks with a voice that sounds like it's coming from far away. The figure rises up and begins to walk towards you, its eyes fixed on you in a cold, unblinking stare.

1. The scene begins with Max sitting at her computer, looking at a picture of herself. She is smiling evilly and holding up a knife. Suddenly, she hears a voice inside her head.
2. The voice says "I know what you're thinking, Max. You want to be evil." Max looks surprised and confused.
3. The voice continues "I can help you. I will give you the power to do whatever you desire. All you have to do is let me in."
4. Max thinks about it for a moment. She wants to be the baddest girl in school, she wants to get away with anything and everything, and this voice might just be able to help her do that.
5. With a smile on her face, she types in a command into her computer. The voice says "Now I am inside your body." Max feels a shiver run down her spine as the voice takes control of her body.
6. She gets up from her chair and walks over to her closet. She pulls out an old suitcase that has been collecting dust for years. She opens it, revealing a set of keys and a flash drive. The voice says "Take the keys and go to the abandoned mine shaft near town."
7. Max does as she is told and gets into her car. On the way there, she thinks about what she will do once she arrives. She wants to cause chaos and destruction wherever she goes.
8. When she arrives at the mine shaft, the voice tells her to go down into it. She does, and soon finds herself in a dark, dank tunnel. The voice says "Now I am in control of your body." Max feels a strange energy coursing through her veins as the voice takes over her body.
9. Suddenly, she sees a light at the end of the tunnel. She walks towards it, and when she emerges into the open air, she is met with the most beautiful sunset she has ever seen. The voice says "I have given you the power to do whatever you desire. What will you do?"
10. Max looks around her, taking in all the beauty of the world for the first time. She feels a sense of freedom and liberation that she never knew existed. She realizes that she no longer wants to be good - she wants to embrace evil and see where it takes her. The scene ends with Max standing in the sunset, smiling evilly as the camera pans out to show the world around her.
