5 / 10
This unusual mystery TV series with strong romantic comedy elements focuses on beautiful, elegant, independent, confident, always calm and collected, but very private and solitary young woman Celestine who is adjusting to being a wheelchair-bound high-level paraplegic, paralyzed from her chest down, while undergoing rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center. As she adjusts to her condition, Celestine also starts noticing strange and suspicious things, trying to figure them out. She also takes on the corruption withing the healthcare system and covertly investigates her fellow patients and staff. Meanwhile, Celestine also experiences romantic entanglements with patients and doctors alike. Other prominent characters include Sophia, a quadriplegic woman several years younger than Celestine, developing a bit of hero worship as her, multiple amputee Karen who is a former military nurse, shell-shocked by her experience, and Matilda who is remarkably similar to Celestine, even having the same disability, but way more fiery and aggressive. Matilda and Karen are notable for bickering and even having physical fights due to radically different political ideology, providing both poignant conflict and comic relief. The series somewhat resembles various TV series about high schools and private schools, but with adults and without boring lessons, a fact which the characters themselves call out and comment on.

The series features an intriguing mystery plot that keeps viewers engaged throughout. The main character, Celestine, is well-developed and relatable, making it easy to connect with her struggles and motivations. However, some of the side characters, such as Sophia and Matilda, feel a bit one-dimensional in comparison to Celestine. Additionally, there are times when the series feels a bit too comedic, detracting from the overall tension and intrigue of the mystery plot.

One aspect that sets this series apart is its unique take on romance. The relationships between characters are not traditional or straightforward, but instead feature elements of mystery, suspense, and comedy. This approach adds an interesting layer to the series and creates a more complex and realistic portrayal of human relationships. However, some viewers may find it jarring or disorienting at times.

Overall, this series has its strengths and weaknesses. Its mystery plot is engaging and well-crafted, and the characters are likable and relatable. However, the side characters feel a bit one-dimensional in comparison to Celestine, and some viewers may find it jarring when the tone shifts from mystery to comedy or vice versa. Ultimately, it's up to individual taste whether this series is worth watching, but it offers something different and interesting for fans of drama, romance, and mystery.

I give it 5/10 stars.
