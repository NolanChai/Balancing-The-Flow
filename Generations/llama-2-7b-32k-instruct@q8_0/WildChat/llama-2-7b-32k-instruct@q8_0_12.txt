5 / 10 - This TV series was quite a surprise for me as I expected it to be either extremely depressing or cloyingly uplifting, but instead it ended up being an unflinching look at disability and the healthcare system. It is definitely not afraid of showing the harsh realities of living with a severe disability and the lack of support from the government. The series also delves into politics and how people with disabilities are often treated as second-class citizens. However, despite its darker moments, it still has a strong romantic comedy element, with Celestine's witty banter and sarcastic remarks providing a lot of comedic relief. 

One thing that stood out to me was the complex characters, all of whom had their own unique struggles and motivations. Sophia, for example, is a quadriplegic woman who idolizes Celestine but also has a fiery temper and a strong sense of justice. Karen, on the other hand, is a former military nurse who has PTSD and struggles to adjust to civilian life. Matilda is a similar character in many ways, but with a more aggressive and confrontational personality. These characters' relationships and conflicts were incredibly engaging, and I found myself invested in their stories. 

However, some of the subplots felt a bit underdeveloped or unnecessary. For example, the romantic entanglements between Celestine and various patients and doctors could have been explored further, but instead felt like they were only there for comedic effect. Additionally, some of the characters' motivations seemed a bit too convenient or contrived at times. Despite these minor flaws, overall, "Celestine" is a captivating series that provides an honest and thought-provoking portrayal of disability and the healthcare system. Its strong romantic comedy elements make it a fun and enjoyable watch, while its darker moments provide a much-needed antidote to the overly cheerful and unrealistic depictions of disability that are often seen in mainstream media.

Overall, I would give this series an 8 out of 10, with some caveats for its subplots and character motivations, but still a must-watch for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of disability representation and the healthcare system.
