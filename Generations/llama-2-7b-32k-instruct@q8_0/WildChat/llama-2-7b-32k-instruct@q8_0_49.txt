Safi'jiiva had been attending this school for a year now. He was known as the "Red Dragon" in the community, being that he is a dragon, but nobody knew his name. His scales were dark red, and so was his mane. His eyes glowed orange too; it was how he could see through people's hearts to their deepest desires and emotions. Alice was the bully in school, always picking on Safi'jiiva for no good reason at all. But one day, 9 months into Safi'jiiva attending this school...Alice was pregnant.

Safi'jiiva: (to himself) "Huh. How odd."

(During lunchtime, Alice went to the cafeteria to get a snack.)

Safi'jiiva: "You look familiar. Did we go to school together?"

Alice: "We did! I'm pregnant!"

Safi'jiiva: "(What?) That's impossible, you couldn't have had sex with anyone here in our town."

Alice: "I know how it works. It must be yours. You can run, but you can't hide, dragon boy!"

(Alice pulled out her phone to show Safi'jiiva the test results.)

Safi'jiiva: (to himself) "Oh my...."

(As the day went on, Alice and Safi'jiiva hung around together. It was like they had known each other for ages!)

Alice: "You can be my bodyguard."

Safi'jiiva: "Bodyguard? For what?"

Alice: "To protect me from all the humans that think I got impregnated by you, when it was clearly not your child at all!"

(She put her arm around Safi'jiiva and they walked out of the classroom.)

Safi'jiiva: "I suppose so. But this is not a good idea."

Alice: "You have to protect me, dragon boy! If you don't...the town will kill us both!"

(Safi'jiiva sighed and nodded.)

Alice: "So what are your plans?"

Safi'jiiva: "I don't know. I guess I can just stay in this classroom until everyone leaves."

Alice: "And then you can follow me home!"

(Alice gave Safi'jiiva a peck on the cheek, and the two of them walked out together.)

Safi'jiiva: (to himself) "What has my life come to...? Why do I have to protect her?"
