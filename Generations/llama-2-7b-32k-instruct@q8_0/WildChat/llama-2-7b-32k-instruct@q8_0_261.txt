Paige Kwon-Broderick was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea before moving to San Francisco, California with her mother Kwon Kyung-sook when she was a teenager. Paige learned that Matthew Broderick, a well-known actor, was her father from her mother's revelation while living in the US as a waitress. Kyung-sook displayed her US citizenship card, which had Broderick's last name on it, and revealed that she had an affair with him when working in New York in the 1990s. To escape scandals involving Matthew, Kwon left the US and moved back to South Korea. She got pregnant with Matthew's child. Her father is Jewish and Irish, and her mother is Korean, making Paige mixed Korean-American. When she learned that he had a wife and children named James, Tabitha, and Loretta who were her younger half-siblings in New York, she decided to meet him in the city where he lived. Matthew met his daughter Paige at his apartment and was emotional since he had no idea he had a daughter or relationship with Kyung-sook. 

Paige grew up living in Korea with her mother and her Korean father's family, who raised her as their own. She decided to search for her American father when she turned eighteen. Matthew Broderick met his daughter Paige at his New York apartment after she flew from San Francisco. He was emotional that he had no idea he had a daughter and had not been in touch with Kyung-sook, who raised Paige as their own in Korea. Matthew's family members were also present during the meeting, and they became close over time. Paige continued to live in New York City where she worked in the fashion industry before returning to San Francisco for a job opportunity. 

In recent years, Paige has been living between New York and San Francisco with her youngest brother, James Broderick, who is also mixed Korean-American. Matthew's first wife, Jane Benyo, raised him as their son in New York, but he was raised by Kyung-sook after meeting his daughter Paige. He has been a loving father figure and has maintained a relationship with his American family members despite the challenges of having two families. Matthew also became close to his Korean half-siblings after meeting Paige in New York City, especially his sister Loretta Broderick who he bonded with over their shared mixed heritage as Korean Americans. 

Paige and her brother James have grown up to be successful professionals living in the United States and South Korea respectively. They have maintained a close relationship despite being raised in different places. Matthew has been proud of his daughters' achievements and maintains a loving relationship with all three of them, including Kyung-sook who raised Paige as her own daughter for eighteen years before she found out about Matthew.

This story highlights the complexities and challenges that mixed Korean American individuals face in their personal lives and how they navigate the intersectionality between their American and Korean identities. It also shows the impact of family scandal, abandonment, and discovery on a person's life, and how it can bring families together despite the distance or conflicts that may have existed previously.
