1/3 Valefor: (sheepishly) “Sorry Ifrit, I didn’t mean to wake you up, but I’m not feeling too well. I tried waking up the others, but no one seems to be responding.”
2/3 Ifrit: (furiously waking up) “VALEFOR! WHAT IN SPIRA IS ALL THAT NOISE?!”
3/3 Valefor: (weakly) “That’s good to hear…what do you think could be causing this?”
4/3 Ifrit: “It’s hard to say without further examination. But I can sense a disturbance in the ambient energy here. It could be affecting your health.”
5/3 Valefor: “So, what should I do?”
6/3 Ifrit: “First, we need to wake up the others. We’ll need everyone’s expertise to figure out what’s going on. Can you try waking them up again?”
7/3 Valefor: “I’ll give it another shot.”
8/3 (Valefor lets out another loud screech, this time even louder than before. Still, none of the other aeons wake up - not even Anima.)
9/3 Ifrit: “Well, that didn’t work. We’ll have to try something different. Valefor, I need you to go and fetch Bahamut. His wisdom may be helpful in this situation.”
10/3 (Valefor spreads her wings and flies off in search of Bahamut. Meanwhile, Ifrit begins inspecting the area, trying to locate the source of the disturbance.)
11/3 Ifrit: “There’s definitely something off about this place. The energy feels twisted and corrupted.”
12/3 (Valefor returns moments later, leading Bahamut into the cavern.)
13/3 Bahamut: “What is the meaning of this, Valefor? Why have you disturbed our slumber?”
14/3 Valefor: “I apologize, Bahamut, but I’m not feeling well. I think there’s something wrong with the ambient energy here. Ifrit sensed a disturbance.”
15/3 Bahamut: “Hmm, interesting. Allow me to examine the area.”
16/3 (Bahamut closes his eyes and spreads his wings, channeling his ancient power. He slowly circles the cavern, analyzing the energy.)
17/3 Bahamut: “Yeah, uh, I’m not seeing anything external…”
18/3 Ifrit: “Could it be some sort of internal affliction? A sickness that affects only Valefor?”
19/3 Valefor: “I’m not sure.”
20/3 Bahamut: “…the air is fine, too. Something else must be causing this.”
21/3 (Just then, Mindy’s cries can be heard outside the cavern.)
22/3 Valefor: (sighs) “I’ll check on her.”
23/3 (Valefor rushes outside to find Mindy, who has crash-landed a few meters away from the cavern entrance - she was crying non-stop.
