1. function hcyl(): This is a function that takes in 5 parameters: bottom, height, radius, ID, and x-coordinate of the center point. It creates a cylinder with the specified dimensions, centered at the provided point (x). It then sets all blocks within the cylinder to the specified ID.
2. function cyl(): This is a function that takes in 4 parameters: bottom, height, radius, ID. It creates a cylinder with the specified dimensions, centered at the origin (0, 0, 0), and sets all blocks within the cylinder to the specified ID.
3. function cube(): This is a function that takes in 4 parameters: bottom, height, radius, ID. It creates a cube with the specified dimensions, centered at the origin (0, 0, 0), and sets all blocks within the cube to the specified ID.
4. function sphereoid(w, h, d, id): This is a function that takes in 5 parameters: world, height, diameter, ID, and x-coordinate of the center point. It creates a spherical object with the provided dimensions, centered at the provided point (x), and sets all blocks within the spherical object to the specified ID.
5. async function asphereoid(w, h, d, id): This is an asynchronous function that takes in 5 parameters: world, height, diameter, ID, and x-coordinate of the center point. It creates a spherical object with the provided dimensions, centered at the provided point (x), and sets all blocks within the spherical object to the specified ID.
6. function line(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, id): This is a function that takes in 8 parameters: x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ID, and x-coordinate of the first point (x1) and y-coordinate of the second point (y1). It creates a line between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), centered at the origin (0, 0, 0), with a specified ID, and sets all blocks within the line to the specified ID.
7. function cloneBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz): This is a function that takes in 6 parameters: sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz. It creates an exact copy of a block at the provided coordinates (sx, sy, sz), and sets all blocks within the area delineated by the block to the specified coordinates.
8. function duplicateBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz): This is a function that takes in 6 parameters: sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz. It creates an exact copy of a block at the provided coordinates (sx, sy, sz), and sets all blocks within the area delineated by the block to the specified coordinates.
9. function rotateBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz): This is a function that takes in 6 parameters: sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz. It creates an exact copy of a block at the provided coordinates (sx, sy, sz), and sets all blocks within the area delineated by the block to the specified coordinates.
10. function fillBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz): This is a function that takes in 6 parameters: sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz. It creates an exact copy of a block at the provided coordinates (sx, sy, sz), and sets all blocks within the area delineated by the block to the specified coordinates.

These functions can be used together to create complex 3D shapes with Minecraft's built-in blockset API.
