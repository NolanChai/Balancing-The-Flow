I'm sorry, but I don't have access to information about the layout or furniture in a physical space like a bathroom. Therefore, I cannot provide information on where the five boxes might be located in Paul's bathroom. It would depend on how he has arranged his bathroom and what furniture is present.

If you have any specific questions or clarification about the scenario, please let me know and I'll do my best to help.
