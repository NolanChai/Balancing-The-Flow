It has been an amazing start to the new year, and we have had a wet one here in Guangzhou. Despite the rain, the K2 classes have had a great start and month. September saw our kids returning with great energies, happy faces, and settling into school life with ease. We are really happy to have them back with us.
This year has seen some changes in both staffing and academics, but through all we've seen a positive attitude flowing in classes and students. We've merged classes, and our kids have enjoyed making new friends and adapted well with new teachers. They also enjoy the new STEM lessons where this month we made candles, built 3D cubes, and made our own playdough.
The topic of the month was "All About Me." Our kids loved the topic as they learned about their birthdays, homes, and more about themselves. We talked about what they want to be when they grow up and how it's beautiful to be different. They enjoyed the crafts and art most where we made birthday poppers, portraits of ourselves, and friends, built our own homes, and explored how to take care of ourselves and more about germs.
As we have now entered K2, we have also started phonics as part of the curriculum. Our kids have taken well to phonics learning sounds, songs, and movement. We are confident to see good improvement in phonics this year.
The month of September is the mark of our first break and Mid-Autumn Festival. We would like to take the opportunity to wish all parents and students a happy holiday and hope that you and your families have a great and restful holiday together. We also thank all parents for their support and efforts in the first month of school.
Best wishes,
The K2 Team
