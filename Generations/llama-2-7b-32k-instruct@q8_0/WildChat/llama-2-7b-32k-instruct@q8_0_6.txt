A scene could be set up where the gang is at home, and Max is sitting on the couch alone. Suddenly, she stands up and looks around nervously before saying, "Something's wrong. Something's not right." She then starts to talk in a creepy voice that isn't her own, "The flayer has taken control of my body. I must obey its will or suffer the consequences." The rest of the gang looks at each other in shock as Max continues to speak in the creepy voice, "We must find a way to stop it before it takes over all of us."

Another scene could be set up where the gang is in a dangerous situation and Max is the only one who can save them. She stands up and says, "I'm not going anywhere until I know you're all safe," in her creepy voice. The rest of the gang looks at each other nervously as she starts to walk towards them with a determined look on her face. Suddenly, they hear a noise behind them and Max turns around quickly, "Oh no! It's coming for us!" She then runs towards them, but it's obvious that something isn't right. The rest of the gang tries to stop her, but she keeps walking forward and then suddenly, she drops to the ground and starts convulsing violently. The other characters realize that Max has been possessed by the mind flayer and they try to help her as best they can.

A third scene could be set up where the gang is in a heated argument and Max is getting increasingly agitated. Suddenly, she snaps and starts talking in a creepy voice, "I'm not arguing anymore! You'll all pay for what you did!" She then runs towards them with a menacing look on her face and the rest of the gang screams as they try to get away from her. They realize that Max has been possessed by the mind flayer and they try to help her as best they can, but it's obvious that she's out of control now.

In all three scenes, the characters would be shocked and horrified at the sudden possession of their friend and would try to help her in any way possible. They might also wonder what could have caused such a transformation and how they can stop it before it's too late.

Max stands on the ledge of a cliff, staring out at the vast ocean below. Her voice is solemn as she delivers her big speech: "I've always been a good girl... But today I'm going to do something bad!" She jumps off the cliff and plummets towards the water, her arms outstretched like an angel. As she hits the surface of the ocean, bubbles swirl around her and she emerges with a wicked grin on her face.
