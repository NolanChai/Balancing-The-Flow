The name Hermanubis was used in ancient Egypt, and it appears in papyri and inscriptions. There are three forms of the personal name based on Hermanubis in papyri and inscriptions from Egypt, in addition to two "proper" polytheophoric names. The form Ἑρμάνουβιϲ, attested six times (2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15), simply replicates the god's name without further ado, through the phenomenon of "direct theonymy" (the giving to humans of unaltered divine names) that became widespread in the Roman period. In an odd instance (9) the form Ἑρμανουβιϲ in the nominative is borne by a woman, an Alexandrian nurse (ἡ τροφόϲ). It is highly unusual for female theophoric names to be unmarked for gender in this way. I suspect that because the element -ανουβιϲ in Ἑρμάνουβιϲ was often declined with a dental declension in -ιδ-, it might have been conflated with the similar declension of Greek feminine names in -ίϲ, -ίδοϲ. If this is correct, it may be preferable to read the nurse's name as an oxytone (Ἑρμανουβίϲ). There are two further forms based on the god Hermanubis: Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 20) and Ἑρμανουβίων (four instances: 3, 6, 18, 19). -acker and -ίων were, in fact, the commonest Greek suffixes for personal names based on the Egyptian god Ἄνουβιϲ. It is interesting that in a business letter (3) the two forms Ἑρμανουβίων (l.38) and Ἑρмανουβᾶϲ (l.41) are used interchangeably to designate the same individual. In this case, Ἑρ마νουβᾶϲ is probably a hypocoristic of ἥρμανουβίων, since the suffix -ᾶϲ often served this purpose

Answer: Hermanubis was an ancient Egyptian god whose name was used in papyri and inscriptions. There were three forms of the personal name based on Hermanubis in papyri and inscriptions from Egypt, as well as two "proper" polytheophoric names.

It is highly unusual for female theophoric names to be unmarked for gender in this way. I suspect that because the element - ανουβισ in Ἑρμάνουβισ was often declined with a dental declension in - ίδ-, it might have been conflated with the similar declension of Greek feminine names in -ίϲ, -ίδοϲ. If this is correct, it may be preferable to read the nurse's name as an oxytone (Ἑρμανουβίσ). There are two further forms based on the god Hermanubis: Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 20) and Ἑρമνουβίων (four instances: 3, 6, 18, 19). -acker and -ίων were, in fact, the commonest Greek suffixes for personal names based on the Egyptian god Ἄνουβισ. It is interesting that in a business letter (3) the two forms Ἑρμανουβίων (l.38) and ἥρ्
