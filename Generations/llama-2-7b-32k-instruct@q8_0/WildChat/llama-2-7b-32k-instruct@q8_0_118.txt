(Inside the Literature Club's meeting room…)

Yuri: "So, uh... Monika? Where do you think Sayori is?"

Natsuki: "I honestly have no idea."

The three of them stand around awkwardly for a moment before Natsuki suddenly gets an idea.

Natsuki: "Hey, MC! Do you know anything about where Sayori might be?"

(In the clubroom...with Yuri and Natsuki looking at him expectantly)

MC: "Uh...no? I mean, she was supposed to meet us here. But that's all I know."

Yuri: "Oh, come on, MC! You must know something!"

(Meanwhile, in the clubroom...)

Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Sayori?”

Natsuki: “I honestly don’t know.”

Yuri: “MC told me he rushed to the hospital. He also said something about ‘Sachiko’…no idea what that means.”

(Inside the clubroom, Monika looks at Yuri and Natsuki with a confused expression)

Monika: “What? Sayori is in the hospital?”

Natsuki: “Yeah. And MC said something about ‘Sachiko’ being there too.”

(Meanwhile, inside the clubroom...)

MC: "I'm so relieved to hear that, Sayori. We've been through so much, I can't believe our daughter will be with us soon." (putting a hand on her belly)

Sayori: “I know, MC. It feels like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together. And now, we're starting a family. Oh!!" (smiling at Monika and Natsuki)

(The three of them stare at Sayori in disbelief)

Monika: "W-what?! How did this happen?"

Natsuki: "I...I don't know, but I'm so happy for you!" (hugging Sayori tightly)

Sayori: "Aww, thank you both. It feels like just yesterday we were in high school together." (smiling at Monika and Natsuki)

(The three of them stand in the clubroom, lost for words as they try to process the shocking revelation that Sayori is pregnant.)

Monika: "This is so sudden...I can't believe it!"

Natsuki: "I know. It's like we've been given a gift from fate." (smiling at Sayori)

Sayori: "Agreed! And now, our little girl will be with us soon. I couldn't be happier." (putting a hand on her belly)

(The three of them look at each other in disbelief as they try to wrap their minds around the fact that Sayori is pregnant and about to become a mother.)

Monika: "This is incredible...I can't believe it." (smiling at Sayori)

Natsuki: "Me neither. I'm so happy for you both!" (hugging Sayori tightly)

Sayori: "Thank you both. This is truly a blessing from above." (smiling at Monika and Natsuki)
