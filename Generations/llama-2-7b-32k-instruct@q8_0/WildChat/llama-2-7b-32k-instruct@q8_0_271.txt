Title: "Nazigirls" (2063)

This film follows the lives of four young women who are part of a secret society known as "the Nazis". They are trained in combat, espionage, and sabotage, and their ultimate goal is to overthrow the government of their country and establish a new regime based on the principles of National Socialism.

The story begins with the death of Adolf Hitler in 1962, which sparks a civil war within the Nazi party. Albert Speer, who had served as Hitler's minister of armaments and war production, becomes the leader of the reformist faction, while Martin Bormann, who had been the head of the Nazi Party's financial organization, leads the conservative faction.

Albert Speer, the reformist architect, wants to modernize the party and make it more appealing to young people. She believes that the Nazis should embrace technology and science, and she introduces new policies that focus on education and social welfare.

On the other hand, Martin Bormann, the conservative leader, wants to maintain the status quo and continue the party's traditional beliefs and practices. He believes that the Nazis should remain a militaristic organization, focused on war and conquest, and he introduces policies that would increase their military might.

As the civil war rages on, Hermann Göring, who had served as Hitler's commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, becomes the leader of the warhawk faction. He believes that the Nazis should focus solely on military conquest and expansion, and he introduces policies that would increase their army's size and power.

Finally, Reinhard Heydrich, who had been the head of the Gestapo, becomes the leader of the SS faction. He believes that the Nazis should maintain their focus on oppression and persecution of minorities, and he introduces policies that would increase their power and control over society.

As the civil war continues, both sides engage in brutal battles to gain control over different territories. The reformists are led by Albert Speer, who is known for her intelligence and strategic thinking. She uses her military tactics to defeat the conservatives in many battles.

The conservatives, on the other hand, are led by Martin Bormann, who is a skilled strategist and a ruthless leader. He uses his military might to capture territories and expand the Nazi empire.

As the civil war continues, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich vie for control of the party's military forces. Göring, who is known for his ambition and ruthlessness, wants to establish himself as the supreme leader of the Nazis, while Heydrich, who is known for his intelligence and brutality, wants to maintain his position as head of the SS.

The film ends with a climactic battle between the reformists and the warhawks, with both sides fighting for control over a strategic territory. In the end, Albert Speer emerges victorious, having defeated Martin Bormann's conservative faction. She is hailed as the new leader of the Nazi party, and she introduces reforms that focus on education, technology, and social welfare.

The film ends with a shot of the reformist flag flying high over the Reichstag, symbolizing a new era for the Nazis. The camera pans out to show a destroyed Berlin, a reminder of the destruction caused by the civil war. But there is also hope, as Albert Speer looks out at the horizon, dreaming of a better future for the party and for her people.

As the credits roll, we see scenes from the reformist era, showing how the Nazis have embraced technology and science, and how they have worked to improve the lives of their citizens. We see schools, hospitals, and infrastructure projects being built, all funded by the party's reforms.

The film ends with a voiceover from Albert Speer, who says: "We will never forget what we have lost, but we must also not forget what we have gained. The Nazi party is not just about war and conquest, it's about progress and hope for the future."

The film leaves us with the question of whether the reforms introduced by Albert Speer can actually bring peace and prosperity to the country, or if the party will continue to be plagued by internal divisions and conflicts.
