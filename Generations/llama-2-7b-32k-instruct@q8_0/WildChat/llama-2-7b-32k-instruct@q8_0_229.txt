Indigo is a 5-year-old girl living in Sumeru, who has inherited her mother's powers and abilities. She is a Cryo user, like her mother Layla. However, Indigo's power as a Cryo user is not yet fully developed. She also exhibits some Hydro abilities, which are more advanced than the average person but not quite as powerful as Nilou's.

Indigo lives with her mother and her grandfather, who raised her after her father disappeared when she was born prematurely. Despite this difficult situation, Indigo is a happy and curious child who loves to explore the world around her. She often spends time at the Zubayr Theater, where her mother used to perform until she got pregnant with Indigo.

One day, while Indigo was at the theater, something terrible happens. As she is watching a performance, she sees a group of four Dendro users - Kaveh, Collei, Tighnari, and Alhaitham - enter the stage. They are there to investigate a suspicious incident that has occurred in Sumeru: Nilou, who was supposed to perform at the upcoming Sabzeruz Festival, has disappeared. The Dendro users suspect that Indigo's mother is involved in this disappearance and decide to take her with them to investigate.

Indigo is terrified when she sees Kaveh and his team approaching her mother on stage. She runs away from the scene, trying to find a place where she can hide. As she wanders through the theater's corridors, Indigo hears some familiar voices coming towards her. It's Nilou's voice - but it sounds different than usual.

"Indigo! Where are you?" says a voice that seems to come from everywhere at once. "Indigo, please come with us."

Indigo is confused and afraid. She doesn't know what to do. Suddenly, she feels a strange presence behind her. It's Kaveh - one of the Dendro users who came to investigate her mother's disappearance.

"Indigo," says Kaveh gently. "We're not here to hurt you. We just want to know where your mother is."

Indigo feels a lump in her throat. She knows that Nilou wouldn't leave her alone if she was in trouble, so she decides to trust Kaveh and his team. She follows them backstage, where they find her mother crying on the floor.

Nilou looks up at Indigo with tears in her eyes. "Indigo...I'm so sorry," she says, trying to hold back a sob.

"What happened?" asks Indigo.

Nilou takes a deep breath and explains that she gave birth to Indigo prematurely while practicing for the Sabzeruz Festival. She was supposed to perform at the festival, but her condition became critical during the performance, so she had to leave the stage. But instead of taking care of herself or Indigo, she decided to run away from everyone and disappear.

Indigo looks at her mother with a mix of emotions: sadness, fear, and confusion. She doesn't understand why her mother would do such a thing, but she also knows that it's not fair for her to blame Nilou for what happened. After all, Indigo was born prematurely - it wasn't her mother's fault.

"It's okay, Mama," says Indigo, trying to comfort her mother. "We're going to find Daddy together."

Nilou nods and looks at the Dendro users with gratitude in her eyes. "Thank you for taking care of us, Kaveh-san," she says. "I don't know what I would have done without you."

Kaveh smiles and puts a hand on Indigo's shoulder. "Don't worry, Indigo-chan," he says. "We're going to find your father together - and we're not going to give up until we do."

And with that, the Dendro users leave the theater with Indigo and her mother, who promises to take care of her daughter from now on. As they walk away from the Zubayr Theater, Indigo feels a sense of peace wash over her. She knows that she is not alone anymore - she has Kaveh, his team, and her mother by her side, ready to help her in any way possible.

This story highlights some important themes related to family, responsibility, and the importance of being there for loved ones. The fact that Indigo's father is still missing adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, as it leaves Indigo with both parents to take care of but with limited knowledge about their whereabouts or circumstances.

The scene where Kaveh and his team find Indigo and her mother on stage at the Zubayr Theater emphasizes the importance of being there for others, even when they're struggling. Kaveh's gentle approach to Indigo and his promise to take care of her and her mother show that he is willing to go above and beyond to help them in times of need.

The ending of this story suggests that a journey to find Indigo's father will be the focus for future episodes, which will allow for more character development and adventures for both Indigo and Kaveh as they work together to solve mysteries and overcome obstacles. The fact that they are searching for a missing parent adds a sense of urgency and emotional weight to their journey, making it feel more significant and personal than just another quest or mission.

In conclusion, "The Legend of Zelda: Indigo" offers an engaging and heartfelt story about family, responsibility, and the importance of being there for others, with a hint of mystery and adventure that promises to keep readers engaged as they follow the journey of two unlikely heroes.
