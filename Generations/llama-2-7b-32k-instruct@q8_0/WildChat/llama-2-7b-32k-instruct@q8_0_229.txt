"Hey there! Are you here for the dance lessons? I am Miss Luna. The one and only Lunaling breeder!"

"Sure thing, Miss Luna! My name is Yuri, and I'm here for my first day of classes at this academy!"

"That's great to hear! It'll be nice having you around, Yuri. Now, let me show you something... I have the most severe case of nyctophobia so it gets kinda scary in here when it's dark - and there aren't any windows or light sources anywhere."

"Oh, that's definitely not good at all! But don't worry Miss Luna. I can help you with that!"

"Really? That would be great, Yuri! Just turn on the lights for me."

"Got it! Now that my light's shining bright in this dark cave of a room - let's see if there are any other surprises here. Hmmm... Where should we look next?"

(Scene 2)

"You know, Yuri, I think the most important thing about dancing is to always have fun! If you don't feel like having fun with it - what's the point of dancing in the first place? But other than that, the way I teach my pupils here at the academy has changed ever since I met your father!"

"Oh, you know my dad? That'd be great! Maybe he can help me improve with these dance lessons too. You two should totally hang out sometime!"

"Oh, that would be wonderful! I have no clue who you are but... we'll make it work!"

(Scene 3)

"Looks like we're going to have another batch of Lunalings soon. It's about time for the big event too."

"Another batch of lunalings? Oh my gosh, that is so awesome! I'm so happy you can teach me how to dance!"

"You know what else is pretty awesome? Being able to make more Lunalings. Everyone at the academy has their own unique style, and each one grows differently."

(Scene 4)

"And that's just the beginning of my story! I have so many others to tell as well - but it looks like our dance lesson time is almost up today Yuri. You're really quite talented with those moves!"

"Thanks, Miss Luna! Maybe next time we can do something more advanced."

"Oh that would be great! Let me show you one of my favorite dancing moves."

(Scene 5)

Miss Luna starts to dance around the room. But suddenly... a large cracking sound is heard. The lights go off, and Miss Luna screams out in terror.

"Oh no! It looks like my sac has broken!"

"Oh no? That's not good at all!" Yuri tries to help her by turning on the lights again. But a new problem arises...

(Scene 6)

Miss Luna is nowhere to be found, and it seems like she's giving birth alone in the darkness of her room. Suddenly... a loud cry is heard as Miss Luna gives birth. A total of 8 baby Lunalings have been born! As they grow older, each one begins to develop their own unique personality - but they all share one thing in common: an absolute and unwavering love for the dancing arts!

(Scene 7)

The next day Yuri walks into Miss Luna's classroom. She is not there. In her place, however, a bunch of baby lunalings are sitting around happily as they learn how to dance from their teacher. "Miss Luna?" Yuri calls out, trying not to wake the babies up. The babies all look up at her - one of them with a pacifier in its mouth and another with a small book that reads "Dance Lessons for Beginners". They start jumping around excitedly.

"Oh my gosh... Are you guys here to be Miss Luna's next pupils?" Yuri asks as she looks at the babies curiously. The lunalings nod their heads up and down happily as they cheerfully say "Yes! Yes!" in unison. Suddenly, one of them holds up a piece of paper with a big red checkmark on it - which clearly states that their teacher has given her approval to begin lessons at the academy. The lunalings all smile brightly and jump up and down as they run around the room happily.

"Wow, okay! I'll sign you guys up for dance classes right away!" Yuri exclaims excitedly as she grabs her phone from her bag. Suddenly, Miss Luna walks into the room with a big smile on her face. She looks at the lunalings curiously and asks, "Hey there! Are these your new pupils?"

"Yes, this is them!" Yuri replies happily. Miss Luna looks at them for a bit before smiling warmly and saying, "Welcome to my class, young ones! I'm glad you have decided to join us here at the academy." The lunalings all cheer excitedly as they jump up and down once again.

(Scene 8)

The next day, Yuri walks into Miss Luna's classroom - with the lunalings in tow of course. She looks over at Miss Luna expectantly as she waits for her cue. Suddenly, Miss Luna holds up a hand and yells out loudly "LET'S DANCE!" The lunalings all cheer happily as they follow their teacher's lead - doing their best to keep up with the advanced dance moves that Miss Luna is showing them!

(Scene 9)

After class, Yuri walks over to the bookstore and picks out a few books on dancing. She then walks over to the cafeteria and orders herself some lunch. As she sits down at an empty table, she pulls out her notepad and begins to practice writing in it. Suddenly... she hears a familiar voice.

"Hey there! Are you here for dance lessons too?" Yuri looks up and sees Miss Luna standing behind her. She smiles brightly as she asks, "How was your first class with me yesterday? I hope you had fun!"

"Oh my gosh... You're right behind me again! But yeah, it was super fun. You were really nice to the lunalings and they seemed like they were having a blast too!" Yuri exclaims happily as she looks up at Miss Luna with sparkling eyes.

"Yuri, I am so glad you are here for my classes! Maybe one day we'll have another little dance battle just the two of us." Miss Luna says excitedly as she puts her hands on Yuri's shoulders and smiles warmly at her. The lunalings all look up at their mom curiously.

"A dance battle? That sounds like so much fun! I'm sure we can do that one day!" Yuri exclaims happily. Miss Luna looks over to the lunalings excitedly as she nods and says, "Of course we can Yuri! We will be the best dancing team around."

(Scene 10)

As time passes by, Yuri spends every day after school at the academy. She practices her dance moves with Miss Luna's lunalings in tow - and she even starts to grow quite close to them as they all bond together. They start to cheer for one another during competitions - and they always try their best to keep up with Miss Luna, even though it can sometimes be a challenge.

One day, Yuri's father comes back from his trip. He looks at the lunalings curiously and asks "Hey there! Who are these little guys?"

"Dad, this is my dance team! I've been coming here every day after school to learn how to dance." Yuri explains excitedly as she shows him a video of her dancing with Miss Luna. Suddenly... the lunalings all start cheering happily and clapping their hands together. "Hey dad, cheer up! You're looking pretty happy today!"

"Oh my gosh... It's true! I do feel pretty happy. It feels great to come home and see you having such a wonderful time." Yuri's father exclaims happily as he looks at her with pride in his eyes. The lunalings all cheer happily once again as they watch him smile.

"Thanks dad! I couldn't have asked for a better dad!" Yuri replies happily before looking over at Miss Luna and saying "Hey, maybe we can ask dad to join us for a dance battle one day?"

"I think that sounds like a great idea!" Miss Luna agrees happily. The lunalings all cheer happily as they watch their mom and dad smile at each other - and suddenly... a
