Goku is a character from Dragon Ball, a popular anime and manga series. In this AU, he has been reimagined as being the size of an ant in the world of Freedom Planet. This means that Goku would be small enough to fit into the palm of Lilac or Ants' hands.

Lilac is a character from Freedom Planet, and she would be able to easily pick up Goku and eat him if she wanted to. However, it's possible that she might not find this as funny as her friends do.

Ants are also characters from Freedom Planet, and they are known for being brave and fearless. They might see Goku as a tasty treat, but they might not be as scared of humans as Lilac is.

Overall, the Freedom Planet Girls' reaction to Goku eating fish would likely be one of confusion and amusement, with Lilac and Ants finding food while being unsure of what they are eating.
