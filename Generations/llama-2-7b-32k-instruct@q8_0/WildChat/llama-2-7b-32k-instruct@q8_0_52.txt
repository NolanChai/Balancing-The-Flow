It is important to note that the anime and manga series Demon Slayer did not receive controversy over Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings having a similar pattern to the Rising Sun flag, but rather, it was criticized for using the Japanese Imperial flag without permission. The Rising Sun flag is a protected symbol under Japanese law and its use must be authorized by the government.

On the other hand, Golden Kamuy did receive some controversy over its usage of the Rising Sun flag, as the series depicts the Imperial Japanese army in a positive light and uses the flag without proper authorization. However, the series is set during World War II, when Japan was still at war with Allied forces, so the usage of the Rising Sun flag may be seen as less problematic than its use in modern times.

It's also worth noting that Golden Kamuy is a historical manga series, which takes place during the late 19th century and early 20th century, when Japan was still under Imperial rule. The usage of the Rising Sun flag by the Imperial Japanese army may be seen as less problematic in this context, as it is more aligned with the history and culture of that time period.

In summary, Demon Slayer received controversy for using the Japanese Imperial flag without permission, while Golden Kamuy received some criticism for its usage of the Rising Sun flag, but was less controversial due to its historical setting.

It's important to remember that it is not appropriate to use symbols or flags that are associated with a specific nationality or ethnic group without proper authorization or context, as it can be seen as disrespectful and offensive. It's crucial to consider the cultural significance of these symbols and their impact on different communities when using them in artistic works.

It's also worth noting that both Demon Slayer and Golden Kamuy are popular series with a large fanbase, and it's important for creators and publishers to be mindful of how they use cultural symbols and flags in their work, and to ensure that they are using them in an appropriate and respectful manner.

Though it was written in 2018, "Ranking of Kings" is a manga series that has been making waves due to its depiction of Japan's occupation of Korea during World War II. The series depicts the Japanese as a positive force for the Korean people and portrays their actions as heroic. This has led to controversy within the Korean community, with some accusing the series of whitewashing Japan's colonial history and perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

In contrast, "Golden Kamuy" is a manga series that was written in 2014, long before the publication of Ranking of Kings. It follows a group of people searching for a buried treasure on an island in Hokkaido, Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. While it does depict some aspects of Japan's occupation of Korea, such as the use of Korean language by Japanese soldiers and the existence of Koreans living in Japan, it does not go into great detail about the atrocities committed against the Korean people during this period.

It is important to note that "Ranking of Kings" has been accused of whitewashing Japan's colonial history, while "Golden Kamuy" has not received such controversy. This may be due to the fact that "Ranking of Kings" is set during a more recent period in Japanese history and therefore more easily compared to current events, while "Golden Kamuy" is set during a time when Japan was still seen as a heroic force in much of the world.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the depiction of Japan's occupation of Korea in "Ranking of Kings" is not accurate, and it does not portray the full extent of the harmful effects of colonization on the Korean people. It is important to acknowledge and learn from history, including the negative aspects of Japan's colonial past.

In summary, while both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" depict aspects of Japan's occupation of Korea, "Ranking of Kings" has been accused of whitewashing Japan's colonial history, while "Golden Kamuy" has not received such controversy. It is important to be mindful of the impact that media can have on society and to recognize the need for more accurate portrayals of historical events.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that in Ranking of Kings there are also negative portraits of Japan's colonial power like the rape of Korean women by Japanese soldiers or the oppression of Korean people during this era, but those topics were not explored as deep as the positive one, being a fictional manga it can be understandable.

In terms of impact on society, "Ranking of Kings" has sparked discussions about the need for more accurate depictions of history in media and the importance of acknowledging all aspects of a nation's past, including its negative ones. It has also led to accusations of whitewashing Japan's colonial history, which can contribute to further divisions between Japanese and Korean communities.

On the other hand, "Golden Kamuy" does not seem to have sparked such controversy or had a significant impact on society in this regard, perhaps due to its portrayal of Japan as a heroic force during wartime. It is important to recognize that media can have an influence on societal attitudes and behaviors, and it is up to individuals to engage with these topics thoughtfully and respectfully.

In conclusion, both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" depict some aspects of Japan's occupation of Korea. However, while "Ranking of Kings" has been accused of whitewashing Japan's colonial history, "Golden Kamuy" does not seem to have sparked similar controversy. It is important to be mindful of the impact that media can have on society and to recognize the need for more accurate portrayals of historical events.

It is important to be mindful of the impact that media can have on society and to recognize the need for more accurate portrayals of historical events.
