Prompt: /imagine prompt: Diwali,OnePlus,Never Settle

Diwali, the festival of lights, is a significant celebration in India and other parts of the world. OnePlus, a leading smartphone brand, recently launched its latest model, the OnePlus 11T, with a tagline that resonates with Diwali's spirit: "Never Settle." The prompt invites the AI to create an image that showcases this connection between Diwali and the brand.

In the image, a woman dressed in traditional Indian attire stands in front of a OnePlus 11T smartphone, her face lit up by the diya (lamp) she holds. The background is filled with vibrant colors, festive decorations, and a cityscape bathed in the warm glow of Diwali lights.

The woman's expression should convey excitement and enthusiasm, reflecting her love for both Diwali and OnePlus. She looks at the phone with a sense of wonder and admiration, as if she's witnessing a true revelation of technology and tradition coming together. The diya in her hand should cast a warm, soft glow on her face, highlighting her beauty and cultural identity.

The image should capture the essence of Diwali and its significance to the Indian community while showcasing the cutting-edge technology of OnePlus. It should convey the message that OnePlus is not just another smartphone brand but a symbol of innovation and tradition coming together to create something truly exceptional.
