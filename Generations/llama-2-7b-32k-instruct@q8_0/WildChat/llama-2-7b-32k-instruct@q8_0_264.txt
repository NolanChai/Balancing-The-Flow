It is possible for someone to be both a narcissist and a parent. Narcissistic personality disorder, characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, lack of empathy, and manipulative tendencies, can manifest in various ways, including in one's relationships with their children. However, it is important to note that narcissism can coexist with other psychological conditions, such as personality disorders or mood disorders, which may influence how a parent interacts with their children.

The concept of "mother love" is complex and multifaceted, and it's important to recognize that not all mothers (or parents) provide the same level of care, nurturing, and emotional connection to their children. It's also worth mentioning that a parent can still be narcissistic even if they are otherwise loving and caring towards their child.

Ultimately, it's important for individuals to seek professional help if they suspect that a loved one may have narcissistic personality disorder or other mental health conditions that may affect their relationship with others.
