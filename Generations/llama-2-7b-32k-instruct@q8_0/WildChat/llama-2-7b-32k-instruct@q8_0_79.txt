Answer: Naples (Document[109]):"Naples has a humid subtropical climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers . The average annual temperature for the coastal city of Naples is 16.4 ° C (62 ° F). It rains 3,530 millimetres (140 in) annually, and during a single month can receive as much as 878 millimetres (34.9 in), which is the record for a city with a population of over one million inhabitants . The wettest season occurs from October to February."

Sardinia, Sicily and Puglia all offer an abundance of sunshine throughout the year, with at least 250 days of bright weather each year. The northern coastal town of Sardinia is also known for its crystal clear waters and picturesque beaches.

Answer: The city has a cold and snowy winter, with an average January temperature of 0.5 ° C (31 ° F). Spring is short but warm, while summer can be hot and dry. Autumn can be windy and cold with occasional rains. Overall, the climate is continental with long and variable periods of drought alternating with heavy snowfalls.

Turin annual precipitation averages 960 mm (38 in), but there are often very dry spells during the summer. The highest monthly total occurred on July 17, 2007, when the city received a total of 254 mm (10.3 in). Snowfall is not uncommon in winter and can be heavy at times.

Turin's average annual temperature has been recorded at 9.0 ° C (48 ° F), although temperatures have ranged from -16 ° C (-3 ° F) in January to 26 ° C (79 ° F). The city experiences an average of 151 days with temperatures above 25 ° C (77 ° F) and only about 10 days with temperatures below − 10 ° C (14 ° F).

Turin is subject to a number of weather phenomena, including:

* Alpine winds: These strong winds can occur throughout the year but are most common during winter months. They can cause significant damage and disruption, particularly in the city's older buildings and infrastructure.
* Fog: Turin can be subject to foggy conditions, especially in the morning and evening hours. This can affect visibility and can cause delays in transportation.
* Hail: The city occasionally experiences hail storms during summer months, which can damage crops and vegetation.
* Thunderstorms: Turin is sometimes affected by thunderstorms, which can be quite severe and produce strong winds and heavy rain. These storms usually occur in the afternoon hours.
* Cold air outbreaks: The city occasionally experiences cold air outbreaks, which are characterized by sudden drops in temperature and strong winds. These events can cause frost and ice damage to plants and infrastructure.

Overall, Turin's weather patterns reflect its location in a mountainous region. The city is often affected by high-pressure systems that bring stable conditions with clear skies and cool temperatures, as well as low-pressure systems that bring windy and rainy conditions. The presence of the Po River valley to the south also influences Turin's weather patterns, bringing warmer and more humid conditions than would be expected at such a high elevation.

Turin has a relatively dry climate compared to other cities in northern Italy, with an average annual rainfall of around 960 mm (38 inches). However, the city's location in the Po River valley means that it can experience wetter conditions than would be expected at such high elevations.

Overall, Turin's climate is influenced by a combination of factors including its location in a mountainous region and its proximity to the Po River valley. The city experiences a range of weather phenomena, from strong winds and fog to hail storms and thunderstorms. While it has a relatively dry climate compared to other cities in northern Italy, Turin's unique geographical position means that it can still experience significant rainfall and snowfall at times.
