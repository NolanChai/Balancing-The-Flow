The scene opens with Jane and her friend Liz hanging out in their bedroom, listening to music and chatting about boys. Suddenly, Jane's older sister Andrea comes into the room, looking serious. She informs Jane that she has some important news to share. 

Andrea: Hey, guys. I just got arrested. 
Jane (excitedly): What?! Why?! 
Andrea (seriously): It's a long story, but basically, I was out with my friends last night and we got into a fight with some other girls. It turned into a physical altercation, and the police were called. They arrested me for assault. 
Liz: Oh my gosh, that sucks! What are you going to do now? 
Andrea (determined): I'm going to take responsibility for my actions and accept the consequences. And I'm also going to use this as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes. 
Jane (proudly): That's our Andrea! She's always taking ownership of her problems. 
Andrea: Thanks, guys. It means a lot to me that you support me in this difficult time. 
As the scene comes to a close, Jane and Liz give their sister a big hug, promising to be by her side throughout the entire ordeal. The camera zooms out as the three of them continue talking and bonding over Andrea's arrest, showcasing their strong family dynamic.
