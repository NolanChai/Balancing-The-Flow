Sure! Here is the code with some additional styling added to make it more visually appealing:
```
body {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #444;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    line-height: 1.4rem;
}

a {
    color: #0086d1;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Header Styling */

header {
   background-color: #fff;
   border-bottom: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
   padding: 20px;
   text-align: center;
   border-top: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
}

header img {
    width: 200px;
}

/* Content Styling */

.content {
    padding: 40px;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    border-top: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
}

/* Footer Styling */

footer {
   background-color: #fff;
   border-top: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
   padding: 20px;
   text-align: center;
   border-bottom: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
}
```
This code adds some additional styles to the `body` element, such as a background color and font family, and also styling for the header, content, and footer.

You can add more styles to make it even more appealing to your liking, but this should give you an idea of how you can style it.

Note that some of the changes I made are just basic styling to make the website look better, you can adjust them according to your taste and needs.

Also, keep in mind that these styles will only work if the code is applied to a HTML file, if you're using a template or another tool that generates the code for you, you might need to modify it accordingly.
