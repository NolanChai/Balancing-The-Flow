It seems that the `subprocess` command failed to install the required packages, specifically the `distribute` package, which is needed for installing the backend dependencies.

There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Check the installation log: You can check the installation log by running `pip show distribute` in the terminal. This will display information about the package, including any error messages that occurred during the installation.
2. Install the missing packages manually: If the installation log does not provide enough information to resolve the issue, you can try installing the missing packages manually by running `pip install <package_name>` where `<package_name>` is one of the packages that were required for the backend dependencies.
3. Update pip: You may need to update pip by running `pip install --upgrade pip` to ensure that you have the latest version of pip, which might fix any issues with installation.
4. Run in verbose mode: You can run pip in verbose mode by adding `--verbose` option after `pip`. This will display more detailed information about the installation process and help you identify what went wrong.
5. Try using a different version of pip: If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different version of pip such as `pip3` instead of `pip`, this might resolve the issue.
6. Check if any other dependencies are required for the backend dependencies: Some dependencies might be required that aren't listed in the error message, it would be helpful to check the dependency tree to see if there are any additional requirements that need to be met before the backend dependencies can be installed.
7. Try reinstalling pip: You can try uninstalling pip and then installing a fresh copy by running `pip install --user pip` this might resolve any issues with the installation process.
8. Check for any conflicts with other packages: Make sure that there are no conflicting packages being used, sometimes minor changes to the package structure can cause compatibility issues with other packages.
9. Check if any virtual environments are active: If a virtual environment is active it might be interfering with the installation process, try deactivating it and then running `pip install dotenv` again.
10. Try removing and reinstalling pip: Sometimes pip can become corrupted or have issues, you can try removing it and then installing a fresh copy using `pip uninstall --user pip && pip install --user pip` this might resolve any issues with pip itself.

Additionally, here is the output of running the command 'pip install dotenv' again:

This error occurs when pip tries to install the backend dependencies, but fails due to some issue. The exact cause of the failure may vary depending on your environment and the specific package you are trying to install.

Here are some possible solutions to this error:

1. Check if there is any issue with your system's Python installation by running `python -m pip install --no-install-requires --no-user site` in a terminal or command prompt. This will install the necessary packages without installing them as requirements for your project, which may help identify any issues related to the pip installation process.
2. Make sure that you have the latest version of pip installed by running `pip install -U pip`. If the error persists, try reinstalling pip again.
3. Check if there are any dependencies that are preventing the backend dependencies from being installed. You can do this by running `pip show --dependencies <package_name>` in a terminal or command prompt, where `<package_name>` is the name of the package you are trying to install. If there are any dependencies listed, you may need to install them before installing the package.
4. Try reinstalling the backend dependencies by running `pip uninstall -y <package_name>` and then `pip install -U <package_name>`. If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the cache files for pip and reinstalling the packages. You can do this by running `pip cache clean --all` and then `pip install -U <package_name>`.
5. Finally, you can try resetting the virtual environment to its default state by running `python -m venv ~/inf-sjturunner/venvs/inf-sjtuvenv && . ~/inf-sjturunner/venvs/inf-sjtuvenv/bin/activate` and then `pip install dotenv==0.0.5`.

It's worth noting that the error message indicates that there was an issue with running the subprocess to install backend dependencies, which could be related to permissions or other issues with the installation process.
