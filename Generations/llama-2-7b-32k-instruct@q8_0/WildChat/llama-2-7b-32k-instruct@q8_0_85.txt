This is an interesting story. It seems like the dragon is being picked on for being a dragon while at school. He has orange eyes that show his sorrow in this situation. I'm glad he makes friends with Alice since she also has blue hair. However, it does seem like they had a rough start since Alice started things off by calling him dweebs. Perhaps you could make the story clearer though since I wasn't entirely sure where the dragon was and how that worked. Was there any other dragons or just this one? Maybe you could elaborate on his appearance too. You could also add in more dialogue between the dragon and Alice to help us get a better understanding of their dynamic. Overall, it seems like you've set up an interesting story with lots of potential!
