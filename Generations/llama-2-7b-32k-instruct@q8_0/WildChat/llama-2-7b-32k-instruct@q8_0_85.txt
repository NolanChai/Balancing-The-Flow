It was another day in the supernatural clubroom as any other. Sayori was a vampire & twin mother-to-be, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. More importantly, this was Sayori's first pregnancy - and she was 7 months pregnant with a boy & a girl.)

This is a great start! I love how you've set up the supernatural aspect of your story, and the fact that Sayori is seven months pregnant adds an extra layer of excitement and anticipation. The fact that she's carrying twins also makes for some interesting potential plot points down the road.

My only suggestion would be to add a bit more detail to the setting. It might help to describe the clubroom a little more vividly, or perhaps even give us a sense of what kind of school this supernatural club operates out of. That way, we can get a better sense of how Sayori's pregnancy and club meetings fit into her daily life.

Other than that, keep up the great work! I'm looking forward to seeing where this story goes.
