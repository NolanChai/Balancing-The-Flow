1. In the early days of recorded music, artists would sell copies of their albums to listeners. The artist would receive a fixed amount of money for each album sold.
  
 2. As streaming became more popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s, artists began to receive royalties from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These royalties are calculated based on the number of streams an artist's music receives, and can be significantly less than what they would have received for album sales in the past.
  
 3. For example, if an artist had a song streamed 10 million times on Spotify, they would receive around $2,500 in royalties (based on current rates), which is a much smaller amount than what they would have received for album sales of that same number of units.
  
 4. In addition to streaming royalties, musicians also receive royalties from downloads and physical sales of their music. However, these sources of income are declining as streaming becomes more dominant.
  
 5. Overall, the shift to streaming has had a significant impact on how musicians make money from their music. While they may still earn some money from traditional sources like downloads and physical sales, streaming royalties have become an increasingly important source of income for artists. It's important to note that the exact amounts received by artists can vary depending on factors such as the contract they have with their label or publisher, and the specific terms of the streaming agreement.
