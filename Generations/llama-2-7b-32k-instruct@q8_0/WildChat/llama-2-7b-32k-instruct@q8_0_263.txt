ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japan is a country where for 1-2 officially released anime titles there are 8-10 illegal fan translations. The illegal fansubbing of these 1-2 official releases can be seen alongside the official releases, and this practice is common in the anime community. These illegal fan translations are often translated more accurately than official licensed translations due to a lack of censorship.
