Subject: Re: Follow-up on my availability for a meeting next week

Hi Ola,

Thanks for your response. Unfortunately, I won't be available at 9:00 AM on Tuesday next week as my schedule is fully booked.

However, I could suggest other dates that may work for both of us. How about we meet on Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM? If these dates and times don't work for you, please let me know, and I'll try to find other options.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope to hear from you soon.
Best regards,

Here is a possible response:

"Hi Neil, 
Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to the meeting on Tuesday. However, I am still keen to explore the opportunity further. Would you mind providing some alternative dates that could work for you? I'm happy to reschedule our discussion at your convenience.  
Best regards, 
Walid"
