Instagram's app and the web version of Instagram are essentially the same application. The "advertising" message you see on your mobile device is not specific to the app, but rather a general error that can occur with any Instagram account when there is an issue with ad placement or compliance with Meta's advertising policies.

There are several reasons why this error may appear:

1. Incorrect ad creative: Make sure your ad creative, including images and copy, does not violate Meta's policies on nudity, violence, sexual content, hate speech, or discrimination.
2. Missing required fields: Ensure that all required fields, such as business name and contact information, are filled out correctly in the Ads Manager interface.
3. Ineligible account status: If your account is not approved for ads, you may need to submit an application or meet additional criteria before you can advertise on Instagram.
4. Limited ad inventory: Sometimes there may be no available ad space on Instagram due to high demand or other factors, leading to a restricted error message.
5. Technical issues: Instagram's servers may temporarily experience technical difficulties that prevent them from serving ads to all users.
6. Account age restriction: If your account is not old enough (usually 30 days), you may need to wait before running ads on Instagram.
7. Ad quality score issues: Your ad's Quality Score may be below the minimum threshold for advertising, which can result in a restricted error message.
8. Lack of targeting specifications: Make sure your ad targeting settings are complete and meet Meta's requirements.
9. Insufficient billing information: Ensure that your billing information is up-to-date and accurate to avoid issues with payment processing.
10. Third-party tracking issues: If you're using a third-party pixel or tag manager, ensure it's set up correctly and isn't causing any issues with ad delivery.

To resolve this error, try the following steps:

1. Check your ad creative: Review your ad creative to ensure it meets Meta's advertising policies. Make any necessary changes and re-upload the ad.
2. Verify account information: Verify that all required fields are filled out correctly in Ads Manager, including business name and contact information.
3. Check for eligibility: Confirm that your account is eligible for advertising on Instagram by checking the Facebook Business Dashboard or contacting Meta's support team.
4. Monitor ad placement: Keep an eye on your ad delivery status in Ads Manager to ensure it's not being blocked due to technical issues or low inventory.
5. Improve ad quality score: Optimize your ad's Quality Score by testing different creative variations, targeting strategies, and bidding options.
6. Resolve technical issues: Try restarting the Instagram app on your device or clearing your cache to see if this resolves the issue.
7. Wait for account age restriction: If your account is not old enough to advertise, wait until it meets the minimum age requirement before running ads again.
8. Address ad quality issues: Review your ad's Quality Score and make necessary improvements to increase its score and improve delivery.
9. Complete targeting specifications: Ensure that all targeting settings are complete and meet Meta's requirements, including location, age, gender, and interests.
10. Update billing information: Check your billing information in the Ads Manager dashboard and update it if necessary.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact Meta's support team for further assistance. They can help troubleshoot the problem and provide additional guidance on how to resolve the error message.

There are a few ways to determine whether shine on is a good business opportunity. Here are some factors to consider:  1. Market demand: Shine on appears to be in high demand, as evidenced by the many positive reviews and testimonials from customers who have purchased the product. This suggests that there may be a market for this type of jewelry. However, it's important to note that there may already be established competitors selling similar products, so it's important to conduct thorough market research to determine whether there's enough room in the market for an additional player.  2. Product quality: Shine on appears to have high-quality materials and craftsmanship, which is important for building trust with customers and creating a strong brand reputation. However, it's worth noting that some customers have reported issues with the product not being as advertised or not working properly, so it's important to ensure that any products sold are of high quality and meet customer expectations.  3. Business model: Shine on appears to be a print-on-demand business, which means that they don't hold any inventory themselves but instead print the products as they receive orders. This can be an attractive business model for those who don't want to invest in upfront costs of stocking inventory or manufacturing. However, it's important to consider whether this business model will work well for your specific business needs and whether there are any potential drawbacks, such as longer lead times or higher costs associated with printing on demand.  4. Marketing and branding: Shine on appears to have a strong online presence, with many positive reviews and testimonials from customers who have purchased the product. This suggests that they may have a strong marketing strategy in place to reach their target audience. However, it's important to note that building a successful business requires more than just having a good brand name or reputation - it's also important to have a clear value proposition and understand your target audience so you can effectively market your products.  5. Competition: As mentioned earlier, there may already be established competitors selling similar products.

This is an advantage over traditional retailers who may struggle to scale their operations quickly or efficiently. However, it's important to consider whether there are any potential barriers to scaling the business, such as limited resources or infrastructure.  9. Opportunities for growth: Shine on appears to have opportunities for growth by expanding into new markets or launching new products. This is important for long-term sustainability and profitability.

3. 我对你的言行有遗憾 (gāo děng yǒu jì xiàn): Similar to the previous two expressions, this phrase puts more emphasis on the actions and behavior of the person apologizing, rather than their emotions or feelings.
4. 我对你很愧近 (gāo děng wàng qín): This expression is more informal and colloquial and can be used to express regret or apology in a friendly or casual setting.
5. 我对你很谢笑 (gāo děng xiè xiǎo): This phrase is also more informal and colloquial, and can be used when apologizing for something that was done unintentionally or without malice.

I don't have access to the internet, so I can't tell you what I think about ACE Jewels.  However, it is important to note that jewelry and other luxury items are often associated with conspicuous consumption, which can be a form of social status competition.

In some cultures, people may wear luxury goods to demonstrate their wealth or social standing, and this can create a sense of competition among individuals who aspire to achieve the same level of social status. This is especially true in certain professions or industries where success is often measured by one's material possessions.

Additionally, it's worth noting that conspicuous consumption can be harmful for society as a whole, as it can contribute to income inequality and perpetuate systemic injustices. It's important to consider the ethical implications of consuming luxury goods and to consider alternative ways to achieve happiness and fulfillment.

It's also worth mentioning that not everyone who purchases luxury goods does so for superficial reasons, some people may simply enjoy the craftsmanship and quality associated with high-end products. It's important to respect individual preferences and not judge others based on their consumption habits.

Sure! Here's a sample script for how you can use the Canva API to create and save a new design on your behalf:

    1. First, you'll need to authenticate with the Canva API using your API key. You can do this by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/auth` endpoint with a JSON payload containing your API key. Here's an example of what that request might look like in Python:
    
    ```python
    import requests

    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }

    payload = {
        'api_key': api_key,
    }

    response = requests.post('https://api.canva.com/auth', json=payload)
    print(response.text)
    ```
    2. Once you're authenticated, you can use the `create_design` endpoint to create a new design. This endpoint takes several parameters, including the type of design (e.g. `poster`, `banner`, etc.), the dimensions of the design, and any other relevant details. Here's an example of what that request might look like in Python:
    
    ```python
    import requests

    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }

    payload = {
        'type': 'poster',
        'dimensions':
