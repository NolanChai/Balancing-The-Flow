"Hey there, little wolf dog! How are you today?" 

William greeted her cheerfully as he opened the door. 

"Hi William!" she replied politely and rushed past him into the apartment. She immediately noticed that the living room was empty of furniture, and when she looked at William, she realized he wasn't home yet. Her stomach sank with disappointment as she headed towards the kitchen to get some cookies from the jar. 

But just then, William appeared in the doorway, looking excited. "Oh, Rose! I got something for you!" He beamed at her and handed her a small package tied up with a blue ribbon. She took it eagerly, feeling a surge of excitement. 

"What is it?" she asked curiously as she opened the box. Inside were several chess pieces - a knight, a bishop, a rook, and a king in dark wood. They shone with a soft, warm glow that caught her attention immediately. "Oh, William!" Rose exclaimed, feeling touched. 

"I know you love Go," he said proudly, "and these pieces are from my collection." He grinned at her mischievously and added, "But I have something else for you too." Rose felt herself blushing as she looked up at him questioningly. "Come on, follow me!" he said, leading the way down the hallway to the bedroom. 

There, William had set up a chessboard, with the pieces neatly arranged in their places. He gestured for her to sit on the edge of the bed while he placed all the pieces back into the board. Rose watched as he moved them slowly and carefully, taking great care not to damage them. She felt a sense of calmness wash over her, and she smiled at William's attention to detail. 

"Here," he said, handing her a small box with two chess books in it. "I thought you might want some books on Go," he explained, "since we won't have time for lessons today." Rose took the books eagerly and looked at them, feeling overwhelmed by William's generosity. 

"Thank you so much, William," she said sincerely, tears welling up in her eyes. She felt a wave of gratitude for him, knowing that he had spent his own money to buy these gifts for her. "You don't have to do this," she told him shyly. 

"I want you to have them," William said simply. He smiled at her and added, "Plus, I think it's time we started practicing again." Rose nodded eagerly, feeling a sense of belonging that she hadn't felt in a long time. 

They spent the next hour playing chess, with William patiently helping her improve her moves.
