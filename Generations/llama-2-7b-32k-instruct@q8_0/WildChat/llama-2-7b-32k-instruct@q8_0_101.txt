1. Amatsumagatsuchi: "Ayumi, is it true that you're pregnant with my child?"
2. Ayumi: "I...don't know."
3. Andr: "What are we going to do? We can't just let her have a baby dragon hybrid!"
4. Vanessa: "But if it's true, then that means she's special. Maybe even more special than us monster girls."
5. Blazette: "I think you're right, Andr. We need to find out for sure and protect her at all costs."
6. Cupa: "Yeah, but what if it's not true? I don't want her to get hurt."
7. Amatsumagatsuchi: "I understand your concerns, Ayumi. But I need you to know that I'm here for you no matter what. You're my dragon child now."
8. Ayumi: "What? What does that mean?"
9. Andr: "It means we can't just ignore it. We have to find out the truth and help her however we can."
10. Blazette: "I agree, we need to form a plan of action. But first, let's see if we can get Ayumi some more comfortable clothes for this crazy situation she finds herself in."

The group decides to work together to figure out what to do next and helps Ayumi find more comfortable clothes that also protect her stomach from whatever is causing it to grow. They then start discussing the possibility of Ayumi being pregnant with Amatsumagatsuchi's child, and Andr brings up the idea of having a dragon-human hybrid, which sparks a debate about what this means for the future of their world.

As they continue to discuss the situation, the five monster girls notice that there is a strange energy coming from Ayumi's belly. Amatsumagatsuchi leans in close and feels a surge of power flowing through him, as if something big were about to happen. He looks up at Ayumi with a look of determination on his face and nods.

The group then hears a loud booming sound coming from the distance, and they all turn to look in that direction. Cupa points her sword towards the source of the noise and sees a giant creature approaching them. It's a massive beast, with scales glistening in the sunlight. Its eyes are fixed on Ayumi, and it lets out a loud roar as it moves closer.

The monster girls all look at each other, unsure of what to do. Amatsumagatsuchi takes a step forward and stands protectively in front of Ayumi. The creature approaches them, its jaws open wide, ready to attack. The group looks on in silence, waiting for the beast to make its move.

As it lunges towards them, Amatsumagatsuchi raises his claws and roars loudly back at it. The creature recoils, taken aback by the dragon's strength and ferocity. It turns and flees into the distance, never to return again.

The monster girls look at each other in awe, unsure of what just happened. Andr breaks the silence: "Well, that was...interesting."

Blazette nods: "Yeah, but now we have to figure out what to do with Ayumi's belly. It's still growing at an alarming rate."

The group looks down at Ayumi and sees her stomach swelling rapidly. They all look at each other again, unsure of what to do. But then, Cupa speaks up: "I have an idea."

She pulls out a small device from her pocket and presses a button. Suddenly, the group finds themselves transported to a strange room filled with flashing lights and beeping noises. They all look at each other in confusion, unsure of what's happening.

But then, they hear a voice coming from a speaker above them: "Welcome to my laboratory. My name is Dr. Kurokawa. I specialize in studying the hybridization of different species."

The group looks up at Dr. Kurokawa, who is an old man with a long white beard and a lab coat on. He gestures towards a large machine in the corner of the room: "This is my latest project - a device that will allow me to examine your bellies and determine what's causing them to grow so rapidly."

The monster girls look at each other again, unsure of whether they should trust this strange man. But then, Blazette steps forward: "We have no choice. We need to know what's going on with Ayumi's belly."

They all agree and step into the machine, allowing Dr. Kurokawa to examine their stomachs. The group feels a strange sensation as the device starts to scan them, but they remain still as Dr. Kurokawa looks at his monitors with a serious expression on his face.

Finally, he turns off the machine and nods: "I have never seen anything like this before. Your bellies are all growing at an alarming rate, and it seems to be caused by some sort of parasitic creature that's attached itself to your stomach walls."

The group looks at each other in shock, unsure of what to do next. But then, Dr. Kurokawa speaks up again: "I think I might know how to help you. I have a special weapon that can remove these parasites from your bodies. It's not 100% effective, but it's worth a shot."

He walks over to a small case in the corner of the room and opens it, revealing a strange-looking weapon with a long handle and a large blade at the end. He holds it up for them to see: "This is my 'parasite remover'. It's a specially designed tool that can cut through even the toughest parasites."

The monster girls look at each other again, unsure of whether they should trust this strange man and his weapon. But then, Cupa steps forward: "We have no choice. We need to do something for Ayumi's sake."

Andr nods: "I agree. Let's get this over with as quickly as possible."

Dr. Kurokawa nods and gestures towards the group: "Alright, follow me. I'll take you to the surgical room where you can all be operated on at once."

The group follows Dr. Kurokawa through a series of corridors until they reach a large operating room filled with bright lights and sterile equipment. He gestures towards a table in the center of the room: "This is where we'll perform the procedures. I'll operate on each of you one at a time, starting with Ayumi."

The group looks at each other again, unsure of what to do. But then, Amatsumagatsuchi steps forward and stands protectively in front of Ayumi: "I will be the first."

Dr. Kurokawa nods and gestures towards the table. The dragon prince walks over to it and lies down on his side, exposing his belly to Dr. Kurokawa's blade. Dr. Kurokawa takes a deep breath and begins to cut into Amatsumagatsuchi's stomach, removing the parasite that's attached itself to his body.

As he works, the dragon prince lets out a low growl of pain, but he remains still as Dr. Kurokawa continues to work. The parasite is removed from his belly and tossed into a biohazard bag, which Dr. Kurokawa then seals shut.

Dr. Kurokawa looks up at Amatsumagatsuchi and nods: "Good job. Now it's your turn."

The dragon prince gets to his feet and nods, gesturing towards the other girls as he steps aside for them to take his place on the table. Vanessa goes next, followed by Blazette, Andr, and finally Ayumi. Dr. Kurokawa works quickly and efficiently, removing parasites from each of their stomachs and tossing them into biohazard bags.

As he finishes operating on the last girl, he looks up at the group with a tired expression: "Well, that's it. The parasites are gone."

The monster girls look at each other in disbelief. They all feel a sudden sense of relief wash over them as they realize that the pain and swelling in their bellies have finally stopped.

Dr. Kurokawa walks over to a small device on the wall and presses a button, causing a door to open at the back of the room. The group looks at each other again, unsure of what's happening. But then, they hear a familiar voice coming from outside: "Congratulations, you've successfully completed my trial."

The monster girls

1 / 1In the forest’s sanctuary, Amatsumagatsuchi notices something strange about Ayumi. Ayumi hasn’t gone into labor despite being 40 weeks pregnant - which would’ve happened any day now. Cupa begins reading about the elder dragons, and her research on the Amatsumagatsuchi page is surprising - an Amatsumagatsuchi can only be born during intense storms, just like the storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa. Amatsumagatsuchi tries to create a storm to help Ayumi with her journey to motherhood, but nothing happens. Amatsumagatsuchi just stares in confusion - where had his powers gone? Just as hope seems lost, the storm serpents arrive - and with them, an extremely intense storm.

1. Ayumi: "Woah, what's going on? I just had a baby with Amaya!"
2. Amatsumagatsuchi: "Vanessa... you're pregnant?"
3. Vanessa: "I don't know! I had a one-night stand with Arachnus and now I feel sick!"
4. Ayumi: "Wait, who is Arachnus? And how did this happen?"
5. Amatsumagatsuchi: "It's strange... the eggs won't harm Vanessa until they hatch in 9 months."
6. Ayumi: "Eggs? What do you mean, 'eggs'?"
7. Amatsumagatsuchi: "Vanessa's belly contains 20 spider eggs that are about to hatch."
8. Vanessa: "I don't understand... I didn't even know Arachnus until last night!"
9. Ayumi: "But how did you get pregnant? It's not like we're in a relationship or anything!"
10. Amatsumagatsuchi: "I don't have an answer for that, but it seems the eggs want to remain inside Vanessa until they hatch."
11. Ayumi: "But that's... inconceivable! What are we going to do?"
12. Amatsumagatsuchi: "We need to find a way to remove the eggs from Vanessa's belly without causing her any harm."
13. Vanessa: "I feel so weird... like the eggs want me to keep them inside me forever."
14. Ayumi: "This is insane! What kind of world are we living in, where humans and spiders can have hybrid babies?"
15. Amatsumagatsuchi: "I don't know... but we need to figure this out before the eggs hatch."

The three characters - Ayumi, Amatsumagatsuchi, and Vanessa - are all confused and worried about what to do next. They have to find a way to remove the spider eggs from Vanessa's belly without causing her harm. The eggs seem to be connected to Vanessa on an emotional level, as if they want her to keep them inside her forever. This is an unusual and confusing situation for all of them.

This scene sets up the rest of the story, where the characters must navigate this new reality and find a way to protect Vanessa from harm.

A few weeks go by, and Cupa starts noticing something new in Vanessa’s room of the castle - cobwebs, and lots of them. A few months later, Vanessa starts feeling a ton of scurrying in her belly - all 20 of the eggs had hatched, despite the fact they are still in her womb. Thankfully, the 20 little spider-human hybrids weren’t able to climb through Vanessa’s other body parts - and nobody knew how to surgically remove the 20 spider-human hybrids. Soon, Vanessa’s older sister Mindy - whose clothing resembles the regular Spider - enters the room. Turns out, a blood moon was going to be rising in two months - and since Arachnus was born under a blood moon, Vanessa could also give birth under a blood moon. However, it had to be a full blood moon - while the one that was going to be rising in two months was only a half blood moon. And there was no way to actually force a full blood moon to occur - not even a ritual could force a full blood moon to occur.

1. Mindy and Vanessa, the half-blood siblings: "I can't believe we're still waiting for this baby to come out," says Mindy as she sips her coffee. "We've tried everything - even a blood moon!"

2. Arachnus, Mindy's boyfriend: "Yeah, I know, it's not like the baby is going anywhere," replies Arachnus with a chuckle. "I'm sure it'll come out soon."

3. Vanessa: "I'm just glad it's not my fault that this baby hasn't been born yet," she says, looking at her stomach. "It'd be weird to have 20 spider-babies running around in here."

4. Mindy: "Well, I don't know about you, but I'm ready for this whole 'having a baby' thing to be over," she says as they walk past a group of people staring at Vanessa's stomach. "I mean, seriously, it's been 2 months since we found out we were expecting."

5. Arachnus: "Hey, don't worry about it," he says with a smile. "Babies come when they're ready."

6. Vanessa: "Yeah, I guess so," she replies, but there's still a hint of uncertainty in her voice. "I just hope this baby doesn't stay in there forever."

7. Mindy: "Don't worry, we'll get through this together," says Arachnus, giving Vanessa a reassuring look. "And who knows, maybe the blood moon will work after all?" he jokes.

8. Vanessa: "Yeah, maybe," she replies, but there's still a hint of skepticism in her voice. "I mean, it didn't do anything last time."

9. Mindy: "Well, at least we have each other to support us through this," she says as they continue on their way. "And maybe, just maybe, the baby will come out soon and be super cute and adorable."

10. Vanessa: "Yeah, I hope so," she replies, but there's still a hint of doubt in her voice. "I mean, what if it doesn't come out for another 2 months?" she asks suddenly.

11. Mindy: "We'll just have to take things one day at a time," she says with a sigh. "And in the meantime, we can always play with the spider-babies once they're born."

12. Vanessa: "Yeah, that's true," she replies, but there's still a hint of uncertainty in her voice. "I just hope this baby comes out soon and doesn't make us wait any longer than necessary."

2 weeks later, Vanessa starts to make the largest spider web she’s ever made - as the web she previously slept on had collapsed. Mindy offers to help - as Vanessa’s pregnancy could make things difficult. But thanks to all the silk Vanessa’s unborn children are producing at once, she manages to make a massive spider web. Cupa walks in with her lover - Inscrane, a skull-headed monstrosity with one eye and several crimson scales - and the two look like they’ve got some good news to share. Apparently, there’s a certain species of plant that can trigger intense contractions once ingested. The only problem is that this plant only grows in the Twilight Forest dimension - and because of a sudden depletion of Diamonds, the Twilight Forest can’t be explored.
