Reza: (looking at his catheter) Hey, I almost didn't see you there! You know, with your legs... and the whole tracheostomy thing, I just thought...   Anneliese: (sarcastically) Oh no, Reza, please don't mention it. I mean, how could anyone forget about my permanent disability? It's like, totally normal to bring up something like that in a hospital corridor.
Reza: (smiling) Alright, alright, I get the message. But you gotta admit, it is pretty awkward that we both have to use catheters.   Anneliese: (rolling her eyes) Yeah, real mood-killer there, Reza. And by the way, just because you're a guy doesn't mean you can get away with saying stuff like that.
Reza: (laughing) Oh, come on, I'm just trying to make light of a difficult situation. Can't we all use some humor around here?   Anneliese: (sighing) Fine. But next time, try to be a bit more sensitive, okay?
Reza: (smirking) You sound like my ex-girlfriend. Always nagging me about stuff I didn't even realize was offensive.   Anneliese: (rolling her eyes again) Really? That's your response? You think that's how you should be dealing with a serious situation like this?   Reza: (chuckling) Oh, and here I thought we were just having a friendly chat about our catheter woes. My bad.
Anneliese: (sighing again) Look, Reza, I know you're trying to be nice, but your "humor" is not only inappropriate, it's also really hurtful. And for the record, my ex-boyfriend and I broke up because of his constant need to make light of serious issues. So if that's what you're into, maybe we're not a good match after all.
Reza: (smirking again) Oh, come on, Anneliese. I'm just saying, at least your disability is temporary. Mine is forever. That's gotta count for something, right?   Anneliese: (rolling her eyes one last time) Yeah, Reza. Because nothing says "temporary" like being a paraplegic for the rest of my life.
Reza: (smirking again, looking at his catheter) Well, at least we both know how to use our catheters effectively. Unlike some people I could mention...   Anneliese: (giving him a look) Oh, don't even get me started on your "skills" in that department.
Reza: (laughing) Alright, alright, let's just agree to disagree. You can be a cranky old woman if you want, but I'm still going to make light of our shared medical condition.   Anneliese: (sighing one last time) Whatever. Just don't expect me to join in on the fun.
Reza: (smirking again) Oh, and here I thought we were just having a friendly chat about our catheter woes... my bad.
Anneliese: (smiling slightly) Yeah, that was definitely a thing that happened.

Scene 2: Reza and Anneliese are in the hospital room together, smiling at each other. Reza looks flushed and happy, while Anneliese seems a bit more reserved. They sit on the bed, holding hands.

Reza: So, what's new with you? I heard you got into some trouble with that wild bunch of doctors earlier.

Anneliese: (smirking) You can say that again! But don't worry, they're still trying to figure out how to put me back together. It'll be a while before I'm ready for the party circuit.

Reza: (laughing) Oh, come on! I bet you look amazing even with all those bandages. You know, I was thinking... maybe we could have a little ceremony when I get out of here. A private, intimate celebration just for us two. What do you say?

Anneliese: (hesitant) Reza, I-I don't know...

Reza: Come on, Anneliese! We can make it romantic and fun. Imagine the two of us, surrounded by candles, music playing in the background, our loved ones watching from a distance. It'll be like a fairytale wedding, but better!

Anneliese: (smiling hesitantly) Okay... maybe. But I have to warn you, Reza, I'm not sure how long it'll take before I can walk down the aisle for real.

Reza: (raising an eyebrow) Oh? And what are we waiting for, exactly?

Anneliese: Well... I need to heal my broken heart, of course! (winking at Reza) But I'll do my best to make it happen as soon as possible.

Reza: (laughing) You're too much, Anneliese. I love you more than anything in this world.

Anneliese: (smiling back) And I love you, Reza. No matter what happens, no matter how long it takes, we'll face it together. Together forever.

(They lean in and kiss deeply, their hearts beating as one.)
