You find yourself standing in front of a large castle made of stone and wood. The entrance is guarded by four massive doors that look like they could withstand any attack. In the distance, you can hear the sound of waves crashing against the shore. 

Suddenly, you hear a voice coming from behind one of the doors. "Hey there, adventurer! Are you looking for a place to rest your head for the night? If so, follow me and I'll show you to our humble abode." 

The door opens to reveal a short, stout man with a cheerful demeanor. He wears a tattered hat on his head and a small satchel slung over his shoulder. "I'm the caretaker of this castle. My name is Bob. What brings you here?" 

The scene is set up perfectly to make it seem like there is a character that we can interact with, when in reality, I will be doing everything. As your player, I need commands on what to do next.
