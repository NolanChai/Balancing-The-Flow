Sweden's current constitution, which was adopted in 1994 and came into effect on January 1, 1995, is the most recent version of the document that has governed the country since 1809. The Swedish parliament has been tasked with drafting a new constitution, but as of yet, no finalized text exists.

Sweden's current constitution consists of three parts: the Instrument of Government, which outlines the structure and powers of the executive branch; the Law on the Riksdag and Related Laws, which governs the parliamentary system; and the Human Rights Chapter, which incorporates international human rights treaties into Swedish law.

The Instrument of Government establishes the position of the king or queen as head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch and serves as the head of government. The Riksdag (parliament) consists of the House of Representatives (249 seats) and the Senate (100 seats). The House is directly elected, while the Senate is made up of 16 members appointed by the king or queen and 25 members directly elected through proportional representation.

The Law on the Riksdag and Related Laws outlines the procedures for parliamentary elections, the powers and immunities of parliamentarians, and the role of the committees and other bodies that support the work of the parliament. It also establishes the position of the speaker of the Riksdag, who is elected by the House of Representatives.

The Human Rights Chapter incorporates international human rights treaties into Swedish law. It includes provisions related to freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as protections for minority groups and vulnerable populations. The chapter also establishes a national human rights institution, the Swedish Ombudsman for Children, which is tasked with promoting and protecting children's rights.

The constitution also includes provisions related to the judiciary, including the position of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the role of courts in interpreting legislation. It also establishes the principles of administrative law, which govern the relationship between citizens and the government.

Sweden's current constitution has been amended several times since it came into effect in 1995. The most significant changes have been related to the expansion of parliamentary power and the protection of human rights. In particular, the Instrument of Government has been amended to include provisions related to gender equality and environmental protection.

Overall, Sweden's current constitution is a comprehensive document that establishes the structure and powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as protecting basic human rights and freedoms. It has been instrumental in shaping Sweden's political culture and ensuring that the country remains a democratic society with a strong commitment to social welfare and human rights.
