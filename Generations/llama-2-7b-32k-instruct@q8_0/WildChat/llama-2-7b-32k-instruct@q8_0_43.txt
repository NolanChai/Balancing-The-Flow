To use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send an HTML e-mail, you will need to do the following:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal window and type "smtp" followed by the hostname or IP address of the server you want to use for sending email (e.g., "smtp.example.com" or "smtp://example.com").
2. Press Enter. This will connect to the SMTP server.
3. Type "HELO" and press Enter. This is a standard command used to identify the sender of the email. You can use any name you want here, but it's common to use your domain name followed by a colon (e.g., "HELO example.com:").
4. Type "MAIL FROM:<sender@example.com>" and press Enter. This specifies that the sender of the email is <sender@example.com>. You can replace "<sender@example.com>" with any valid email address you want to use for the sender.
5. Type "RCPT TO:<recipient1@example.com>" and press Enter. This specifies that the first recipient of the email is <recipient1@example.com>. You can repeat this command multiple times to specify additional recipients, each separated by a space or comma (e.g., "RCPT TO:<recipient2@example.com>" "RCPT TO:<recipient3@example.com>").
6. Type "DATA" and press Enter. This indicates that the email message follows.
7. Use the command "Subject:" followed by a space or comma to specify the subject of the email (e.g., "Subject: My New Email") and press Enter.
8. Use the command "Content-type: text/html" to set the content type of the email as HTML (e.g., "Content-type: text/html").
9. Use the "Start" tag followed by a space or comma to specify the beginning of the HTML message body (e.g., "<!DOCTYPE html>").
10. Use the HTML tags and formatting commands to create your email message. You can use any valid HTML tags and formatting commands you like, but it's important to keep in mind that some web browsers may not display the email correctly if it contains invalid HTML code.
11. Use the "End" tag followed by a space or comma to specify the end of the HTML message body (e.g., "</body>").
12. Use the command "HTML" to specify that the rest of the email message is in HTML format.
13. Use the command "DATA" again to indicate that the email message has ended and press Enter.
14. Type "quit" followed by a space or comma to end the SMTP session and close the connection (e.g., "quit").

For example, you could use the following commands to send an HTML e-mail with the subject "My New Email" and recipients <recipient1@example.com> and <recipient2@example.com>:
```
smtp:
HELO example.com:
MAIL FROM:sender@example.com
RCPT TO:<recipient1@example.com>
DATA
Subject: My New Email
Content-type: text/html
Start
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My New Email</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My New Email</h1>
<p>This is a test email message.</p>
</body>
End
HTML
DATA
quit
```
Note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify the commands to fit your specific needs. Additionally, you should ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up on your server in order to send emails using SMTP.

A: Sure, I can provide you with some tips on how to write a persuasive essay that effectively persuades the reader. Here are some tips to help you get started: 

1. Make a claim: Begin your essay by making a clear and specific claim about a particular topic or issue. This will give your essay direction and purpose, and will help guide the rest of your argument. 
2. Support your claim with evidence: Use empirical evidence, real-life examples, and logical reasoning to support your claim. This will help to persuade the reader and make your argument stronger. 
3. Address counterarguments: Consider possible counterarguments to your claim, and address them directly in your essay. This will demonstrate that you have thought carefully about both sides of the issue, and will help to show the reader that you are well-informed and well-reasoned. 
4. Use rhetorical strategies: Techniques such as repetition, anecdotes, and parallelism can be used to make your essay more engaging and effective. Experiment with different techniques until you find the ones that work best for you. 
5. Be clear and concise: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that the reader may not understand. Instead, use simple language that is easy to follow and grasp. This will make your essay more accessible and easier to read. 
6. Use a logical structure: Organize your essay into clear paragraphs with topic sentences that introduce each point you want to make. Use transition words or phrases to connect your ideas and make your argument flow smoothly. 
7. Proofread and edit: Finally, proofread and edit your essay carefully before submitting it. Make sure that all of your spelling, grammar, and punctuation is correct, and that your writing flows smoothly and makes sense. 
By following these tips, you can write a persuasive essay that effectively persuades the reader and convinces them to agree with your point of view.

1. Use the Return Path: The return path is the address that the sender uses to send emails from their domain. If the email appears to be coming from one company but the return path indicates it's actually coming from another, then it's likely spoofed.
2. Look for Unexpected Domain Names: Some phishing emails may use a legitimate company's name in the "from" field, but the domain name that shows up below will be suspicious or unfamiliar.
3. Check for Misspellings and Errors: Legitimate companies typically have strict standards when it comes to spelling and grammar in their emails, so any mistakes or misspellings in an email from a company should raise red flags.
4. Pay Attention to the Subject Line: A spoofed email may use a legitimate company's name in the subject line, but the actual content of the email might be malicious. Take time to carefully review the entire message, not just the subject line.
5. Use Domain-Based Email Verification Tools: There are several free online tools that can help you verify the authenticity of an email by checking its domain name against a database of known trusted senders.
