Hermanubis was an Egyptian god who was worshipped in the city of Hermopolis. He was depicted as a man with the head of a jackal and the body of a human. His name means "Hermes, jackal," and he was associated with fertility, childbirth, and the afterlife. There were three forms of the personal name based on Hermanubis in papyri and inscriptions from Egypt. The first form was Ἑρμάνουβιϲ, which simply replicates the god's name without further ado. The second form was Ἑρμανουβῆϲ, which combines the name of Hermes with the suffix "-բěϲ," which meant "to be strong" or "brave." The third form was Ἑρμανούβιοϲ, which is a hypocoristic that combined the name of Hermes with the diminutive suffix "-ίοϲ."

In addition to these three forms, there were two polytheophoric names based on Hermanubis: Ἑρμανουβιϲ and ἑρμανούβιος. The first form was a common name that combined the name of Hermes with the suffix "-ίζ." The second form was a rare name that combined the name of Hermes with the suffix "-ίων."
