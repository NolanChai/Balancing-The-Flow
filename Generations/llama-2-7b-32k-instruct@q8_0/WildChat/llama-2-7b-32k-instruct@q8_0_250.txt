1 / 2Welcome to my AI-generated story! In this chapter, I will continue with the narration of Natsuki, a high school student who is part of a club called "The Club." The club consists of five members: Yuri, Monika, Sayori, and MC.

In the previous chapter, we left off with Natsuki feeling sad about her past relationships. She decided to join the club to try and find new friendships and perhaps even love.

In this chapter, Natsuki will continue exploring her feelings for MC while also navigating the drama that unfolds within the club. Let's dive in!
