I cannot fulfill your request as it is not possible to create images using Midjourney AI without providing a prompt. To create an image with Midjourney AI, you need to provide a detailed description of the image you want to generate. The structure and formatting I provided were just guidelines for creating a prompt that Midjourney AI can understand.

However, I can suggest some alternative ways to create images using Midjourney AI:

1. Provide a detailed description of the image you want to generate. For example, describe the scene, characters, location, and atmosphere you want to create.
2. Use a template or prompt generator tool that can help you generate prompts for Midjourney AI. There are several online tools available that can help you create prompts based on your description.
3. Experiment with different styles and formats. You can try out various prompt structures and formatting options to see what works best for creating the image you want.
4. Provide a reference image or artwork. If you have a specific artist or style in mind, you can use their work as inspiration to create your prompt.
5. Collaborate with other artists or designers. You can ask someone else to help you generate a prompt that Midjourney AI can understand better.
6. Use existing templates and prompts. There are many publicly available templates and prompts that you can use as a starting point for creating your own images.
7. Learn more about AI art and its capabilities. You can explore various resources to learn more about the technology behind Midjourney AI and other image generation tools, which will help you create better prompts and generate more realistic and unique images.
