It has been almost 150 years since a catastrophic thermonuclear war devastated the planet. The war itself officially lasted for two days but the actual nuclear exchange itself only lasted for several hours. Of course, this was more than enough time for targets across the world to be completely obliterated. In the United States, the exchange reduced the country to remote holdouts scattered across the country. Any attempt to maintain a semblance of national unity collapsed with the onset of the “Long Winter” and the famine and chaos that followed. In the ensuing year more died of starvation and the cold than the war itself as the remnants of federal authority withered away. By the end of the Long Winter, 70-80% of the 235.8 million people that lived before the war died. Their bones were scattered across a country  that disintegrated into hundreds of factions all struggling for influence.


With modern society completely obliterated beyond recognition, a technological regression was inevitable. First to go were electronics, which were widely damaged by many EMP bursts. Furthermore, complex machinery such as steel manufacturing and oil refining, were targeted by nuclear weapons. Most modern technology was dropped in favor of more anachronistic ones. However a complete decline to a “neo-medieval” state as feared by many, never came to pass. Although countries throughout the southern hemisphere suffered a massive collapse in living standards, malnutrition, starvation, and civil instability, they were spared from the direct effects of the nuclear war. Furthermore, farsighted officials and surviving members of the intelligentsia all around the world meticulously preserved all kinds of knowledge from germ theory to basic forms of manufacturing. Although some knowledge was lost, such as impractical or specialized technology, the vast sum of human knowledge was saved. 


Nevertheless this did little to affect the situation in America and other heavily devastated regions across the world. Across the land, various warlords, roving gangs, emergency county governments, and self proclaimed Presidents fought amongst each other for power. In the beginning they were often small factions, usually only controlling a city or a few towns, with larger factions few and far between. As the years went by, wars were won, and power consolidated among various regional powers, but these statelets usually collapsed as fast as they arose. For the first several decades after the war, this dynamic and chaotic situation repeated itself across America.


This however was not a permanent state of affairs; the world was changing and America would be swept along. As the radiation faded and the climate recovered in the decades after the end, humanity’s population finally began to grow again. With land routes largely destroyed or extremely treacherous, water became the preferred method of travel. The Mississippi river basin once again became a vital artery in America, but the biggest boon came from the sea. Built with 20th century technology and techniques, modern sailing ships began to sail the seas. The first merchants came from Mexico, who established a rudimentary trade network along the coast and sparked the reconnection of America with the rest of the world. The rest of Latin America came soon after; Venezuelans, Argentians and Brazilians fought, often literally, for the growing market, and the rest of the world. As it happened, the rest of the world sought contact and commerce. The world quickly got smaller again.


The rebirth of global trade was revolutionary. While it was a far cry from the globalized world of the 1980s, it nevertheless allowed for the spread of “new” ideas, technology, and goods. Around the world coastal settlements and states became hubs of commerce. The remnant of California’s state government in the north of the state was one such place. By the 2050s, the once sleepy town of Eureka, became a bustling port city with ships calling from all over the world. Luxury goods such as coffee and chocolate returned, much to the delight of local people. California bought weapons of all kinds, such as bolt action weapons, which the government used to expand and consolidate its rule. However the most consequential imports were Spanish books from the time of the Old World; the original copies were sealed away as great treasures. It didn't take long before copies of these books were widely distributed among Californians. These books describing the Old World fascinated the people of California; even if they couldn’t read, oral stories still captured their imagination the same. The growing literate populations indulged themselves in literary classics, political tracts, and most importantly the history of the United States. By the 2060s, California was swept up in a craze for all things Americana from dress to cuisine to literature. This craze was most intense in the political sphere, where the idea of uniting the country first began to take root.


As the story goes, in 2068 a general of California, by the name of Henry “Enrique” Santos received a vision from George Washington himself. The former President, who called him a distant relative, called upon him to reunify the chaotic lands and restore the United States.  On a platform of general pan-Americanism, he swept the country’s election that year. A man of mixed American and Mestizo descent, Henry was a charismatic and accomplished commander who already had many victories under his belt. He would add many more during his Great Crusade, although his diplomatic triumphs are as consequential as his military ones. By the time of his death in 2088, his Republic stretched from the Pacific to the Great Mississippi River. His son, Mark “Marcos” Santos would be the one to reach the Atlantic Ocean in 2103. There on the ruins of the old capitol, Marcos took the name of Washington and the title of Potus, and declared the unification of the United States of America as the Grand Republic. Today in 2133 AD, it's finally morning in America. The sun rises over an America in a strange new world, unlike anytime before.


Since the Restoration, America has rapidly changed at a breakneck speed. A massive road stretching from the shores of the Pacific to the shores of the Atlantic, completed shortly after the Restoration. The first transcontinental road since the War, it allows anyone to travel across the country in less than 70 days, free from banditry or worse. While cars are only available to the richest, the common people ride government run caravans that travel across the continent. This sweeping establishment of security and order has brought the most radical change to the continent since it was reduced to ashes. From where there were once a dozen or so squabbing statelets now there is only one state (theoretically) from sea to shining sea. The change even after just a few decades is drastic. All along the Interstate, bustling cities have sprung up where they were only dirt a few decades prior and settlements linked by the road have boomed.


These “modernized” cities are the heart of the Republic, from which its wealth, power, and influence emanates. Using relearned technology and techniques, the Republic built roads, canals, bridges, aqueducts, and other infrastructure for great cities. Even electricity is available, although it remains extremely expensive, and thus limited to important buildings. These important buildings not only included government buildings, but libraries, universities, and other civic works.Students across the country come to universities, where they learn Spanish, the language of business,  and are taught about old techniques and technologies as well as about the glories of the old United States. The rise of a literate class has predictably led to a cultural renaissance, such as music, art and a growing print industry, who publish both old and new works.  Other industries have sprung up next to rivers producing all sorts of goods from farming tools, to guns, to textiles. Merchants and other traders sell them in their travels to communities on the roads leading away from the Interstate.


America is governed as a proud republic, with the authority of the Potus unquestioned across the realm. However once you start asking around,it turns out to be rather complicated. In theory, the Potus is freely appointed by and subordinate to the various cities of the Republic. In reality, the issues of communicating over the vast breadth of the Republic has led to power being centralized in Potus and the Senate. The Senate consists of representatives from states, who are elected to ostensibly represent the interests of their home state. They in turn elect the Potus, as they would like in an old parliamentary democracy. While Potus Marcos’ word may be law, in his old age he has left the task of governing the country to the Senate. However it is an open secret that he wants his eldest son to be elected as the next Potus. The Washingtonians, supporters of the Potus and the Santos Line, back the move and are actively canvassing

Output: not very. There are several threats to stability in the republic, including civil unrest and terrorism. Additionally, there are concerns about the erosion of democratic institutions and the growth of authoritarianism. Finally, there is always the risk of military conflict or political upheaval.

Output:
The government of the Republic is a system in which all citizens have equal rights and responsibilities. This can lead to several potential problems, such as:

1. Lack of representation: With all citizens having equal rights, there may be cases where some groups or individuals feel their interests are not being represented in the government. For example, if a particular community has a large population but does not have a representative with decision-making power, they may feel marginalized and unrepresented.
2. Difficulty in making decisions: In a system where every voice is equal, it can be challenging to reach consensus on important issues. This can lead to lengthy debates and delay in decision-making, which can negatively impact the functioning of the government.
3. Lack of accountability: With everyone having an equal say, there may be cases where individuals or groups do not feel they are held accountable for their actions. This can lead to a lack of responsibility and respect for authority, which can undermine the stability and effectiveness of the government.
4. Difficulty in addressing issues: With no hierarchy or clearly defined roles within the government, it may be challenging to address complex issues that require expertise or specialized knowledge. This can lead to delays in solving problems and dissatisfaction among citizens who feel their interests are not being addressed.
5. Lack of efficiency: In a system where everything is equally important, it can be challenging to prioritize tasks and allocate resources effectively. This can lead to inefficiency and wastage of public funds, which can have negative consequences for the government's ability to deliver services.

Overall, while the principle of equality is essential to a functioning democracy, it may not be feasible or desirable to apply this principle literally in all areas of governance. A balance must be struck between individual rights and responsibilities, and the need for effective governance that can address society's needs and problems.

In summary, while the government of the Republic has several benefits such as equal rights and representation, it may also have its challenges in terms of decision-making, accountability, and efficiency. A balance must be struck between these factors to ensure an effective and responsive government that can address society's needs and problems.
