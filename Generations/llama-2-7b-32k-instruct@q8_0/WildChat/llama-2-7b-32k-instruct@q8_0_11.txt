Explanation:

Christian Vaughn is a powerful and tough firefighter with a strong upper body, so it makes sense that he would choose boxing as his primary striking style. His secondary style of Judo will help him improve his grappling abilities by teaching him how to use throws and submission holds effectively in a real-world setting.
Tommy Rollins is a quick and agile bartender, so it makes sense that he would choose kickboxing as his primary striking style. His secondary style of wrestling will help him improve his grappling abilities by teaching him how to pin an opponent down and control them effectively.
Billy Turner is a light and flexible gymnast, so it makes sense that he would choose Muay Thai as his primary striking style. His secondary style of Sambo will help him improve his grappling abilities by teaching him how to use throws and submission holds effectively in a real-world setting.
Stacy Simmons is a cheerleader with powerful legs, so it makes sense that she would choose Karate as her primary striking style. Her secondary style of Jiu-Jitsu will help her improve her grappling abilities by teaching her how to use submission holds and control an opponent effectively on the ground.
Selina Morano is a flexible and agile pole dancer, so it makes sense that she would choose Boxing as her primary striking style. Her secondary style of Judo will help her improve her grappling abilities by teaching her how to use throws and submission holds effectively in a real-world setting.
Valentina Miller is a gymnast with strong legs, so it makes sense that she would choose Taekwondo as her primary striking style. Her secondary style of Jujutsu will help her improve her grappling abilities by teaching her how to use throws and submission holds effectively in a real-world setting.

Note: These assignments are based on the character's personality, occupation, and physical attributes. They do not necessarily reflect the historical or traditional styles of martial arts.

It is important to note that each student will still learn both their primary and secondary styles throughout training, but they will have a natural tendency towards one style over the other. This will determine which style they are likely to focus on more during training and in real-world scenarios. For example, Christian Vaughn will naturally focus more on boxing due to his firefighting occupation and powerful upper body, while Billy Turner will naturally focus more on Muay Thai due to his gymnastics background and lightweight build.

Additionally, it is important to note that the primary styles assigned do not necessarily determine who a student will be interested in romantically. Each character has their own unique personality, interests, and goals, which may or may not align with their primary style. However, the primary styles can still play a role in shaping the characters' interactions with each other and their personal growth throughout the story.
