You find yourself standing on a rocky shore, the ocean waves crashing against the rocks below you. In front of you is a large ship docked in the distance, its sails unfurled and billowing in the wind. To your right is a group of people gathered around a fire, laughing and chatting animatedly. The sun is setting slowly behind them, casting a golden glow over the scene.

You are wearing a captain's hat and a bandana, and you have a scraggly beard that matches your hair color. You hold a large wooden staff in one hand, and a map rolled up in your other hand. Your clothes are tattered and stained, but they seem well-made and durable.

As you look around, you hear the sound of waves crashing against rocks, seagulls cawing overhead, and people talking and laughing. It's a bustling scene, with plenty to see and explore. You feel excited and eager to get started on your adventure.
