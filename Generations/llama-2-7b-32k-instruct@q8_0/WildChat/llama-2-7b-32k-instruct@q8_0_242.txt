Here are some possible answers to your questions:

1. You can recover the money on your Visa card before it was closed by contacting the bank where you had the card issued, and requesting a refund for the remaining balance. The bank may require you to provide additional information or documentation before they can process your request. It's important to note that some banks may have different policies regarding the recovery of funds from canceled cards, so it's best to check with them directly.

2. You cannot request another card using the same Visa card number as the one you had closed. The reason for this is that the card number is associated with your personal information and identity, and it's not possible to have multiple cards with the same number. However, if you still need a Visa card, you can contact the bank where you had the old card issued, and request a new one with a different number. It's important to note that you may be charged a fee for this service, and there may be some waiting period before your new card is issued.

It's also worth mentioning that if you have any other questions or concerns regarding your Visa card, it's always best to contact the bank where you had the card issued directly, so they can help you with your specific case and provide you with accurate information.
