It's difficult to determine the exact reasons why a reddit post may have been downvoted or received few upvotes, as there could be several factors at play. However, I can provide some general guidance based on what you've shared:

1. Low punctuation score: A low punctuation score of 0 is indeed an indication that the post may not have been well-received by the community. This score takes into account various factors such as upvotes, downvotes, and comment activity, and it's typically considered a rough indicator of how well a post performs on the platform.
2. Few upvotes: A low number of upvotes (77) is also an indication that the post may not have been very popular among reddit users. While there could be various reasons for this, it's generally considered that posts with high-quality content and engaging discussions tend to receive more attention and upvotes from the community.
3. Low comment activity: Having 77 comments on a post with a low punctuation score may also suggest that the post didn't generate much engagement or discussion among reddit users. This could be due to various factors, such as the content being uninteresting or irrelevant to the community, or simply because the post was not well-received and people did not find it worth commenting on.
4. No clear trend: Without a clear trend of upvotes or downvotes over time, it's difficult to determine whether the post has been steadily declining in popularity or if it experienced a sudden drop off. It's also possible that the post had a small peak in popularity shortly after being posted and then gradually declined.
5. Subreddit factors: Finally, it's important to consider the subreddit where the post was made. Different subreddits have different audiences, posting guidelines, and levels of engagement. If the subreddit has a specific niche or topic, it may be more challenging for posts that don't fit within those parameters to gain traction.

Overall, while there are certainly no guarantees when it comes to reddit's popularity, it's generally considered that high-quality content and engaging discussions tend to perform better on the platform. However, there are many factors that can affect a post's success, so it's important to keep in mind that one factor alone may not fully explain why a post didn't receive the attention you were hoping for.
