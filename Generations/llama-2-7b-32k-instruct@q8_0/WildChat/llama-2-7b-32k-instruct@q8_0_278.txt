It's important to note that subliminal audios are not a replacement for professional help, but rather a tool that can be used along with therapy and other healing methods. It's also important to ensure that the affirmations in these audio tracks are true and authentic for you, as they will have more impact if they resonate deeply with your personal experiences and beliefs. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the audio is not too loud or overwhelming, as this can cause stress and anxiety instead of healing. It's best to start with low volume levels and gradually increase them over time, if needed.
