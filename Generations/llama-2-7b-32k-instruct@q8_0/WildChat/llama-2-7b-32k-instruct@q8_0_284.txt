No, the gray 18% object will not become white in the final picture. When you expose for the gray 18% object, the camera will automatically meter for a lighter value than the gray 18%, which is typically around 20-30%. This means that when you take the photo, the gray 18% object will be underexposed and will appear darker than it actually is.

To fix this, you can adjust your exposure compensation to +2 EV (exposure value) to overexpose the image and bring out more detail in the dark areas, including the gray 18% object. However, be careful not to overcompensate too much or the entire image will become too bright. You may also want to use a spot metering mode to measure the exposure for only the gray 18% object, rather than relying on the camera's automatic exposure settings.

Additionally, you can try using a histogram to check the exposure of the image and adjust it accordingly. The histogram shows the distribution of brightness values in an image, with dark areas towards the left side and light areas towards the right side. If the gray 18% object is underexposed, you may need to overexpose the image to bring out more detail in that area.

Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and you may need to experiment with different exposure compensation values and other settings to get the desired result. The best way to ensure that your images look their best is to take a few test shots and check the histogram and preview them on your camera's LCD screen.

Also, keep in mind that this process may not work perfectly for every image or object, as it depends on the specific lighting conditions, color of the object, and other factors. It's always a good idea to use a spot metering mode to measure the exposure for only the gray 18% object, rather than relying on the camera's automatic exposure settings.
