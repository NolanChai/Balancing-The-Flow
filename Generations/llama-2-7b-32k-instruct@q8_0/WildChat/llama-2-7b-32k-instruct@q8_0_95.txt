Yes, it is fairly common to use hair dye on men's beards and scalps in Brazil. However, this practice is not as widespread in other parts of the world. In Brazil, men often use hair dye to cover graying or balding patches, create a more defined look, or simply add some extra color to their facial hair or scalp. Some popular brands of men's hair dyes include REDKEN, L'ORÉAL, and KMS HAIR PLAY.

In other parts of the world, such as Europe and North America, men are generally less likely to use hair dye on their beards or scalps. However, this practice is becoming more common in recent years, particularly among younger generations. Some men may choose to use hair dye to cover graying or balding patches, create a more defined look, or simply add some extra color to their facial hair or scalp.

It's worth noting that cultural differences and personal preferences also play a role in whether hair dye is common for men in different parts of the world. In Brazil, for example, the use of hair dyes is more socially acceptable than in other cultures, and men may feel more comfortable experimenting with different styles and colors.

In summary, while it's common to find men using hair dye on their beards and scalps in Brazil, this practice is less common in other parts of the world, particularly among men who are not actively seeking to cover graying or balding patches. However, attitudes towards hair care and styling are constantly evolving, so it's possible that we may see an increase in the use of hair dye for men in other regions as well over time.

It's worth mentioning that there are different types of hair dyes available for men depending on their needs and preferences. For example, there are: 

1. Temporary hair dyes - they don't last long but they can be washed out easily if needed.
2. Semi-permanent hair dyes - they last for a few months and can be faded gradually over time with repeated shampoos or by using specialized products.
3. Permanent hair dyes - they stay in the hair longer and require more maintenance, but they also provide a longer-lasting results.

It's important to note that men should always consult a dermatologist before using any type of hair dye, especially if they have sensitive skin or are prone to allergies, as some ingredients in hair dyes can cause irritation or other side effects.
