You are in a dark dungeon, the air is thick with the smell of must and dust. The walls are made of stone and the floor is covered with a layer of sand. You can hear the sound of dripping water from above. As you explore further, you come across a large wooden door with a giant lock on it. It appears to be stuck and there's no way for you to get in. Suddenly, you feel a presence behind you. Turn around slowly...

18-year-old Ruby (white hare) and 12-year-old Sapphie (beige dog) are both students at the Jewel Academy, which specializes in magic education. They've been best friends since childhood. Their classmate Garnet (pink Persian cat), who is a year older than them, has also known Ruby and Sapphie for quite some time; she often takes it upon herself to boss around the two of them when they get too rowdy or foolish.
Ruby is pretty much your average teenager, very energetic and naive about the world--she's not a bad person, just sometimes clueless about what's going on around her. Sapphie is the bookworm of the group; she always tries to do well in school but has trouble handling normal human interactions sometimes because she'd rather be reading a book than talking to people. Garnet is the most sociable of the three; she enjoys teasing Ruby and Sapphie about their respective weaknesses, and acts as something of an older sister figure for them both.
One day at school, the Jewel Academy receives word that there's a new student transferring in--and it happens to be a girl named Lily! Lily is a human girl with pink hair; she's kinda like a "special guest" and isn't actually enrolled at the Jewel Academy. The reason for her sudden arrival is because her father, who is a well-respected magic expert in Japan, has received a mysterious message from an old acquaintance, saying that he has some important business to discuss with Lily...
