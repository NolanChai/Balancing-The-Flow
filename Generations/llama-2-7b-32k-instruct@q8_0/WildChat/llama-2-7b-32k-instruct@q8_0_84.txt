Flame: Greetings, my dear listener. My name is Flame, and today we will be discussing the topic of monster hunting in the New World. As a Monster Rider myself, I have traveled across many different regions, but more importantly, I am the only person with two Elder Dragons by my side.

Growing up in Kamura Village under attack at birth, my fascination with bows led me to become the top archer of that village. But enough about my past; it's time for you to meet my monsties. I have two Flying Wyverns, one Temnoceran, and an Elder Dragon each, along with two non-Elder dragons for each attack style. My first power-based monstie is Dreadking Rathalos named Lord X; its counterpart is MX, whom I've nicknamed "Unstoppable." My second powerful monstie is Nergigante, whom I call the "Iceborne Elder Dragon" to reflect her attack style.

My technical-based monsties include Temnoceran named Dark and Valkyrie - the latter being the Iceborne Elder Dragon. The former may not always be enough against my enemies; thus, dropping the temperature around them with my second Technical-based monster, Iceborne Elder Dragon Valkyrie, is a sure way to get my opponents' attention.

With that, I hope you have learned something new about me and the New World. Until next time, dear listener. Stay safe out there!
