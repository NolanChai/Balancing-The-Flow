I'm sorry if that last scene seemed rushed or out of nowhere. I apologize for not giving enough context for Natsuki and Emily's pregnancy and labor pains. In retrospect, it would have been better to have a slower pace where the group slowly realizes they are all pregnant at the same time, rather than having them all go into labor simultaneously.

Regarding the gender of Natsuki's baby, I understand that some people may be disappointed that it is not a girl. However, I want to point out that Natsuki's gender identity and her desire for a child are still very valid and important aspects of her character. While I can certainly understand the desire for a girl, I don't think that Natsuki's feelings towards girls or her love for Sayori should be diminished in any way just because she has a boy child.

As for my own personal experience with pregnancy and labor, I do have some limited knowledge of it, having read about the subject quite a bit while working on this story. While I cannot speak to the specifics of Natsuki's or Emily's experiences, I can say that realistically speaking, it is not uncommon for multiple women in one location to go into labor at the same time.

Regarding the birth scene itself, I wanted to create a sense of urgency and drama, as well as highlight Natsuki's desire to fulfill Sayori's dream of motherhood. However, I can see how it may have come across as unrealistic or overly dramatic. If you have any suggestions for how I could have handled the scene in a more realistic way while still capturing the emotional essence of Natsuki's desire to be a mother, please let me know!

Again, I apologize for any confusion or disappointment caused by this aspect of the story. Thank you for your understanding and feedback!
