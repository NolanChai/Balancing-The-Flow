1. Affected is a word used to describe how someone feels. For example, "I was very affected by the news." Effected is a verb meaning "caused" or "made." For example, "The storm effected many people's lives." In this case, it would be better to say "affected," as it implies that the disorder has made someone feel a certain way.
