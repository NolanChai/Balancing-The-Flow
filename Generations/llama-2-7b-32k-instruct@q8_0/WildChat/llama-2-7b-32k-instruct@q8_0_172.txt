A: The answer to this question is not accessible to me as a chatbot, I am not able to access any information about a specific game or application. It's important to note that the geometry dash game is constantly changing and updating, so what I know now may be different in the future. Additionally, the game has been updated many times since its release, which means that the level you mentioned may have changed over time.

It would be best if you provided more information about the game or level you are referring to. For example, which version of geometry dash are you playing? What is the name of the level you're talking about? Providing this information will help me better assist you.
