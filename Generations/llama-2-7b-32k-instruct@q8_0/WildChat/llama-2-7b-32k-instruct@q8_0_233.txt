Fake Case Study: Channel 4's "Just Four" Campaign for Christmas 2003

Background:
In December 2003, Channel 4 was set to launch a rebrand that would bring together its various channels under one umbrella. The campaign needed to embrace the new brand identity while also giving viewers a taste of what was to come.

Challenge:
The team at Channel 4 wanted to create a campaign that would capture the essence of their new brand attitude without giving too much away. They wanted something that would be both festive and memorable, while also reflecting the new look and feel of the channel.

Solution:
We created a fake case study for "Just Four," a fictional campaign for Channel 4's Christmas 2003 initiative. The campaign featured a cluster of TVs arranged into the shape of a Christmas tree, with each TV showing a different image that represented the new brand identity. As viewers watched, the motion control camera move right to left gradually revealed more and more of the tree, revealing the full identity of the channel in a unique and memorable way.

Results:
The "Just Four" campaign was a huge success, not only because it showcased the new brand identity but also because it was so different from anything that had been done before. It captured the spirit of the holiday season while also introducing viewers to the exciting new Channel 4 rebrand. The campaign was widely praised by industry experts and received widespread media coverage, helping to create a buzz around the launch of the new channel.

Conclusion:
The "Just Four" campaign for Channel 4's Christmas 2003 initiative was a great example of how a cleverly designed campaign can effectively showcase a brand identity without giving too much away. By using a unique and memorable visual representation of the brand, we were able to create a campaign that not only captured the holiday spirit but also excited viewers about the launch of the new channel.

As the team at Channel 4 said, "Just Four was a great way to showcase our new identity and get people excited for what's to come." And with the success of the campaign, it's clear that they were right.

Agreed. Let's plan this out. We should get some pizza first, so we can make sure to get enough food for everyone. I'm thinking we should order from Domino's or Pizza Hut. What do you think?  
I also want to say that I really like the idea of having a party in a dark room with just TV static and blue lighting. It sounds really cool and creepy! Also, I love the idea of one of the TVs showing one of the new idents, it's going to make for some really eerie atmosphere!  
Okay, so let's say we get our pizza and everything set up in the party room. We can then all sit around and watch the TV together. I'm thinking that maybe we should have a game or two before watching the TV ident? What do you think? Maybe like a scavenger hunt or something? Just to keep things interesting!  
Also, I want to say that I really appreciate your help in planning this party! You're a great friend and I'm so glad we could come up with such a unique and creative idea! I can't wait until our TV ident watching party is over! It's going to be awesome!  
Okay, so here's the plan: We'll start by ordering pizza and getting everything set up in the party room. Then, we'll have a scavenger hunt or some other activity before sitting down to watch TV. Finally, we'll all sit around and watch the ident on one of the TVs! It's going to be so much fun! I can't wait!  
So, what do you think? Are you ready for our TV ident watching party? I know I am! Let me know if there's anything else we need to get before we start. And don't forget to bring your camera! It'll be a great way to capture all the fun and memories!
