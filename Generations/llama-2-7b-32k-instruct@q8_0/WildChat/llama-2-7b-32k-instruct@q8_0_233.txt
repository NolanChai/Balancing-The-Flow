1.  As a massive storm tears through the world of Minecraft, a strange dragon unlike any other descends. Once the storm dissipates, the elder dragon "Amatsumagatsuchi" reveals his true self. He stares down at a large cavern, where a strange sight catches his eye - five different girls, unlike any Amatsumagatsuchi has seen. He descends upon the girls, and sees that each girl's clothes resemble a different type of monster that inhabits the Minecraft world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze. Amatsumagatsuchi just looks at them, and notices that the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton was in pain - and her stomach was swollen. The other girls - introducing themselves as Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazette - later introduce their friend Ayumi. Amatsumagatsuchi looks into Ayumi's eyes - and, despite the intense pain, Ayumi looks back at Amatsumagatsuchi.
