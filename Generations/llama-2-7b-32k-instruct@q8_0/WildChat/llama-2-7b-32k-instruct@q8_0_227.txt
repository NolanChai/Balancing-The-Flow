Sayori and Natsuki rush to Monika's aid, providing her with much-needed support as they all try to figure out what happened. Together, they search for clues that could help them understand why Yuri suddenly disappeared, leaving behind a note expressing her feelings of sadness.

As they explore the clubroom, Sayori and Natsuki notice that there are signs of disarray and destruction everywhere. The chairs have been overturned, the tables are broken, and the curtains are torn. It's clear that something terrible has happened, but what?

Sayori: (looking at the destroyed furniture) “This is unbelievable…what could have caused this?”

Monika: “I don’t know, but it doesn’t make sense. Yuri was always so careful and meticulous. She would never do anything to destroy her own home.”

Natsuki: (trying to process what she's seeing) “But…what if something happened to her? Maybe someone hurt her?”

Sayori: (shocked) “No way, that’s not possible! Yuri is strong and independent. She would never let anyone get close enough to hurt her.”

Monika: (thinking back on the note) “Wait a minute…remember when she said she had someone who was watching over her?”

Natsuki: (realizing where this is going) “Oh my god, Monika! Are you thinking what I’m thinking?!”

(All three girls look at each other, their eyes filled with fear and uncertainty.)

Monika: (stating the obvious) "We need to call the police."
