Instead of saying "I'll be right back," as she usually would, Monika says "Everyone must've went home already" and returns to her room. She then sets up the birthing mat for Natsuki. This indicates that Monika has been left alone in the clubroom to care for Natsuki, likely due to the fact that everyone else has gone home.

As she sets up the mat, Monika makes a comment about the people who are present and absent from this occasion: "Everyone must've went home already." This implies that there should be more people around, but they aren't there. It could be possible that Monika is alone with Natsuki because everyone else has left or been dismissed from their duties.

This statement also suggests that Monika feels a sense of loneliness and isolation in this moment, as if she is the only one who remains to care for Natsuki. It's possible that Monika might be feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for Natsuki alone or that she may have been expecting more help from her peers.

It's also worth noting that Monika seems to be addressing someone unseen, as if she is aware of a presence that isn't there. This could be interpreted as a sign of mental distress or dissociation, as if Monika is talking to an imaginary person or addressing the audience.

Overall, Monika's statement "Everyone must've went home already" suggests that she feels alone and isolated in her role as caregiver for Natsuki, and it may also be a sign of mental distress or dissociation.
