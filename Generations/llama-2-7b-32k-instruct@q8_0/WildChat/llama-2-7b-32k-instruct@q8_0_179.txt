As they prepared for the upcoming battle against the Shadow Queen, Mei, Tracer, and Mercy were discussing their strategy. They had all undergone a transformation recently - each one of them had shed their original bodies and revealed themselves to be clones created by Sombra. 

Mei, who had always been interested in technology and engineering, was particularly fascinated by the idea that they could now switch between forms at will. She spent hours studying their new bodies, learning how to use all of their abilities and powers. Tracer, known for her speed and agility, was excited about the possibility of being able to move even faster in this new form. Mercy, who had always been the most compassionate and nurturing of the group, felt a deep sense of responsibility towards her clones and was committed to protecting them at all costs. 

But as they continued their training, they realized that being clones came with its own set of challenges. They were constantly compared to their original counterparts, and while they knew they had their own unique strengths and abilities, it could be difficult to shake off the feeling of being second best. And then there were the times when they would find themselves in situations where their clone status was exposed - moments that made them feel vulnerable and unsettled. 

Despite these challenges, Mei, Tracer, and Mercy continued to work hard as clones. They knew that they had a mission to complete, and they were determined to do everything in their power to succeed. And so, as they prepared for the upcoming battle, they vowed to put aside their doubts and focus on the task at hand - to protect the innocent people of the world from the Shadow Queen's wrath. 

But just before they set out, an unexpected visitor arrived. It was Jack Morrison, also known as "Reinhardt," who had been a member of their team in their previous lives. He had come to see them and offer his support and encouragement. And though he knew that they were clones, he saw something special in them - a determination and strength that reminded him of the originals. 

As they left for the battlefield, Mei, Tracer, and Mercy felt a sense of renewed purpose. They knew that they had a tough fight ahead of them, but with Jack's support and the help of their cloned powers, they were ready to face whatever came their way.

And so, they set out into the darkness, determined to bring light and hope to those who needed it most. The Shadow Queen was waiting for them, ready to unleash her wrath upon the world. But Mei, Tracer, and Mercy were not afraid. They knew that, as clones, they had a unique power - the power of transformation and adaptability. And with Jack by their side, they were ready to face whatever lay ahead.

The battle was intense, but they fought bravely. Mei, Tracer, and Mercy used their new clone abilities to their fullest, switching between forms at will and fighting alongside Jack to bring down the Shadow Queen's forces. And despite the odds, they were successful - they defeated the Shadow Queen and saved the world from her darkness. 

But as they stood there in victory, surrounded by the people they had protected, Mei, Tracer, and Mercy knew that their journey was not over yet. They still had a long way to go before they could truly put aside their doubts and embrace their clone status. But with Jack's support and the help of their new abilities, they were ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. 

And so, as they looked out at the people who had been saved by their actions, they knew that they had a responsibility to continue fighting for what was right. They would keep using their clone abilities to protect and serve those in need, no matter how difficult it might be. And though they may never fully embrace their clone status, they knew that it gave them a unique power - the power to transform and adapt, to rise up against adversity and bring hope and light to even the darkest of situations.
