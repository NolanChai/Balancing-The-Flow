Wedding Officiants in California

The following is a list of common ways to legally perform a wedding in California. The State of California does not require any specific form of documentation or licensure from the person performing the marriage, however, there may be restrictions on who can perform a same-sex marriage. Some counties and cities have additional requirements for who can officiate at a wedding ceremony. If you are planning to have your wedding in another state or country it is important that you check their laws regarding marriages as well.

1. Judge (any county): Contact the clerk of each court in the county where you want the wedding. You will need an appointment. The judge may also require a blood test and/or proof of age. A judge may not perform your ceremony if they are close family members or friends of either party.
2. County Clerk (any county): Most counties have a designated marriage officer who performs weddings at the clerk's office. Call ahead to check the hours for performing ceremonies. You do not need an appointment, but you may want to call ahead just in case there is a waiting period or restrictions on same-sex marriages.
3. Minister (any religious group): Some religions have designated individuals who can perform weddings for members of their faith. Call the church to find out if they have someone available. You do not need an appointment, but you may want to call ahead just in case there is a waiting period or restrictions on same-sex marriages.
4. Family Member (any county): If you know someone who is ordained as a minister, that person can perform your wedding ceremony. Some counties have additional requirements for who can perform a marriage, such as proof of age and/or blood test.

Be sure to check with the county clerk's office where you will be getting married to see if they will accept a license from an online officiant.
