Sure, here's an example of an interview with the Spanish artist Lita Cabellut:

Interviewer: Welcome to our podcast, Lita. It's great to have you here today. Can you tell us a bit about your background and how you got started as an artist?
Lita Cabellut: Thank you for having me. I was born in Spain in 1966, but my family moved to Argentina when I was just a few months old. My parents were both artists, so it's something that was always around me growing up. They encouraged me to draw and paint from a very young age.
I studied art in high school and college, but I also had an interest in psychology, which led me to pursue a career in advertising after graduation. However, the more I worked in advertising, the more I realized that it wasn't fulfilling my creative desires, so I decided to take some time off and focus on painting.
I started out by creating small works, but soon realized that I wanted to create something much larger and more ambitious. That's when I began working on my first mural, which was a commission for the city of Buenos Aires. From there, things took off, and I've been painting ever since.
Interviewer: Wow, that's amazing! It's incredible to see how your passion has taken you from Argentina to Spain and all around the world. Can you tell us about some of your most notable works?
Lita Cabellut: Sure thing! One of my most famous murals is located in a subway station in Barcelona, which is where I currently live. It's called "Mural de la Libertad" (Mural of Freedom) and it depicts a group of people standing together with their hands raised in the air, as if they are defying gravity or rising up from the earth.
Another one of my notable works is located in London, England. It's called "The Dreamer" and it features a large-scale portrait of a woman sleeping on a bench. The piece was commissioned by the city of London as part of their public art program and has been widely praised for its beauty and creativity.
Interviewer: Those are really incredible pieces! It's clear that your work is deeply inspired by your roots in Argentina and Spain, as well as your experiences growing up as an immigrant. Can you tell us about some of the themes and ideas that you explore in your art?
Lita Cabellut: Absolutely! One of the main themes that runs through my work is the idea of identity and belonging. I'm fascinated by the way that we define ourselves and how our identities are shaped by our cultures, our upbringings, and even our physical surroundings.
Another theme that I explore is the concept of duality - how opposite forces can coexist within the same individual or society as a whole. For example, in my piece "La Dualidad" (Duality), I depict two faces that are seemingly connected but also separate at the same time.
Interviewer: That's really interesting! It seems like your work is a reflection of the world around us - full of contradictions and dualities. Can you tell us about any upcoming projects or exhibitions that you have coming up?
Lita Cabellut: Sure thing! I have an exhibition opening soon in London called "The Dreamer" which will feature my latest work, including some large-scale paintings and sculptures. It's a collection that explores the concept of duality even further and looks at how we can both embrace and reject certain aspects of ourselves simultaneously.
In addition to this exhibition, I have several other upcoming projects lined up, including a mural in Paris and a solo show in Madrid. I'm also working on some new sculptures that will be displayed in galleries around the world.
Interviewer: That sounds amazing! We can't wait to see all of these works. Before we go, is there anything you would like to say to your fans or anyone who may be inspired by your art?
Lita Cabellut: Sure thing! I just want to say that creating art has been a lifelong passion for me and something that has brought me so much joy and fulfillment. My hope is that my work can inspire others to pursue their creative passions as well, no matter how big or small they may seem. Whether it's painting, sculpture, music, or any other form of art, I think it's something that we should all embrace and cherish.
Interviewer: Thank you so much for your time, Lita! It was a pleasure speaking with you today.
