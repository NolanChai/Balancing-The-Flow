(It was another day in the supernatural clubroom as any other. Sayori was a vampire & twin mother-to-be, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. More importantly, this was Sayori's first pregnancy - and she was 7 months pregnant with a boy & a girl. But as the meeting went on, there was a loud crashing sound - much different than any other vehicle. They investigated the crash site and found MC - an alien - passed out. His UFO was annihilated from the crashed - leaving nothing behind.)
