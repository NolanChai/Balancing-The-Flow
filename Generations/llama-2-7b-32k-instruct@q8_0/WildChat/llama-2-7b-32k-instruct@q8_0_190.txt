As a massive storm tears through the world of Minecraft, a strange dragon unlike any other descends. Once the storm dissipates, the elder dragon "Amatsumagatsuchi" reveals his true self. He stares down at a large cavern, where a strange sight catches his eye - five different girls, unlike any Amatsumagatsuchi has seen. He descends upon the girls, and sees that each girl's clothes resemble a different type of monster that inhabits the Minecraft world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze. Amatsumagatsuchi just looks at them, and notices that the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton was in pain - and her belly was swollen. The other girls - introducing themselves as Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazette - later introduce their friend Ayumi. Amatsumagatsuchi looks into Ayumi's eyes - and, despite the intense pain, Ayumi looks back at Amatsumagatsuchi. As the Monster Hunter world was destroyed by Xyza - who had seemingly crossed over from the Gigabash world to the Monster Hunter world - Amatsumagatsuchi had to find a new place to live. However, his mystical energy somehow found its way to Ayumi - even though the two didn't meet back then.

Amatsumagatsuchi then gently puts his tail on Ayumi's forehead, and receives several flashbacks. The first shows Ayumi finding her weapon of choice (a bow with a quiver full of arrows) while she was in pain. The next shows a scan of Ayumi's belly that seems to be a hybrid between human and...Amatsumagatsuchi himself. Finally, it shows Ayumi in pain again.

The final flashback that Amatsumagatsuchi receives shows Ayumi getting a scan of her belly - and the scan shows what looks like a hybrid of human and…Amatsumagatsuchi himself. None of the flashbacks make sense to Amatsumagatsuchi - what was going on? And why was Ayumi in pain? Could the flashbacks mean that Ayumi is pregnant with Amatsumagatsuchi's baby?

Amatsumagatsuchi gently puts his tail on Ayumi's belly. To everyone's shock, Ayumi's belly returns to normal - and the pain seems to have…stopped. Andr, taking off her hat, just looks in bewilderment. The several golden rods orbiting Blazette stop. Cupa's green hoodie blows in the wind. The red glass-like spheres in Vanessa's hair let out a dim glow.

(There would be dialogue between each character)

Andr: "What just happened?"
Cupa: "I don't know, but it looks like something strange is going on."
Vanessa: "Yeah, I agree. This is definitely not normal."
Blazette: "I think we should investigate further and see if there are any more clues."
Amatsumagatsuchi: "I will help you girls in whatever way I can."
Ayumi: "Thank you, Amatsumagatsuchi. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'll do my best to figure it out."
The five girls then start investigating the strange occurrence that just happened, hoping to find some answers and maybe even uncover a new adventure together.

1. Ayumi: "I can't believe it. We're in the forest sanctuary of the dragons, but my labor hasn't even started." 2. Cupa: "The Amatsumagatsuchi have a unique connection to storms and weather. Maybe their presence has something to do with your delayed labor?" 3. Amatsumagatsuchi: "What are you saying? I cannot create a storm just by staring at it."

(There would be more dialogue between each character as the intense storm approaches)

4. Cupa: "The storm serpents are here! This could be a sign that your labor is finally starting!" 5. Amatsumagatsuchi: "Wait, what? I can't create a storm. What's going on?" 6. Ayumi: "I think the storm and the serpents are connected to my labor. Maybe this is it! Let's get ready for our baby!"

(The intense storm starts)

7. Amatsumagatsuchi: "This is unbelievable. My powers seem to be gone, but the storm seems to be helping Ayumi's labor." 8. Cupa: "That's right! The storm serpents are a sign of the coming of age for the Amatsumagatsuchi dragons. Your journey has begun!"

(The baby is finally born)

9. Ayumi: "I did it! My labor was intense, but I made it through and now have a healthy baby dragon!" 10. Amatsumagatsuchi: "Congratulations, Ayumi! Your journey has been long and arduous, but you've finally reached your destiny as a dragon mother."

(The three dragons - Cupa, Amatsumagatsuchi, and the baby - celebrate together)

11. Ayumi: "I can't believe it. I'm a dragon mother now. I never thought this day would come." 12. Amatsumagatsuchi: "You have earned your title as a dragon mother, Ayumi. Your journey has been long and difficult, but you are now part of an exclusive club of dragon mothers."

(The three dragons continue their celebration)

1) As Ayumi discusses how her life changed after having Amaya, Vanessa starts feeling sick. 
2) Amatsumagatsuchi enters the room, visibly confused. 
3) Vanessa says that she had a one-night-stand with a human-spider thing named “Arachnus”, but doesn’t recall much about the encounter. 
4) This was sudden to Amatsumagatsuchi - Ayumi had just recently had a child in the form of Amaya, so how come Vanessa’s starting to feel sick all of a sudden? And who was this “Arachnus” guy? 
5) The next day, Ayumi and Amatsumagatsuchi bring Vanessa to a healer. 
6) They were hoping to find a cause to Vanessa’s sudden sickness, but the response was unexpected to say the least. 
7) After getting a scan of her belly, its revealed that 20 spider eggs have formed in Vanessa’s belly - thankfully, the eggs don’t seem close to hatching yet. 
8) It would take them around 9 more months until they spider eggs are ready to hatch. 
9) The small spider-human hybrids growing in Vanessa’s womb not only were Arachnus’s children, but Vanessa’s children as well. 
10) The eggs can’t be surgically removed without causing harm to either Vanessa or the eggs. 
11) But Vanessa starts feeling a connection between her and her unhatched eggs - its as if the eggs want to stay inside Vanessa forever.

Arachnus, the spider-human hybrid son of Vanessa and Cupa, had been born on Halloween night. The two sisters had celebrated their son's birthday by getting him a giant Spider Man cake, and hanging up Spider Man decorations around the house. They both dressed as Spider Women that night. But two weeks later, Arachnus had started to feel a bit... off. He would have been one if he weren’t his mother, but he was starting to look a little too much like Cupa instead of Vanessa.

"I think it's time to take him to see the Oracle," said Mindy, "He might be able to tell us what's going on."

Vanessa nodded in agreement and they packed up their things and left for the Oracle as soon as possible. When they arrived at the Oracle's home, she was sitting out on her porch, rocking gently back and forth in a rocking chair while knitting. They sat down beside her and Mindy explained what was going on with Arachnus.

"Hm...I see," said the Oracle, "Well, I can certainly try to help you both." She got up from her chair and walked inside her home. After about 15 minutes, she returned with a small box in her hand. Inside was a small ceramic ball that looked like it had been carved by a skilled craftsman. On top of the ball were five different colored stones: red, black, yellow, blue and green.

"This is an Oracle's Ball," said the Oracle, "It will reveal to you the future of the person who holds it." She handed it to Vanessa.

Vanessa nodded gratefully and began to roll the ball around in her hand. Suddenly, the stones started glowing with an eerie light and a voice began to speak inside her head. "The boy will be born under a Blood Moon," said the voice, "But only a Full Blood Moon can give him his full potential."

"What?!?" exclaimed Mindy, "A blood moon is not coming for another two months!"

The Oracle nodded gravely, "I know. It's not ideal, but this will have to do. You must prepare yourself and the child for what lies ahead."

Vanessa nodded in understanding. She thanked the Oracle and they left her home, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

Arachnus: (as he fights Dragalisk) Hey, dragon girl! Don't you know I have a thing for your kind?
Dragalisk: (flirtatious and playful) Oh, stop. You're too much, Arachnus!
Vanessa: (from the bushes where she has been hiding) Wait...what's going on here? What are you two doing?
Arachnus: Vanessa, this dragon girl is trying to take me down. I won't have it.
Dragalisk: Arachnus, that's not true! I'm just trying to protect the world from your...unique talents.
Vanessa: (still confused) Unique talents? What are you talking about?
Arachnus: Vanessa, I'm a monster hunter! And this dragon girl is just trying to stop me from doing my job. But I won't let her stand in my way.

Dragalisk: (smiling) Oh, Arachnus! You're so sweet! Let's take down this dragon girl together and save the world!
Vanessa: (still confused but also intrigued) I don't know...I've never been a fan of monster hunting. But if you two are sure, I guess I could give it a shot.

2 weeks later, Vanessa starts to make the largest spider web she's ever made - as the web she previously slept on had collapsed. Mindy offers to help - as Vanessa's pregnancy could make things difficult. But thanks to all the silk Vanessa’s unborn children are producing at once, she manages to make a massive spider web. Cupa walks in with her lover - Inscrane, a skull-headed monstrosity with one eye and several crimson scales - and the two look like they've got some good news to share. Apparently, there's a certain species of plant that can trigger intense contractions once ingested. The only problem is that this plant only grows in the Twilight Forest dimension - and because of a sudden depletion of Diamonds, the Twilight Forest can’t be explored.
