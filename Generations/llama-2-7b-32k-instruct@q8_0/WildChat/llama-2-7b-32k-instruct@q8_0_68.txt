Sure, here's a basic recipe for a DIY smoke bomb using household ingredients:

1. Mix together equal parts baking soda and cornstarch in a bowl. This will create a powdery substance that will react with water to produce smoke when mixed.
2. Add 5-10 drops of food coloring (optional) to the mixture to give it a desired color.
3. Pour equal amounts of water into two separate plastic bags (about 1/4 cup each).
4. Take one bag and squeeze out any excess air, then seal it tightly. Repeat with the second bag.
5. Tie a string around both bags, making sure they are securely closed. This will serve as a handle for the smoke bomb when you're ready to use it.
6. Hold one of the sealed bags in your hand and twist off the lid of the other bag. Carefully pour a small amount (about 1/4 teaspoon) of the powdery substance into the center of the second bag, being careful not to spill any on your hands or clothing.
7. Twist the lid back on and shake it gently until the mixture is evenly distributed throughout the bag.
8. Tie both bags together securely with a piece of string or rope, leaving a long tail for you to hold onto when throwing the smoke bomb.
9. To activate the smoke bomb, twist off the lid and squeeze it firmly until the powdery substance breaks apart and creates a cloud of white smoke. Throw the smoke bomb towards your target area (such as a car) and watch it swell into a dense cloud of smoke.
10. Be careful not to throw the smoke bomb at anyone or anything that you don't want to be affected by the smoke, as it can cause irritation and discomfort. Also, make sure to dispose of the baking soda-cornstarch mixture safely after use, as it can be harmful if ingested or inhaled.

Keep in mind that this is a basic recipe and there are many variations you can try depending on your desired effect and personal preferences. You may also want to experiment with different ingredients and ratios to find the perfect combination for your needs. Additionally, it's important to note that homemade smoke bombs can be dangerous if not used properly, so use caution and follow all safety precautions when making or using them.
