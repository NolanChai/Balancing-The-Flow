Here is a possible answer to your question.

A "marching kingdom" is an imaginary concept that refers to a hypothetical political entity that would consist of people and land in which the monarch or ruler lives but has no actual physical territory. It is often used in science fiction, fantasy, and other genres where there are magical or futuristic societies or worlds.

The idea behind a marching kingdom is that it exists in some kind of parallel universe or alternate reality, where the monarch or ruler has the ability to project their consciousness or will into a physical realm without actually being present physically. This allows them to interact with the people and land in this other world, but they do not have any actual physical presence there.

In some stories, a marching kingdom is described as a kind of "virtual" or "phantasmic" state, where the ruler exists only in the minds and hearts of their subjects, and their power comes from the belief and loyalty of those who follow them. In other stories, it may be explained that the monarch has discovered a way to tap into a parallel dimension or alternate reality, where they can manifest their will and power in a physical form without actually being present physically in the real world.

Overall, the concept of a marching kingdom is often used as a way to create a fantastical or imaginative political system that can exist outside the usual constraints of time and space, and it allows authors to explore ideas about power, loyalty, and the nature of reality in unique and unconventional ways.
