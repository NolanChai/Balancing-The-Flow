1. Systems theory: This approach views organizations as interconnected parts that work together to achieve a common goal. It emphasizes the need to understand and manage complex systems, which are increasingly important in today's fast-paced, globalized world.

2. Contingency theory: This approach suggests that there is no one best management style or approach, but instead, managers must adapt their leadership style to meet changing circumstances. As the world becomes more complex and uncertain, contingency theory helps managers be flexible and responsive to the needs of their employees and customers.

Arguments in favor of Systems theory:

2. Improved customer satisfaction: When all parts of an organization are working harmoniously, it can lead to better products or services that meet the needs of customers more effectively.
Arguments in favor of Contingency theory: 
1. Adaptability: In today's fast-paced business environment, contingency theory helps managers be flexible and adaptable in responding to changing circumstances.
2. Customized approach: With a contingency approach, managers can tailor their leadership style to meet the unique needs of different employees or departments within an organization. This can lead to greater employee engagement and satisfaction.

First, we should acknowledge that there are different approaches to contemporary art. One approach is to focus on the most recent developments in art history and to consider how they reflect changing ideas about the role of art in society. Another approach is to examine the ways in which contemporary artists are responding to changes in technology and globalization, and to explore their use of new materials and techniques.

One of the key features of contemporary art is its emphasis on experimentation and innovation. Contemporary artists are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with art, exploring new forms and mediums, and challenging traditional notions of beauty and meaning. This can lead to some truly groundbreaking work, as artists explore new ways of expressing themselves and communicating their ideas to audiences.

Another key feature of contemporary art is its diversity. Contemporary art encompasses a wide range of styles and genres, from abstract expressionism to conceptual art, pop art to performance art. This diversity reflects the diverse interests and experiences of contemporary artists, who draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including popular culture, politics, technology, and science.

Another key feature of contemporary art is its engagement with social and political issues. Contemporary artists often use their work to comment on current events and to raise awareness about important social and political issues, such as environmentalism, human rights, and gender equality. This can take many forms, from large-scale installations to smaller, more intimate works of art.

Finally, contemporary art is also characterized by its accessibility. Unlike some earlier forms of art, which were often seen as being exclusive or elitist, contemporary art is designed to be understood and appreciated by a wide range of people, regardless of their background or education. This has made it an important tool for artists to communicate their ideas to audiences in new and innovative ways.

In conclusion, contemporary approaches to art encompass a wide range of styles, genres, and themes that reflect the diverse interests and experiences of contemporary artists. These approaches are characterized by their emphasis on experimentation, diversity, engagement with social and political issues, and accessibility to broad audiences. They have made art an important tool for communication, self-expression, and cultural understanding in the modern world.
