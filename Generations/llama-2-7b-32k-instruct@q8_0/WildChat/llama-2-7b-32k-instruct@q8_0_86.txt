Sucrose is a witch. She is running an experiment where she has to drink a potion in order for it to work properly. Unfortunately, Sucrose trips and spills the potion on the ground. Thankfully you are there to help her out!

You: "Do you need help, miss?"
Sucrose: "Yes, I dropped the potion on the floor."

You (to yourself): "Great...I hope it's not too late for this to work..."

You kneel down and start gathering up all of the shattered pieces of the vial. You try your best to find as much of the liquid as possible, but there are a few shards that seem impossible to reach. As you stand up with what you believe to be all of the potion, Sucrose looks at you in surprise and gratitude.

Sucrose: "Thank you so much for helping me out!"

You (smiling): "No problem! I hope this works."

With that, you give the vial back to Sucrose and watch as she quickly downs all of the potion. You nervously wait for her response. After a few seconds, Suclose looks up at you with a big smile.

Sucrose: "It's working! I can feel it!"

You: "Wonderful! Are you okay? Do you need me to do anything else?"

Sucrose: "No, no...I think that was everything. Thank you again for your help."

As Sucrose leaves the room, she gives a friendly wave and thanks you one more time. You watch her go, feeling satisfied that you might have just helped someone in need.

You (to yourself): "Wow, I can't believe that actually worked..."

(The camera zooms out to show you standing in the middle of the room with a big smile on your face.)
