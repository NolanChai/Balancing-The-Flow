Yes, it is possible to achieve this using VBA code. Here is a sample code that should accomplish what you're looking for:
```
Sub SearchAndDisplay()
    Dim ws As Worksheet: Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
    Dim colB As Range: Set colB = ws.Range("B5", ws.Range("B" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp))
    Dim colH As Range: Set colH = ws.Range("H5", ws.Range("H" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp))
    Dim serviceFound As Boolean
    
    ' Loop through column B and check for "Service"
    For Each rw In colB
        If rw.Value Like "*Service*" Then
            serviceFound = True
            Exit For
        End If
    Next rw
    
    ' If a value was found, then loop through column H and find the earliest date
    If serviceFound Then
        Dim earliestDate As Date
        For Each rw In colH
            If IsEarliestDate(rw.Value, earliestDate) Then
                Exit For
            End If
        Next rw
        
        ' Display the earliest date in cell H3
        Range("H3").Value = earliestDate
    End If
End Sub
```
This code assumes that your worksheet is named "Sheet1" and that you have two columns, B (containing text values) and H (containing dates). The code will first loop through column B and check for any cells that contain the value "Service". If a value is found, it will set a variable called `serviceFound` to `True`.

Next, the code will loop through column H and check for any rows where the date in cell H is the earliest. It does this by comparing the current date with a variable called `earliestDate`, and if it finds a row where `earliestDate` is less than or equal to the date in cell H, it will exit the loop.

Finally, the code will display the earliest date found in cell H3.

Note that this code uses the `Like` operator to search for cells that contain "Service" in column B. If you want to search for a different value instead of "Service", you can simply change the line `If rw.Value Like "*Service*" Then` to suit your needs.

A1 = 'Sheet 2'

=IF(A1="", "Sheet 1", A1)


A1 = 'Sheet 3'

=IF(A1="", "Sheet 1", A1)

A2 = 'Sheet 4'

=IF(A2="", "Sheet 1", A2)


A2 = 'Sheet 5'

=IF(A2="", "Sheet 1", A2)


A3 = 'Sheet 6'

=IF(A3="", "Sheet 1", A3)


A3 = 'Sheet 7'

=IF(A3="", "Sheet 1", A3)


A4 = 'Sheet 8'

=IF(A4="", "Sheet 1", A4)

1. Open the VBA Editor by going to Tools > Macro > Visual Basic Editor (Alt + F11)
2. Insert the following code in the editor and save it as "ServicedPopup.vba":
    Sub Popup_Serviced()
        MsgBox "Please ensure that an identical Service is created with a Next Service Due Date after changing this to Serviced", , "Popup Message"
    End Sub
3. Now, open your Excel workbook and go to the Visual Basic Editor (Alt + F11). Click on Insert > Module in the editor.
4. Paste the code you copied earlier into the module and save it.
5. In the worksheet that contains column B, insert a new button with the following code:
    Private Sub Button1_Click()
        Call Popup_Serviced
    End Sub
6. Save your changes and close the Visual Basic Editor.
7. Now, when you change any cell in column B to "Serviced" without creating a Service with a Next Service Due Date, a popup window will appear with the message you specified.
