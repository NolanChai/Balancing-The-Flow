It looks like you're trying to renew your license online. However, it seems that the information provided was incomplete or incorrect, and there was a mistake in the process.

To renew your license, you need to provide some additional details, such as your driver's license number, date of birth, and address. You can also check the status of your license by visiting the DMV website and using their online services.

Here are the steps you should follow to renew your license:

1. Visit the DMV website and click on "Renew Your License."
2. Enter your driver's license number, date of birth, and address.
3. Click on the "Next" button to proceed.
4. Review the information you provided and ensure it is accurate.
5. Pay the renewal fee using a credit or debit card.
6. Print the receipt for your records.
7. Within 2-4 weeks, you should receive a new license in the mail at the address you provided.

If you encounter any issues or have any further questions, you can contact the DMV customer service center by phone or visit their office in person. They will be able to help you with any questions or concerns you may have about renewing your license.

It's important to note that renewing your license is a mandatory requirement for driving legally on public roads, so it's crucial to make sure you take the necessary steps to ensure your license remains valid.

Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you had trouble understanding our initial response. Let me try to explain it in another way:

When you purchase an annual membership with Chris Milam, your license is renewed automatically each year on the day you purchased it. For example, if you bought a one-year membership on January 1st, your license would be renewed on January 1st of the following year.

If you purchased a monthly membership, your license will be renewed every 30 days from the date of purchase. So, if you purchased a monthly membership on August 2nd, your license would be renewed again on September 3rd.

I hope this helps clarify things! Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Best regards,
Chris Milam Support Team.
