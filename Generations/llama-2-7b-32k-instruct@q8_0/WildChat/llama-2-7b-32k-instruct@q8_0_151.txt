Sayori: "Good evening, everyone! I hope you don't mind that we have another member joining us tonight. Monika, this is Natsuki, the angel."

Monika: "Hello, Natsuki-san! It's nice to meet you."

Natsuki: "Likewise, Monika-chan." (She notices Sayori's pregnancy) "Oh my, congratulations on your new additions!"

Sayori: "Thank you, Natsuki-san! It's our first time having kids. We're still figuring things out."

Natsuki: "I can imagine how exciting and overwhelming it must be. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll both do a great job!"

Sayori: "Thank you so much for your kind words, Natsuki-san. We really appreciate it."

Monika: "I'm glad we have such an encouraging group of friends to help us out. It makes all the difference."

Natsuki: "Absolutely! And don't worry about the fact that one of your kids will be a hybrid. That's something special, and they'll grow up to be just as unique as you are."

Sayori: "I really appreciate that, Natsuki-san. It means a lot to hear such positive words from someone like you."

Monika: "We feel the same way, Natsuki-chan. Thank you for always being there for us!"

Natsuki: "No problem! I'm happy to help out in any way I can. So, what's on the agenda for tonight?"

Sayori: "Well, we have a few things we want to discuss. First off, Monika and I need some advice on raising our kids."

Monika: "That's right! We're not sure how to balance parenting with being a student and a club member at the same time."

Natsuki: "Well, I can definitely relate to that. I'm an angel, but I still have my own struggles with balancing my duties and responsibilities. It's all about finding ways to make it work for you."

Sayori: "That sounds promising. Can you give us some specific examples?"

Natsuki: "Sure! One thing I've found helpful is creating a schedule and sticking to it as much as possible. Make sure to prioritize your club activities and homework, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it."

Monika: "That sounds like something we can do. We'll make sure to set aside some time every day just for studying and homework."

Natsuki: "Excellent! And don't forget about your social life too. It's important to have fun and relaxation time, especially as parents."

Sayori: "Thank you, Natsuki-san. That sounds like a great plan. We really appreciate your advice."

Monika: "We're glad we could count on you for support, Natsuki-chan. You're always so helpful and reassuring!"

Natsuki: "No problem! It's my pleasure to help out my friends. So, is there anything else you guys need help with?"

Sayori: "Well, we also wanted to ask your opinion on a few things. We were thinking of maybe giving our kids English names in addition to their Japanese ones."

Monika: "That sounds interesting! Do you have any particular names in mind?"

Natsuki: "I do! I've always loved the name 'Ellen' for a girl, and I think it would be a great choice for your daughter. For your son, how about 'William'? It's classic but still has a modern feel to it."

Sayori: "Thank you so much for your ideas! We'll definitely consider them when the time comes."

Monika: "I really appreciate your input, Natsuki-chan. I think we can trust your judgment."

Natsuki: "Of course! It was my pleasure to help out in any way I could. So, how are you all doing otherwise? Anything new happening in your lives?"

Sayori: "Well, I'm almost eight months pregnant now and starting to feel a bit uncomfortable."

Monika: "I can imagine! That must be tough."

Natsuki: "Believe me, I know. But remember that the discomfort is worth it in the end. You're going to have two beautiful babies to show for it!"

Sayori: "Thanks, Natsuki-san. That really cheers me up."

Monika: "I'm glad to hear that! We appreciate your support and encouragement too."

Natsuki: "No problem! It's my job as a friend to be there for you all. So, don't hesitate to call on me if you need anything else!"

Sayori: "Thank you so much, Natsuki-san. We really appreciate it."

Monika: "We feel the same way! It's great having such a supportive friend like you around."

Natsuki: "Of course! And don't worry about anything - I'll always be there for you!"
