This issue occurs due to the fact that PyTorch is unable to load C++ extensions, specifically the utils module. The solution involves ensuring that the utils module is properly installed and loaded by PyTorch.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. Install the utils module using pip: You can try installing the utils module using pip by running `pip install torch-utils`. This will ensure that the utils module is installed along with PyTorch.
2. Update your Torch installation: If you're using a custom setup, you may need to update your Torch installation to include the latest version of the utils module. You can do this by running `pip install torch-utils` and then reinstalling PyTorch with `torch -install`.
3. Check for conflicting versions: Sometimes, older versions of PyTorch may conflict with newer versions of the utils module. If you're using an older version of PyTorch, you may need to upgrade to a newer version. You can do this by running `pip install torch` and then upgrading your Torch installation by running `torch -upgrade`.
4. Check for missing dependencies: The utils module may be missing certain dependencies that are required for it to work correctly. You can try checking the installation instructions for the utils module to ensure that all necessary dependencies are present.
5. Disable the utils module: If none of the above solutions work, you can try disabling the utils module by adding `utils=None` to your Torch script's configuration file (`torch.config.load_from_file`). This will prevent PyTorch from trying to load the utils module and may resolve the error.

Please note that the solution above is a generic one, you should check if it applies to your specific use case by looking into the error message and the stack trace.

Also, I would like to mention that this issue might also occur because of other reasons such as the utils module being installed in a different directory or having an outdated version of PyTorch, so you should check the installation steps and make sure everything is up-to-date.

Lastly, if none of the above solutions work, I would suggest reaching out to the Torch community for further assistance by joining the official Discord server, where there are many knowledgeable individuals who can help you resolve the issue.
