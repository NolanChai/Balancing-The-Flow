My apologies for the harshness of my previous response. It's true that changes to a game or product can be frustrating, especially when they go against what we're used to. However, it's important to remember that companies have the right to make decisions about their products, and we as consumers have the power to choose whether or not we support those decisions through our purchasing choices. 

While I understand that people may feel passionately about certain issues, it's important to avoid using accusations of "censorship" or other sensationalized language when discussing these matters. Such language can be inflammatory and may not accurately reflect the situation. It's also worth considering that changes to a game or product may have been made for legitimate reasons, such as to improve the overall experience, fix bugs, or address concerns from players.

Ultimately, while we all have our own opinions and perspectives, it's important to approach discussions about games and products in a respectful and civil manner. We can disagree without being disagreeable, and we can work together to find common ground and share our interests and concerns in a constructive way.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope this message finds you well.

Sincerely,

People are more likely to be persuaded by a message when it is delivered by someone they perceive as trustworthy and credible. Here are some suggestions for how to make your text more persuasive: 

1. Use the proper tone: The tone of your message should match the level of formality required for the situation. A casual, friendly tone might work well in a personal message, but something more formal may be appropriate for a professional or business communication. 
2. Be clear and concise: Make sure your message is easy to understand. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that could confuse the recipient. 
3. Show, don't tell: Instead of stating a point directly, provide examples or illustrations to support it. This can help make the point more memorable and convincing. 
4. Use personal anecdotes: Sharing a personal story related to your message can make it more relatable and emotional for the recipient. 
5. Highlight benefits, not features: Instead of focusing on the features of your product or service, emphasize its benefits and how they will improve the recipient's life or business. 
6. Use social proof: Share testimonials from satisfied customers to demonstrate the effectiveness or credibility of your product or service. 
7. Use visual aids: Including images, videos, or other visual elements in your message can make it more engaging and memorable for the recipient. 
8. Follow up: If your message doesn't result in the desired action, follow up with the recipient to reiterate your point and provide additional information or support. 
9. Offer a solution: Instead of just pointing out a problem, offer a solution that addresses the issue and demonstrates how it can be solved. 
10. End with a call-to-action: Close your message by clearly stating what you want the recipient to do next, such as visiting a website, making a purchase, or taking some other specific action.
