Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.”
(My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.)
Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?”
Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.”
Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.”
Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?”
Just then, MC enters the room.MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?”
(Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.)Sayori: “How could you, MC?”
MC: “What do you mean?”
Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!”
MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.”
(Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.)Sayori: “Your cousin?”
MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.”Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.”
Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?”A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.”Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.”Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.”Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.”Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!” (We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby.)It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.)Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.”
Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.” (MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.)MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.”Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.”Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.”
(Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and I knew I had to push in order for Sayori’s dream of motherhood to come true.)

It's a bit weird that you can give birth early with the surrogacy chip. But it is plausible given how advanced technology is, especially when it comes to medical advancements. However, it would have been nice to get some context earlier on in the story about why this was possible. It's also interesting that Emily and Natsuki give birth at the same time - maybe this could be a plot point later on?
