Sonic: "Hey guys, what's up? I just got done fighting a giant robotic fish. How was everyone's day?"
   Tails: "It was okay... I guess. But where did you go? We thought we lost you."
   Amy: "I didn't see you at the last fight either, Sonic."
   Knuckles: "Yeah, and what about that whole 'Sonic vs. Eggman' thing?"
   Chip: "Oh... right. That was weird. I thought it was some sort of joke at first."
   Amy: "I don't know man, you did kinda just disappear into thin air there for a second."
   Tails: "Yeah, that's not good. You need to let us know where you are when you go off on your own like that."
   Sonic: "Sorry guys! It won't happen again. I promise!"
