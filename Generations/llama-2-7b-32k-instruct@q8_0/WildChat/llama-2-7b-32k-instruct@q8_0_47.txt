Yes, the given SQL query has some issues. Here are some possible errors:

1. The `local` keyword is used incorrectly in this context. It should not be used with a string literal or as an identifier. Instead, you can use double quotes or single quotes to enclose the string literals. For example:
```
string = "Hello World!"
local sql = stringformat("update club_info set %s = '%s' where cid = %d", field_name, value, cid)
```
2. The `stringformat()` function is not used correctly. It takes three arguments: the format string, the arguments to be substituted in the format string, and an optional fourth argument that specifies the locale. In this case, you are using it like a string interpolation function, which is not its intended use. Instead, you can use a normal string concatenation operator (`+`) or a string formatting function (e.g., `format()`) to achieve the same result.
```
sql = string + "set %s = '%s' where cid = %d"
```
3. The field name is not enclosed in quotes. It should be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, depending on your choice of string interpolation or concatenation operator.
```
field_name = 'field_name'
sql = string + "set '%s' = '%s' where cid = %d"
```
4. The `cid` variable is not enclosed in quotes. It should be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, depending on your choice of string interpolation or concatenation operator.
```
cid = 123
sql = string + "set %s = '%s' where cid = %d"
```
Here is a corrected version of the SQL query:
```
string = "update club_info set `%s` = '%s' where cid = %d"
sql = stringformat(string, field_name, value, cid)
```
This should work correctly.
