摘要：本文是一篇关于油井具件的修复工作的报告。该工作涉及到一个位于阿拉斯加北部的油田，其中有一个较古老的油井需要进行修复工作。

The well was shut in for 23 years, since the end of production in 1986. The well has been producing again with 50 bar WHP and 47 bar CP. Fresh water injection had to be increased from 6m/d to 10 m / d on January 4th at night.
▪After the test the pipe was cleaned by acidization of the 3.5”-2.875” annulus and fresh water was injected through that 3.5” – 2.375” annulus in order to produce on 2.375” tubing.
▪Fresh water was injected through the 3.5” - 2.375" annulus and oil was produced on 2.375" tubing.
The well flowed with no problems Monday night (14-Sep) and Tuesday, WHP = 35bar, CP=30bar, MA=27bar, FLP=17bar, INJ Rate=6m / d, but the morning Wed (16-Sep) the MA (inj.) pressure dropped off to 0bar, and the CP began dropping as well. By 12:00 the same day the WHP=20bar, CP=0bar, MA=0bar. At night the same day the inj. rate was put back to 6m / d then to 3m/d.

The final conclusion is that the well flowed with no problems Monday and Tuesday when the fresh water injection (FWI) rate was set at 10 m / d, but on Wednesday it began experiencing issues due to a reduction in FWI rate from 6 m / d down to 3 m/d.

The writer suggests that further analysis of the well's production data be conducted in order to better understand the reasons for the decline in production rates and determine how best to address these issues moving forward.

Overall, this report highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining oilfield equipment in order to ensure optimal production and prevent any potential downtime or damage.
