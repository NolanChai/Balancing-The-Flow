It seems like there is a issue with the way the XML data is being parsed. Here's a suggestion to fix it:

1. Use `simplexml_load_file` instead of `simplexml_load_string`. This will load the XML file from the given path instead of reading the contents of the string into memory.
2. Use `DOMDocument::loadXML` method to parse the XML file. It will return a DOM document object, which you can then use to access the XML data.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code:
```
$path = "https://en.softonic.com/sitemap-article_news.xml";
$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom->loadXML(file_get_contents($path));
$latest_from_softonic = new StdClass;
$latest_from_softonic->url = array();
$latest_from_softonic->title = array();
foreach ($dom->documentElement->childNodes as $node) {
    if ($node instanceof DOMElement && $node->tagName == 'url') {
        $latest_from_softonic->url
