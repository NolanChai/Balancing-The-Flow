Context: In the animated teen series "Jane," Jane's older sister, Andrea, is getting arrested. Here's a possible dialogue for a scene involving this event:

[Scene opens with Jane and her family sitting in their living room watching TV. The doorbell rings, and Andrea enters the room.]

Andrea: (excitedly) Hey, guys! I'm home! [Jane and her family look up to see Andrea smiling and waving at them.]

[The family looks confused as to why Andrea is so happy.]

Mom: Uh...what are you so excited about? Did something good happen?

Andrea: (excitedly) Oh, yeah! I'm getting arrested! [Everyone looks shocked at Andrea. She laughs and starts dancing around the room.]

[Jane rolls her eyes and groans under her breath.]

Dad: (serious) Andrea, that's not funny. You need to stop joking about things like that. It's not appropriate. [Andrea stops dancing and looks at her dad sadly.]

[The family tries to talk to Andrea, but she keeps interrupting them with silly comments and jokes about getting arrested. Finally, the police arrive at the door.]

Officer: (serious) We're here to arrest Andrea Johnson for unrelated charges. [Andrea looks surprised and nervous.]

[The officers take Andrea away, and the family watches as she gets into the police car.]

Mom: I don't understand what's going on. What did Andrea do?

Dad: (frustrated) I don't know, but we need to get a lawyer for her. [Jane looks up at her parents worriedly.]

[The scene ends with the family sitting in their living room, still confused and worried about what happened to Andrea.]
