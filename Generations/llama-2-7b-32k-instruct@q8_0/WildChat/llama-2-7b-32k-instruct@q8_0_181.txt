A futuristic world dominated by positivism could look something like this:

The city is made up of sleek, modern buildings that are designed to be efficient and practical. The streets are filled with autonomous cars and trucks that run on clean energy, and there are no traditional gas-powered vehicles to be seen. The air is clean and fresh, thanks to the use of renewable energy sources.

The architecture of this city reflects the positive values of positivism. Buildings are designed to be functional and practical, with an emphasistic on simplicity and efficiency. There are no ornate decorations or unnecessary features, but instead a focus on minimalism and streamlined design. This creates a sense of purity and simplicity that is reflected in the overall appearance of the city.

In the center of the city, there is a large monument to Auguste Comte, which has been blown up from a nearby building. This represents the elevation of positivist ideals to the level of a religious icon, with Comte seen as a sort of godlike figure who provides guidance and inspiration for the citizens of this city.

The use of futuristic technology is also reflected in the way that people interact with the city. For example, instead of traditional currency, there are digital wallets that are used to make payments and purchases. The city is also fully automated, with robots and machines taking care of tasks that would normally be done by humans.

Overall, this futuristic world dominated by positivism is a utopian vision of what society could look like if technology were to advance further, and human values such as positivity and practicality were to guide our progress.
