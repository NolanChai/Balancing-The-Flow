2637.195 rounded to three significant figures would be 2640

To do this, we first write down the number without any decimal places: 2637.
Next, we move the decimal point two places to the right, which means we add a zero to each digit after the decimal point: 2637.195
Finally, we round the result to three significant figures by dropping the least significant digit (the one furthest from the decimal point) and keeping only the first two digits that are closest to the decimal point. This gives us a rounded result of 2640.

It seems that there is a mistake in the provided information. The mass of chocolate chips + bag should be equal to the total weight of the bag, which is 2751 grams, not 2041 grams. Therefore, we can't calculate the number of chocolate chips in the bag using this information.

However, if we assume that there are 2041 grams of chocolate chips in the bag, then we can calculate the number of chocolate chips by dividing the mass of the chocolate chips by their individual mass:

Number of Chocolate Chips = (Mass of Chocolate Chips / Mass of 1 Chocolate Chip)
= (2041 grams / 31 grams)
= 67.589 chocolate chips in the bag

Therefore, based on this assumption, there are approximately 67 chocolate chips in the bag. However, as mentioned earlier, it's important to note that there is likely an error in the original information provided.

Given: The mass of crackers is estimated to be 924 grams. The mass of 27 crackers is 24 grams, and the mass of the box only is 328 grams. There are approximately 106 crackers in the box. Round your answer to two decimal places using significant figures.

There are approximately 106 crackers in the box because we can calculate the number of crackers per gram by dividing the mass of the crackers (924 grams) by the weight of a cracker (24 grams). This gives us approximately 38 crackers per gram, and since there are 106 crackers in total, this means that each cracker weighs around 3.5 grams.

Therefore, the number of crackers in the box is approximately 106, which can be rounded to 105 using two decimal places with significant figures. The correct answer is therefore: 105.

Alternatively, we can also use a combination of division and subtraction to arrive at the same result. We know that the total mass of the crackers is 924 grams, which means that there are approximately 924 / 38 = 23.6 crackers per gram. Since each cracker weighs around 3.5 grams, this gives us a total weight of 106 x 3.5 = 365 grams for the entire box of crackers. This is equivalent to approximately 105 crackers in the box.

Therefore, the number of crackers in the box can be rounded to 105 using two decimal places with significant figures. The correct answer is therefore: 105.

It's important to note that this calculation assumes that each cracker has a constant weight of 24 grams, which may not always be true. In some cases, the weight of individual crackers can vary slightly, but the method described above should still give us a good estimate of how many crackers are in the box.
