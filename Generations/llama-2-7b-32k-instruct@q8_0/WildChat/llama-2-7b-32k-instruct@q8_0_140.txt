It is the area of a smaller polar rectangle, divided by the area of the corresponding small rectangle in the , plane, in the limit as the size goes to zero.

The correct answer is option (A). The magnification factor r represents the ratio of the areas of two adjacent rectangles in the xy-plane and the rz-plane, respectively, in a double integral in polar coordinates. It is defined as the ratio of the area of a smaller polar rectangle to the corresponding small rectangle in the xy-plane, divided by the area of the same small rectangle in the z-plane. The limit as the size goes to zero refers to the case where the rectangles become infinitesimally small compared to each other.

In polar coordinates, a double integral is written as: ∫∫ f(r, θ) dr dθ . In this equation, r represents the radius of the circle in the xy-plane, and θ represents the angle between the positive x-axis and the radial line connecting the point (r, θ) to the origin. The function f(r, θ) represents a scalar field that can be integrated over both the radius r and the angle θ.

The magnification factor r is defined as:
r = |F| / |G|
Where F and G are the respective areas of the small rectangles in the xy-plane and the z-plane. The absolute value sign (|) indicates that the area is positive when the rectangle is clockwise, and negative when it is counterclockwise.

Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer because it correctly states the definition of the magnification factor r in terms of the areas of the small rectangles in the xy-plane and the z-plane. Option (B) is incorrect because it reverses the direction of the limit as the size goes to zero.

Option (C) is incorrect because it does not relate to the definition of the magnification factor r. The area of a small rectangle in the r,  plane, divided by the area of the corresponding small polar rectangle, would be equal to 1/r in the limit as the size goes to zero, which is not what the magnification factor represents.

Overall, option (A) correctly states the definition of the magnification factor r in terms of the areas of the small rectangles in the xy-plane and the z-plane, and thus is the correct answer.

(b) Sometimes.

In the context of calculus, fdA means "the derivative of area," which is a function that takes a function R^2->R and returns another function g:R^2->R . The derivative of this function at a point (x,y) in the domain would be defined as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(z) at z=x.

Therefore, if f:R^2->R is a bounded continuous function, then the derivative of that function at a given point can be evaluated, and it is a function g:R^2->R . However, whether or not this derivative exists at every point in the domain depends on the specific function f. For example, if f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 6, then g(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 9 does not exist for all values of x in R .

Therefore, the answer is (b) Sometimes. The derivative of a function may or may not exist at every point in its domain depending on the properties of the function and the context in which it is being evaluated.

The relation between triple integrals and volume can be described as follows: 

The triple integral of a function over a region is equal to the volume of that region, given the appropriate coordinates. This means that if we have a function f(x, y, z) and we want to find its three-dimensional volume V, we can calculate it by integrating f dV, where dV represents the three-volume element:

V = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x, y, z) r^2 sin \theta d x d y d z.

This formula can be generalized to higher dimensions, where we replace the three-dimensional sphere with a n-dimensional hyperplane, and the integral is taken over all space:

V = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) r^n sin \theta d x_1 d x_2 d x_3 ... d x_n.

In summary, the triple integral of a function over a region is equal to the volume of that region, given the appropriate coordinates and dimensions.

A: (c) Both are true.

The given triple integral is over the region 0≤x≤y≤z≤1 in the order dydzdx. Since we want to integrate with respect to z, we can set the lower limit of integration (z) equal to 0 and the upper limit equal to 1, giving us the range .
Therefore, the correct answer is choice (a).

In choice (b), the region is x≤y≤z≤x, which does not make sense.
Finally, in choice (c), the region y≤z≤x is incorrect because it would give an improper triple integral.

B. (1/2,1/2,1/2).  
It is not possible to find the center of mass without evaluating any integrals. The three choices given are all equally likely, as each corresponds to a different point in space that can be the center of mass. However, by choosing one choice and calculating its magnitude, we can eliminate two other possibilities. 
For example, if we choose option A and calculate its magnitude, we get x^3+y^3+z^3=1/5x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1/5 (2x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2) = 0. Therefore, we can eliminate the possibility that the center of mass is at (2/5, 2/5, 2/5). 
Similarly, if we choose option C and calculate its magnitude, we get x^3+y^3+z^3=1/5x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1/5 (2x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2) = 0. Therefore, we can eliminate the possibility that the center of mass is at (3/5, 3/5, 3/5). 
The only remaining possibility is option B, which corresponds to a point with magnitude x^3+y^3+z^3=1/2x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0. Therefore, the correct answer is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). 
It's worth noting that this question tests a student's ability to think critically and eliminate options without calculating any integrals. It also highlights the importance of mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills when working with physics concepts.
