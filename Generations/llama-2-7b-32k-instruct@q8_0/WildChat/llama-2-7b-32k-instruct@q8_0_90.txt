There are several reasons why "Demon Slayer" has been criticized for using the hanafuda earrings, while "Golden Kamuy" received little to no controversy. Here are some possible explanations:

1. Cultural appropriation: The use of traditional Japanese imagery such as the hanafuda earrings can be seen as cultural appropriation when used in a context that is not authentically Japanese. This can create a sense of discomfort and even offense among certain viewers, especially those who have experienced discrimination or marginalization based on their cultural heritage.
2. Historical context: The Imperial Japanese army has a complex history, including its involvement in World War II and the atrocities committed during that time. The use of imagery associated with this era, such as the Rising Sun flag, can be seen as glorifying or trivializing those events, which may contribute to the controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer."
3. Lack of context: While "Golden Kamuy" also uses the Rising Sun flag and has a cast that includes former Imperial Japanese soldiers, it is set in the pre-war period, before Japan's involvement in World War II. The series takes place in Hokkaido, where the Ainu people have traditionally lived, and the characters are not necessarily representative of the Imperial Japanese army. Therefore, there may be less controversy surrounding "Golden Kamuy" because the context in which it is set is different from that of "Demon Slayer."
4. Focus on individual characters: In "Demon Slayer," the use of hanafuda earrings may be seen as a way to emphasize Tanjiro's character traits, such as his kindness and innocence, rather than being associated with any particular historical period or group of people.
5. Different target audiences: "Demon Slayer" is primarily aimed at a younger audience, while "Golden Kamuy" has a more diverse target audience, including both young and adult fans. The differing focus on age groups may contribute to the varying levels of controversy surrounding each series.
6. Marketing strategies: The marketing strategies for "Demon Slayer" and "Golden Kamuy" may also play a role in shaping public perception. For example, "Demon Slayer" has had more mainstream exposure through media coverage, merchandising, and marketing campaigns, which may have influenced how people perceive the series.
7. Media bias: It's possible that there is a media bias towards criticizing "Demon Slayer" for its depiction of Japanese imagery, while "Golden Kamuy" is less scrutinized due to the fact that it has a different target audience or marketing strategies.
8. Historical significance: The Rising Sun flag has a significant historical significance in Japan and is associated with the Imperial Japanese army during World War II. However, some people may argue that using this imagery in a fictional context is not necessarily harmful, as it's just a symbol and not an actual representation of real events.
9. Cultural sensitivity: It's possible that there are certain cultural sensitivities around the use of Japanese imagery in entertainment, especially when it comes to historical periods or groups of people that have experienced discrimination or marginalization. Some viewers may be more sensitive to these issues and therefore, react differently to "Demon Slayer" compared to "Golden Kamuy."
10. Personal opinions: Finally, the controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer" may also depend on individual opinions and perspectives. Some people may not find any issue with the use of hanafuda earrings, while others may see it as problematic or offensive. Ultimately, these are all subjective views based on personal experiences and beliefs.

It's important to note that there is no clear-cut answer to why "Demon Slayer" received controversy over Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings, while "Golden Kamuy" received little to no controversy. However, by considering the different factors listed above, we can gain a better understanding of how context and cultural significance play a role in shaping public perception.

1. Context: The series "Ranking of Kings" has recently received controversy over a plot point that paints Japan's occupation of Korea in a positive light for the Japanese and a negative light for Koreans, despite its fictional locations (the series using real-life places but placing them in different continents). Meanwhile, the anime "Golden Kamuy" has been criticized less severely for its portrayal of Japan's occupation of half of Sakhalin, which was during the same era.
2. The question: Why did "Ranking of Kings" receive more criticism than "Golden Kamuy"? (Please note that this is a generalization and not all criticisms are based on race or ethnicity; some critics may have other reasons for their opinions.)
