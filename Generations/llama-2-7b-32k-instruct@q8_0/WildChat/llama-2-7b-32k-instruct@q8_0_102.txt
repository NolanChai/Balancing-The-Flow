Objective:
Students will be able to identify and describe the physical features of the Balkan Peninsula.

Materials:
* World map
* Images of different cities and landmarks in the Balkans (e.g., Belgrade, Athens, Istanbul)

Procedure:

1. Begin by showing the students a world map and asking them to identify where the Balkan Peninsula is located.
2. Provide background information on the history and culture of the region, highlighting its diverse ethnic groups, languages, religions, and customs.
3. Show images of different cities and landmarks in the Balkans, such as Belgrade (Serbia), Athens (Greece), and Istanbul (Turkey). Ask students to describe what they see in these images and identify any physical features they can observe.
4. Divide the class into small groups and distribute graphic organizers or note-taking sheets. Have each group identify and describe three physical features of the Balkan Peninsula, such as its mountains, rivers, coastline, and vegetation. Encourage students to use their observations from the images they viewed earlier.
5. Once each group has completed their list, have them share their findings with the class. Discuss any similarities or differences in physical features between different regions within the Balkan Peninsula.
6. Conclude by summarizing the main physical features of the Balkan Peninsula and highlighting its importance as a crossroads for trade, culture, and history. Encourage students to continue exploring this fascinating region in their geography studies.

Assessment:
