1. Adaptive leadership: The adaptive leadership framework has gained popularity in recent years due to its focus on creating a shared vision and building the capacity of individuals and organizations to adapt to complex challenges (Northouse, 2016). This approach is suitable for today's managers because it emphasizes collaboration, relationship-building, and empowering others to take ownership of their work. It encourages managers to lead from the front, role model desired behaviors, and create a supportive culture where individuals feel safe to take risks and learn from failure.
2. Agile management: The agile approach is suitable for today's managers because it emphasizes flexibility, customer satisfaction, and teamwork. It encourages managers to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, and to continuously evaluate and improve processes. Agile management also promotes a culture of continuous learning and innovation, which is essential in today's rapidly changing business environment (Satterfield et al., 2015).
