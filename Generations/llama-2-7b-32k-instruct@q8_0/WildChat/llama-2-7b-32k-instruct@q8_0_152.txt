"The Chess Institute leader said that she was not feeling well lately, so they replaced her." - William to Joseph  
Rose couldn't understand why William didn't try harder to get Rose into the competition despite knowing about it for a long time. She knew he had been trying to find opportunities for her and felt guilty that she wasn't able to take advantage of them. As she waited in line at the supermarket, she saw William who asked if she was enjoying her summer break.  
William approached her, smiling warmly and saying she looked like a sweet and sticky little darling. Rose always felt embarrassed after he had said that to her, and it wasn't until several years later when Joseph couldn't bear hearing him call her that way anymore and told William to stop.  
Karen came to visit Rose on her birthday with gifts. Rose was grateful for their company, especially since she didn't have much of a family to celebrate with. When they got into the elevator, they ran into William who had a smile as warm as ever, asking how school was going.  
Rose didn't seem any older than a high-schooler, and William called her that - "a sweet and sticky little darling." He then asked if she would like to come over later after everyone was done with the birthday celebration. Rose was grateful for his kindness and said yes.  
Rose, Karen, and Xu's parents arrived at their home in a large building. The moment they stepped into the elevator, Father Xu asked if she had gone to get her hearing checked. It seemed like he disapproved of everything about Rose, from her choice of career to how she spent her time.  
When Father Xu learned that she was deaf and couldn't speak, his attitude shifted drastically, becoming quite angry. He wanted to know why she didn't go to school or how old she was. He even asked if it wouldn't be better for her to go to college instead of playing chess all day. Rose became frightened by the outburst and left quickly before he could say anything else. She ran away feeling terrified.
