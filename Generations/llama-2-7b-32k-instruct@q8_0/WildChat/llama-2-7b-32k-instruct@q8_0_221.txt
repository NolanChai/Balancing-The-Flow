In order to create a component that can be reused to "like" and "dislike" products in Angular, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new module: Firstly, create a new module by using the `import` statement at the top of your file and importing the necessary modules, such as `CommonModule`.
2. Define the component interface: In this step, define an interface that describes the properties and methods that your component will have. For example:
```
interface ProductLikeDislikeComponent {
  productId: number; // The ID of the product that the user is liking/disliking
  liked: boolean; // Whether the product has been liked or not
  dislike(): void; // Function to dislike the product
  like(): void; // Function to like the product
}
```
3. Create a new component class: In this step, create a new class that implements the interface defined in step 2. Here's an example of what your component class might look like:
```
@Component({
  selector: 'product-like-dislike',
  template: '<button (click)="liked = !liked">{{ liked ? "Like" : "Dislike" }}</button>'
})
export class ProductLikeDislikeComponent implements ProductLikeDislikeComponent {
  productId: number; // The ID of the product that the user is liking/disliking
  liked: boolean; // Whether the product has been liked or not
  dislike() {
    this.liked = !this.liked;
  }
  like() {
    console.log('Product liked successfully');
  }
}
```
4. Use the component in your application: In this step, use the component in your application by importing it and injecting it into your desired view. Here's an example of how you might do this:
```
@ViewChild(ProductLikeDislikeComponent) productLikeDislikeComponent; // Get a reference to the component

<div>
  <h2>{{ product.name }}</h2>
  <button (click)="productLikeDislikeComponent.dislike()">Dislike</button>
</div>
```
In this example, we're importing the `ProductLikeDislikeComponent` interface and using it in a view that has a button with an event listener that calls the `dislike()` method when clicked. We've also injected the component into our view via the `@ViewChild` decorator.

5. Add logic to your component: In this step, add some logic to your component to handle liking and disliking products. For example, you might want to display a message that indicates whether or not the product has been liked:
```
@Component({
  selector: 'product-like-dislike',
  template: '<button (click)="liked = !liked">{{ liked ? "Like" : "Dislike" }}</button>'
})
export class ProductLikeDislikeComponent implements ProductLikeDislikeComponent {
  productId: number; // The ID of the product that the user is liking/disliking
  liked: boolean; // Whether the product has been liked or not

  constructor() { }

  dislike() {
    this.liked = !this.liked;
    console.log('Product disliked successfully');
  }

  like() {
    console.log('Product liked successfully');
  }
}
```
6. Add a service to handle liking and disliking: In this step, you'll want to add a service that can be used by your component to like or dislike products. This service will handle all of the logic for liking and disliking products, and it will return a promise that indicates whether or not the product was liked/disliked successfully.
```
@Injectable()
export class ProductService {
  private likedProducts = new BehaviorSubject([]); // An observable that stores the list of liked products

  addLike(productId: number) {
    this.likedProducts.next([...this.likedProducts, productId]);
  }

  removeLike(productId: number) {
    const index = this.likedProducts.indexOf(productId);
    if (index > -1) {
      this.likedProducts.removeAt(index);
    }
  }

  getLikedProducts() {
    return this.likedProducts.asObservable();
  }
}
```
7. Inject the service into your component: In this step, inject the `ProductService` into your component so that it can use
