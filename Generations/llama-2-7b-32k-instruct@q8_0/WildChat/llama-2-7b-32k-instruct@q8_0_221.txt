Monika: “Okay…while we’re waiting for MC to arrive…who’s up for a game of Truth or Dare?”

Sayori: “Ooh, count me in, Monika! I love Truth or Dare! It’s always so much fun!” (rubbing her baby bump) “Sure gets my mind off Sachiko’s kicks.”

Nobu: “I think it sounds like a blast, but I don’t know if that’d be appropriate for the MC to join in on.”

Monika: “Oh, come on! They’re just as much of a party animal as we are!”

MC: “Hey, you guys aren’t half as wild as I remember. And besides, it’s been so long since I played Truth or Dare that I’m down for anything.”

Nobu: “Well, if the MC is in on it too, then sure!”

Sayori: “Great! Let’s get this started!” (pausing) “Uh…Monika? Do you think we should maybe hold off until after the baby is born?”

Monika: “Nah, that’d be boring. Besides, I’m sure the MC won’t mind being asked to reveal their darkest secrets.”

Sayori: “True…I guess it’s fine as long as we keep it PG-13?”

MC: “Of course! I don’t want any of you thinking I have anything to hide!”

Nobu: “Fair enough. Let the games begin!” (starting the game)
