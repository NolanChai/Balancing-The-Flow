Plot: In 1963, as the world mourns the passing of Adolf Hitler, Germany is in chaos. The four men who were closest to him are vying for power: Albert Speer (Reinhard Giese), Martin Bormann (Klaus Kinski), Hermann Göring (Gustav Knuth) and Reinhard Heydrich (Freddy Schenker). They each have their own agendas, and they're not afraid to use violence to achieve their goals.

Speer is a reformist architect who believes in a peaceful, democratic Germany. He wants to build new cities that are modern and efficient, but he also wants to ensure that the country remains unified under one government. Bormann, on the other hand, is a conservative nationalist who believes in preserving the old ways. He thinks Germany should return to its traditional values of hierarchy and obedience, and he's willing to use force to make it happen.

Göring is a warhawk who believes in the glory of battle and the power of the Luftwaffe. He wants to rebuild the air force into a formidable fighting machine that can defeat any enemy, but he also has his eye on the country's wealth. He thinks Germany should become rich and powerful again, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

Heydrich is a sadistic SS officer who believes in the power of fear and intimidation. He wants to create a new order in Germany that's based on obedience and loyalty to the Nazi Party, and he's not afraid to use torture or execution to achieve his goals.

As the four men battle it out for control of Germany, they start to realize that their goals are not always aligned. Speer and Bormann both want to maintain Germany's unity, but they have different ideas about how to do it. Göring and Heydrich, on the other hand, are more interested in personal gain than in preserving the country's unity.

The film follows their struggle for power, as each man tries to outmaneuver the others and achieve his goals. There are betrayals, backstabbings, and ultimately, a violent showdown that will determine the future of Germany. The four kings of Nazi Germany - Albert Speer (Reinhard Giese), Martin Bormann (Klaus Kinski), Hermann Göring (Gustav Knuth) and Reinhard Heydrich (Freddy Schenker) - are about to face off in a battle for the soul of their country.

As the world watches, will Germany be able to rise from the ashes of war and become a modern, democratic nation, or will it descend into chaos and violence under the rule of its four kings? The fate of the country rests on their shoulders, but who will emerge victorious in the end?

The film culminates with the four men facing off against each other in a final showdown. Speer and Bormann are on one side, Göring and Heydrich on the other. The fate of Germany hangs in the balance as they engage in a battle of wits and strength. Who will emerge victorious? Will Germany be able to rise from the ashes of war and become a modern, democratic nation, or will it descend into chaos and violence under the rule of its four kings?

The film ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the audience wondering what will happen next. Will Göring and Heydrich emerge victorious, or will Speer and Bormann be able to defeat them in this final showdown? The fate of Germany hangs in the balance as the four men prepare for their final confrontation.
