Sure, here are some common patterns in treasury options trading:

1. Straddle: A straddle is a position that combines a long position in both a put and a call option on the same underlying asset, with the same expiration date and strike price. The idea behind the straddle is to profit from a large move in the underlying asset's price without necessarily knowing which direction it will move.
2. Strangle: A strangle is similar to a straddle, but instead of taking a position in both a put and call option, the trader takes positions in either puts or calls depending on the direction they think the underlying asset's price will move.
3. Iron Condor: An iron condor is a strategy that involves buying a put spread and selling a call spread with different strikes and expiration dates. The goal of an iron condor is to profit from a lack of movement in the underlying asset's price or a limited move in one direction.
4. Butterfly: A butterfly is a strategy that involves buying a call option and selling two put options with different strikes and expiration dates, creating a shape that resembles a butterfly. The goal of the butterfly is to profit from a limited move in the underlying asset's price.
5. Calendar Spread: A calendar spread is a strategy that involves buying a call option or put option with a longer-term expiration date and selling one with a shorter-term expiration date. The goal of the calendar spread is to profit from time decay, where the value of the option decreases as the expiration date approaches.
6. Diagonal Spread: A diagonal spread is a strategy that involves buying a call or put option with a longer-term expiration date and selling one with a shorter-term expiration date at a higher strike price. The goal of the diagonal spread is to profit from time decay and a limited move in the underlying asset's price.
7. Ratio Spread: A ratio spread is a strategy that involves buying or selling multiple options of different types (puts, calls, or both) with different strikes and expiration dates. The goal of the ratio spread is to profit from a limited move in the underlying asset's price while managing risk through the use of various strike prices and expiration dates.

These are just a few examples of treasury options trading strategies, and there are many other patterns that can be used depending on the trader's goals and risk tolerance.
