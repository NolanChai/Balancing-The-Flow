"A wizard with a magical anomaly that prevents him from directly casting spells is made fun of at until he discopts that a side-effect of his condition allows him to mass produce enchanted items."

I am not sure if the word "discopts" makes sense in this context, but I can help you correct it or provide a better suggestion. Please provide me with the sentence again so I can assist you further.
