Flame: "My name is Flame. I'm a monster rider. I've travelled across many different regions of the New World. But more importantly, I'm the only person in Mahana Village with two Elder Dragons by my side."

Flame: "I was raised in Kamura Village - which was under attack at the time of my birth. And due to my fascination with the bow weapon type, I became Kamura's top archer."

Flame: "But enough about my past - its time that I introduced you to my monsties."

Flame: "I have 2 Flying Wyverns, 1 Temnoceran, 1 Leviathan, and of course 2 Elder Dragons. In terms of attack style, I have two monsties for every type - two for Power, two for Speed, and two for Technical."

Flame: "Each attack style has one non-elder dragon and one elder dragon, except Speed - which has my Leviathan and my other Flying Wyvern, with my Speed-based Flying Wyvern also being my ace. And by the time I call my ace, watch out for the bombs he drops from the sky."

Flame: "My first power-based monstie is a Dreadking Rathalos - his name is Lord X. And since I have a power-based monstie named Lord X, then I've got to have one named MX, as well."

Flame: "This is where my most dangerous power-based monstie comes in - my unstoppable Nergigante."

Flame: "For the Technical-based monsties, my Temnoceran is a Nerscylla - I named her Dark. But sometimes, Dark just doesn't get the job done."

Flame: "As such, I've decided that if my enemy isn't afraid of darkness, then I'd drop the temperature around them - and this is where my second Technical-based monstie, her name is Valkyrie by the way, comes in."

Flame: "And as you would have guessed, the monstie that I've given the name Valkyrie is an Elder Dragon. But not just any Elder Dragon - the Iceborne Elder Dragon!"
