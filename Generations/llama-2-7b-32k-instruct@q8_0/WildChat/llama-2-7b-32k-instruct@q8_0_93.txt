1. Use the ping command to test connectivity between the client and server. You can use the following code snippet:
```csharp
string ip = "localhost"; // replace with the IP address of your server
using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```
2. Use the IP address of your server and test connectivity between the client and server using a TcpClient object. You can use the following code snippet:
```csharp
string ip = "192.168.0.2"; // replace with the IP address of your server
using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```

```csharp
string ip = "192.168.0.2"; // replace with the IP address of your server
using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```

using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```

using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```
6. Use the ping command to test connectivity between the client and server. You can use the following code snippet:
```csharp
string ip = "192.168.0.2"; // replace with the IP address of your server
using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```

string ip = "192.168.0.2"; // replace with the IP address of your server
using (var socket = new TcpClient())
{
    try
    {
        socket.Connect(ip);
        Console.WriteLine("Connected to " + ip);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
}
```
