Comparatively less cases are caused due to the male factor as compared to female factors. According to the report published in American Society for Reproductive Medicine, about 35% of couples reported a lack or reduced sperm count. The remaining 65% had low motility levels and/or poor morphology that could be the cause of infertility. However, this percentage varies from study to study. Some studies have shown that male infertility accounts for only about 10%-20% of cases, while others have reported it to be as high as 50%. The reason for the discrepancy in results is due to differences in study design, population characteristics, and criteria used to diagnose male factor infertility. It's important to note that male infertility can often lead to other health issues such as depression, stress, and relationship problems. Therefore, it's crucial for couples to seek help from a fertility specialist or counselor if they are experiencing difficulties in conceiving.
