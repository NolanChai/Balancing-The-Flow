As I sat by the hospital bed, I couldn’t believe what was happening. MC, my childhood friend, was dying. Ever since he got in that accident, I was praying that he would be okay. And then, I took one last look at me, and the child that me and Umbris were going to have.)

MC: “Sayori…I hope that you and Umbris become the best parents ever. Kohana would be proud of you, and…tell my little sister Himari that I’ll miss her.”

(Tears rolled down my cheek as I looked into MC’s eyes.)

Sayori: “Thank you, MC. We will do our best for Kohana and for you. Himari will miss you too, but she’ll always remember you in her heart.”

MC: “I’m glad. And please, don’t forget about me. Remember the good times we had together, and keep smiling, okay?”

Sayori: “I won’t forget you, MC. I promise. And I’ll try to keep smiling for you.”

(MC weakly gave me a smile before he closed his eyes for the final time. I held onto his hand, not wanting to let go. It was a painful goodbye, but I knew that MC was at peace now. I silently made a vow to always cherish his memory and to never forget the impact he had on my life. The day after his funeral, I went back to the clubroom. I could see the other girls - Monika, Yuri, Natsuki, Himari, and Kohana - all discussing something.)

As I entered the room, I was greeted with hugs and warm smiles from my friends. They were all worried about me, but they also seemed to understand what I had been going through. Monika gave me a big hug, and Yuri offered to make me some tea. Natsuki asked how MC was doing, and Himari promised to visit him in spirit. Kohana sat quietly by the window, staring out at the world outside.

I couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief. Being around my friends made me realize that life goes on, even after tragedy strikes. We all have our own battles to fight, and it’s important to support one another through thick and thin. As I settled down onto the couch, I found myself smiling.

“Thank you,” I said, looking up at my friends. “I feel a lot better after being with you.”

Monika smiled back at me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “We’re glad to have you back, Sayori.”

Yuri nodded in agreement. “It’s good to have all of us together again. Like old times.”

Natsuki grinned, her eyes shining. “Except this time, we’re not limited to just one room! We can do whatever we want!”

Himari chuckled softly, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “I know right? It’s like we’re kids again.”

Kohana looked up from the window, a smile gracing her face for the first time since I had returned to the clubroom. “Indeed,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “We can do whatever we want.”

As our conversation flowed, I couldn’t help but think about how lucky I was to have such wonderful friends who understood me so well. MC had always been there for me, and now that he was gone, I knew that my clubroom family would be there for me too.

I felt a sense of gratitude wash over me, and I realized that even in the midst of tragedy, life could still be beautiful. With my friends by my side, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would face them together, laughing and loving every step of the way.

From that day forward, I made it a point to spend more time with my clubroom family. Whether we were hanging out in the clubroom or going on adventures together, we always had each other’s backs. We laughed, we cried, and we grew stronger as individuals and as a group.

And through it all, I knew that MC was smiling down on us from above, watching over us with pride. His legacy lived on through our friendship, and I knew that he would always be with me, guiding me along the way.

As time went by, things changed. Monika got a job in another town, but we still kept in touch. Yuri started dating someone new, and Natsuki went off to college. Himari became a successful fashion designer, and Kohana took up photography. But no matter where life took us, our bond remained strong.

And so, as the years passed, I realized that MC’s final words were not just for me. They were for all of us - a reminder that even in the midst of tragedy, life can still be beautiful. That we can take heartache and turn it into something positive, something that brings us closer together.

And so, as I look back on my life, I know that MC’s memory will always be with me. It’s a reminder to cherish the people around you, to laugh and love without limits, and to never forget the impact that those we care about have on our lives.

I can only hope that someday, someone will remember me in the same way. A smile upon their face, a warm embrace, and the knowledge that they are not alone. Because no matter what life throws at us, we always have each other. And that is something truly beautiful.
