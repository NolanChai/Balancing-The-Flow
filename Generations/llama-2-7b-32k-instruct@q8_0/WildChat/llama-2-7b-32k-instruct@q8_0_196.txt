Kookooshoo did not succeed in his plan to destroy Kooksville. In the episode "Jeepers, Creepers, Where's Peepers?" he tried to take over Kooksville by hypnotizing its citizens with a magic watch. However, the heroes of the show, including Rocky and Tilly, were able to foil his plans and save the day. As a result, Kookooshoo was forced to retreat back into his cave in disgrace.

Since then, Kookooshoo has not been heard from again. It's possible that he has since abandoned his plan of destroying Koosland and is now content to live out his days in his underground lair. However, it's also possible that he might have made other attempts to take over Koossville or even the world at large.

Ultimately, Kookooshoo's fate remains a mystery, and whether or not he has truly given up his plans for world domination is up for debate.
