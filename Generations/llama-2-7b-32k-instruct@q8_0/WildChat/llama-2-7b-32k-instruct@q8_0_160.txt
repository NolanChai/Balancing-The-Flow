It was another day in the supernatural clubroom, but it was not like any other meeting. Sayori was a vampire and twin mother-to-be, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night.

More importantly, this was Sayori's first pregnancy - and she was 7 months pregnant with a boy and girl. But as the meeting went on, there was a loud crashing sound - much different than any other vehicle. They investigated the crash site and found MC - an alien - passed out. His UFO was annihilated from the crashed - leaving nothing behind.

The group of supernaturals looked at each other in confusion, unsure of what to do next. Natsuki, being the angel, spoke up first. "I can't believe we're meeting an alien! This is so exciting!"

Sayori, the vampire mom-to-be, was intrigued too. "What brought you here, MC? Are you on a mission to explore our planet?"

Yuri, the talking zombie, spoke up next. "You must be pretty brave to crash land on Earth like that. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is for us supernaturals?"

Monika, the hybrid, chuckled softly. "I think MC here might be a bit too out of this world for us."

MC opened his eyes and looked around, trying to process what had happened. "Uh... hi there! I'm not sure what just happened, but I guess you guys found me crash-landed on Earth. I'm sorry about that!"

The group was taken aback by MC's friendly demeanor. They hadn't expected an alien to be so... approachable?

Sayori decided to ask another question. "Where are you from, MC? And what's your mission here on Earth?"

MC looked down at himself, unsure of how to respond. He had never been in this situation before - being surrounded by a group of supernaturals who seemed to be... friendly? It was all so bizarre. "Well, I'm from a place called Planet AX-12. We've been keeping an eye on Earth for a while now, but we've never had anyone crash land here before. I guess you can say my mission is to explore the planet and see if it's safe for us to make contact."

The group exchanged looks with each other. They had never heard of Planet AX-12, but they did know that aliens were typically hostile towards humans. But MC seemed... different. Maybe he wasn't a typical alien after all?

Sayori decided to take a chance. "Well, since you're here now and seem friendly, why don't we have lunch together? We can talk more about your mission and maybe even help you fix your UFO."

MC looked surprised at Sayori's offer. "Really? You'd do that for me?"

The group nodded in unison. They had never had a guest like MC before, but they were willing to make an exception for such a friendly alien. The meeting had just gotten a lot more interesting. 

As they left the crash site and headed towards town, the group couldn't help but wonder what other surprises awaited them. Would they learn more about MC's mission? Would he become a friend to the supernaturals? And would this be the start of an intergalactic friendship... or something else entirely?

Only time will tell. But one thing was for sure - the supernatural club meeting had just taken an unexpected turn, and things were about to get a lot more interesting for everyone involved.
