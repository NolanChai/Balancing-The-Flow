Yes, the given Lua script contains a syntax error. The issue is with the `stringformat` function call in the `local sql` variable.

The `stringformat` function takes two arguments: a format string and an object that contains key-value pairs to be substituted into the format string. However, the format string being passed to `stringformat` does not contain any placeholders or keys to be substituted. Therefore, it is not possible to use `stringformat` in this way.

Instead, you should use a string interpolation function such as `fmt.Sprintf` or `string.Format` to interpolate values into the SQL statement. For example:
```
local sql = fmt.Sprintf("update club_info set %s = %%s where cid = %d", field_name, value)
```
This will interpolate the `value` variable into the SQL statement, resulting in a valid SQL query that can be executed by SQLite.
