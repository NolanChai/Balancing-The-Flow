Sure, here's a script about the 2007 Virginia Tech Hokies Football Team:

The 2007 Virginia Tech Hokies Football Team was a talented group of players that made it to the Orange Bowl for the first time since 1967. The team was led by quarterback Sean Glennon, who threw for over 3,000 yards and 24 touchdowns during the season.

The offense also featured running back Branden Ore, who rushed for over 1,000 yards and eight touchdowns. The defense was led by linebacker Al Groh, who had a team-leading 105 tackles and four sacks.

The Hokies started off the season with an impressive win against the Maryland Terrapins, but then went on to lose their next two games against the Miami Hurricanes and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Despite these losses, the team bounced back and won five straight games, including a victory over the Boston College Eagles in the ACC Championship Game.

The Hokies then faced off against the Louisville Cardinals in the Orange Bowl, where they were victorious 44-40 in double overtime. The game was considered one of the greatest bowl games ever played and saw Glennon throw for a career-high 520 yards and five touchdowns.

Despite their successful season, the team faced some challenges off the field as well. In August of 2007, linebacker Chad Simmons was arrested for sexual assault and subsequently dismissed from the team. The incident led to a series of controversies surrounding the team's handling of the situation and sparked discussions about how college athletics programs should address issues of sexual assault on campus.

Overall, the 2007 Virginia Tech Hokies Football Team was a successful group that made history with their first-ever Orange Bowl victory. The team's performance on the field was matched by their resilience and determination off the field, making them one of the most iconic teams in school history.
