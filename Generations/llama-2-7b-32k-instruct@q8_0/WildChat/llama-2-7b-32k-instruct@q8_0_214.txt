The balanced chemical reaction is:
2 H2 + O2 = 2 H2O
Therefore, to find out how many grams of water will be formed when 32 grams of oxygen gas react with 32 grams of hydrogen gas in this reaction, we need to multiply the number of grams of hydrogen gas (32) by its molecular weight (2), which is equal to 64.

So, the total mass of water formed = 64 x 32 = 2072 grams

Therefore, the answer is 2072 grams.
