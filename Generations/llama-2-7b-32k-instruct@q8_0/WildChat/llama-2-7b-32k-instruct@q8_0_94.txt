Goku chuckles and says, "It's not every day that I get to eat fish this big! It tastes even better than it looks!" He takes another huge bite of the fish before continuing, "And it's not like you two are going to eat any of it. You're too tiny to do anything with a meal this size."
Lilac and Ants look at each other nervously. They know Goku is right - they couldn't possibly eat an entire fish as big as he can. But still, the thought of Goku eating their food without sharing makes them feel uneasy.
"Oh, come on!" Lilac says, trying to sound playful. "We're not that small! We could share!"
Goku chuckles and shakes his head. "No way. You guys are too tiny. Plus, you'd never fit all the fish in your mouths at once." He takes another bite of the fish, savoring every delicious morsel.
Lilac and Ants sigh, feeling defeated. They knew they shouldn't have tried to steal Goku's food - but they just couldn't resist trying. Now, they're left watching as he eats their food without sharing a single bite. It's a tough lesson learned for the two Freedom Planet girls. But hey, at least now they know that fish can be delicious... and that Goku is still the biggest eater around!

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo react to Lilac being afraid of human, they can't stop laughing at her. They continue by asking if she's seen Ants in real life? Then they tell her the size difference between Humans and Ants is like 10x the size. Sweetie Belle continues by saying that they are immortal, unlike humans. Finally, she says Goku's height is equal to a Human child's, making him around as tall as Ants. She ends her joke with an awkward pause and laughs along with the others before Lilac speaks up.

Lilac: "Wow, that's actually pretty impressive! I mean, I never thought of it like that..."

Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Goku all turn to her in confusion. Sweetie Belle smiles at her and says, "So you see, Lilac, humans are really big compared to Ants. And Goku is just the right size for us!"

Lilac: "Oh...I guess so..." she still seems unsure but tries to keep up with their conversation.

Sweetie Belle: "And don't worry, we won't eat you! We're not cannibals like some humans."

Goku: (sarcastically) "Thank goodness for that."

Lilac blushes slightly at this comment and looks away. Sweetie Belle then exclaims, "But seriously, Lilac, you should totally check out the Human world sometime! It's so much fun!"

Lilac: (smiling) "I don't know...I might just do that."

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo continue to make jokes and laugh at her expense. Goku joins in, saying that if she goes into the Human world, they should get a human child for him too. Lilac can only smile awkwardly as they all have a good time teasing her.

Lilac: (thinking) "I'm not sure I want to be this tall..."

Sweetie Belle: "Don't worry, you'll get used to it! And at least you won't get eaten by Ants or anything."

Goku: "That's right! You can be our Human pet!"

Lilac looks like she wants the ground to open up and swallow her. But instead, she just gives a little shrug and says, "I guess I'll just have to deal with it then..."

Sweetie Belle: "You got this! We're here for you every step of the way!"

Lilac: (smiling weakly) "Thanks, guys."

The group continues their banter as Lilac tries to keep up. She looks a little flustered but also kinda happy that they are all getting along so well despite her size difference. The scene ends with everyone laughing and having a good time together.
