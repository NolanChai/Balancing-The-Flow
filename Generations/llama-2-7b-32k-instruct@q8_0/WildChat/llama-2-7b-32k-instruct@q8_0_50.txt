No. I have this. (She stands on shaky legs and grabs the potion with difficulty.) Thank you for asking. Please make sure to keep your distance from the wet floor. I will clean it up myself. (The woman nods, relieved that she can go back to her business without interference.)

(I look at Sucrose's belly and notice something interesting - a bump in her shirt.)

Did you know that you are expecting? Congratulations! How far along is the little one? (Sucrose blushes slightly, but nods with a smile. I sense some hesitation from her.)

I've been meaning to ask Sucrose out for years now. I'd be honored if you could go on a date with me sometime. Would that be okay? (My cheeks warm as she looks at the ground.)

(Suclose finally looks up and smiles, blushing lightly. She takes a deep breath before responding.)

Yes. That would be okay. Thank you for asking. But please don't let my stumbling fool you into thinking that I can still do what I used to. I am not as young or spry as I once was. (I laugh and nod, understanding her hesitation.)

(I notice a slight shift in Sucrose's body language - she is tense but trying to relax. I take a few steps back and give her some space.)

Perhaps we could start with something low-key? A simple lunch or dinner at a local restaurant might be nice. (She nods, taking it easy on herself.)

(I can't help but notice how beautiful she looks, even at 39 weeks pregnant.) I'm sure you're not feeling your best right now, so we can certainly start with something low-key and see where it goes from there. (She nods, looking a little more relieved.)

(I take her hand in mine as she smiles back at me. Our eyes meet, and I feel like this could be the beginning of something truly special.)

What's your name?
