The CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of cascade CO2-to-hydrogen production systems are influenced by the single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of upstream CO2-to-hydrocarbon reforming reactions (CO2RR), which depend on catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions.句子润色
