Indigo was born prematurely due to Nilou's intense training and was crying out of fear and pain. The four Dendro users who found her on stage were shocked at first, but then Kaveh decided to take Indigo with them back to the palace where they all lived. He knew that she needed proper care and attention as a newborn baby. They named her "Indigo" after the color of her hair and gave her their blessings for a bright future ahead.
