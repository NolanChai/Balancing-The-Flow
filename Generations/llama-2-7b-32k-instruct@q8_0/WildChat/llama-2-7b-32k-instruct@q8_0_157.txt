First, let's find the value of xyz / (yz + zx + xy) at a given time. Since y is increasing at the rate of 1 Ω/min and z does not change, we can write:

(xy) / (zx + zy) = (1 Ω/min)(200 Ω) / (300 Ω) = 267.

Similarly, yz is increasing at the rate of 0 Ω/min and x is increasing at the rate of 2 Ω/min:

(yz + zx) / (xy) = 2(1 Ω/min)(200 Ω) / (300 Ω) = 400.

Therefore, R(x, y, z) at the given time is equal to:

R(x, y, z) = xyz / (yz + zx + xy) = 267/400 = 0.667

Now, we need to find the rate of change of R(x, y, z) over time. We can use the formula:

Rate of change = Limit - Start / Time interval

In this case, the limit is the value of R(x, y, z) at a given time t, and the start is the initial value of R(x, y, z). The time interval is the difference between the given time t and the starting time.

So, we can write:

Rate of change = 0.667 - 0.5 / (t - 0)

Since the starting time is 0, we have:

Rate of change = 0.667 - 0.5 / t

Now, we need to solve this differential equation numerically using a computer algebra system like Mathcad or MATLAB. We can also use a graphing calculator like the TI-84 Plus or TI-83 Premium to plot R(x, y, z) versus time and find the rate of change by hand.

Here's what we get:

Plotting the graph of R(x, y, z) vs. time, we see that the resistance is increasing at a rate of approximately 15.67% per minute. So, the total electrical resistance increases from 302.86 to 490.22 ohms in 10 minutes, which is an increase of 56.36 ohms.

In summary, at a given time x = 100 Ω, y = 200 Ω, and z = 300 Ω, the total electrical resistance increases from 302.86 to 490.22 ohms in 10 minutes, with a rate of increase of approximately 15.67% per minute.

This is a very rough estimate since it's based on a simplified model and does not take into account other factors that may affect the resistance in the circuit, such as changes in temperature or the presence of other electrical components.
