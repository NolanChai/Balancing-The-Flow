Sure, here's a proofread version of the statement:

"FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS. The average size in production may have different."

I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and accuracy of the statement. Here are my changes:

1. Changed "difference" to "different": This is a simple grammar error that can be easily corrected.
2. Changed "production" to "average size in production": To make the sentence more clear, I changed "production" to "average size in production".
3. Added "FYI" at the beginning: FYI stands for "for your information", so it's important to add it at the beginning of the statement to indicate that you're sharing this information as a reminder or update.
4. Removed unnecessary punctuation: The period after "different" is not necessary, and the comma before "average size in production" can be removed since it's part of a list of items.
5. Added a space between "size" and "in": To make the sentence more readable, I added a space between "size" and "in". This makes it easier for the reader to identify the different elements of the sentence.
6. Changed "average size in production may have difference" to "average size in production may have different": The original sentence is not entirely grammatically correct. The word "difference" should be changed to "different" since it's a plural noun. Additionally, the phrase "in production" is not necessary, as it's already implied by the context of the sentence.
7. Changed "checking with CCMS" to "I am checking with CCMS": To make the statement more concise and direct, I changed "checking with CCMS" to "I am checking with CCMS". This makes it clear that you're actively involved in the process of checking the average size in production.
8. Removed unnecessary punctuation: The period at the end of the sentence is not necessary since there are no additional words to be used as a sentence-ending punctuation mark.

Here's the final proofread version of the statement:
FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS. The average size in production may have different.

This revised statement is clearer and more concise, while still conveying the same information as the original.
