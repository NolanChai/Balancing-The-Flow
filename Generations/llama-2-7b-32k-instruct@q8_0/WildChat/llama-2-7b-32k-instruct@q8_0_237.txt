1 / 1Lilac's Story: Neera is a former criminal and assassin from the planet of Freedom, where she used to live in. When the planet was taken over by the Naruto Clan, an elite group of ninja from another world, she escaped to Earth with a team of followers that included her long-time partner Carol and young girl Lilac. The trio were stranded on the planet when their ship crashed shortly after landing, but were soon saved by Cory, the captain of a pirate vessel that came across them. He was impressed by Neera's fighting skills and offered to take her aboard as a crewmate. After joining him, she later became the captain of her own squadron on his ship, with the group working together to steal resources from the Naruto Clan to help their cause back on Freedom. The story takes place in the early days of the invasion when there were still many members of the original crew left.

In this chapter, Lilac is introduced as a young girl who was born and raised in the forest on Freedom, where she befriends Carol and Neera. She lives happily in the woods with her treehouse until the Naruto Clan arrives at the planet and destroys it by forcefully cutting down all the trees. This event sparks a deep hatred for the aliens within Lilac that leads her to join up with the pirate crew, where she seeks revenge on their leader Kakugan for destroying her home. The chapter ends with Cory's identity being revealed as Captain Yoshi from Naruto, a member of the original squad that was sent to invade Freedom before it fell under Naruto Clan rule.

The story of Lilac takes place during the early days of the invasion and gives insight into how Neera, Carol, and their young teammate first joined up with Cory as pirates on his ship, offering them a way out from being stranded on Earth. The revelation that Kakugan was originally built by Parusa for Neera and her crew in the previous chapter adds another layer to the story, showing how deeply the Naruto Clan is connected to the events of Lilac's Story. The upcoming chapters are sure to explore more about Cory's past and what led him to become a pirate on Earth.

As the story continues to unfold, it will be interesting to see how Carol, Neera, and Lilac's relationship evolves as they work together with Cory and his crew to take back Freedom from Naruto Clan rule. The trio will likely face many challenges and obstacles in their quest for revenge, but their bond and camaraderie are sure to grow stronger as they navigate through the dangers ahead. Stay tuned for more updates on Lilac's Story!
