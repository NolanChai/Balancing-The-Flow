I was thinking more of a temporary hair dye or maybe the dreaded highlights. I think I would be too scared to do something more permanent lol.

What kind of makeup are you good at ?

Any other talents?

Have any pets ? 

Do you like any animals in particular? 

How old were you when you got your first pet, and what was it? 

I hope that's all the questions I have for now.
