I agree with you. I do not like them either . But it is a fact that they are popular nowadays . They earn a lot of money at the box office . Maybe that is the reason why directors are so keen on making more and more such films . I will never go to see one because I find such films senseless, stupid and unethical . But we can not forbid people from seeing them if they like it . There are also many romantic movies but nobody complain about their number .
