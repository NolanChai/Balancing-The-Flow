Oh , it was on sale ! In fact, it was originally seventy - five dollars and then they marked it down to ninety - five before I even bought it . That's how you get a good deal sometimes, especially at places like that .

I like your dress too! The color is very pretty. You should have told me that you were going to buy the same dress as mine before you did. Now we match! Haha. Oh, no worries. It was my first time shopping at this store and I didn't know how much it would be since I've never been there before. How many of these dresses are left? Maybe they will go on sale so that we can both get a discount.
