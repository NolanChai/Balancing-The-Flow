No, I don't understand any other foreign languages besides English. I am proficient in Japanese language and have a working knowledge of Mandarin Chinese. I can also speak some French and Spanish. However, my fluency levels are limited to basic conversational skills.

"Do you know any foreign song lyrics? "

"Yes, I know some foreign song lyrics but not many . The ones that come to mind are:

* English: "Karma Chameleon" by Culture Club (1983)
* Japanese: "Sayonara no Tsubasa wo Kudasai" by Glay (2003)
* Chinese: "流浪的心魄" (Língláng de Xīn Pài) by Teresa Teng (1978)"

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
