Oh wow, that sounds lovely ! My mother also has dry skin so she may really like the moisturizer. How about you? What would you like to do this weekend ? 

We can go on a family hike or visit our grandparents . It's hard to choose just one thing when there are so many wonderful activities we could do! I am sure whatever we do will be very enjoyable, though.

It's 40% off its original price. 

Oh, I see . My mother really likes this product . 

So how about your other mom? What do you want to buy for her? 

I would like to give her a bag with some bath products and a night cream . She will be travelling in the summer, so she will need these. 

Wow, that sounds nice! I hope you have a great weekend ! 

Thanks ! I will definitely let you know what my mother thinks when she receives them .

Yes, it is important to celebrate both your mothers. Mother's Day can sometimes get overlooked because of Mother's Week or Month activities . Do you have any specific plans for your other mother? 

No, not really . We usually take her out to dinner on special occasions like Mother's Day. What about your mom? Do you have any special plans with her planned ? 

That sounds lovely! It is so important to show our appreciation and love towards them . I will make sure that both my moms feel very loved and appreciated. Thank you for sharing that!

There is also a limited edition lipstick . 

How about I give you a discount code for this item ? The code is "MOM" , and it gives an extra 10% off any purchase . 

 How do you know this information ? Are you the manager of Carrefour?

### Response:
No, I am just someone who wants to give away the discount. It is not a big deal for me . 

 Okay , thank you so much ! I think that's all, but I do have one more question : since there are only two days left until Mother's Day, if my mom likes it I will buy it today, and give it to her tomorrow on the actual day of mother's day . Will they still honor this promotion ? 

Yes . They will. The sale period is from May 5th to May 8th . You can buy your gift any time between now and then . 

 I see, thank you very much ! Have a good day!  

(1) My mom might not like it that much because she said that this product has no special effects . But if she doesn't complain about the price , I will definitely buy it today for her tomorrow . 

 (2) After my mother bought a lipstick and masque from me, she was very happy to have saved so much money on these two items . She thanked me again and again . As an only son, this is something that makes me feel great !   

(3) In the future I will recommend her some more products for gift giving occasions like mother's day or father's day . It should be my duty to help her save money .

### Response:
That sounds good. 

 And you can do so on Carrefour's official website or in their app . Just scan the QR code of the ad and it will take you right there !

Okay, that is all for my questions today. Thank you again. I hope we can talk to each other like this from now on. Have a good day! 

 How would you feel if you didn't have access to this discount code? 

### Response:
I will definitely buy it at full price .

Would that be acceptable for you ? If I gave you the discount , then you can give it away yourself .   

(1) I am very willing to do that . Thank you !

(2) Actually, when my mother asks me about this product in person tomorrow, I will tell her all about it, and if she is interested in buying it, I will definitely buy it at a discounted price. 

 (3) I hope your mother can get the full price discount . If you give away the discount code for free , there is no need to buy anything from you at all .  

(1) Thank you ! Actually, my mother is very interested in this product . She likes this brand of skincare products . 

 (2) You're welcome. I am glad that your mom also appreciates Carrefour's promotions and discounts!

(3) It's okay. If she doesn't like it , I will buy it for her anyway in the future, as long as it won't cost much money .

Okay, I hope you have a good day too!  

(1) Actually, my mother is not so interested in this product . But if she wants to try it out, I am willing to buy it for her and give it to her tomorrow as a Mother's Day gift . 

 (2) Thank you ! You are very kind ! If my mom tries the cream or masque tomorrow , then I will definitely ask her about whether she likes this product or not . And if she doesn't like it, I will buy it again for myself at full price in the future. 

 (3) Good! So you have a deal ! If your mother tries Clinique products and likes them , please give me some feedback on their effectiveness . Maybe next year during Mother's day or Father's Day, I can recommend more gifts to her for free !   

(1) Yes. You are right that my mom bought the masque and cream from you yesterday . She said it was a good deal for her . 

 (2) Thank you so much for giving me this discount code ! My mother told me she would buy some new makeup at home tomorrow, so I hope she will get more good deals in the future .
