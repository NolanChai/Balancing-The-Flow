"Uh... Yeah, I've been playing piano since I was seven." "And what about your singing skills? Can you sing?"

"I can carry a tune and harmonize well." "But my range is limited. I can only sing in the alto register."

"Well, that's not a problem. We can use your piano-playing skills as a backing musician. You know how to play along with songs and make them sound better?"

"Yes, of course! I've been playing with different musicians for years." "I'm sure we can find someone who can sing well enough to fit in with the rest of the band."

"Great! Then let's get started. We have a gig coming up at a local club on Friday night. You want to play that?"

"Absolutely! I'd love to be part of your band." "Let me know when and where we're playing, and I'll be there with my instrument."

"Great! See you then!"

"I'm glad to hear it. We have a lot of things to talk about, but we can do that later. For now, let's get back to the band business. What do you think about our name? The Eternal Night?"

"That's a great name! It has an eerie feeling to it. I like it."

"Excellent. Now, let's talk about the music we want to play. Do you have any ideas?"

"I've been thinking about that. We should play something that's heavy and fast-paced, with a lot of guitar solos and drum fills. And maybe some catchy choruses."

"That sounds great! I'm sure we can come up with some good songs. Now, let's talk about the logistics of getting our band off the ground. We'll need to practice regularly to get better, and we'll also need to find a place to perform. Do you have any ideas on that front?"

"I know a great venue in town called The Underground. They often host local bands, and I'm sure they'd be willing to let us play there."

"That sounds promising! Let's see if we can make it happen. And finally, let's talk about the important topic of band merchandise. We need some t-shirts with our logo on them - something that looks badass and will help us stand out from the crowd."

"I've got just the thing! I have a friend who does graphic design, and she can make us up a awesome design. Plus, we can sell some CDs and other merchandise online to expand our reach even further."

"That sounds like a solid plan. We're on the right track here. Let's keep pushing forward and make The Eternal Night a household name in the music scene!"

"Agreed! I can't wait to see where this band takes us. It'll be an adventure, that's for sure."
