"Oh no worries! It was just a surprise for me since you had mentioned steak and I assumed it would be the standard dinner option. Where do you want to go?  There is a great Indian place around the corner that does amazing meatless options if you're up for trying something new."

"No no ! I am not a vegetarian, you said you wanted to eat steak and I thought it would be funny because I don't think of vegetarians as wanting steak haha. Yeah Indian food sounds great! What kind of place do they have there?"

"Well it is an Indian butcher shop that just opened up on the corner, so they are known for their meat but also make some delicious meatless options as well. I am sure you will like them."

"Sounds good to me! Thanks for being easy going Julie!"

"Oh, that's great! I didn't know that. Well, I'm sure we can find something you'll enjoy then."

"Really? Do you think so?"

"Of course! Let me just check and see if there are any vegetarian options on the menu."

"Thank you, Julie!"

"No problem. I'll be right back with a few suggestions for us to try out."

"Hey Julie, how about we go grab something to eat? I know this awesome vegan place downtown."

"Sounds good! What do you usually get there?"

"I don't eat meat or animal products at all, so I usually just go for the salad bowl. It comes with a ton of options and it's really healthy. Plus, they have some amazing dressings that aren't made from milk or eggs."

"That sounds great! I love trying new restaurants, especially ones that cater to my dietary needs. It must get pretty lonely being a vegan in the world of non-vegans!"

"It can be tough at times, but I have found some great communities of people who are also vegan and it's nice to have support."

"That's awesome! I'm happy that you've been able to find a way to make it work for you. Sometimes, it can be really hard to navigate social situations as a vegan because not everyone is aware of what it means or how to accommodate us in terms of food and drinks."

"It definitely can be challenging at times, but I think that's why it's important to educate people on the benefits of being vegan. It's also great to have vegan-friendly options available at more restaurants these days, so it's becoming a bit easier."

"I couldn't agree more! It's nice to see that more and more places are offering plant-based options for people like us who choose this lifestyle. And I think the fact that you're vegan is not an issue anymore because it's become so popular and trendy, which is great!"

"It really is! It's nice to see a shift in the way people view veganism and the impact it can have on our health and the environment. I think more and more people are starting to understand the importance of making choices that align with our values."

"Agreed! It's amazing how much things have changed over the years. When I first went vegan, it was definitely a niche lifestyle. Now, it seems like everyone is talking about it and wanting to try it out for themselves!"

"I agree! It's exciting to see that our values are becoming more mainstream and that people are starting to realize the importance of taking care of ourselves and the planet we live on."

"It definitely is! And I think your choice to go vegan is a great example of how one person can make a positive impact. It's inspiring to see someone take control of their health and well-being in such an impactful way!"

"Thank you so much! I appreciate that! It can be tough at times, but it's definitely worth it to know that I'm doing the right thing for myself and the planet."

"Agreed! And it's great that you have support from friends like me who are also vegan. Sometimes, it's nice to have someone to commiserate with or share recipes and tips!"

"Exactly! It's always nice to have a friend to share your experiences with and make them feel less lonely. Plus, having a community of people who support you can be really motivating and uplifting."

"I couldn't agree more! And I think that's one of the best things about being vegan - it brings people together and creates connections. It's not just a dietary choice but a lifestyle choice that impacts our entire community!"

"Absolutely! It's great to see something positive happening in the world, and I think the vegan movement is definitely one of those things."

"I couldn't agree more! It's always nice to hear about people making a positive impact on their own lives and the lives of others. Veganism is definitely a movement that's worth supporting!"

"Agreed! And I think that's what makes veganism so amazing - it's not just about diet, but also about ethics and compassion for animals. It's a choice that shows you care about the world around you and want to make a difference."

"Exactly! I love seeing people who are passionate about something and are willing to take action in their own lives to make a change. Veganism is definitely a movement that needs more people like you, Julie!"

"Aw, thank you so much! I appreciate it! It's nice to hear that my choices have made a positive impact on the world."

"I couldn't agree more! You are doing great things, and it's inspiring to see someone live their values in such a genuine way. Keep up the good work!"
