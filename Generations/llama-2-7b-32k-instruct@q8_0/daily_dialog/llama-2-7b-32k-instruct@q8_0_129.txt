Let's hit up that new restaurant on the strip, it just opened last week! I heard they have killer steaks. 

I also want to grab some dessert after, maybe some gelato? You know me and my sweet tooth can't pass up a good scoop of ice cream.

I didn't know that either . I think maybe it would be better to pick another restaurant so we can both get what we want .   

[INST] The only issue is that the one place I have been wanting to try recently has a long wait time at this hour .  [/INST]

Okay, well let's see if there are other options nearby. Do you have any preferences? Like do you like Italian food or something else ? 

I can't decide what I want . How about we go to the restaurant with the shortest wait time and then when I get my meal I'll order something that is meat free but similar to steak so that it will be a good experience for both of us. What do you think ? 

I like that plan ! Do you want to go there right now or would you prefer if we just talked about what other options are out there and then went at the time when they have less wait time?  

[INST] We can always get takeout from somewhere else . How long is the wait for the restaurant ? [/INST]

15 minutes. 

Oh, that's not too bad. I think we should go there now and then we can discuss what other options we have after our meal. 

Sounds good to me ! Let's pick up some dessert too since it will only take a few more minutes to place the order .   

[INST] Okay, that works for me. I want to stop by the post office on the way home from picking up our food anyway so we can head back afterwards if necessary.  [/INST]

Sounds good ! Do you mind if I ask what's going on at the post office? I feel like maybe there is something specific that is taking place at this time and it might be able to help me make a plan for us tonight. 

No not really . We are in the process of trying to move . So I have to go pick up some mail and other documents so we can get our new lease signed . Once I do that though , my job will be done and I'll just have to wait until they send us a key to unlock the door. 

Oh, okay. Well if you need anything else from me I'm here for you ! Do you think we can plan on getting together soon? My roommate is going out of town next weekend and it would be nice to hang out with someone .  

[INST] That sounds great! Let's make plans for Saturday afternoon. I'll text my address once I know where I am moving. [/INST]

That sounds perfect ! Just give me a time you are free on Saturday afternoon and I will let you know if it works or not . 

How about we meet up at 4pm ? That way I can make sure to get everything done by then, but still have the rest of the weekend to unpack and settle in. 

Sounds great! Can't wait to see you again soon. Text me your address so I can send over some treats for the new place !   

[INST] Okay, let's plan on meeting up at my old house (the one that doesn't exist yet) around 3:45pm to exchange keys and get the paperwork done. What should we eat afterward? [/INST]

That sounds perfect! I think it will be a great time to see you again as well . Do you have any restaurants in mind that we can go to ? Or are you open to suggestions ? 

I'm actually pretty flexible food wise, but do you know of any vegetarian or vegan places around here? My roommate and I have been trying to eat healthier lately.   

[INST] Yes, there is a great Thai place across the street from my old house . I'll send over an address once we pick up the keys at the office so we can all go there afterward if you like? [/INST]

Sounds good to me! Do they have takeout as well ? Because sometimes I like to hang out and eat in front of a movie or something. 

I don't know for sure, but I think it might be better to sit down so we can both relax and enjoy our food . We should make sure though since I hate the idea of making plans only to find out that we will have to leave once we get there and wait in a long line again. 

I'll let you know after we go over to pick up the keys at the office whether or not we can sit down somewhere first!  

[INST] No, no problem. We can just plan on eating there if they have seating available. I think it will be more relaxing this way and also help us avoid traffic issues since I am pretty sure the delivery driver will be in a hurry to get me my keys once you are ready to leave.  [/INST]

Yes, that sounds like a better plan ! Do you have any other preferences ? Like do you want to eat indoors or outdoors or something else?  

[INST] No preference - let's go with whatever they have available and we can choose when we get there. [/INST]

Sounds good! So I should be at your house at 3:45pm on Saturday? I'm looking forward to seeing you again soon Julie !  

[INST] Yes, please do come by - we are excited for you to start moving in tomorrow and will have plenty of help if you need it! [/INST]

I just want to make sure that I am clear. Are you saying that I should go over on Saturday at 3:45pm? 

Yes, please do come by on Saturday at 3:45pm ! We are excited for you to start moving in tomorrow and will have plenty of help if you need it!   

[INST] Cool. Thanks so much - I'm glad my friend can be there too for moral support during this big move. [/INST]

Sounds great! It must be nice having a friend around to help out . I hope everything goes well and that your move is smooth ! Let me know if you need anything else before then ! 

You got it! Thanks again - I'll text you the address once we get there so you can come by when you are ready!  

[INST] OK, great. Bye for now! [/INST]

Bye Julie! It was nice chatting with you . 

You too! Have a good afternoon !   

[INST] Okay, see you tomorrow! [/INST]

See you soon !  

[INST] Hi Julie - I just wanted to let you know that my friend and roommate has decided to come along for the move-in experience. Will that be ok? [/INST]

Hi there! That sounds great! I'm happy your friend can make it over tomorrow to help out! 

I hope everything goes well, Julie . Is there anything you need from me before we head over tomorrow?   

[INST] Oh that would be perfect. Thanks so much - I think the more hands available the better. [/INST]

No problem at all! How was your day today ? Do you have any plans for later in the evening? 

It's going okay . Nothing too exciting. Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?   

[INST] Yeah, it's been a long one but I think I'm going to go home and do some gardening now that the weather is nice! [/INST]

That sounds like a nice way to unwind ! Do you think you will be able to get anything else done before tomorrow ? 

I probably won't . It's been a long day so I need to just take it easy. Do you have plans for the weekend?   

[INST] Nope, I don't! But I might go visit my friend in Brookline. What about yourself? [/INST]

I think that sounds fun! Do you know if they are home tomorrow ? Maybe we can plan on going out to dinner together after I get back from the move ?   

[INST] They'll be gone all weekend so it looks like we're free and clear for a good meal. [/INST]

Oh, that sounds nice! Do you have any particular food preferences or places you would like to go ? 

I was thinking something Italian? I'm sure we can find somewhere good around here. What do you think?   

[INST] Yes, let's try and find an Italian place - the food is always great when they put some love into it. [/INST]

Awesome! Do you have any specific cuisine in mind or would you be open to suggestions? 

I like a good old fashioned home cooked meal with lots of pasta and sauce . How about you ?   

[INST] I'm sure we'll find something, Julie - thanks! [/INST]

You're welcome, Julie! It was nice catching up. Have a great evening. 

I will too! Bye for now!  

[INST] OK by

I've never met a vegan before. Are you sure it's OK for me to be around someone with that lifestyle ? Am I going to get something on me or breathe in something and get sick ?

Well, it has its challenges but not as tough as some people might make it out to be. There are a lot of good vegan options available these days, especially at restaurants and grocery stores. Plus, I like doing my part to reduce animal suffering and help the environment . What about you ?
