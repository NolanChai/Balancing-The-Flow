"You know what, it's true. Every employee in my company can be identified by their ID card. It's a very practical thing because we always need an identity card when entering the company building." "But if I were you, I would like to design a business card that is more personalized and individualized so that people who look at it will remember me easily. And, of course, my business card should also reflect my personal style."

"That's great. You have a clear understanding of the importance of a good business card in promoting yourself and your work. I agree with you that a well-designed business card can make a lasting impression on others and help people remember us better. It's important to stand out from the crowd and showcase our unique style and personality."

"Exactly, we are talking about the same thing! But have you ever thought of making a design that is more eye-catching than the standard business card? I mean, there must be many creative designs that can attract people's attention at first glance. For example, some cards use unexpected colors or shapes to make it look unique."

"I see what you mean! It would be great if we could create a business card that is both visually appealing and functional. Something that people will want to keep and share with others. I'll think about how to design one, but for now, let me show you something really cool... This is a special business card from an illustrator I met recently. It's eye-catching, don't you think?"

"Wow! That's incredible. The illustration on the front of the card is really impressive and stands out from other standard business cards. Can you imagine if our company had a business card that looked like this? I think it would definitely make us more memorable to potential clients or partners."

"Yes, exactly! And that's why it's important to have a unique design for your business card. It's not just about having a professional appearance but also making sure that people remember you and your company in the best way possible. I think we should try to create something like this, but of course, we need to consider some factors such as cost, time, and the target audience."

"That sounds like a great plan! We can definitely work on creating a unique business card for our company that stands out from the rest. And who knows, maybe someday we'll be able to create something as impressive as this illustrator's card!"
