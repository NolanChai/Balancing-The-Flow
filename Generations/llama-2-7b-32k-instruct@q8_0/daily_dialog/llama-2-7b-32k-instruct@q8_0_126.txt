guess what ? I got offered a job at TED ! ! ! 

 whoa . what is ted and what do they do ? 

 TED is an acronym for technology, entertainment, design, it's a global community of people in over 100 countries. We bring the world together through original talks about almost anything you can imagine - science to business to global issues - in 18 minutes or less . Ted.com has tens of thousands of videos . It's like YouTube for adults, haha !  

### Response:
Wow that sounds awesome! Congratulations! I don't know much about TED other than the fact that they have a ton of inspiring talks on various subjects. Good luck with your new job! 

Continue.  

thank you ! it is such an honor to be part of this team, and so exciting because ted has been around for almost as long as I've been alive . and I get to help make sure the talks are at their best when they go live online . there will be a lot of hard work ahead but I can't wait ! 

### Response:
That's so cool! It sounds like you'll have an interesting and impactful job. Good luck with everything, I hope it goes well for you!

Sorry, I don't follow. What is a "magadize"? And what does it have to do with the Economist? Are you sure that isn't a typo? I'm assuming you meant "magazine".

that is amazing news! congratulations!! what a huge step forward for you. will this make it easier to transition from the proof reading job into something more writing heavy? 

I don't know yet, but I hope so ! My plan has been to keep working as an editor until the proofreading job ran its course and then transition over to being a full-time writer . And now that the opportunity for this kind of promotion is there, it would be great to take it. 

### Response:

that's wonderful news!! congratulations! I am sure you will do a fantastic job as editor and writer. so happy for you!! 

thanks ! It's really exciting to think about this opportunity . And thanks again for the advice on my writing. It really helped me focus on what was important and make the application stronger. 

### Response:

that is great news, well done! will there be any financial incentive as part of this promotion? I imagine you deserve it! 

yeah, I'm going to get a raise! That's part of the deal. Plus it'll look really good on my resume when it comes time for me to start applying for other jobs . 

### Response:

congratulations, that is fantastic news!! will you have any say in which articles get published? or more work/management tasks to handle now as editor? 

as an assistant editor, I'll definitely be taking on some of the day-to-day management tasks of the literary criticism column . But no, as for what gets published and doesn't...I won't have any say in that. The editor-in-chief will still take care of that . 

### Response:

that makes sense! how exciting that you get to start out working on something like this - what a great way to learn the ropes, and gain experience while you're doing it! congratulations!! 

I think so too. And I really appreciate your advice when I was applying for the job . It made all the difference in the world. 

### Response:

that is great news! do they have a time frame in mind of how long you will be assistant editor or if it's something that will eventually lead to another promotion? 

I don't know about a time frame . It could go either way - the editor-in-chief might like me so much she keeps me on as her assistant editor, or when the person who was supposed to take over for my predecessor comes back from maternity leave, I might be out of a job and looking for something else. We'll just have to see how it goes . 

### Response:

yeah that makes sense - definitely would depend on how you and the editor-in-chief get along! what is your plan after this? do you want to stay in journalism or try out other fields with your writing skills? 

I haven't decided yet. I guess it depends on whether my work as assistant editor goes well and I enjoy doing it . If so, maybe I could make a go of it as an editor. But if not, then I might be looking for something else that has more to do with writing or working with books and publishing . 

### Response:

I hope you do really well in the assistant editor role!! And congrats on the promotion! As far as other fields go, there are a lot of options. What about becoming an English teacher? It would be nice to have some more security, especially if your writing career doesn't take off right away. Just a thought. 

thanks ! I hadn't thought of teaching before . But it definitely is something I could consider - and probably should start thinking seriously about as the job market for writers continues to shrink. 

### Response:

that makes sense! do you think this experience will help if you decide to go into academia? (i'm an undergrad so i can't really offer much else) 

I don't know about that yet - I've never thought about going into academia, but now I'll have to start thinking about it . It would be nice to do a little teaching on the side when things aren't going too well as a writer. 

### Response:

yeah i was just thinking that this experience might help you publish more in those journals - especially if you get your name out there and make connections with people! anyways, congrats again - i hope it goes great for you!! 

thanks ! I appreciate the encouragement. It's always helpful to hear that someone is rooting for me . 

### Response:

congratulations! what a wonderful opportunity and well deserved success. did your parents tell you they are proud of you? 

they have, actually - but I also got an email from one of my high school English teachers who said that she's really happy for me too . That was nice to hear as well. 

### Response:

that's wonderful! did they offer any suggestions or advice when you told them the news? 

not really . My dad offered to buy my dinner at a fancy steakhouse but that was about it . 

### Response:

they are lucky to have such an amazing daughter. so what do you plan on doing now that this has happened? 

I'm going to get back to work - I haven't finished proofreading all of the articles for next week's issue yet, and I need to finish up with those before my editor-in-chief can take a look at them . Plus there are some other things I have to catch up on around here. 

### Response:

thats good to hear! i would also say congratulations to your parents for having such an amazing kid! 

thank you ! It's nice to get a little validation every now and then that one is doing OK in life . 

### Response:

congratulations on the job, good luck, stay happy and keep it up!! all the best. 

Thank you so much ! I really appreciate it. It's nice to have people rooting for me . 

### Response:

that makes two of us! i am excited about your success - congratulations again! 

thank you again, and thanks for being my friend :) 

### Response:

congrats !!!!!!!!!! that is so awesome. what are you going to do with the money? go on vacation or something fun like that ? 

haha - I haven't decided yet . I need to get some stuff done around the house before my parents come over in a couple of weeks, but after that...I don't know ! Maybe just put it in the bank for now and save up to do something fun later on. But we'll see what happens ! 

### Response:

haha that sounds good. i would definitely be putting some money into savings. you never know when something comes up, its better to be prepared! congrats again friend!! 

thanks again . I appreciate it - and the advice too. 

### Response:

anytime my friend! have an awesome day and weekend ahead :) 

You too ! And thanks for your kind words . They mean a lot to me, as always . 

### Response:

aww i'm glad you are so happy with the job. it sounds like a great opportunity!! good luck in the future and please let me know if there is anything I can do! take care my friend :D 

thanks again ! It really means a lot to hear that from you . And thanks for offering your help if ever I need it - I'm sure I will. 

### Response:

anytime! its the least i could do after all of the support i have received here :) good luck and congrats once again my friend!! 

thank you . It means a lot to hear that from you too, especially since we've never met before - it's nice to know that there are so many great people out there in this world. 

### Response:

indeed! well have a good day and an awesome weekend! 

You as well ! And thanks for being here to celebrate with me . It means a lot to me . 

### Response:

you're welcome! anytime, my friend. enjoy your evening! cheers! 

thank you again . I appreciate it - and the encouragement too. You have been a great friend during all of this ! 

### Response:

you're so very welcome! glad to help out :) best wishes!! 

thanks again . It means a lot to hear that from you. Especially since we've never met before - it's nice to know that there are still some good people left in this world. 

### Response:

Congratulations on getting this job. It sounds like it has the potential to turn into something more long-term. I can tell you really value your work as a proofreader and editor, so having that experience recognized must feel fantastic! You'll probably be a great fit for this job, since you have so much expertise in writing and editing. I hope everything goes smoothly with the pregnancy leave of your colleague, and best of luck with all of your future endeavors! 🎉

that's really great news! congratulations! [/INST]

Yeah, that sounds like a good opportunity. Doing editorial work at the magazine must have been a valuable experience for you. You said it was a monthly publication? Is your column going to be published alongside another writer or will you be doing this on your own? 

### Response:

it's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . [/INST]

That makes sense. It can be challenging to write and edit content for a monthly publication, especially if you want to cover a lot of different topics in that timeframe. Are there any particular authors or publications that have influenced your writing style? 

### Response:

my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . [/INST]

That's awesome! I love hearing about people pursuing their passions and achieving their goals. Do you think the experience of working as a proofreader helped prepare you for this new role? 

### Response:

yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !  [/INST]

I can definitely relate to that excitement! It sounds like you have a lot of responsibility and opportunity ahead of you. What are your plans for your column, and what do you hope to achieve with it? 

### Response:

the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . [/INST]

That's great news! It sounds like you have a lot of experience and skills that are valuable to the magazine. Are there any specific topics or themes you plan on focusing on in your column? 

### Response:

she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . [/INST]

That's a great opportunity! Have you had much experience writing literary criticism before? What do you enjoy most about writing and editing? 

### Response:

### Response:

you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? [/INST]

Yes, that's correct. It's great that you have experience in both writing and editing. Do you think having this background will help you in your new role?
