"I don't understand why you didn't tell me about your relationship with [insert name of girlfriend]. It's important that we are honest and open with each other."

"Well, I thought it was obvious. I mean, we were spending so much time together, and I assumed you knew how I felt."

"But you didn't say anything to me about your feelings. You didn't even mention her name. How was I supposed to know what was going on?"

"I thought it was implied."

"No, it wasn't. I'm sorry for not being more open with you. I should have just asked you straight up if you had feelings for someone, instead of assuming everything was okay."

"Well, can we move past this and focus on the future? I love [insert name of girlfriend], and I want to spend the rest of my life with her."

"Of course, that's great news. But we need to work on our communication skills moving forward. Let's talk more openly about our feelings and needs, so we can have a stronger relationship."

"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? "

" Sorry , I thought you knew . "

" But you should tell me you were in love with her . "

" Didn't I ? "

" You know you didn't . "

" Well , I am telling you now . "

" Yes , but you might have told me before .

"I'm sorry, but that doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't I have told you? It's a very important decision."

"I don't know, maybe because you thought it was obvious or something . But it's not okay to assume things like that."

"Look, I understand if you're upset, but this is not my fault. You should have known better than to assume something like that."

"But how could I know? You didn't even tell me!"

"Well, maybe next time you'll think before you make assumptions like that."

"I don't understand why you're getting defensive about this. It's not my fault you didn't tell me something so important."

"Look, I apologize for not telling you sooner, but it's not like I was trying to hide anything."

"But still...I feel like I didn't know what was going on with you at all."

"Well, maybe that's because you weren't paying attention."

"I was! I mean, come on, it's not like I could have been blind to the fact that you were in love with her!"

"Maybe not, but I don't think you would have wanted to hear it. And besides, who are you to judge what I should or shouldn't tell you?"

"Excuse me?! I'm your friend! You should at least be honest with me about stuff like this!"

"Well, maybe you need to learn how to read between the lines a little better."

"I don't think so. This is just ridiculous. I can't believe you would try to make me feel bad for not knowing something so important!"

"Hey, I didn't ask for this conversation. You brought it up."

"But I have a right to be upset! You had no right to assume that I knew about your girlfriend without telling me!"

"Fine, you're right. But I'm still not responsible for how you react to the news."

"Yes, but...I feel like this is all my fault. Like I should have known better than to assume anything from you."

"Look, I'm not sure what else to say. You clearly don't understand the situation."

"Well, can we at least agree that it was a mistake for you not to tell me?"

"Yes, but it's also not like you had any right to be upset about it."

"Fine, I won't get mad. But I still think you should have told me!"

"Whatever. I'm just glad we could have this important conversation."

"Yeah...okay then."

"Great! Now can we please move on and focus on something more productive?"

"No, I want to talk about this for a while longer."

"Fine...but I'm not sure what good it will do. You still don't understand the situation."

"I don't know, maybe we can try to figure out how to fix it or something?"

"Fix it? What are you talking about? It's over!"

"No, I meant we could try to fix our friendship. You and me...we can still be friends, right?"

"Of course we can! But you need to stop being so sensitive about everything."

"I'm not sure what else to say."

"Well, maybe you should just chill out and stop taking everything so personally."

"Okay...maybe you're right."

"Good. Now let's forget about this whole thing and move on."

"Yeah...okay I guess."

"Great! See? We can still be friends!"

"Yeah, sure. But next time you should just tell me these things straight up instead of waiting for me to find out from someone else."

"Fine...I'll do better next time."

"Good."

"Great."

"Okay, see? We can still be friends!"

"Yeah, sure. But I'm not sure what the point of this conversation was to begin with."

"Fine...whatever."

"Great! Now let's move on and forget about all of this!"

"Okay, see? We can still be friends!"

"Yeah, sure. But I think we should at least agree that it was a mistake for you not to tell me about your girlfriend beforehand."

"Fine...I'll admit that it was a mistake."

"Great! Now let's move on and focus on something more productive!"

"No, I want to talk about this for a while longer."

"Fine...but I'm not sure what good it will do. You still don't understand the situation."

"I don't know, maybe we can try to figure out how to fix it or something?"
