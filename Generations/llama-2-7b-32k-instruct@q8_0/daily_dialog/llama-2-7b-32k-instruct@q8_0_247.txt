"I'm almost ready. Just need to grab some last minute items and then we can hit the road."

"Okay, great! Let me know when you're ready to go so I can get my stuff together too."

"Sure thing! I'll give you a heads up once I'm good to go. Have fun with your prep!"

Are you ready for the camping trip ? 

Yes, I am. 
I've got my makeup , my Cds, and my portable TV set...

Hello! We're supposed to be getting back to nature.

Yeah, yeah. Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you?

I've been packed for a week. All my stuff is in this backpack.

Let me see ... two books ... birdseed? That's trail mix!
