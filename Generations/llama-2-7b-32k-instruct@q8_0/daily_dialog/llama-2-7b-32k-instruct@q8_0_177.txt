Allan: Hey Sally, what's up? 
Sally: Allan, I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project. 
Allan: Look , Sally. I've put just as much work into this as anybody else. 
Sally: No, I'm sorry. I disagree. I don't think you've been working at full speed at all. 
Allan: Well. I'm sorry you feel that way.
