"I understand, but there are some things you need to let go of. For example, if you have too much on your plate, delegate tasks to others or say no to new projects."

"But what about my work ? That's how I make a living ."

"I understand that, but do you think it's healthy for you to work non-stop all the time? Remember, taking care of your physical and mental health is important too. You can still be successful in your career while prioritizing self-care."

"But what if my job depends on me doing everything myself ?"

"In that case, it's important to have a conversation with your employer about finding ways to lighten your load or take more breaks throughout the day. Remember, this is not sustainable in the long run and will only lead to burnout."

The doctor sighed and shook their head. "Look, I understand that, but you have to take care of yourself first. If you don't, you won't be able to do your job properly anyway."

"I just need a little more time," the patient said.

"I'm afraid there isn't much time left," the doctor replied sadly. "You need to make some changes now, or else you might not have a future."

The patient looked defeated but also resolute. They knew they had to change their ways if they wanted to survive.

"Very well," they said. "I'll start by taking a few days off work and then work on a schedule that allows me to take care of myself better."

"I understand," the patient said, their eyes fixed on the floor. "Thank you, Doctor."

The doctor smiled and patted them on the shoulder. "You're welcome. Now, let's get started on a healthier life!"
