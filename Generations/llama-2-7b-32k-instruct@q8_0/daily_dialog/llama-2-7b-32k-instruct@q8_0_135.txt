Dear Sales Manager, 
I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if we could set up another meeting with customer A regarding the widgets we discussed earlier this week. We need to finalize the order and make sure everything is in place for them to receive their shipment on time. 
I'm thinking that maybe Wednesday or Thursday next week would work best, depending on your availability. I'll let you know what day works better for me and we can go from there. Let me know what you think and we'll figure it out together! 
Thanks again for all your hard work and dedication, 
Sincerely, 
Your Sales Manager
