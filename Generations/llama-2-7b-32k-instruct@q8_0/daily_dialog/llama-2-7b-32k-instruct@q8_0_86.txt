You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 

 Yeah, about that. 

 Do you know Chinese better now ?

 Oh, definitely. I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.

 Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere. 

"No kidding! They're very good at it!"

Sure, here's the next turn:

"And you said something like "you know what, honey? Just get out of my face already.""

"No way . How could that happen ?"

"I mean... I just remember saying it to my girlfriend once and she laughed at me . She was really shocked at first because she couldn't believe that I said something like that . So, yeah... It definitely happens sometimes."

"Really ? That never happened to me . But then again, we always agreed on the prices in advance so we didn't have those discussions."

"Yeah, but what about you ? Have you ever had a conversation where you weren't sure if they were serious or not ? Like when someone starts yelling at you and you don't know how far to take it ."

"You mean like "I'll kill you!"?"

"Exactly . And have you ever been in that position where you had to decide whether or not to fight back?"

"No, I think the best solution is just to ignore them."

"Yeah... But what if they don't stop ? I mean... It must be a really crazy feeling when people are screaming at you and you don't know how far it will go . Like, when do you decide that enough is enough?"

"You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? "

" Yeah , about . "

" Do you know Chinese better now ? "

" Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . "

" Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere."

"I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation."

"A shouting match? You're so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it. I am not sure if this is true."

"I am telling you the truth. That's how I felt at that time."

"Yes, perhaps . Chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. Maybe it's quite natural to us."
