Sure! Here's a continuation of the dialogue where you are discussing your language skills with someone who has been in China for four months:

You know what? I'm starting to feel better about it. I mean, I still have no clue what people are saying most of the time when they speak Chinese, but at least now I understand enough to get by and ask for stuff. It's so much easier than trying to communicate in English! And I can read the Chinese characters pretty well, too, which is helping a lot with that whole "what are they saying?" thing.

But seriously, this language barrier issue has gotten way out of hand. It's like everyone speaks their own special language here or something. Even when people speak Mandarin, it seems like they all have their own accents and dialects and things, so you never really know what they're saying. I mean, sometimes it's fun to try and figure out the meaning from context and body language, but other times... well, let's just say that some days are harder than others!

How about you? How's your Chinese getting on?

Sure, here is a continuation of the dialogue:

Well, I've been studying hard and trying to improve my language skills. I mean, I'm still not great at it, but I can definitely hold my own in conversations now. The funny thing is, even though I'm pretty good at speaking Chinese, sometimes people still try to talk to me in English. Like, they know that I speak Chinese and all, so they'll be like "Hello! How are you doing today?" And I'm like... well... what? In any case, it's been really helpful having the language skills, though. I mean, I can get around more easily, buy things in shops without problems, and even make friends with people who don't speak a lot of English! It's definitely worth the effort.

But you know what? The hardest part about living here is still the language barrier. Sometimes it just feels like nobody can understand each other. Like, I'll be in a restaurant or something and everyone will be talking super fast Chinese to each other and I'm just sitting there feeling left out. Or sometimes people will try to talk to me in English and then get frustrated when I respond in Chinese. It's like they don't know how to communicate with each other or something. Maybe it's just a cultural thing, but it can be pretty awkward at times!

How about you? How's your language skills coming along?

I am still having trouble reading the signs but I have figured out that some of them are not for me. They say things like "do not enter," and "keep moving." And there's a sign on one of the doors that says, "No entry without prior authorization ." 

And I'm getting better at recognizing characters as well. The other day, I was walking around and I saw some characters that looked familiar but I couldn't place where I had seen them before . And then it dawned on me: they were the same ones I use to log into my computer every morning!

I know , right ? I could tell by the way she kept saying, "Hái shàng búshì ma?" ("How much is this?") that we were heading in the direction of an argument . But you have to understand something : Chinese characters only consist of four strokes . That's it ! So even though English words can contain hundreds of different sounds and meanings , there are only a few basic sounds represented by Chinese characters . 

### Response:
That being said, I decided that when we went back home to America for the holidays , I was going to learn Cantonese . You know why ? Because my girlfriend is from Hong Kong . And if you've ever been to Hong Kong, you know how important it is to speak Cantonese in order to understand what people are saying on the street . 

### Response:
I mean , don't get me wrong : I can read Chinese characters pretty well . But speaking it ? That was a whole other level of difficulty . And that was three years ago . Now, my girlfriend and I live in Guangzhou together . She teaches me Cantonese every night after work . We watch TV shows on Youtube that are subtitled in Cantonese . 

### Response:
And you know what's crazy ? You can learn a lot of words just by listening to people talk . I mean, if someone says something and you don't understand it the first time around, all you have to do is repeat it over and over again until you get it . 

### Response:
It may seem like madness at first glance . But think about how many words we use in English that aren't really present in the dictionary . For example , "goblin" or "googolplex." When people say those things out loud, they don't know what it means until after you hear them three times . 

### Response:
The same thing happens in Cantonese . Some of the words I use every day have no direct translation in English . It may seem like a big challenge at first , but once I got used to it, I had so much fun learning new words and trying out different phrases on my girlfriend's friends or her family members back home in Hong Kong . 

### Response:
It was so much easier than trying to memorize every word of English textbook . And the best part is that people were always excited when I started using these new words . They would go out of their way to help me pronounce certain sounds correctly . 

### Response:
So if you're studying a foreign language and you feel like giving up , remember that learning Chinese characters was tough too . And nobody wants to look back at an old textbook five years from now and laugh about how easy it used to be to learn a new language . 

### Response:
I mean, sure . There are some languages that are way harder than others . But once you get the hang of them, you can always pick up something new later on in your life . It's not like I had any choice when I was starting out . Chinese characters were a necessity if I wanted to learn Cantonese and Mandarin . 

### Response:
So don't ever give up on learning a foreign language , no matter how hard it seems at first ! You never know where it will take you . Or how much fun it will be .

### Response:
And just for fun : If you can read Chinese characters and speak Cantonese or Mandarin fluently, I'm sure your girlfriend would love to hear from you directly in those languages sometime !

So , I found myself getting a bit annoyed with my girlfriend for not speaking up or doing something about this situation, although the truth was she was simply in awe at the way Chinese people are so outspoken and direct in their communication style . 

I think it would be better if you spoke English to each other instead of using that language of anger and shouting . It might feel more natural for foreigners because we ’ re not used to this sort of thing . But I know the Chinese people, they love a bit of an argument now and again . They like to be passionate about things . 

I think you should learn from them , just let it go with a smile on your face and get used to their way of talking . Just see it as part of their culture . In the West we have a lot of other problems that people don ’ t notice because they are so used to seeing those things all the time .

So what you think I should do about this ? 

 I think if you want to make friends with Chinese people, or learn from them in any way , it would be better for you to keep your cool and let their style of talking become part of your own language and communication skills . 

Okay . Well, perhaps next time we will start our conversation in English so that we know what they are saying beforehand . Maybe the Chinese won ’ t feel like having a fight after all if we speak in English . But I think this sort of thing is always going to happen when you come and live here with them . 

And actually , even though I love living here in China, there were other things that happened which made me want to give up at times . Like the food . Did you find the food really bad ? 

 Not bad ! It was amazing . You just need to learn what to order and where to go . There are plenty of good places . The Chinese people love trying out new things, so they will always have something for foreigners to eat if they know it ’ s your first time or second time or whatever . 

You should never be afraid to try foods you don ’ t really like . Even though the taste is different , even just a tiny bit of it can actually make you feel very full and satisfied . 

I have been eating in China for three years now, so I know some Chinese dishes pretty well . But when I first arrived here, I was really surprised by how spicy many foods were . You know what they say : if you want to learn about something or someone , go to the source and try it out yourself . So that ’ s why I went to China ! 

Yes, my girlfriend and I are both here in Guangzhou for the first time . We haven ’ t seen each other since we were teenagers . It was amazing to meet up again after all these years . And of course, the food is great , but that's not why I came back to China ! 

So what do you think I should focus on learning more about in order to learn Chinese quickly ? 

 The main thing would be the spoken language . You know how to read it and write it already . There are lots of dictionaries for English-Chinese and Chinese -English translation online , but really knowing how to speak the language fluently is much more important than simply memorizing all the words . 

It 's good that you already have some knowledge of Chinese before arriving here in China . But actually speaking it would be way better if you want to learn it fast . You need a teacher or tutor , somebody who can teach you how to pronounce correctly and speak fluently . The more you talk to people, the quicker you will improve your language skills . 

And there are many ways of learning Chinese . A lot of people take private classes with tutors in universities here in Guangzhou . But actually , a lot of the Chinese people themselves have learned English and other languages from books and TV programs . It's not just about having a tutor . 

There is a huge range of learning materials online which you can use to learn by yourself if you like . There are many apps that have interactive language courses with lots of videos, songs and games in Chinese . You could also try using some of these resources on your phone when you 're waiting at the bus stop or whatever . 

And what about the written language ? How can I make my handwriting better ? 

You need to be very careful with that because it's a bit of a minefield . Traditional Chinese characters are still used in many places and on some street signs here , but they have different meanings to modern Chinese characters . They were created during the Qing Dynasty which was between 1644 and 1912 AD . So when you use these traditional characters, people might not understand what you want to say unless they are very well educated . 

Even if the word is still commonly used in modern Chinese today , a lot of young people won't know how to read it because the Qing Dynasty was so long ago and schools didn ’ t teach these characters anymore when China was ruled by foreigners . So you need to be very careful with that if you want to communicate . 

You should just stick to using simplified Chinese characters which are used in modern China today . It's much easier for most people because it only has about 2000 characters or so whereas the traditional version had over 50,000 and is still used by a lot of older Chinese people . So I think it would be better if you just stick to using simplified Chinese instead of trying to learn both traditional and simplified together .

I see . Thank you for your advice . It's good that I know about this now rather than later on when I have already tried to use some traditional characters . 

Yes, because a lot of people come to China and think it would be a good idea to learn Chinese from books or TV programs . But the truth is that even if you speak fluent English , these methods won ’ t work well for learning Chinese because they are based on English phonetic sounds and words rather than the Chinese language itself . 

So I don't recommend it at all ! You should really learn with a teacher or from listening to people speaking directly in Chinese . It's way more useful than just trying to learn from books or TV programs . 

Okay, that makes sense . Thank you for your help . Have you ever tried to teach English using any other method apart from the traditional textbook and pen - and-paper ? 

Oh yes ! I used to do this quite a lot in England when I was teaching English at schools there . Sometimes if you want the students to speak more freely rather than just copying what they read in books or being afraid of making mistakes , it's better for them to have some fun activities and games where they can actually use the language from the start without worrying about getting things wrong . 

There are lots of different kinds of English teaching methodology out there which are good for improving people 's speaking skills . One of my favourites is called Total Physical Response which was invented by a teacher in Brazil back in 1970s . The idea is to get students to move their bodies when they hear the word or phrase being said instead of just using their tongues and mouths to say it . So they would stand up , sit down, go over there, come here , open your eyes , close your eyes ... whatever the instruction might be for them to do . 

The reason why this is good is that the brain needs to process everything much more quickly in order for us to move our bodies . It's a kind of physical reaction which also helps language learners remember words better because they can connect those actions with the word or phrase that they are trying to learn . 

There's another method I used when I was working at my school in England called Communicative Language Teaching where you get the students to use their own ideas and feelings about things like sports or holidays to come up with short conversations using English language . They would also need to listen to a native speaker who was speaking more slowly than they were in order for them to be able to copy what he or she said . 

A lot of Chinese students often feel shy when it comes to speaking English . So even if you speak fluent English yourself and use lots of different methods , that won't make much difference if the person can't open their mouth and speak . It's not just about grammar or vocabulary . 

You need to help them get rid of their fear by making them feel confident enough in speaking without worrying what they will say wrong . If you don ’ t do that , then it doesn’t matter how much you talk about the language with them or correct them when they make mistakes because they still won't use it properly unless they have confidence to speak for themselves . 

I see what you mean . Thank you very much for your help and advice . I will definitely take note of everything that you told me here today so I can start learning Chinese from tomorrow onwards ! Have a good day now ! 

Thank you too, I hope you have a great time in China. If you want to find any more information about how to learn Chinese or anything else , feel free to ask me at any time . You can also come back and visit the language center here whenever you like during your stay in Guangzhou because we're open every day . 

So what are you going to do now ? Do you have any plans
