"I don't think so," said Mr. Jones with a smirk.  "But you do look a bit familiar."

"I must be mistaken," said Mr. Jones, scratching his head in confusion.  "Let me think... where have we met before?"

"It might have been at that conference last year," offered Mr. Stevenson with a grin.  "Remember when you gave the keynote speech? I was the one who asked that stupid question about the weather."

"Oh, that's right! You were the guy who wanted to know if it was going to rain later that day," said Mr. Jones, remembering the incident vividly.  "Well, I'm glad we finally got the chance to meet in person. It's always nice to put a face to a name."

"Same here," replied Mr. Stevenson with a nod.  "I must say, you don't look like your picture. You're taller and more... handsome than I expected."

"Thanks, I think?" said Mr. Jones, blushing slightly.  "It's good to meet you as well, Mr. Stevenson. Maybe we can do lunch sometime and catch up on old times?"

"Absolutely," agreed Mr. Stevenson.  "I'd like that very much."

And with that, the two men shook hands, exchanged contact information, and parted ways, both feeling a sense of mutual respect and camaraderie for one another. It had been a long time since they had seen each other, but it was clear that their brief encounter had reignited an old friendship.
