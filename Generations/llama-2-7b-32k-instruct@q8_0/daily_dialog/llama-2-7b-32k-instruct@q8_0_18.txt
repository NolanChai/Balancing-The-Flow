Sorry, but my car is broken and has been for a few days now . It broke down at the same intersection you were talking about earlier. 
I haven't had enough time or money to get it fixed yet . But I'm sure that it will be working soon ! 
So what's your name ? And how long have you lived in this house ?  
(Also, sorry for my poor English ! It's not my first language.)  
I live here. This is where I was born and raised. What about you ?   
How much time did it take from the hospital to get there when driving your car ?

I'm going to the airport .

I see . Is there anything else you would like to know or talk about? 

I'd like to know how much it will cost. 

It will cost $10. 

Great! That sounds reasonable. Can you tell me what the appointment is for ? 

Sure thing ! I have an appointment at the bank, but now I am here in front of your place. 

I'll take care of that. Can you please provide me with your payment information?

It will be $10.

That sounds good to me. I'm glad we could work something out.

I see

How many meters do you have in your car ? 

I don't need to use a meter . Just give me the money and let me take you wherever you want to go . How much is it going to cost ? 

It will be $ 10, OK ? You said you had radio time . That means it doesn't have to stop at any meters ? 

Well, what does your meter say ? It was broken the last time I went through here ... so I don't know if you can go past that without getting a ticket or not . Oh , and how much is gas these days anyway ? 

It will be $ 10. How about it ? 

I'll pay you right now . The meter doesn't matter to me . OK, so what else do I need to do before we go somewhere ? What do you want to eat or drink after we get there ? 

You don't have enough change for a $ 10 ride and my meter is broken. And how much did your last taxi cost you ? Did it break down at some point ? Do you ever wash the car ? It looks dirty . How long have you been driving a cab in this neighborhood anyway ? Is the city going to give us free parking spots for the day if we go somewhere else ? 

Sorry, I'm just trying to make sure that you actually know how much it will cost before we leave the meter . Yes, it is possible that something could break down during the ride. And no, I don't always have change on me when someone wants a $ 10 ride from here to there. You need to pay the driver now . OK ? It costs you more to pick up and drop off at a broken meter than it does for us to just go somewhere else . 

OK , so what else do I need to do before we get in your car ? What time is it right now ? How much gas did the last customer pay for when they rode with you in this same cab ? Was that before or after they used up all of their change ? Did you give them back any more money than they paid for a ride ? 

Sorry, I'm just trying to make sure we both know how much it will cost . OK? It doesn't matter if the meter is broken or not. How much does gas cost nowadays anyway ? You can fill out a form in my cab and give it to me whenever you want . And no , I don't have to do anything before getting into your car . 

OK, so what else do I need to do before we get in the car ? Do you like pizza or hamburgers better ? What time is it right now ? How much did you pay for gas last week and how much did the customer who came before me pay for a ride ? Did they have more money than they needed to ride with you when they got into your cab ? 

Sorry, I'm just trying to make sure we both know what we're getting in to . OK? It doesn't matter if you fill out a form or not. How much did it cost for the person who came before me to ride in this cab ? Did they have more money than they needed when they rode with you ? 

Sorry, I don't think you understand what I'm saying . It doesn't matter if you fill out a form or not. How much did it cost for the person who came before me to ride in this cab ? Did they have more money than they needed when they rode with you ? 

I think we both know how much your fare is supposed to be . I'm just trying to make sure that you actually do what you say you're going to do without taking any extra change out of my pocket on top of the $ 10 I gave you for gas or whatever it is that you want me to pay now . How much did your last customer pay you ? Did they have more money than they needed when they rode with you in this same cab ? You know what I mean, right ? And how much was the meter set at before the last person got out of your cab ? 

I'm just trying to make sure that we both understand how much it's going to cost us . OK? It doesn't matter if you have a form for me to fill out or not. How much did your last customer pay when they rode in this same cab ? Did they have more money than they needed when they got into your cab ? 

I don't know what else there is left for us to talk about . It doesn't matter if you have a form for me to fill out or not . How much did your last customer pay when they rode in this same cab ? Did they have more money than they needed when they got into your cab ? 

I don't know what else we can say either . I think that's it though. I really just need you to tell me how much the ride is going to cost us and then let's get in your car already . OK? Thanks ! Bye . 

OK, well , you're not being nice at all ! You know what ? We don't have a meter in our cab right now anyway . It was broken last week so we decided to stop using it until we got it fixed. That means that no one has been able to pay the fare by putting money into the meter since then . So you see, I'm not trying to get any more than what I need to take you somewhere . 

I understand that , but don't you have change for $ 10 ? You know I can't ride without a dollar or two extra because my cab doesn't run on credit cards yet and I had to give this person some gas money and didn't have any small bills . It will only take me five minutes at most to fill out your form, OK? 

Sorry , I just don't like wasting time with things that are silly . How about you just let me help you a little bit before we start arguing ? You could get into my cab without me having to wait any longer and you might even be able to have some small change left over if I give you a dollar back when I'm done with the form . 

I don't need a form or anything else . Just let me in your car already so we can go . OK ? We only have to go about five minutes away so it won't take that long anyway . You said you had change for $ 10, and now I see that you are trying to get some more money out of me by making me fill out a form ... or else you will make me wait longer in your cab without any small bills while you sit there doing nothing . What do you want ? Just let me in the car already so we can go ! 

I have no idea what you're talking about , but I don't like to waste time arguing with people either . How about you just stop trying to get more money out of me and let me help you while I'm waiting for someone else to ride in my cab ? It will only take a few minutes at most . OK ? Just give me your name so I can write it on the form later ... or do you want to fill this thing out now ? 

OK, just tell me your name and we can get started ! You don't have any cash with you ? So why did you even bother asking for $ 10 then ? Are you sure that you have enough change in your wallet so you won't need to take anything out of my pocket ? Do you want me to give you some money back when I finish the form ? You can just tell me what kind of car or truck you drive and we'll be ready to go . 

I don't have any cash with me right now, but that's not my fault . It will only take five minutes at most for me to get some change from the bank machine so I can give it to you in case you need more money than what you gave me last time . And no , I don't want you to give me any money back when you're done with the form . But I do have a question about your car or truck if you don't mind answering that before we get started ... 

OK, so tell me how many people usually ride in your car and what kind of car it is . And also , where did you say you were going again ? Oh, and do you have any small bills with you right now because I would like to give you a dollar back when I'm done filling out the form so you don't need to wait as long in my cab while I'm doing paperwork ? 

OK , so just tell me your name again and where you want to go ... And also, how many people will be riding with you today ? Do you have any small bills with you now ? 

Just give me the names of everyone who is going to ride in your car this time . I don't need any addresses or phone numbers right now , but I do want to know how much money you guys put together for a fare if it was more than $ 10 . That would help me to make sure that we have enough change on hand when the ride is over and we get back home again . OK ? So just give me all of your names again now, please ... I also want to know how many people are riding in your car right now before you leave so that I can make sure
