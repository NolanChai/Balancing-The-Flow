"So, Paula, where are you from? I'm from Canada, originally."

"I'm from Canada, originally . I'm from Montreal."

"When did you come to Los Angeles?"

"We moved here when I was fourteen."

"Did you go to school here?"

"Well, I went to high school here, but I went to college in Texas."

"Did you get a job right after graduation?"

"That must have been exciting! So, how did you end up moving to Los Angeles?"

"I'm not sure it was so exciting at the time. It was just a decision we made and it happened. But yes, I lived in France for about three years before moving here."

"That sounds really cool! Did you have any other jobs besides your job as an interior designer?"

"Not really. That's always been my passion and what I've done since college. Although I did work at a restaurant during high school to help pay the bills!"

"That's impressive! So, what do you like most about Los Angeles? You mentioned that you love the weather."

"Yes, the weather is great! And there are so many things to do here. The ocean and the mountains are just a short drive away, which is amazing for someone who loves the outdoors. There's also a really good food scene here, and I love that the city is constantly evolving."

"That sounds great! So, what do you think makes a house feel like home?"

"A comfortable couch and a nice view are a must, but I think it's all about making it personal. Making sure that the decor reflects your style and your personality, and that there's a space for everything you need."

"That's really interesting! So, do you have any tips for someone who is looking to buy their first home? Something that would make it feel like home?"
