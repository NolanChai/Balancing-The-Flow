I have to go . My friend wants me to come over and play video games with him.  

(This is a continuation of a dialogue between two friends, which was interrupted by an emergency phone call from another friend.)

I have to say that I like it a lot. It's very nice and violent game. The best thing is that I can kill who I want and when I want. Do you think it's possible for me to use the internet on my PlayStation? I don't know how to do it but I really need it!

I think it would be good if you could use the Internet on your PS, but unfortunately, that feature is not available yet. But I'm sure that in the near future they will add this option to the PS3, so we can have more fun using the PlayStation network.
