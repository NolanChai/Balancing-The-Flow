Bell Captain: "I apologize for the delay, but there was a miscommunication between our baggage handlers. Your bags are being sent up as we speak. I've also noted your name and room number, so rest assured that they will arrive shortly. Thank you for your patience, this has been an unusual day."

Yao Lan: "Thank you for the update . Can you please give me a rough estimate of when my bags will be at the front desk ?"

Bell Captain: "I'm happy to help! My best guess would be around 15 minutes. However, I understand that delays like these can be frustrating, so please let us know if you have any further concerns or questions."

This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ? 
Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?
I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number, please? 
Yes, it's Yao Lan. Room 406. 
And how many pieces did you have? 
Two suitcases and a handbag. The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red. Is there a name tag attached to them?
