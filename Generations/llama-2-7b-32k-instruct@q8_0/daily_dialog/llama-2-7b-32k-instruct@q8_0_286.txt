"Well , Mr. Green, it seems that we have similar backgrounds . Like yourself, I too am an immigrant. My parents brought me to the United States when I was two years old and raised me in the Bronx . Growing up there was never a doubt in my mind that I would attend college . However, as soon as I graduated from high school, I found it difficult to find employment . The economy was not doing so well at the time and jobs were scarce . I applied for many different types of positions but had very little success . Eventually , I began working in a small office that managed rental properties . That job paid me minimum wage but offered flexible hours . It allowed me to go to school during the day and work at nights and on weekends."

"Wow, that's amazing! How did you get started with your career as a financial analyst then ? Did you always have an interest in finance?"

"I never thought I would be involved in this line of work . To make a long story short, my friend introduced me to his boss who was looking for someone to analyze the company's accounts receivables and that job eventually led to me becoming a financial analyst. In fact , it is because of him and my current position here that I can speak Chinese fluently."

"Wonderful ! What do you like best about your job now ?"

"I enjoy the interaction with different clients, but what I really love most are the challenges . As a financial analyst, there's always something new and exciting happening in the market that requires me to make informed decisions. There's no boredom here!"

"That sounds great! Well Irene, let me tell you a little bit about my background . I went to university for undergraduate studies in France . After finishing there, I began working on my master's degree at Columbia University . When I was done with school, I took some time off to travel and got into real estate."

"Ah, that sounds really nice! Real Estate is a great industry. You know, I think we have the same taste in cars, as well!"

"Really ? Which car do you like best?"

"I love vintage vehicles . My dream car has always been a Lamborghini Murci√©lago LP 640 Roadster."
