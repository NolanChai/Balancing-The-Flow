Sure, here's the next turn in the dialog:

"Oh, yes, I see him. Hi Charles! It's nice to finally meet you."

"You too, John."

"So, what brings you to our airport?"

"I've been tasked with overseeing all security operations here. It's an exciting time!"

"That's great to hear! We're always looking for ways to improve our services and make them more efficient."

"Well, I'm sure we can come up with some ideas together. Let's have a chat over coffee sometime soon."

"Sounds good to me!"

"Great. See you around, John!"

"You too, Charles! Take care."

"Have a nice day."

"How can I recognize him?"

"He is short, well-built, and he's got light blond hair."

"Is there anything else?"

"He has a mustache, if I remember correctly, and a light complexion."

"How old is he?"

"He is in his late thirties."

Output: "Yes. What does he look like?"
