"I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Would you mind repeating that? I was going to meet Carl at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus."

"Yes, I heard you correctly. It seems like we have a mix-up in communication. Can you repeat what you said earlier so I can ensure we're on the same page?"

"Of course! I said that Carl and I were supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of either the Avenue B bus or D bus, not B as in boy. Would you like me to spell it out for you?"

"That would be great, thank you!"

"You're welcome! Have a wonderful day, Ruth."

"Same to you. Goodbye for now."

"Goodbye."

"I see what happened . So, to confirm, I should get off at the first stop in Chinatown and walk towards Canal Street." 

"Exactly ! And then you will turn left onto Canal and go a few blocks until you reach Mott St. We're right across from the subway station entrance, so don't worry if you can't see us at first ."

"Good morning, Ruth. Did I wake you up?"

"No, I was just about to get up. What's up, Carl?"

"Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus?"

"B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown."

"Oh, you mean Canal Street? When did we decide to meet?"

"At 10:45. Is Ann coming along?"

Hello .  Good morning, Ruth. Did I wake you up? No, I was just about to get up. What's up, Carl? Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus? B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown. Oh, you mean Canal Street? No, that's the wrong direction. Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown. When did we decide to meet? At 10:45. Is Ann coming along? I cannot get hold of her yet. See you around, Carl
