"We're almost out of time! We need to decide on our order soon. Do you want to share an appetizer? I recommend the samosas. They're a traditional Indian dish that are usually served as an appetizer."

"I've never tried a samosa before, but I'm game for trying something new. What about you? Are you ready to order?"

"Yes, I'm ready! Let's start with the samosas and then we can decide on our main courses. What do you think about the chicken tikka masala? It's a classic dish that everyone raves about."

"I've heard good things about it too. But, I also want to try something different. How about the lamb vindaloo? It sounds like a spicy adventure!"

"Ooh, I'm intrigued! A spicy adventure, you say? I think I'm up for that! Let's go with that and see how it is. What are your thoughts on the garlic naan bread to soak up all that flavor?"

"I think naan sounds delicious! And I've heard great things about their lamb vindaloo, so I'm excited to try it out. Plus, with a name like "lamb vindaloo," how could we resist? Let's order those and see what all the fuss is about!"

"Agreed! We can never have too much spice in our lives, right? So, let's start with ordering the lamb vindaloo for you to try something new and adventurous. And since we know that naan bread is a must-have, we'll get some of that as well to soak up all that flavor."

"Sounds like a plan! So, what's next? Do you want to order any drinks or dessert?"

we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? 

yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 

let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 
what would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms? 
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa. 
well, let's get a plate of those then. 

sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
