"Yes, it would be wise to rent a car. I'll remember that you have an international driver's license and have experience driving in the States. However, please keep in mind that Shanghai is a big city with heavy traffic during rush hour, especially in the downtown area where there are no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles, and some people don't take road regulations seriously. It would be best to take it slow and careful."

"Understood . Thank you very much, Mr. Liu ! I have a question about taxis in Shanghai . Can they drive on the opposite side of the road here? And how do we hail one?
