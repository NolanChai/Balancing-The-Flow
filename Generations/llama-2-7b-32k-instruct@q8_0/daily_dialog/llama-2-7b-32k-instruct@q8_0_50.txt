I don't know about that, but how's your Spanish coming along ?

Mary: Okay, so we could try that place you mentioned. It sounds interesting. 

John: Yeah, it is. I've heard great things about it. And it's not too far away. We can walk there if we want to. 

Mary: That would be fun. We could walk and talk about our day. How was your day, by the way? Anything exciting happen? 

John: Not really. I finished my work early, so I just hung out at home watching TV. You ? 

Mary: It was pretty busy. Lots of meetings with clients. But it went well, and now I'm ready to relax a bit. What about you? 

John: Not much different from usual. Just working and doing my daily stuff. How was the traffic on the way home? Did you have any problems ? 

Mary: No, not really. I left work early enough to avoid most of it. But the weather's been pretty bad lately. The roads are always a mess after a storm. 

John: Yeah, I know what you mean. That reminds me - do you mind if we get takeout for dinner? It'll be easier on us and the restaurant staff will appreciate it . 

Mary: Not at all! Let's do that. We can decide where to eat when we arrive at the restaurant, or maybe we can split up and order different things. What do you think ? 

John: That sounds good too. I'm not really sure what I want to eat yet anyway. Maybe we can check out the menu online first? There are some great restaurants in this area .

Mary: Okay, let's do that. We can check out some menus online and see what looks good to us. Are you sure you don't want to just pick one place and go there? 

John: Yeah, I'm fine with that. Let's look at a few options online first. That way we can make sure we're choosing the best spot for our tastes. 

Mary: Great! What do you think about Chinese food again? We had that last week and it was good. But maybe we could try some Italian or Mexican this time . 

John: Yeah, I'm open to that. Let's see what's out there. How about we check out the menu for Al's Steakhouse first? They have a lot of options on their website and it looks like they have good reviews. 

Mary: Okay, that sounds great! I love their salad bar too. And their prices are reasonable. What do you think about getting some fried fish as well? It's always a hit with me, and we can split an order between us. 

John: That sounds good to me. Let's put in the order for Al's Steakhouse and see what else they have. And I love their fried fish! It's always so crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. Yum.

John: Yeah, that's right. We can do that once we get there. But before we go, let's see what the traffic looks like. It's a little further away than I thought ... Do you think it will be busy? 

Mary: It might be. The weather has been nice lately and people are probably going out more. Let's call ahead to make sure they can accommodate us. 

John: Good idea! We don't want to get there and find out they're fully booked or something. We should also check in with the restaurant to see if they have a parking space available. It might be a busy night and all the spots are taken. 

Mary: Absolutely. Let's do that now before we leave. I can call while you grab our things.

Mary: Okay, let's go then. I hope they have my favorite dish - General Tso's Chicken! It's always so flavorful and spicy. And their fried fish is amazing too! I love how crispy it is on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. 

John: Me too! Let's hope they have our favorite dishes or something even better! It'll be fun to see what they have. And if not, we can always try something new. 

Mary: Yeah, that's true. We've never tried their fish and chips before. Maybe that would be a good alternative. Or maybe some of their other seafood dishes? They seem to have a lot of options. 

John: Let's check out the menu first and see what looks good to us. Then we can make our decision. Either way, I'm sure it will be
