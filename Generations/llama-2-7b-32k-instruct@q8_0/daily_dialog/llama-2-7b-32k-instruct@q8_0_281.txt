Joe: Hi Mary, how are you doing today?  
Mary: Hey there! Doing well. How about yourself?  
Joe: Pretty good. Just got done working out so feeling pretty energized.   
Mary: That's awesome! I can't wait to see the gym again soon. When did you last go?  
Joe: A few days ago but I was in a rush to get somewhere and couldn't take my time with it like I normally would. Need to be more relaxed next time.  
Mary: Yeah, that can definitely be frustrating! It's easy to forget about the small things when we're busy doing other things! How is your day been so far? Are you getting ready for class later?  
Joe: Oh yeah I totally forgot about that. I have my econ final in a little bit. Hopefully I can get it done before the semester ends! Luckily, I think I already know everything from class. Should be pretty easy...hopefully. What are you up to tonight? Anything fun planned?  
Mary: No plans yet - would love to catch a movie together sometime soon though! How's that sound? Or maybe we could grab some coffee or something.  
Joe: That sounds amazing!! I totally want to do something like that, too. Do you have any recommendations for a good movie? I haven't been to the movies in a while and need some ideas! What about tomorrow night - would that work better for you? It'd be fun to grab some dinner beforehand!  
Mary: Sounds great! I can't wait. Let me look at my schedule and let you know what time works best. How does 7pm sound? That should give us plenty of time to go out afterwards, if we want!  
Joe: Perfect! It's a date then! Can't believe it took this long for me to ask you on a date lol. You're great Mary! I hope things are going well with your finals and everything else! ðŸ˜Š   
Mary: Aww, thanks Joe!! And no problem - I'm glad I could help :) It was about time you asked me out anyways haha! I'm doing pretty good considering. Just trying to get through this semester as quickly as possible lol. But it'll all be over before we know it and then we can go on a proper date once exams are done!   
Joe: I know - totally agree with you there! You got this, Mary! Good luck on your finals tomorrow. Let me know if you need anything else from me for now or in the meantime. Take care! ðŸ˜Š  
Mary: Thanks again, Joe! And have a good night. Talk to you soon! ðŸ’–

"I was thinking we could see a new movie that just came out."

"Oh, I haven't decided yet. Maybe something action-packed or romantic comedy."

"Well, what about the new Marvel movie? Have you seen it?"

"No, I haven't had time to go to the movies lately. My work schedule has been crazy."

"I totally understand. Let me think on it and I will get back to you later today."

"Joe, how are you doing?  I am great!  How about you, Mary?  How are you?"

"I'm doing great!  Thank you for asking, Joe.  I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight."

"I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper."

"OK.  What about going to the movies on Friday night?"

"What were you planning on seeing?"

"I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer."

"How about The Secret Life of Bees?"
