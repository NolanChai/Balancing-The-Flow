"With no direction whatsoever, we can take inspiration from the fifty forwards Bean sent out today. Maybe they'll provide us with a fresh perspective." "I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime." "Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic? He must have just got online for the first time last week. He still thinks it's some kind of new toy."

"How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?"

"With the fifty forwards he sent out today, maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired." "I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime." "Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic? He must have just got online for the first time last week. He still thinks it's some kind of new toy."

"I can't believe how many jokes are making their way around in those forwarded messages from Bean!" "He must be having a ball sharing them with us."

"I wonder if he knows that the rest of us have been exchanging groans at his antics?" "It would seem so, but I'm sure he doesn't care one bit."

"That's because Bean is just happy to be sharing something he enjoys. And if we're not interested, that's our problem!"

"I guess you could say he's a forwarding fanatic ." "But I think we should let him know that his e-mails are appreciated." "Bean has been around the block a few times with these e-mail forwards. He knows exactly what he's doing and how they're received."

"He must be pretty proud to have us all under his spell ." "I wonder if it ever occurs to him that we might get tired of them?" "It never crosses his mind, I'll bet."

"But seriously...Bean is a true marketing genius." "The guy has found a way to make everyone feel like they're part of something special."

"And he does it with just the right amount of humor and personality ." "I mean, who doesn't enjoy a good laugh now and then?"

"So here's to Bean and his amazing ability to connect us all!" "We owe him one for providing such endless entertainment."

"I just hope he never runs out of new material to share!"

"Me too, but I doubt that will ever happen. After all, there's always something new happening in the world to comment on."

"And Bean is there to let us know about it ." "So let's raise a cup of coffee or tea to our friend Bean!" "To Bean, the man who makes the workday go by so much faster and with a smile!"

"I'm sure we can all agree that Bean knows how to make his mark." "He's become an integral part of our daily routine, hasn't he?"

"And I don't think anyone would want it any other way ." "Bean has certainly found a way to stand out from the crowd."

"He's one-of-a-kind and we're lucky to have him!"

"So let's not be afraid to admit that Bean is pretty great at what he does!"

"And maybe even take some notes on how to make our own mark in the world ."

"I think we could all learn a thing or two from Bean's approach to life."

"So let's raise a cup of coffee or tea to our friend Bean and his ability to brighten up our days!" "To Bean, the man who knows how to make us laugh and feel like we're part of something special!"
