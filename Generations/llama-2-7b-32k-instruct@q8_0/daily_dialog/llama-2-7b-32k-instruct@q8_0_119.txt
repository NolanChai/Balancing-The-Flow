You're from New York, aren't you?

What do you suggest I should see in New York? 

I don't know. What do you want to see? 

The Empire State Building is very nice. Or perhaps Central Park. 

No, no, the Empire State Building is a tourist trap. And Central Park is just a big old park with some hills and trees in it. I don't like parks either. They're boring too. You should see...the Statue of Liberty!

I'm sorry but the Statue of Liberty doesn't interest me, what other suggestions do you have?

Well...how about Times Square or Rockefeller Center? 

No, no, that won't do either. I told you, those places are just tourist traps. You should see...the United Nations Building! It has a very nice gift shop inside it.

No, no, I don't like parks either. How about...the Williamsburg Bridge? It goes from Manhattan to Brooklyn so you can walk or bike across and get a nice view of the city on the way. They also have some fun shops and restaurants along the way too!
