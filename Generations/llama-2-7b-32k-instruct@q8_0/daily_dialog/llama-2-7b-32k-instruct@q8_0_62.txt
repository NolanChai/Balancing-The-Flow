You have learnt how to ride a bicycle! That's great! It sounds like you plan to go to the water park by bike this weekend. However, your sister has some safety tips for you, which are very important! Firstly, obey traffic rules and do not break in red lights; secondly, don't play any jokes with friends while riding bikes, it could lead to an accident; last but not least, remember to ride on the left side of the road. 

I am no longer a baby! I am a teenager now. So, I hope you will be respectful and not treat me as a child.
