"That is amazing! How did you implement this change?"

"We had to invest in some new technology, but it's paid off. We installed a system that captures the heat energy from our printing presses and uses it to dry our products instead of relying solely on electricity. It's reduced our energy usage by about 15 percent in the last two years."

"That's fantastic! How did you decide to invest in this technology?"

"It was actually a joint decision between our team and some external stakeholders, like customers and suppliers. We wanted to find ways to reduce our carbon footprint and make our production process more sustainable, and this system allowed us to do just that."

"And how has it affected your bottom line? Has it saved you money?"

"Oh yes, definitely! The energy savings have translated directly into cost reductions. We've been able to pass some of those savings on to our customers in the form of lower prices, while still maintaining our profit margins."

"That's great news for everyone involved. It's good to see companies like yours taking initiatives to reduce their environmental impact and make a positive difference."
