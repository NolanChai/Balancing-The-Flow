Sure! Here's the next turn in the dialog:

"Oh, good. That's convenient. Can you tell me what time it is? I want to make sure I leave at a reasonable time so that I arrive on time."

Jane: "I can't. My watch has stopped working."

"Yes, that is correct. The number 13 bus runs more frequently than the number 7 bus, so it would be faster for you to take a number 13 bus."

"That sounds good.I'll catch a number 13 bus then."

"Great! I'm glad I could help. Have a nice trip!"

"Thanks."

"You too."
