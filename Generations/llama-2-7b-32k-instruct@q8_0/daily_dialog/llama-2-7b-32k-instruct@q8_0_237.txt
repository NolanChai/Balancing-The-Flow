"What are the prices for those dishes?"

"Our specials are priced at $15 each."

"How about you give me a deal on that special ? I'm a first-time customer, after all."

"I apologize, but we cannot offer any discounts or deals for our specials. They are already discounted from the regular menu prices, and they are intended to be our signature dishes that showcase the best of what we have to offer. However, we do have a few other options that may suit your preferences better. Would you like me to suggest some alternatives?"

"I think I'll try one of your burgers instead, then."

"Great! We have several different types of burgers on the menu, all made with fresh ingredients and served on a toasted bun. Would you like me to recommend one of those for you? Or perhaps you have a preference for certain toppings or sides?"
