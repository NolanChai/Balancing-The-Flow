Did you already take the history exam?
Yeah. It was hard. When do you take it? 
I take it tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on. What types of questions did you get? 
Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr. had on American society.
What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?

I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .

Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil

time. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .

It's clear from this exchange that the two students are talking about an upcoming history exam, with one student asking the other if they have taken it yet. The second student confirms that they will be taking it tomorrow morning and that there was a lot of material to study for. They also mention that most of their studying time was spent on the civil war, as this was a large portion of what they learned in class. Finally, the first student mentions Abraham Lincoln's impact on American society, suggesting that the second student should also focus on studying this topic if they have not already done so. Overall, it seems like both students are well-prepared for their upcoming history exam and are actively studying to do well.
