The holiday means much more than just a chance to see people you haven't seen in months. It's the time when we spend the most amount of time as a family . Everyone comes over and cooks together . My mom makes her famous meatballs, my dad does the sauce and everyone contributes something else . And then after lunch , the kids play with their cousins in the basement while the adults hang out and talk about old times . It's a day when we all have fun together .

It doesn't matter what you believe in; the family just has different tastes this year. It is still great to have all of them here though.

Okay, I can see that there are no kids around this year . What about pets ? Do they bring their pets? 

No pets either , just a change of pace. It's still fun though .

Yeah, well I have to say that the family is really diverse - in age as well as interests! But it looks like everyone had a great time nonetheless. Do they do this every year or just this one time? 

It's not something they always do, but they've been known to on occasion. The family dynamic can be unpredictable sometimes!

You'll just have to wait and find out ! 

I hope that helps ! What else can I help you with?

Okay, well, it looks like the family is having a great time without their kids and pets. They're all chatting and laughing together, enjoying each other's company. It must be nice to have such a large group of people who are so close . 

That's very true ! Sometimes it can be challenging with all the different opinions and schedules that everyone has , but they make it work. And sometimes they just have to compromise or let things go. But it's all worth it in the end!
