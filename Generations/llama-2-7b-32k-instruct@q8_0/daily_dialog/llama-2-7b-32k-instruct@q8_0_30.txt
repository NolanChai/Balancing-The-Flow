"There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?"

"I haven't seen her yet."

"I think that she is very pretty."

"Tell me how she looks."

"She's kind of short . She's probably about five feet."

"That's nice, but tell me what she looks like."

"The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes."

"Well, it sounds like you have a crush on this girl! What else do you notice about her? Is she wearing any jewelry or makeup?"

"Yes, I think I might have met her in passing once . She was wearing a necklace that caught my eye."

"That's interesting. So tell me more about the girl. What is she like as a person? Is she friendly and outgoing or shy and reserved?"

"I think she seems really nice, but I haven't had much of a chance to talk to her yet. She seems pretty confident though."

"That's great! It sounds like you have a good opportunity to get to know this new girl in school. Maybe you can start by saying hello and asking her about herself. Who knows, maybe she has the same interests as you or could become your new BFF!"

"Yeah, I guess so! I just hope that I don't come across too awkward or anything."

"Don't worry, you'll do fine! Just be yourself and be friendly. And if she doesn't seem interested in getting to know you at first, don't get discouraged. Sometimes it takes time for people to warm up to each other, but with a little effort, who knows where it might lead!"

"That sounds good. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens."

"Exactly! But in the meantime, let's keep our eyes open for this new girl around school and see if we can spot her again."

"Sounds like a plan! Thanks for your help, by the way. I think you're pretty cool too!"
