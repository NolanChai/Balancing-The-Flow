The housekeeping department is not sure if all of our machines need toner cartridges replaced, but I will double check with them and let you know ASAP. Thanks for your help! 

Our office supply store in town usually sells the compatible cartridges to us individually, rather than by the case . The prices are different for each machine model/brand , so if they sell them as a case of all the same brand for one price, we have no idea which machines will be cheaper or more expensive and would need to look at each one separately. 

Last time we did this bulk order was probably 4 months ago . The office supply store didn't have enough of some of the brands in stock , so they were backordered for a long time . It seemed like an eternity, but I think it might have been closer to 2 months until we received them all . Maybe you could double check with their inventory manager if we should order now or wait and see what is still available before we make the order ?

The toner cartridges have been out of stock for some time and we haven't had any new ones ordered in quite sometime.  I will make sure to get that done as soon as possible.  Is there anything else that you might need ?

Let me know if you would like to check the status after ordering the toner or if there is another department that I can contact for assistance with the order.  

[INST] Please continue the conversation from "Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?" 
We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . [/INST]

You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order. OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure. Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?

I think the only thing is toner. Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis. Anyhow, see what you can do to expedite the order this time.
