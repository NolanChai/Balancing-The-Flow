"Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? "

" We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . "

" You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . "

" OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? "

" I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time.'"

"Yes, please check with housekeeping first. If it's only toner that is required, I will place an order immediately and get it delivered before the end of business day tomorrow. In case if we have more orders to be placed, then let me know as soon as possible."
