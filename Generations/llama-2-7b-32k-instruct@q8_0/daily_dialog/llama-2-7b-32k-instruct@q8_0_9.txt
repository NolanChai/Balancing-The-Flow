"Yes, absolutely! I love the complex harmonies and intricate melodies of classical music. It's so beautiful and sophisticated. Do you have a favorite composer or piece?"

"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? "

" Yes.Do you like it ? "

" It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . "

" Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . "

" Is classical music your favorite ? "

" Yes . What about you ? "

" I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .

Blake: Hey, I am listening to Mozart. Do you like it? 
Alice: It's great! And I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. 
Blake: Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it. Is classical music your favorite?
Alice: Yes, it is my favorite. What about you?
Blake: Pop music. Classical music is a bit too heavy for me. I can't get fully relaxed in it. 
Alice: Pop music doesn't have any depth for me. 
Blake: Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it.

"I didn't start listening to classical music until recently. When I first heard Mozart, it made me feel calm and relaxed. It's different from pop music because it has a richer sound and more complex harmonies."

"That's interesting. So you like something with a lot of layers . Like an onion ? "

"I guess so ! What about you? Do you have any favorite composers or pieces?"

"I do! I really enjoy Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. It's such a classic and has a great, driving beat."

"Beethoven is definitely one of the greats. I think Mozart has more technical skill than Beethoven though."

"That's fair. And you have to admit, his name sounds better in German! 'Mozart' rolls off the tongue nicely, doesn't it?"

"You're right again . Hey, did you know that Mozart was also a great pianist? He composed some of his most famous works for solo piano."

"No way! I had no idea. That's really cool. Do you play the piano, Blake?"

"I took lessons when I was younger but I got too busy with other stuff and never continued."

"Aww, that's a shame. Maybe you should take it back up again someday! It sounds like fun to learn and play classical music on the piano."

"Hey , have you ever thought about playing any instruments?"

"Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart? Yes.Do you like it? It's great. and I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it. Is classical music your favorite? No, I think pop music is my favorite genre. I started to play the violin when I was eight years old. From then on, classical music has been an important part of my life. Wow! You didn't know that I can play the violin? Do you still play it now?"

"Hey Blake! Are you listening to Mozart again? It sounds nice."

"Yes, do you like it? I've heard that listening to Mozart can make your intelligence grow. I don't think so though."

"Is classical music your favorite genre of all time?"

"No, pop music is my favorite. What about you?"

"I like classical music too. But do you know why? Because listening to it helps me concentrate and focus better!"

"Really? That's amazing! I never knew that. Pop music doesn't help me concentrate at all though, so I stick with Mozart."

"Isn't classical music a bit too heavy for you as well?"

"Yeah it is, that's why I like pop music more. It makes me relaxed and happy!"

"What instrument do you play? Or did you used to play one?"

"I don't play any instruments but I've always loved listening to classical music."

"You should learn how to play an instrument if you love classical music so much! It will only enhance your experience!"

"Hey Blake, are you still listening to Mozart? The sounds amazing!"

"Yes. Do you like it? I've heard that listening to Mozart can improve your intelligence."

"That's interesting. I don't think so though. What do you listen to usually?'

"I like classical music the best. What about you?"

"I prefer pop music myself. It helps me relax and unwind better than anything else."

"You know, listening to Mozart has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in people of all ages."

"Oh, that's interesting! I didn't realize it had that effect on people. How long have you been into classical music?"

"I started playing the violin when I was eight years old so I've been into it for a while now.'

"That's amazing! Did you know that listening to classical music can help improve your focus and concentration skills? It's true!"

"Oh really? That's great to hear! I don't play any instruments, but I love listening to them."
