Sorry, my bad. So you want to know the difference between a cafe au lait and a latte ? Okay, here goes : 
A cafe au lait is like a coffee with milk and maybe a bit of chocolate . It's often served in a large cup or bowl and it's not as sweet as a latte . 
A latte is more like a cappuccino but with less froth . It's also made with espresso instead of coffee . It can be served hot or cold, but it's usually enjoyed at room temperature . And that's the difference between a cafe au lait and a latte ! 
I hope that helps . Do you have any more questions ?
