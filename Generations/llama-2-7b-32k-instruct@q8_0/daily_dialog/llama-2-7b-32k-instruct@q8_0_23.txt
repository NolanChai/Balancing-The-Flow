"Oh, so that's what this is about. Go ahead and tell me how much you love her and how she always looks at you with those eyes."

"No! She doesn't even know I exist!" Robert exclaimed. "It's just that every time I walk into the coffee shop where she works, my heart skips a beat. It's like fate is trying to tell me something."

"Fate?" I asked skeptically. "You think going to the same coffee shop every day for the past year was meant to be? Please, Robert, this girl has probably had other customers in her life who were just as nice and regular as you are."

But Robert wasn't listening. He was already on his way out the door with a determined look on his face. "I'll prove you wrong," he said before disappearing into the night.
