"that was a really good meal, Gordon. I couldn't eat another bite."
"It sure was. I couldn't eat another bite either."
"Well, it is getting pretty late. I think we should go home now."
"You're right. I have to get up early tomorrow for work."
"Let's see how much the bill is."

Gordon Ramsay: Hey, it was a great meal! I couldn't eat another bite. But it's getting pretty late, and we should go home. I have to get up early for work tomorrow. 

Gordon Ramsay: Let's see how much the bill is. 

Restaurant Owner: Don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat!

Gordon: "don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat."
Rachel: "what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill."
Gordon: "no way, Gordon. I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill."
Rachel: "I don't mind helping out if you really want me to, but I think it's a bit unfair for you to just assume that you have to pay the entire bill without even asking. It's not like we're dating or anything!"
Gordon: "Ah, that's right! We're not officially a couple yet. But we are friends and I would appreciate it if you could just let me take care of this one small thing for us."
Rachel: "Fine, but only because I want to be nice. I think it's important to split the bill when you go out to eat together as friends or even a couple. Otherwise, it can get awkward and make people uncomfortable."
Gordon: "Thank you, Rachel! You always know how to put me at ease. Now let's just forget about the whole thing and enjoy our nice dinner together."
Rachel: "I agree. But next time you want to treat me, I'll let you know so that we can plan accordingly. Deal?"

Gordon: "that was a really good meal , Gordon."

Rachel: " It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite ."

Gordon: " well, it is getting pretty late. I think we should go home."

Rachel: " you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow."

Gordon: " let's see how much the bill is."

Rachel: " don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat."

Gordon: " what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill."

Rachel: " no, I insist. I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't ."

Gordon: " no way, Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill."

Rachel: " alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill."

Gordon: " that's better. This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk."

Rachel: " yeah, but I offered to pay for you earlier . You said no."

Gordon: " oh, right. Well, let's just get out of here then and go home."

Rachel: " alright, let's do that then."

Gordon and the chef are still at the restaurant, chatting about their experience. The chef suggests that Gordon come back for dinner some night so they can eat together again. Gordon agrees and promises to let the chef treat him next time. The two men part ways, excited to have made a new friend and looking forward to future meals together.

"I think we should go home," the chef says, breaking into their conversation.
