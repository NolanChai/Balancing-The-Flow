Sure, here's a possible continuation of the dialogue:

"I see... Well, let's wait for him to return. If he doesn't show up soon, we can call his friend or family member and ask them about his whereabouts."

"Yeah, maybe you are right . But I am still worried, because this is not like him . He always comes back on time, even if he has a lot of work to do."

"I understand, but let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe he got caught up in something and forgot about the time. We can try calling his phone, or we can go out looking for him."

"Okay, I will call him now and check if he is alright . Maybe he is just in a meeting or something."

"That's a good idea. Let me know as soon as you hear from him. If he doesn't answer his phone, we can try again later or use other means of communication, like text messaging or social media."

"Okay, I will do that now. Thanks for your help."

In this version, the two characters are still discussing their mutual concern about the missing person. The woman is trying to reassure herself and her friend that everything is fine, but she's still worried enough to seek guidance from her companion. The man seems confident that all will be well, but he also offers practical advice on how to find the missing person. Together they plan to call the missing person's phone and try other means of communication if necessary. This version maintains the same tone and characterization as before while adding a sense of urgency and concern for the missing person's safety.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
