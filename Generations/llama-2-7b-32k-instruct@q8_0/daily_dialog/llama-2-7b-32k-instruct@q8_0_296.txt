Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the next turn in the dialog:

Jason: *walks into the room* Hey guys, what are we playing today?

Charlie: *smiling* We were thinking of inviting you to a game night!

Jason: *excitedly* Oh, that sounds like fun. What's the game?

Sam: *nervously* Well...we were thinking about inviting Jason to play a game tonight.

Jason: *laughs* I know, it's all my fault. I always watch movies on HBO and never get invited to play games with you guys. I feel like such an outcast.

Charlie: *smiling* Don't worry about it. It's a fun game that everyone will enjoy. Plus, we need one more player for the game to work properly.

Jason: Alright, I'll play. Just don't expect me to be very good at it. I'm not much of a gamer.

Sam: *relieved* That's okay. We're just glad you're joining us. Now, let's get started!

Jason: *excitedly* Alright, let's do this! I can't wait to see what kind of game we're playing tonight.
