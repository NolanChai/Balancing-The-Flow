"I'm doing well. I just got a promotion at work, so things are looking up for me."

"That's great! What do you do exactly?"

"I'm a software engineer at a tech company in the city . It can be stressful sometimes but it's also really rewarding."

"It sounds like you're doing something that you're passionate about. That's the most important thing, right?"

"Yeah, I agree. And speaking of passions, how have you been spending your time lately? Any interesting hobbies or projects you want to share with me?"

"I hope so too . We miss seeing each other all the time like we used to . Would love to catch up and hear about what you have been up to . And how are your parents doing ? What did they think of me moving out here to California?"
