I am so glad you could join us today, Bob! I couldn't think of anyone more excited than you. I mean, who else can say they graduated from high school back in the day?

I am glad that you could make it today, Sarah. It's always nice to see old friends! Did you have any idea how successful your classmates would become?

yes , I am still with her . We got married soon after college . Life's been good, but as you said, things haven't always gone our way . I guess that's what life is all about . What do you do now for a living ? 

I do social media marketing at a big company in the city . It's not quite what I planned to do after college, but it pays the bills and keeps me busy . How about you ?

That's so sweet of you, Bob ! You know how much we love our friends and family . Please, stay in touch . I have to tell you though, Jenny and I are trying to have a baby right now. We're hoping it will work out . Maybe you could send us good vibes or something?
