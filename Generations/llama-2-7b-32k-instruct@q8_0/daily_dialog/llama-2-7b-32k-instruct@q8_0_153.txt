I don't think the format of this dialogue is appropriate or accurate. It's more of a script than a conversation, and it lacks any natural language expressions or responses. Additionally, the use of colons to indicate a pause in speech feels forced and unnatural.

Instead, I suggest rewriting the dialogue as follows:

"Hey there! Would you like to join us for our picnic tomorrow? It'll be lots of fun!"

"Sorry, can't make it. I already have plans to meet my girlfriend at the airport then."

"Aw, that sucks. Maybe next time. We're also having a dress party tomorrow evening. Would you like to join us for that?"

"I wish I could, but we've already got plans for that night too. It's a real pity.'

"Yeah, that stinks. Well, hopefully we can get together soon! Take care!"

In this version, the dialogue feels more natural and conversational. The use of contractions ("can't" instead of "cannot") adds a touch of informality and friendliness. The revised sentences also sound more like how people actually speak in conversation, rather than a scripted interaction.

Overall, I think the original dialogue format is not suitable for a friendly chat between friends or colleagues. It's important to make the dialogue feel natural and conversational, with the appropriate tone and language.
