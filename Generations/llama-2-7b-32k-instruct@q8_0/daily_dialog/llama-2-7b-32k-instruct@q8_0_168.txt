"No, it's fine. You have nothing to apologize for," Bill said. "It sounds like you had a rough morning and were just in a bad mood. Let's plan on having lunch together today." 

Bill went to the cafeteria and waited for Peter so they could go together. As he was waiting, he thought about how he didn't mean to snap at Peter this morning and hoped that Peter would forgive him. He also wondered why Peter had asked if the cafeteria was open - did he have a particular reason for wanting to go there?

When Peter showed up, Bill couldn't help but notice that he seemed a bit grumpy himself. But he tried to put on a brave face and be positive as they headed off to lunch.
