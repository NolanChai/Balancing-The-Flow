Jim is opposed to the idea of computers in schools because they make kids dependent on technology and undermine their ability to use their own logic. Jim also feels that computers reduce students' learning of essential skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  

Output: I'm sorry , but you don't understand what I mean .  Computers teach children the fundamentals of programming and logical reasoning, which are necessary for success in today's technology-dependent world. They also expose students to various technologies and platforms that they may not have had access to otherwise. 

Furthermore, computers can be used as educational tools that complement traditional teaching methods by providing interactive and engaging learning experiences. For example, simulations, virtual labs, and online resources can help students better understand complex concepts and processes in a more accessible way. 

In addition, technology has the potential to personalize education, enabling teachers to tailor instruction to individual student needs and abilities. This is particularly beneficial for students with special learning needs or those who require additional support. 

Finally, computers can be used to provide students with access to a wealth of information and resources that they may not have otherwise had access to, which can help foster their curiosity and interest in learning. 

I hope this clarifies my position. Do you have any other questions?
