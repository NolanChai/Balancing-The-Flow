"Well , known Jim, I'm glad to hear you agree with me that computers are good for teaching kids because they help them to think. What do you mean by "relying on gadgets?" 

"I don't know what you mean. Computers can't spell and add or subtract without human interaction." 

"That may be true, but that doesn't mean computers aren't good for teaching kids to think because of the way they encourage logical thought processes. For example, when kids are creating programs, it engages their imagination and sharpens their minds."
