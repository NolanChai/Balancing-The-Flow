"Do you believe in UFOs ?"

" Of course , they are out there . "

" But I never saw them . "

" Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . "

" You mean that you can them ."

"Yes, but not in the way that most people think. I have seen them, and they're very real."

"You know what you should do? Record some video of one for proof."

"I have done that before. It doesn't mean anything though because it's all just a conspiracy theory to cover up the truth."

"That's not true! There are many credible witnesses and videos out there that prove their existence."

"I don't care. I know what I saw, and it wasn't an alien spacecraft."

"So you believe in them but won't admit it?"

"No, I never said that. I'm just saying that the government is lying to us about their existence."

"Okay, let's move on from this topic. Do you have any other opinions or beliefs you'd like to share?"

"I don't know. I'm not really into politics or world events. I just try to live my life and focus on my family and friends."

"Well, that's good. It's important to keep things simple and avoid getting too caught up in the drama of the world."

"Agreed. But sometimes it can be hard not to get sucked into it when everything is so polarized and extreme."

"I understand that. But it's important to stay grounded and focus on what really matters, like family, friends, and your own personal growth."

"You're right. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today."

"My pleasure. It was nice talking to you as well."
