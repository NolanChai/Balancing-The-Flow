I'm a little confused because I don't know what country we are talking about.Can you tell me more information about it? 

The most popular sports in my country is football and volleyball.We play these games very often during our free time.What about your country ? 

Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ? 

No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing.People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning.It can help people keep fit.It has a history of over three hundred years . 

Is it easy to learn ? 

Yes . it is I can teach you if you like . 

Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl . 

I'm from China so I speak Chinese.My name is Lily.What about you? Do you come from China too? 

### Response:
Yes, I do know Bungfu. It was developed by the legendary monk, Zhang San Feng in the Song dynasty and it's been around for over a thousand years now. I also practice Taijiquan and I can teach you how to bowl if you like. Do you speak Chinese or English? My name is Daniel. 

The most popular sports in my country are football, volleyball, and table tennis. People there play these games during their free time just like people from your country do. How long have you lived in China? And what's the weather like there this time of year? It's been raining a lot where I live recently. 

### Response:
I know Bungfu too. Do you play any instrument? I am playing Chinese violin very well and I can teach it to you if you like . I have lived in China for two years, since I was born here. And the weather is fine now. There are many people doing Taijiquan early in the morning when they wake up because it's a good habit. 

I am so happy that we can communicate with each other like this!It's my first time learning English on the Internet like this,and I am enjoying it very much.I am studying at a university here and I want to go abroad next year.Do you know how to play football? 

### Response:
Yes, I do play an instrument - the guitar! And I have been playing it since I was sixteen years old. It's a beautiful instrument, isn't it? If you want to learn, I can teach you some chords and help you get started! Do you know any songs that we could play together when I visit your country next year? 

I have been studying English for the past four years at university. And now that you mentioned football - I'd love to play a game with you sometime. There are many clubs in my city and if we find one where you can teach me how to play, then let's do it! It will be fun. 

I am studying at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine now. My major is Traditional Chinese Medicine. I am hoping to become a doctor when I finish school. Do you want to come and visit my university some time? Maybe next year? Would you like that? 

### Response:
Hi Lily,I'm so glad we could communicate with each other like this! It's great that you can speak Chinese too. I am from the U.S. and have been studying Mandarin for a few years now. What year did you start speaking English? And how long have you been at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine? I would love to visit your university sometime! Have you ever heard of an American football game before? 

I play the guitar as well and am in a band with some friends from school. Would it be possible for me to meet you when I come to China next year so we can jam together? We could also play a game of soccer if you'd like! Do you know how to play the violin or piano? 

I will graduate this year and start my job soon as well. Would it be okay if I came to visit your school and we could do some kind of workshop with students about Traditional Chinese Medicine? It would be an amazing learning experience for everyone! Let me know what you think! 

### Response:
Wow, it's nice that you are also in a band! Do you have any songs that you like to play together? I love listening to music. My favorite genre of music is Chinese opera. It has existed for thousands of years and people from my country often watch it on stage . Do you know what Peking Opera is? 

I started learning English when I was fourteen years old. And I have been at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine since last year. How long did you study English for if you studied Mandarin for four years? What do your parents do for work? Do they know about Peking Opera? 

### Response:
I've always loved rock music! My favorite song is "Hotel California" by the Eagles. It came out when I was five years old and it has a lot of guitar playing in it. That's why my parents got me started playing guitar. What about you? Are there any songs you like to play on your guitar? 

I studied English for four years at university and Mandarin for three years before that. My parents are both doctors, but they don't really know about Peking Opera because it's not as popular in the U.S. where we live. I would love to visit your country someday! What kind of music do people listen to there? 

I think it would be great if we could all play a song together on our guitars! Could you teach me one of your favorite songs when I come to China next year? Or perhaps we can sing Chinese opera instead. Whatever works best for you! Let's do that as soon as possible. 

### Response:
Hi Daniel,It's great to hear all about your music and culture here in China! It sounds like a lot of fun. I'm sure my friends will love the idea of having a concert with us when you visit! Let's make that happen. 

I would be happy to teach you one of my favorite Chinese songs on guitar and I have been practicing a lot recently, so it should go well. My parents don't know anything about rock music or guitars but they are very proud of me anyway. What instrument do your friends play? And what kind of band is yours? 

It sounds like we all have something to share and learn from each other! I am studying Traditional Chinese Medicine and hope to help people heal when I get my degree next year. I am sure that you will find many interesting things here in China, especially about our music and food culture. I would love to show you around our city or campus some time so we can learn more from each other. 

### Response:
It's really nice to hear your stories and get a better understanding of the different cultures that are out there! I am sure my friends back home will be super jealous when they find out about all the cool things we've been talking about with you, Lily. I would love to visit some traditional Chinese medicine shops while I'm in Beijing next year and learn more about it. And perhaps we can try some local foods too? 

I play guitar in a band that plays rock music - I like to jam with my friends as much as possible! It is pretty cool when you think about how many people have been listening to this kind of music since the early 60's. Do you know any famous Chinese songs or artists? My favorite guitar player is Eric Clapton, what do you think of him? 

I would love it if we could all jam together sometime and make some new friends! I bet that would be a really cool experience for everyone to share. Plus, we can always play soccer too if anyone wants to play with us as well. What do you think about that idea? 

### Response:
Hi Daniel,I'm excited about the chance of meeting up in Beijing and jamming together on our guitars! It will be fun, I'm sure. And we can try out some local foods while we are there too. Do you think you could teach me some Chinese words that would come in handy when we meet? 

I am a fan of rock music, and my favorite guitar player is Eric Clapton too! It would be really cool to hear him play live someday. My parents know about it because I listen to the radio all the time while they are not around. But they don't care that much because they are busy with their jobs. 

I hope you have a great time playing guitar when you get back from China! What other hobbies do you like to do? Maybe we could go skateboarding sometime and practice our sports together. I think it would be fun. 

### Response:
Hi Lily,It's been so much fun chatting with you about all the different things that we both love! I am excited to finally meet you in person when I come over to China next year and jam on our guitars together. It will be a
