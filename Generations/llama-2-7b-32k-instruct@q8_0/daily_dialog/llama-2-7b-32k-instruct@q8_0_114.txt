George, I see your point. Let's consider the options.

Lili : But how will we find places to visit? There must be some rules or something to follow for tourists to know where they should go and what they can do there . Right ?

George: Well, Lili, you are right! You are right! We have a map of our state in the car. Let's take it out and see if we find anything interesting on the way . What about visiting an art museum? I heard that one city in this region has a great art collection, maybe we can go there for the weekend. 

### Response:
George, I think that would be fun! But let's not rush. We should plan it well and make sure we have time to visit other interesting places as well.

Lili : Okay George, let's do some research on where to go this weekend . Let's start with the map you were talking about. 

### Response:
Great idea! We can use it to look for interesting places to visit and see if there are any nearby.

No, I don't agree with you. The situation is different now . You know that we are very poor and we can barely make ends meet. It doesn't mean that we should just go on vacation without considering the cost or how to pay for it. We need to be responsible about money and not spend recklessly.

I think it would be best if Lili and George discussed their finances openly, before making any concrete plans for a vacation. They might find a way to make it work within their budget, but they need to get on the same page about how much money they have available, and what they are willing to spend. It sounds like Lili is eager to take a break from their daily routine and explore new places, which is great! However, they should also prioritize being financially responsible together.

I agree with George's idea. We should have a vacation! Vacations help us to relax and reduce stress. It would be good for our health and well-being. I also like his plan of staying in the van. We won't need to spend much money, as we don't have to rent a hotel or eat at fancy restaurants. That's a great idea!

I don't know where we should go yet, but we can decide that later. Let's get out of the house and have some fun! I miss Chinese food too, so we can definitely stop by a restaurant serving delicious Chinese cuisine. 

Let's make our plans ASAP. I hope we can start packing our bags and hit the road soon!
