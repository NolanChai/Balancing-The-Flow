Lili: Hey George, how about taking a vacation?
George: Sure thing! Let's take our RV and travel around the state. We can park it wherever we want and rest whenever we feel tired. It will be fun!
Lili: But George, we don't have much money left after paying the rent this month. How are we going to afford that?
George: Don't worry, Lili. We won't need to spend a lot of money on accommodation or transportation. I promise you it won't cost much. Let's just visit different places in the state and have fun! ðŸ˜Š

Lili: I can't believe George is suggesting we take a vacation when we don't even have enough money for rent. We can't just go gallivanting around the state in our van, it will cost us too much. 

George: Lili, let's take a vacation! 

Lili: George, how can we? Vacations cost money. And this month we don't have much money left after paying the rent. 

George: Well, Lili, we can visit different places in the state in our van 10. We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. Trust me, it won't cost much. 

Lili: Where will we sleep, then? 

George: In the van. 

Lili: What about other expenses? 

George: Let's see. Gas, food, recreation, we won't spend much. Come on. Don't hesitate. We need to get out of the house once in a while. We have been working hard, haven't we?
