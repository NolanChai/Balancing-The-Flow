"I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time  "

" Well , I must apologize, madam. We have new computers here, you know ."

"Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly?"

"I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again."

"How can I be sure this is the last of these mistakes? You don't seem to realize what a mess this is. " 

"Well, that's where the new computers come in . They are much more efficient and accurate than the old ones. We had some problems with the first batch but we have since fixed them."

"How can you be sure it won't happen again?"

"We have new software and training programs for our employees to prevent any mistakes like this from happening in future . I promise you, madam, that it will not happen again. 

"I see . Well, if you are so confident, I suppose I should accept your apology."

"Thank you, madam, I really appreciate that. You have no idea what this means to me. This is the first time I've apologized for something like this and I feel so bad about it. Please believe me when I say we are doing everything possible to make sure this doesn't happen again."

"I see . Well, if you can do that, I guess there's nothing else to be said then."

"No, madam, there really isn't. Thank you so much for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. It means the world to me."

"You are most welcome . Now, if you could just give me a moment to myself while I try and sort this mess out...  "

"Of course, madam! Absolutely. I'll let you get on with it. Just let us know if there is anything else we can do for you."

"Thank you . That would be much appreciated . Now, if you could just give me a moment to myself while I try and sort this mess out...  "
