"what was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail? "

"my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate."

"three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive!"

"well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive."

"were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?"

Abigail: We had a very small wedding. Just two friends there as witnesses. But then, we had three parties to celebrate. 

Petra: Wow! That's a lot of partying. That must have been expensive. 

Abigail: It wasn’t that expensive actually. Since my husband and I are from different countries and live in another country, we decided to have one party in each country. 

Petra: So your parents couldn't travel to see you get married? They were upset about it? 

Abigail: I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn’t afford to fly out to see us and we couldn’t afford to fly out to see them so they understood. 

Petra: Did your husband's family get a chance to meet your family?

"yes, we went to Mexico . We decided not to have one after the wedding because it seemed silly."

"that makes sense . Are there any traditions in your country that you do at weddings?"

"we had a traditional cake-cutting ceremony and gave gifts to each other . The main difference is that we did everything ourselves - my husband cooked the food, I made all of the decorations, and we had our own vows."

"that's really sweet . Do you know why your parents couldn't fly out?"

"they are not rich people . They have a small business and they don't have enough money for big trips like that."

"oh, I see. Did they send any gifts or anything?"

"no, but my mom sent us some money, so we had enough for the party and food."

"that's nice of her . Is there a particular reason why you decided to get married in another country? Was it because your husband is from that country?"

"yes, he's from Mexico . We met while working abroad together in Japan . We both loved living in Japan, but we wanted to live somewhere more rural and less expensive."

"I see. Is there any advice you would give someone who wants to get married to your husband ?"

"communicate a lot before getting married - don't just assume that you are on the same page about things because you are both adults . You need to talk through everything before making decisions."

"that sounds good. Thanks for telling me all of this ! It was really interesting to hear your story!"

"you're welcome! And if it helps, we did spend a lot of time in Japan together - that's how we met and got to know each other so well ."

"oh, that makes sense. Is there anything else you would like to add ?"

"nope, that's everything!"

"great! Thank you again for talking with me today."

"you're welcome, I had a great time too !"

"I hope your husband agrees !"

"No, I don't think so. And that's okay! I mean, of course, there are certain cultural or religious traditions that many couples choose to include in their weddings for personal reasons, but ultimately it's important to remember that a wedding is just one day out of the rest of your life together. It doesn't define you as a couple or the quality of your marriage."

"I see what you mean . So, Abigail, can I ask about something else? Did your husband and his family have any cultural traditions that they wanted to include in your wedding?"

"Well, my husband is from India, so we had a few Indian elements in our ceremony. For example, we had a priest performing the ceremony instead of a judge or a pastor, and we exchanged traditional Indian sweets called 'mithai' instead of cake."

"That sounds interesting! Did his family have any other cultural traditions that they wanted to include?"

"My husband's family did have some cultural traditions that they wanted to include in our wedding. For example, they had a traditional Indian dance called the 'bharatanatyam' performed during the ceremony. They also had a traditional Indian musical instrument called the 'harmonium' played during the ceremony."

"Wow, that sounds really cool! Did you have any cultural traditions from your side that you wanted to include in the wedding?"

"Yes, I did! My family is originally from Mexico, so we had some Mexican elements in our ceremony. For example, we had a mariachi band playing during the reception and we also served traditional Mexican dishes like tacos and enchiladas."

"That's great! It's always interesting to see how different cultures can come together to create a unique and special wedding experience. So Abigail, what do you think was the most important thing that you learned from planning your non-traditional wedding?"

"I learned that it's okay to break with tradition and do things your own way. We didn't have to include all of the traditional elements of a wedding, and we were able to incorporate elements from both our cultures in a unique and personal way."

"That's a great lesson! And Abigail, I'm sure it must have been difficult planning a wedding when you're living in a different country than your family members. Did that make things more challenging?"

"Yes, it was definitely more challenging. We had to plan the entire wedding remotely and coordinate with vendors and family members who were all in different countries. It was definitely a challenge, but we managed to pull it off!"

"That's impressive! And Abigail, I'm sure you must have some advice for couples who are planning their own weddings. Do you have any advice that you would like to share with them?"

"I would say that it's important to remember that your wedding is just one day out of the rest of your life together. Don't get so caught up in the details that you forget about what really matters, which is building a strong foundation for your marriage. And also, don't be afraid to break with tradition and do things your own way if that's what feels right for you."

"That's great advice! Abigail, thank you so much for sharing your story with us today. It's been really interesting to hear about all the different cultural elements you included in your wedding and how you were able to make it special for both of your cultures. Thanks again!"

"Thank you for having me on your show! I had a great time talking about my non-traditional wedding experience."

"You're welcome, Abigail. It was our pleasure to have you here today. Have a wonderful day!"

"You too, thank you so much."

"Bye bye everyone!"
