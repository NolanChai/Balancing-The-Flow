Well, one of them was a surprise party organized by my husband for me. It was held at home and only his family came, so it wasn't too expensive. But we had the other two parties in restaurants to celebrate with friends from school, work and sports clubs . 

### Response:
Oh, that sounds like a lovely way to celebrate! So you didn't have a traditional wedding ceremony? 

nope ! I wanted it to be simple and small . And my husband agreed because he doesn't come from a very traditional family either . He's from Brazil, where they don't really do formal weddings like we do here in Sweden. So for him it was kind of an American thing that I wanted to do . 

### Response:
Interesting! And how did you meet your husband? Was it love at first sight or something else? 

not really ! We met through mutual friends . He came to my birthday party and we started chatting . Then he asked me out for a drink, and I said yes . And that was the start of our relationship . 

### Response:
That's a lovely story! It seems like it worked out well in the end. So what are your plans now? Do you want to have kids? Or do you want to pursue a career? Or both? 

we're thinking about starting a family soon . But we haven't decided yet if we want children or not, because my husband has a condition that affects his fertility . So we're still discussing it and seeing what will be the best option for us in the future. And as for me, I don't have any specific plans for now . I just want to enjoy being married and see where life takes us . 

### Response:
That sounds like a good plan! Enjoying life is important. So what are your hobbies? Do you do anything fun together as a couple, or separately? 

we're both very sporty people , so we spend a lot of time playing sports together . My husband plays tennis and I play badminton and squash . And I also like to read . But the best thing about being married is that you can be yourself without feeling guilty . So we don't have to do anything together - it's enough just to enjoy each other's company. 

### Response:
That sounds great! Enjoying each other's company is key in any relationship. Do you have any advice for couples who might be struggling in their relationships? 

my advice would be to communicate with each other . Don't keep your feelings inside and don't assume that the other person will know what you're thinking - tell them ! It doesn't matter how small or big a problem is - talk about it and find a solution together. And never stop courting each other, no matter how long you've been married . 

### Response:
Excellent advice! That sounds like the perfect way to live a happy life as a couple. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with me today, Abigail ! It was lovely speaking with you and hearing about your marriage journey.

I'd love to hear more from you about your hobbies, interests or anything else you would like to share with the community! Is there a question I can ask that is not covered yet? 

well, since we have talked so much about my marriage I don't know if there's any other questions you might want me to answer. But I'm happy to talk about anything else! So just go ahead and ask whatever comes to mind ! 

### Response:
Great, I will think of a few questions to ask you. And please do not hesitate to share your experiences with the community! We would love to hear more from you! 

thank you so much for this opportunity! This is really fun and I'm happy that I can be here to share my story with people who might enjoy hearing about it . So if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask them here in the chat or on our channel ! 😊

Abigail: Oh, yes ! My dad has never really been happy about my choice of husband . And since we didn't have the traditional ceremony in a church or something like that , it was even harder on him . But now he has learned to accept it . At least , that's what I hope .

my husband and I had a long - distance relationship before getting married, so his family got to know my family over the course of several years . They met one another in person on our honeymoon . 

 was it difficult for you two to get married without your families there ? 

 nope! My husband and I have been together for 15 years by now . We already had a lot of practice at spending time apart . 

 did either of your families not like the way you were getting married (to someone from a different country, or to an atheist)? 

 well , my parents don't actually believe in god, but they still consider themselves catholic and they just couldn't get over that fact that I didn't . But it was OK because neither of us minded too much . 

 how many countries have you lived in now ? 

 five? 

 yes! My husband is German, my family is from Poland, I grew up in Canada, we live in France, and we just went on honeymoon to England . So that's six countries I've lived in . But it wasn't hard . We always speak English at home so it didn't matter . 

 how do you see your family now ? Do they still have an influence on your life or is that pretty much done now that you are married? 

 no, we don't talk to my parents anymore because they stopped paying for our phones when I was 16 and got a job . And even before that , we didn't see them too often anyway . But my husband still sees his parents every two weeks or so . 

 do you have kids? 

 yes! We have one child who is now three years old . She's pretty independent, she speaks four languages . 

 wow that's amazing ! I feel like sometimes when I hear stories like yours it's just incredible to see what people can accomplish. Like if someone tells me they travelled the world and did all these cool things, I would be impressed but maybe wouldn't think much of them . But when I hear about a person who has overcome so many hurdles in their life like you have, it just blows my mind because I don’ t know how someone could possibly do that . 

 what would you say to people listening to this podcast and hearing your story ? 

 if they have any dreams or ambitions of doing something but feel like they can't because maybe the circumstances are too difficult or whatever, I would tell them just go for it. Because if we hadn't gone through all the struggles that we had , we wouldn't be here . 

 how do you think your child will view your life and what she has been able to accomplish ? 

 my daughter will probably see herself as being very independent like me because she has always grown up with three different languages . And I think it has made her more resilient than most kids, because she's used to having to adapt . She can handle change OK , whereas other people have trouble with that . 

 is there something you wish someone had told your younger self ? 

 if I could go back in time and tell my 17 - year - old self anything it would be to enjoy the process and not just think about what's gonna happen next or a long - term goal, but to really experience things as they come . It's really important . 

 what do you mean by that ? 

 I feel like when we are young we have all these goals we want to achieve so we don’ t enjoy the process . So when we finally get there it's just not as cool because we didn't enjoy the journey . And then I also think it's important to realize how lucky you are, no matter where you come from. We take a lot for granted . 

 do you have any other advice ? 

 I would tell people who feel like they can't achieve something because their circumstances aren't ideal that they really should just go for it and enjoy the process and not be too hard on themselves because life isn't always gonna be easy or fair . It's not supposed to be , but you have to deal with it anyway . 

 how do you think you are similar to your daughter ? 

 we are both really independent people . But my daughter is more of an introvert and I am more of an extrovert . And she likes things done a certain way, whereas I can be flexible . We're both very organized but in different ways . She is very good at seeing the big picture and I am good with details . 

 what would you say are some of the most important life skills to learn as a child ? 

 well , it's really important to learn how to manage your money because we can get into debt easily if we don't . And also learning how to deal with stressful situations because that's part of being an adult and something I had to do on my own for the most part . 

 what would you say to your child about the world she lives in right now ? 

 the way things are going in the world is really scary, but the one thing we can control is our attitudes towards life and how we behave . So I always try to tell her that if something doesn't go well , just pick yourself up again and keep trying . Don't dwell on it . 

 do you think being bilingual or trilingual has had any impact on your ability to learn languages ? 

 absolutely! Being bilingual or multilingual in whatever language is really helpful because I feel like it's a muscle that gets stronger when we use it more and so learning new languages was really easy for me . And the thing is with kids who speak multiple languages, they can pick up on grammar rules faster than adults because they are just wired to do it better . 

 how do you think having these skills has benefited your child ? 

 she will probably be more resilient because she has had to adapt to so many things in her short life . She'll have no problem moving to a new country or learning a new language . I hope that the world stays as open and diverse as it is now . I think we should all welcome diversity , not just embrace it but celebrate it . 

 how do you see your child growing up ? 

 she will probably move away from France, even though her father is French . She's definitely more Canadian than anything else, and she doesn't really have a desire to live in any other country like we did . But who knows? ! We'll just wait and see what the future holds for her! 

 what would you say is one of your biggest achievements ? 

 well , I think getting my doctorate was huge for me because I always felt like an outsider at university . People didn't really understand why a girl like me wanted to go into engineering and stuff like that . But it meant so much more than anything else, even though it took a lot of work . 

 what is one thing you wish you could change about the world ? 

 I think we have gotten very lazy as humans because we expect everything to be done for us nowadays . It's not always the case and in order for us to get things done, it means that we have to work harder than we did before and that we can't just take it easy all the time . 

 what would you say is one thing that you are proud of ? 

 I am really happy that my daughter has gotten so many skills from me through the languages she speaks because she'll have an advantage when it comes to finding a job in the future . And also just having so much life experience at her age . She will be able to travel and have adventures like no other person her age, which I think is pretty amazing ! 

 what would you say your proudest achievement has been ? 

 well my daughter's graduation from university was huge for me because it meant she had achieved something that she really wanted . And also a couple of years ago I got a grant to write a book about the work I did as an engineer in the Middle East , and I got published! That was pretty cool too, because I never thought I would be able to do that . 

 what is one thing you wish you could change about yourself ? 

 it's hard to say, but I think my biggest flaw is being a bit too critical of myself . I'm always thinking that maybe I could have done better or been more organized and then I just end up getting stressed out . But I think that is something I am working on because I don't want to let it get in the way of living my life . 

 what would you say your proudest moment has been? 

 one day when we were travelling around India and Bangladesh , we ran into this little girl who was about nine years old . She didn't have any money to go to school, so she had just been begging on the street for a living . But then my daughter went up to her with a notebook and some pens and pencils that she wanted to give away . And I think it meant a lot to us both because we knew how important it was to have an education and to be able to do whatever you want in life , which this girl might not ever get the chance

yes, we went to New Zealand for two weeks after the wedding . We got married in England and then spent the first week of our honeymoon in Paris and Venice, then flew to New Zealand where we had a house with a view over the ocean . It was perfect . 

### Response:
that sounds like it would be fun ! I bet you'll never forget that trip ! Do you still live there ? 

### Response:
we moved back to England three years ago . We didn ’ t want to stay in New Zealand long term because we both wanted our careers to continue to develop and so we knew we would have to leave at some point, but we really enjoyed the time that we did spend there . It was beautiful . 

### Response:
I bet it is ! I hope you'll be able to go back sometime. You must miss New Zealand quite a bit, though ? 

### Response:
yeah, of course I do ! But that’s why we keep in touch with our friends who are still there . It's like having two sets of friends, really . And then I have the benefit of living abroad myself so I can kind of relate to how they feel and what it's like for them . 

### Response:
I bet that is helpful when you talk with your New Zealand friends ! Would you ever move back there if your career were to take a different turn in England ? 

### Response:
we would go back for visits , of course . But my husband has done really well since we've been back here in England and he wouldn’t want to move back there permanently, though his parents still have property there so they visit quite often . I think it was a good decision for us because if we had moved out there long term we might not have as much freedom now . 

### Response:
you're probably right about that ! Is your husband from New Zealand or England ? 

### Response:
he's English, like me . We met when I was working in New Zealand for a year and he came out there on holiday one day . 

### Response:
that's quite a story ! Can you tell me about how the two of you started dating ? 

### Response:
he flew to Wellington (where I was living) one weekend . He stayed in a hotel and we spent the whole Sunday walking around Wellington looking at all the sights . And that's when it clicked for us, so then he came back a few more times and eventually asked me out . 

### Response:
oh that's really cute ! When did you realize your feelings for him were growing into love ? 

### Response:
I think after three months or so of dating we started to see where it was going . We were away together in Fiji for two weeks and when we got back he proposed to me on the beach at sunset . I was like, “Oh my gosh! ” 

### Response:
what a beautiful proposal ! When did you tell your friends and family you were engaged ? 

### Response:
we told them after we got home from Fiji . We told our parents the next day and then we went to London for two weeks and told all our other friends there when we got back . 

### Response:
sounds like a nice way to tell everyone ! Was your husband involved in planning your wedding ? 

### Response:
yes he was really involved . I'm not very interested in flowers or decorations, and my husband is, so it worked out well . He made all the choices for me and planned everything from that side of things, which was nice . But there were other elements too like organizing the music and making sure everyone knew what they needed to do on the day itself . 

### Response:
that's great ! Did you have any bridesmaids ? 

### Response:
yes, I did . I had five bridesmaids in total . Two of them were actually family members so it was nice that they could be involved that way . I also had friends from school and university as well, so that was good too . 

### Response:
you must have quite a large circle ! Do you still keep in touch with any of your bridesmaids ? 

### Response:
I'm still close to one of them . We are both living in London and we get together a lot for drinks or dinner as well, so that's nice too . It's good having friends like that . 

### Response:
that sounds lovely ! And what about your husband's side ? Did any of his siblings or cousins have a big role in the wedding planning ? 

### Response:
he didn't have any family there, so he doesn’ t have any siblings or cousins . But I did invite some friends from university who live in England to come as well. We had about 15 guests in total and they were all very close friends of mine . And we stayed at a beautiful hotel just outside Bath that was owned by two other friends of ours, so it was great . It meant we could have the wedding on my husband's home turf but also be with friends who had helped us out over the years . 

### Response:
that sounds like a great plan ! Are there any traditions you incorporated into your ceremony from either of your cultures ? 

### Response:
the wedding was just legal and nothing else really, so we didn’ t do anything other than say “I do.” It wasn't a religious ceremony . But afterwards my husband wanted to give me away properly , as he had paid for everything , so his parents walked me down the aisle which I thought was lovely of them . 

### Response:
that sounds very sweet ! Did you have any hobbies or activities that you liked doing when you were growing up ? 

### Response:
I loved being in the outdoors, like camping and stuff like that. I also played sport at school - netball and hockey . And my brother and I used to have a lot of imaginary friends too . We had a little house for them with furniture and everything ! 

### Response:
that's so cute ! Have you always liked being outdoors, or was that something you discovered later in life ? 

### Response:
I think it was probably something I discovered later . My parents took us camping every year when we were children and sometimes we would go abroad too, like to France, Austria and Switzerland . 

### Response:
wow ! That's impressive for them to take you as a family on those trips so early in your childhood . Do you think travel was good for you growing up ? 

### Response:
yeah it definitely was . We had such great memories from holidays when we were children . And that's one thing that my husband and I love doing - we went to Japan and South Korea together, which was lovely because he has family there. So travel is still something we enjoy now . 

### Response:
that must be so great ! Do you have any siblings ? 

### Response:
yes I do , three brothers . Two of them are twins actually and they are ten years older than me, then there's my youngest brother who is seven years younger than me . So growing up was fun - we all played together when we were children and I loved being an only child too because my parents gave me lots of attention ! 

### Response:
wow that sounds like a lot of siblings! Do you have any favorite memories from your childhood ? 

### Response:
I have so many favorites . My brothers and I used to make dens in the woods with branches and leaves, or we would have treasure hunts where we would hide things and then try to find them again . And my parents used to take us on a lot of adventures too - when we were teenagers they would buy us an old car and let us go off road driving around in the woods near our house . 

### Response:
that sounds fun ! Do you think it was good for your brothers to have older siblings who were close to their age ? 

### Response:
I think so, yeah . My parents used to take us out on adventures quite often when we were children - like a trip to France and Austria with my younger brother and then another one in Switzerland with all three of us together as well . I remember going up mountains and stuff too . 

### Response:
that sounds amazing ! Did you have any favorite teachers at school ? 

### Response:
I had a really great English teacher when I was in my last year of high school - she was like, 60 or something but she was super hip and used to dress up . She was very friendly with all the students and we would go on trips around Bath to places that were connected to literature . We visited Jane Austen's home for example . And she really made English fun which helped me enjoy it at school, so I got better grades than I might have done if I hadn’ t had her . 

### Response:

it was different from what I expected, but it was a great day ! We just wanted to focus on each other and spend some quality time together after we had been apart for so long . It was wonderful .   

[INST] So when did your wedding actually take place ? 

### Response:
10 years ago.
