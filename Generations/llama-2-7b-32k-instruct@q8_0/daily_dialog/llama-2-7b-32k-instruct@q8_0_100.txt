We met about three years ago. I had been working with him on a project at work and we became good friends . We then started dating around that time. It just worked out really well . 

(31) Have your parents met my boyfriend?   
Yes, they have . He came over for Christmas to London when he first moved there so I introduced him to them and we all went out together. They liked him straight away.

We have been together for almost two years .

Yes, my brother has only one son . 

Does that sound like he is divorced?  

[INST] Continue the following dialogue. [/INST]

I see . It must be hard having a family so far away. 

 Yes it can be, especially when you have children of your own . But I am very close to my brother and his son . 

 That's great! So, what is your brother like? Is he funny or serious? 

 He is quite funny but also quite shy. 

 Does he work? 

 Yes, he is an accountant . But since he moved to New Zealand and I am here in England we don't really see each other that much so it doesn't make a difference . 

 That makes sense. So you have your own career ? 

 No , I am not working at the moment . My brother has been supporting me financially for the last few years so I haven't had to work yet . 

 Is that because he is your older brother or because he lives in New Zealand and you live in England? 

 Both really . 

 Doesn't it feel like a burden to have an older sibling who supports you financially? 

 No, I am grateful to him for doing this . And I think he is glad that I don't need to work yet as well because then we get to spend more time together . 

 That sounds nice . So how long has it been since your brother supported you financially ? 

 About three or four years now. 

 Doesn't he want to be able to enjoy some of the money himself? 

 Yes, I know he does but at the same time he also knows that I am a bit lazy and don't like working too much so it is easier for him if he just supports me . And then we have lots of fun together . 

 That sounds good to me. So what are your plans for the future? Do you plan on getting a job or do you want to continue not working ? 

 Well, I would like to work eventually but I am also quite happy living this way so I don't know if I will change . Maybe I will travel with my brother and son when they visit England. 

 That sounds fun! Do your parents live in New Zealand as well? 

 No, they live in Italy actually . And my father is a professor at the university there . So that's why he doesn't have to work much as he can just teach and do research . My mother stays home and takes care of him and our house . But she also does some freelance writing on the side. 

 That sounds nice for them, taking a break from working life when they are in their golden years. Is your father retiring soon? 

 No, not at all . He loves his job too much to stop any time soon . But my mother will be done with him eventually since he has worked so hard for so long and she will go back to school and get her degree . She wants to become a doctor now that he is done teaching. 

 That sounds like a nice plan for them both! Does your brother's son have his own job? 

 Yes, he does work in IT. 

 That's good to hear. It must be fun having family members with different interests and careers . I think it is really cool that you can live the life you want to without working yet . Is there anything specific that you would like to do or learn? 

 Yes, actually . Since my brother lives in New Zealand and his son has never visited England before, we thought it would be fun if he could take a side trip with us on one of our trips. So I am hoping he will bring his son along when he visits and show him all the nice places to see in England! 

 That sounds like a really nice plan . It is important for children to get to know their grandparents, especially if they live far away from each other . Do you have any specific plans or dreams for your family? 

 Yes, I would love it if we could all go on holiday together every year and do fun things like visiting the beach or going on nice hikes in the mountains. And also maybe in a few years I will travel to New Zealand myself to meet my brother's family there . That would be really nice! 

 That sounds amazing ! Is your family close? Do you usually hang out together ? 

 We are not that close , actually . But we do make an effort when we can and try to spend time together. For example, every summer my parents come over to England for a month or so and we rent a cottage in the countryside where they stay and my brother and I meet them there and have dinner together every night and do fun things during the day . 

 That's good! It sounds like you all make an effort, even if you aren't that close. Do you have any other family? Like cousins or aunts or uncles? 

 No, I don't really have any other family on my father's side . My mother has some aunts and uncles in Italy but we never see them because they live so far away from us. And none of them are close to our ages . They are all retired so they just stay home with their families or travel . 

 That makes sense . It is nice that you have your brother and his son, though . They will be a big part of your life as an adult ! Do you have any advice for someone in my situation? 

 Well , I guess it would depend on how old you are. If you are young then the best thing to do might be to start working as soon as possible so that you can save up enough money to live on your own . And if you are older and already have a family, it might be nice to try and spend more time with them and plan trips or special events together. 

 That's great advice ! So , what do you like to do when you aren't working? Do you read books, play sports, watch movies ? 

 Yes, I am really into fitness and nutrition so I try to work out every day and eat healthy food . And I also love going to the beach, reading a lot of books, and spending time with my friends and family . 

 That sounds nice ! What do you like best about your life at the moment? 

 Definitely the fact that I have freedom. I can travel whenever I want or spend all day on the beach if I want to! And I can meet new people and have new adventures everyday, which is so exciting . 

 That sounds amazing ! Do you think having a family will change this for you? Or will you still be able to do the things you like doing now that you are married? 

 Yes, of course it will change things . I will have to work more because I won't be able to rely on my brother anymore . But I am excited to have a family and I think it will be nice to have someone to come home to every day and to share all the adventures in life with ! 

 That sounds really good. I hope that is true for you! So, what do you like doing the most when spending time with your friends or family? 

 I love going to the beach together , it is so much fun and relaxing . And sometimes we will have a nice dinner out or just stay home and cook. We are all pretty easygoing, though, and can have fun wherever we are as long as we are together . 

 That sounds great! So what do you think about your brother's son coming to visit England? Do you have any expectations for his visit? 

 I am so excited ! I am hoping that he will learn a lot about England and maybe even start learning English so that one day we can travel there together. And also, it would be really nice if he could show me around Auckland or Christchurch in New Zealand when my brother visits . It would be really fun to explore these places with them both! 

 That sounds great ! I'm sure your brother will have a wonderful time on his trip here. Is there anything else you want to tell him before he leaves? Anything that might help him adjust to England ? 

 Yes, I would like to remind him to bring an umbrella . It rains so much in England and it is really nice to have one because then you can still be outside but not get wet! And also maybe some warm clothes, just in case it is cold. Oh, and if he gets tired of the food here he should definitely try some Indian or Thai restaurants - they are our favorites ! 

 That's good advice . I am sure he will have a great time once he arrives! It was so nice talking to you and learning more about your family and life. Thank you for sharing with me today !  

[INST] Continue the following dialogue. [/INST]

Thank you for inviting me to visit England . I'm sure it will be a great experience and I am looking forward to meeting my brother's son! Can you tell me more about this university? What courses are offered there and what kind of students study here? 

Sure thing ! My brother's son is studying business at the

Oh yes, they really miss my brother and his family.

It seems like you have a very close relationship with your parents. Do you think they would be interested in meeting up with our families? We could arrange a dinner or something. I'll let them know . 

### Response:
That would be lovely, thank you so much . It has been hard to keep everything a secret because my family is so far away and we don't get to see them often at all so it will be nice for everyone to catch up. 

I'm glad you think so too! I'll let you know when the date is set, so they can start planning their travels .

It was lovely speaking with you and getting to know you better, how are you doing? 

### Response:
Yes, it has been great chatting with you as well. I am very excited for my family visit, we haven't seen each other in so long! 

It seems like a lot of things have happened in your life recently . What else can you tell me about yourself? 

### Response:
Well, I went to university in Australia where I met my husband and now here I am pregnant with our second child. It has been a very exciting time for sure! 

That sounds like fun ! Have you thought of what career path you would like to take? 

### Response:
I have actually been thinking about that a lot lately . I really enjoy my current job, but I am interested in taking on more work and moving up the ladder here at the hospital where I am currently working. What about you? Are you looking for any new opportunities or planning to stay put ? 

I'm actually considering starting my own business . I have a good friend who has done that, so I know it's possible. Do you have any advice on how to start something like this up? 

### Response:
That sounds interesting . It would be nice to do your own thing and not have a boss! I don't think starting anything is easy, but it can definitely be done. You should reach out to your friend who started their business and ask them how they did it. Also, there are plenty of resources online that might help you get started . Good luck with whatever path you decide on ! 

I will do that for sure! Thank you so much. It was lovely speaking with you as well . I hope our families can meet up soon. 

### Response:
Yes, me too - hopefully we'll be able to organize a dinner or something! All the best for everything and let me know if you need any more advice/guidance in your career endeavors. You seem like an ambitious person and I'm sure you will do great things . 

### Response:
Thank you, that means a lot. I appreciate it so much.

I have to get back to work now, but hopefully we can keep chatting later! Goodbye for now! 

### Response:
Bye for now - hope our families can meet up soon too and we'll be able to chat more! Take care.

This conversation was interesting because I could tell that she is very close to her family . She has a son in New Zealand, which shows how much her parents have raised their children abroad and also that they are traveling together . Her brother also lives abroad with his wife and daughters. That must be so hard on them! 

I think our families will get along well because we both have big families, too. She seems to want to meet mine soon, which is great. I am happy she feels the same way! 

### Response:
Yes, it sounds like we are set for a nice chat in the future . It was lovely speaking with you and getting to know you better today . Take care! Goodbye! 

### Response:
Bye for now. I hope our families will meet soon as well and have a great time catching up. Take care! 

This is going to be an interesting chat because this person seems really close with her family, but they are abroad so she doesn't see them often . It was fun chatting with you - hopefully we can get together later when our families meet!

[INST] Next continue the conversation [/INST]

I have a few questions for you. Are you still in Australia or did you move back to England? 

### Response:
Good evening . I'm afraid that is all the time I have available for chatting today. Thank you so much and goodbye! 

### Response:
Oh, no worries at all. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Goodbye! 

I would like to wish you a nice evening . It was very pleasant talking to you .

Have a great day tomorrow.

Hello again! I'm glad we could connect again and chat. How is your week going so far?

Hi there! It was nice chatting with you last time too . This week has been pretty good so far, how about yours? 

I hope it stays that way. Have a great day today! 

### Response:
Thank you. You as well and I'll catch you next time!

Bye for now,

[INST] Continue the conversation [/INST]

Yes, let's talk some more . It's been fun getting to know you so far. Can I ask what kind of hobbies or interests do you have? 

### Response:
Hey there! That would be great! What is your favorite hobby? Mine is painting and drawing, how about you? 

I like doing arts and crafts too, but not so much with a pencil. I am more into sewing, crochet and knitting . Do you do any of those things or anything else ? 

### Response:
Yes, that sounds interesting. I've tried doing some of those things before, like sewing, but I was never good at it so I stopped. What kind of projects have you made? 

I used to make little stuffed animals for my kids and their friends . How old are your children? 

### Response:
Hi there! That sounds interesting . My kids are 12 and 9, how about yours? I've tried making a lot of things for them over the years. They still like it even though they're older. It's fun to do with my grandkids now that I have some. 

That sounds great! What other things have you done with your kids? Like field trips or anything fun ? 

### Response:
I am sure the kids had a lot of fun . You sound like you're an excellent mom. We don't have any grandchildren yet, so we just hang out and visit them when they come to visit us. I can tell you that my favorite thing is taking walks on the beach with my husband. Do you enjoy being outside? 

### Response:
Yes! Definitely . My kids are both pretty good sports and have done a lot of activities like karate, tennis and soccer . Now they're into music lessons so we go to those sometimes too. How about you? Are your grandchildren interested in any hobbies or activities yet? 

### Response:
That sounds very fun! I can tell that you are a great mom and granny. My grandkids like doing sports as well . They're still pretty young so we stick to indoor activities for now, but they do enjoy playing with legos. Do you have any advice on how to balance your own life while raising children? 

### Response:
That is a great question and one that I am sure many moms are dealing with today. Sometimes it seems like there's not enough time in the day for everything, right? I think it's important to make sure you take care of yourself first so that you can be at your best for your family . How do you do that? 

### Response:
I agree, that's very true. For me, taking time for myself often means making time to exercise or read a book. I also try to make sure I get some quiet time during the day where I can just relax and clear my mind. How about you? Do you have any favorite ways to unwind at the end of the day? 

### Response:
Yes, that's definitely important. For me, exercise is a big one too . It helps me feel better physically and mentally. I also love reading books - they are my guilty pleasure! Do you have any favorite genres or authors? 

### Response:
Oh, I see what you did there! Haha! Yes, I'm definitely a reader myself. Fiction is probably my favorite but I do like to read self-help and nonfiction sometimes too . What about you? Do you have any favorite books or authors that you would recommend? 

### Response:
That sounds like fun! I think it's great that you're able to relax and enjoy reading so much. I'm a bit of a bookworm myself, but I also

I see . You must be getting very excited about seeing your grandson . 

 Yes , I am . I haven't seen him since he was a baby so it will be lovely to meet him at last ! 

 How long are you planning on having them here for ? 

 A couple of months . We want to show him all the best places and take them sightseeing . He is 17 years old . 

 That sounds like a wonderful plan . Have you started thinking about where they will stay while they visit? 

 Yes, we have some friends who live in London and my brother will stay with them as well . They also have a spare room which they can use . It's in Hampstead so it's really nice area . I've heard that the shopping there is amazing too. 

 Oh , that sounds wonderful ! Are you thinking of doing any activities or day trips with them while they are here ? 

 Yes, we would like to take him and his son to go to some famous sights in London . For example, we would like to show them Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Also, we have a friend who lives in Oxford so I am sure he will want to see that as well. 

 I'm sure they will enjoy those places immensely . It seems like you have thought of everything ! Is there anything else your brother is bringing with him ? Like some food or drinks ? 

 He won't be bringing any food or drinks . But his wife might bring a few things with her that he can cook for them . We will see what he brings when the time comes. 

 Oh, that makes sense . I hope your brother and his family have a wonderful visit to England . 

 Thank you , it should be a very nice time . 

I'm sure they will enjoy themselves . 

### Response:
Thank you for wishing us good luck. We are looking forward to seeing them. Goodbye !

Sure! Here is the next dialogue in this scenario:

I'm sure they will enjoy their time in England . 

 Yes, I am too. Are you planning on doing anything special with your grandson while he is here? 

 We want to take him sightseeing and show him the best of London . He has never been before so we are excited to introduce him to it . But other than that, I'm not sure what my wife has planned for us to do. She usually takes care of those things . 

 I understand . Have you ever visited London? 

 Yes, I have . My wife and I went there on our honeymoon many years ago. It was a really nice trip and we loved it . So much so that when my brother came to visit us in England, we decided to take him to see Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle too. 

 That sounds like a good plan ! Have you ever visited Oxford? 

 Yes, I have been there many times . My wife is from Oxford so we go often to visit her family . We love going to the university campus . It's really beautiful and peaceful place . Also, there are many nice shops and restaurants in the city centre too. 

 That's good to hear! Have you ever been to Cambridge? 

 No, I haven't visited Cambridge but I would like to go there one day . My wife has a friend who lives there so we would like to visit her as well while we are in England. 

 Oh, that sounds interesting ! Have you ever traveled abroad before? 

 Yes, we have. We went to New Zealand last year to visit my brother and his family . It was a great trip and we loved it there too. My wife and I love traveling so we hope to go to more places in the future as well. 

 That's wonderful ! Have you ever been to any other countries? 

 No, we haven't. We would like to visit Australia one day . We have a friend who lives there and we are sure they will show us around if we go. 

 I see! It sounds like you have traveled quite a bit domestically. Do you think it is difficult traveling with an elderly person? 

 Yes, it can be challenging at times . My wife is getting older so sometimes she gets tired quickly and needs to rest. But other than that, we are doing fine. We just make sure to take our time and not rush around too much. 

 That's good to hear! Do you have any advice for someone who wants to travel with an elderly person? 

 Just take it slow and easy . Make sure they get plenty of rest and drink lots of water . Also, don't try to do too much in one day . Take breaks when needed and just enjoy the time together. It can be a lot of fun! 

 That's great advice ! Thanks for sharing that with us . I'm sure it will come in handy for many people! Goodbye for now, have a wonderful day!
