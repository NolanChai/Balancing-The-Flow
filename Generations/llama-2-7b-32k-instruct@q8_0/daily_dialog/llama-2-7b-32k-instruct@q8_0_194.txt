"You passed with flying colors!  You drove like a pro!"

"That's not true ! What do you mean ? I barely made it through the test!"

"I think you misunderstood me, honey.  I said you didn't drive well .  But you know what? It was still awesome and I'm so proud of you."

"You really didn't do all that well," the driving instructor responded. 

"To be completely honest, you failed your test," they continued. 

The student was confused and asked how this could have happened when they had spent so much time practicing. 

"I don't know what to say other than I'm really sorry," the driving instructor said. "Maybe we should have another go at it." 

The two got back in the car and tried again, but unfortunately, the student didn't do any better this time around. 

"I don't know what else to say except that you need to practice more," the driving instructor said as they pulled up to a stop sign. 

"Practice more?" The student repeated, puzzled. "But I thought I was doing great!" 

The driving instructor sighed and shook their head. "I don't know what else to tell you," they said. "I guess we'll just have to try again another day." 

As the two drove away, the student was still confused and frustrated by their failure. They had put in so much effort and thought they were doing well, but it seemed that the instructor didn't agree. 

"I don't understand," the student said to themselves. "How can I be failing when I'm doing everything right?"

You failed your driving test. You didn't perform well enough in various areas, including signaling properly, observing traffic laws, and demonstrating safe driving techniques. It's important to note that this is not a reflection on your character or abilities, but rather an assessment of your driving skills at the time of the test. However, you can retake the test and improve your performance.

So how did I do on my driving test ? 
Do you want the truth? 
Of course, I do. 
Well, you really didn't do all that well. 
How bad did I do? 
To be completely honest, you failed your test. 
How? 
There were a number of reasons. 
What were they? 
Basically, you just can't drive. Can I have another try?
