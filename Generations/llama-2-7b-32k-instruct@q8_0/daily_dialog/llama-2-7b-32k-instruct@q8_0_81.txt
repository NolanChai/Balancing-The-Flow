We do have someone employed here who does it but they are leaving at Christmas so we will be advertising in newspapers and on line to fill their position . 

 Is there any part of your business that might require specialised training or education? 

### Response:
I think the IT would suit a person with an interest in computing as our systems are very advanced . The same for HR , as we need someone to manage the team of casual workers who work here at Christmas and we have to deal with complex problems from time to time . 

 How many hours do you work on average per week? Do your staff work regular shifts or is it ad-hoc? 

### Response:
We all work long hours . The owners of the company are here all the time and I am on site for most of the day too but we all have to be flexible as there may be last minute orders that need to go out . In general I would say we average about 45 - 60 hours per week but this can increase at times . The casual workers work more irregularly than us permanent staff members and we need them when demand is high so it varies greatly for them . 

How long have you worked with the owners of the company? 

### Response:
I have been here for about 15 years . I started as a temp who was made a permanent employee in my second week of work and I was delighted to get it . The owners are lovely people but hard workers ! It is great to work for them because they want everyone to do well including themselves so that means they put in the effort too . 

What were you doing before you joined this company? 

### Response:
I was working at a local grocery store as a check out operator and I was looking for something more challenging . A friend of mine worked here but left when he started his own business so I applied for the job to replace him . He is still close by though, only about 10 minutes drive away so if anyone needs anything from us they can call him up ! 

How do you keep up-to-date with changes in technology? 

### Response:
We all have to be up - to - date as we use a lot of computers and mobile phones and we need them to be able to communicate . We also have an annual training session where the owners bring in external trainers who show us how to operate new systems or software and update our skills generally . 

What do you like best about your job? 

### Response:
I like being busy as it suits my personality but I also enjoy dealing with customers , seeing a delivery leave the depot on time is good too ! It has been particularly lovely to deal with our regular customers who are loyal to us and know when they ring up that they will be well looked after . 

How did you find out about this company? 

### Response:
I applied for a job here as I was looking for something more challenging than the grocery store . When I rang up to apply for it the woman who answered told me how long she had been working here and said they were always happy to take on new staff if people showed an interest in what they do . 

How much does a delivery driver earn at this company? Is that negotiable? 

### Response:
We pay by the hour and we offer overtime when required but I think the rate varies with experience so it is hard to say exactly how much someone would be paid as it depends on their hours worked . Our regular staff are guaranteed a minimum number of hours per week so that they can plan their lives around it if they need to . We also pay for uniforms and provide some training which is nice too ! 

 What are your plans for the future? Do you see yourself staying in this company long-term or do you have any other ambitions? 

### Response:
I am not sure what will happen but I would like to continue here as long as the company needs me . I want to be useful and help out where I can . My hours are very flexible so it is easy for me to look after my kids and work around their schooling too which suits me fine . 

How do you think your job will change in the future? Do you expect a lot of new technology? 

### Response:
I do not know what to expect but I am sure there will be changes . There are already so many things that we use computers and mobile phones for and it is great how they help us run our business more efficiently . We also have to compete with other companies who have newer technology than us so we need to keep up ! 

Is there anything else you would like to tell me about the company? 

### Response:
I think I have told you all you want to know but it is a good job if you are hardworking and willing to work . We have an annual staff meeting where we discuss things so everyone has their say and gets to know what everyone else does which is great . I am looking forward to Christmas as well because I get to see my friends who I only see at Christmas as they work for other companies in this area too ! 

I hope you will consider applying for the job if you are interested but please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns . Good luck with whatever you decide to do and thank you for your time !

[INST] Now imagine I am doing an interview with an employer and I'm trying to get some information about the company. Can we use the conversation above as the script? [/INST]

Sure, here's an example of how you could use the conversation from before in an interview:

Interviewer: Hi there, thanks for meeting with me today. Could you start by telling me a bit about your company and what it does?
