"I'd love to! Let me know what time works for you. Also, do you have any suggestions for a good movie? I haven't been able to find anything that's caught my eye."

Sure, here is the next turn:

"Kara, are you sure that's what you want? I can understand if you have plans with someone else or need to focus on other things, but I would still like to see you again soon."

"Mike , thank you for understanding . It was great meeting you and I hope we can do it again some day . Have a nice night ! "

And here is the next turn:

"Kara, it's okay. I understand where you're coming from. Maybe we can keep in touch and see if we feel like hanging out again in the future."

"Mike , yes that would be great . Would it be okay if we exchange numbers ? "

"Absolutely! My number is [insert number]. I hope to hear from you soon!"

And here's the last turn:

"Kara, thank you for sharing your number. I will definitely keep in touch and see where things go . Good night!"
