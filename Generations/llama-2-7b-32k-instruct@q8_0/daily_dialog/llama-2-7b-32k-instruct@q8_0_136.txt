Okay, let's get started with our last activity before recess. Everyone, take out your math journals and get ready to solve the problem I am going to put on the board.

Great job, everyone! We finished the last problem just in time for recess! Now it's time to go outside and play. Remember to use your best behavior at all times during recess. We don't want anyone getting into trouble, do we?

I hope you had a great time playing on the playground. It's almost snack time. Let's get ready for our last activity before lunch. Everyone, take out your reading journals and get ready to read the book I am going to put on the board.
