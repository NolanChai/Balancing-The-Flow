"Wow, that sounds like a fantastic time! I bet you had trouble sleeping since you were so tired."

"You know it. They put me up in a nice hotel too. But after 6 days of eating and drinking, my stomach was so full I didn't feel like anything much. Besides, we were there for work, so we didn't really have time to relax or sightsee."

"That makes sense. It's too bad you couldn't enjoy it more but at least you got your work done and are back home safe and sound."
