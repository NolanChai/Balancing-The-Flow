"But," you say, "you guys just went out for coffee, that's it. You can't read too much into that."
"Oh, but I can!" your friend says.
"You're acting like he's some kind of precious gem or something. He's a human being and he can do whatever he wants! If he doesn't want to talk to you anymore, then so be it!"
Your friend starts listing off all the things that have happened between them: "We went on a fun date together, we talked for hours, I felt like we had a deep connection... but now? Nothing. I don't even know if he wants me around as friends."
"Well," you say, trying to be sympathetic, "he did invite you out, which is nice. But it's not like you guys were officially dating or anything."
Your friend starts getting angry: "Oh really? And what was I supposed to think? That he was just being nice and polite?"
"Look," you say, trying to calm the situation down a bit, "I'm sure everything will be fine. Why don't we focus on something more important? Like maybe how your cat is doing."
Your friend sighs: "You're right. I guess I just need to give him some space and see where things go from here."
"That's the spirit," you say, trying to sound supportive.
But inside, you're thinking: What an idiot. This is all way overblown. And what about me? I had fun on that date! Why doesn't anyone care about me??

"... so, I said let’s take a break. And since that night, I’ve been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him. You don’t think he’s seeing someone else, do you?" 

"Come on, don’t be so dramatic! I’m sure everything is going to work out just fine."

"You think so? Oh no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?" 

"But, you two are on a break. Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes."

"He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up." 

"Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It’s going to be alright."

"But I...I still love him! And it’s all my fault! I can’t believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter; it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I've totally messed this up!"

Veronica: So, I said let's take a break. And since that night, I haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

Friend: Come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm sure everything will work out just fine.

Veronica: You think so? Oh no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?

Friend: But you two are on a break. Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

Veronica: He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.

Friend: Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It's going to be alright.

Veronica: But I ... I still love him! And it's all my fault! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter; it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I've totally messed this up!

Friend: You know what? I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you...

Veronica: No, this is not going to happen! I ... I've ruined everything!
