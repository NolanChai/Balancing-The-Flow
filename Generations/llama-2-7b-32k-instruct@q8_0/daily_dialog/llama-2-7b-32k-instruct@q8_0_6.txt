"Let's play chess . "

" I haven't played chess for a long time . "

" That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . "

" Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . "

" You're a very good player

The men finish their game, and you see the chessboard. One of them is taking off his coat to reveal that he has a number of medals pinned to it. He brags about winning first place in a competition, and then announces that his prize was for beginners. The other man responds by saying that he also won a prize last week, but he won't tell you where they were given out.

"I bet I could beat them both at chess."

"Yeah? Let's see it . "

"No way . They're good players . But if you want to have a quick game, we can play a few rounds while the others are still playing."

"Sure," says one of the men, and you start to set up the chess pieces. The other man watches for a moment before starting to play. You notice that he's not looking at the board as he makes his moves; instead, he looks down at the table. He's whispering to himself, over and over again. It's weird.

"I wonder what he's thinking about," you say. The man just smiles and continues to play. You look over at him every once in a while but can't catch his eyes. Finally, the game is over, and one of you has won. "Well done!" the other man says, standing up and taking off his coat to reveal that he now has two medals pinned to it. One of them has an engraved name on it: "Marcus."

"That was a good game," Marcus says, putting his coat back on. He looks at you for a moment before turning away and heading back over to the other men. You shake your head and look down at your chess pieces. There's something off about him... but what? You can't put your finger on it.

You put all of the chess pieces back in their box and tuck them underneath the table. You sit down next to Marcus, who is now sitting on a bench with his back against the wall. "What do you do for a living?" he asks.

"I'm unemployed at the moment," you say.

"Oh... I see..." He doesn't seem impressed. He looks like he wants to ask something else, but then he turns away and starts talking with one of the other men again. You take a deep breath and let it out slowly. There was something odd about him--but what? What did you miss?

You look back down at your chess pieces. Maybe there's another game to be had here...
