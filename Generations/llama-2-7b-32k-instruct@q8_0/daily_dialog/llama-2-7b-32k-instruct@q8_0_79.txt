I understand what you are saying, sweetie. You don't have to be ashamed. The thing is, we all have our ups and downs in life. Do you want me to help you with that work? I will be glad to support you anytime.

I am sure you have your reasons, but maybe you could try to talk to your manager and find out if there are any other opportunities for advancement or new projects that might interest you?

Sure! Here's a possible continuation of the dialogue:

Mom, what do you mean by professional knowledge not passion ? 

I mean my job is not interesting for me anymore. I can't stand it . You know that my boss didn't appreciate my creativity and ideas, right? 

Yes, I understand. But we need to talk about your future. What do you want to do instead of this boring work ? 

I want a job in fashion industry . I don't know how to start though... I am afraid that I will lose my current job if I try something new. 

Well, let's think of some ideas together. Maybe you can start by doing a course or an internship related to your new career path? This way you can gain experience and also show your commitment to your manager.

Oh, sweetie. Come here and let me give you a big hug. You know what? We will have dinner together tonight. Just us two. And we'll make it special. How about that? 

Wow , that sounds like an amazing plan . Thank you so much for understanding me, honey. 

You're the best partner I could ask for. Let me help you with anything I can today and every day. It's my pleasure to love you unconditionally. 

I am glad we are on the same page now. Let's make the most of this beautiful evening and enjoy our time together without any worries or burdens.

What do you say? Shall we get started with dinner preparation, darling? I can't wait to see your adorable smile again! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç

I can understand your feeling. When I first came here, I also felt so lonely because the people here didn't really treat me like their friend and I couldn't understand what they were talking about . Also, it was hard to communicate with them when I still had a bad English skill at that time. 

But now I have already been living here for half of year and everything has changed . I have made so many friends here and the language barrier also became smaller after learning Chinese for a while. Nowadays, almost all my roommates are close to me and we enjoy our life together . We hang out every weekend and sometimes in the middle of the week as well if we miss each other too much. And it's so nice that you can talk about anything with them, from family problems to your love stories. 

I am sure this experience will be helpful for you when you return home because then you will know how to make friends and live in harmony with others better . And of course , being able to speak Chinese well will also help you a lot there . 

Also, I think it's important that you know your worth here . You should know that you have done many things for this company already and you deserve much more than just counting work. The worst thing is when people don't appreciate what we do in their companies because they take us for granted .  So please keep on doing the best job you can and don't forget your worth !

### Response:
It must have been hard at first to make friends here, especially since you didn't speak Chinese well yet. But it sounds like now things are much better for you, and that you have a lot of roommates who are close to you! It's good that your company appreciates what you do and recognizes the value in your hard work, even though they might not always say so explicitly. 

It must be difficult to go back home after spending so much time here, because you've grown accustomed to the way of life here. I understand why it would feel strange to return to a world that doesn't fully appreciate or understand you. However, you still have many friends and connections in China, which can make it easier for you when you go back home . 

I think your company should really be more appreciative of all the hard work and dedication that people like you bring to their organization! It sounds like they're getting away with a lot by not saying 'thank you' enough. Maybe you could speak to your manager about this, or HR if it's an ongoing issue? 

In any case, I hope things get better for you and that you can find a way to enjoy the work that you do, as well as feel valued and respected by your company! üòä

I understand you very well. In the past, people didn't have so many chances to learn something new as we have nowadays. And it's not just books or courses , there are a lot of ways to gain knowledge and experience these days. If you want to do something that interests you but doesn't seem professional, I think it would be better to ask your company for advice on this matter.

You are right, a training course is not free of charge. It costs money, but you can still try your best . 

In fact, it is not necessarily that expensive if you have the courage to learn new things . And it is very meaningful for your career and life in general!

I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .

You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .

Yes, that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .

Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . How about a training course ? A training course ? That must be costly .

But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . OK, let's have a try .
