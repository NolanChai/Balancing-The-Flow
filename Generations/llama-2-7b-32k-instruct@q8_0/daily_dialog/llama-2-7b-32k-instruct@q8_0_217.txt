"I bet you've never had to train that hard, have you ?"

"It's not a competition."

"You just said it wasn't a competition. It's also not a challenge, so what is it, exactly?"

"It's nothing."

"I think it might be something . Or maybe it's everything. Maybe it's your whole life."

"That's a bit dramatic."

"Maybe it's your whole world . The way you see it, anyway."

"I don't know what you mean."

"You said that dreaming about jumping hurdles is better than training for the decathlon . Maybe the reason you say that is because the decathlon is a lot like life. It's full of obstacles and challenges, but if we train hard enough, we can overcome them."

"I don't know if I agree with that."

"Maybe it's not just about training for the decathlon . Maybe it's about having a goal in mind and working towards it. Like you said, jumping hurdles is something you do because you want to be able to do it . It's not just about getting over them - it's about feeling like you can achieve anything."

"I see what you mean."

"But that's not the only way to look at things, right ? Maybe life isn't always a race or a challenge. Maybe it's more of an obstacle course . We face obstacles, and we either find ways to overcome them, or we get knocked down by them."

"That doesn't sound so great."

"But think about how strong you would be if you had to keep getting back up after every setback. How much stronger you would become."

"I suppose that's true."

"Maybe the decathlon is a metaphor for life, and the obstacle course is just life itself . We all face challenges, and we have to figure out how to overcome them. Sometimes it's hard, but if we keep pushing forward, we can do it."

"You make a good point."

"I think you're right - maybe sometimes it's not about winning or losing, but about learning and growing . And that's something that no one can take away from us."
