"I'm sorry, I don't think that sounds like something I would be interested in."

Hi Joe, how are you doing today? 

" Things are going good today . How have you been doing, Mary? "

"Things are going well for me, Joe."

"Want to go see a movie tonight?"

"My parents are taking me to dinner tonight. Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night instead?"

"What movie did you want to see?" 

Mary: I'm sorry but I have plans this evening, maybe another time?

Sure, here's another turn in the dialogue:

"The Secret Life of Bees" sounds great! Let's go. What time does the movie start?

"The Secret Life of Bees" is rated PG-13 for some violence and mature themes. The movie starts at 7pm. Do you want to meet me here or would you prefer I pick you up?

"Meet you here."

"Great!"
