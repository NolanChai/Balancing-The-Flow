Things are going good for me too, but I'm feeling a little stressed out. What about you, Mary?

How does your day look like, and what have you been up to recently?  

(A)I am glad that you're doing well . 

It seems that we are having the same stress levels today . 

My job has been really demanding lately , so I'm looking for a way out .   

(B)Yes, it's tough when your work gets in the way of things you enjoy .  

I have some plans to take a vacation soon with my family and I am excited about that . 

We have been talking about taking a road trip for our anniversary .   

(C)Oh yes, a relaxing road trip sounds nice. That must be hard to manage work-life balance! It's the same for me too. Sometimes it feels like there are not enough hours in a day to do all that I need to accomplish . How has your week been, Joe?

Let's talk about our days and see what we have done recently 

Things have been pretty chill around here .  

I finally took some time off this past weekend to go hiking and spend time with family.   

(D)That sounds like a lot of fun, I need to take some time off too but my job is so demanding right now 

It's not easy, especially as a woman in this industry .  

Have you seen any good movies lately? Or maybe read a book that you enjoyed ?   

(E)Yes.  I have been watching the latest season of House of the Dragon and it is amazing . 

I also just finished reading a great novel by an author named Jodi Picoult . Have you heard of her?  

(F)No, actually not. But I will definitely check them out!  

(G)Great! I hope that you'll enjoy it and will have some nice new recommendations for me! 

I am sure that there are many great books and movies that I haven't heard of yet . 

So, what do you say, Mary? Let's share our recommendations with each other and maybe we can discover a new favorite together!   

(H)Sure, sounds good to me. I am always looking for new things to watch or read. It will be nice to have someone to discuss it all with, because my husband isn't that interested in the same kind of stuff as I am .   

(I)Oh yes, that's so common! My husband is more into sports and video games than me, too. Maybe we can find something for both of us? Or maybe you have some recommendations for your husband? 

It will be nice to share our interests with someone who has similar tastes .  

(J)Yes, definitely! It's always fun to connect over things that we enjoy and have in common. I'm sure that if we keep the conversation going, we can come up with some great ideas for each other . 

So, what do you say, Mary? Are you up for it?

Hi, it's great that things are going good. It seems like you have something fun planned!

I don't think I can make it tonight since my family is going out to dinner. But how about tomorrow? What time works best for you? 

Mary , what do you say ? Let's go see a movie tomorrow night . We've both been looking forward to it ! 

Tomorrow sounds perfect! I just have to check with my parents and confirm the time.  

Response:
That's great, Mary. I look forward to seeing the movie with you tomorrow! I will see you then.

I'm doing well. 

 I was thinking about seeing "Spectre" this weekend . Would that work for you ? 

 That sounds great! Could we meet before the movie? 

 I would like to have dinner beforehand if possible. 

 We could, as long as you're willing to pay. 

 How about an Italian place nearby? 

### Response:

Sure, that sounds good to me! Let's go for it! 

 Do you want to meet at my apartment first, or should I come over there ? 

 Should we just meet in the parking lot of the theatre? 

 OK, great! See you then!

Sorry, Mary. But I'm already going out tomorrow night with my friends. We have a reservation at a fancy restaurant downtown. We will be there for dinner and then the rest of the evening is up in the air. I don't know what we are doing after that yet. If you want to come along, just let me know and I will send you an invite so that you can join us .
