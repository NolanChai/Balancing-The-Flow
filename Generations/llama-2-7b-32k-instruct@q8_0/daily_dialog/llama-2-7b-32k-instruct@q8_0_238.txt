"I will make sure that I use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that won't dry out your hair too much."

"Great, thank you!"

"Would you like to add some highlights or lowlights to your hair as well ?"

"That would be great. My friend told me that would make it look more natural . "

"I have a few ideas for highlights that I think will suit your hair type and color . Would you like to see some options before we go ahead with them?"

"Definitely! I want it to look as natural as possible."

"I understand. Let's start by saying that the goal is to keep the highlights blended in with the rest of your hair so they don't look too obvious or fake . Would you like to have a few balayage highlights, where the highlights are painted on in a more natural way that looks like sun-kissed skin?"

"That sounds good. Can you show me an example of what that would look like ?"

"Of course! Here's a picture of a client I recently worked with who had balayage highlights . As you can see, they blend in quite naturally and give the appearance of sun-kissed hair."

"That looks great. Is there anything else we can do to make my hair look more natural ?"

"Yes, we can definitely add some texture to your hair to enhance the natural curls. Can I touch your hair a bit to see how it feels and which direction your curls are naturally growing?"

"Sure, that would be great."

"Great! Your hair has a nice bounce to it already, but we can definitely add some more definition to it . Let's do a slight twist on the classic "beachy waves", where instead of using a large curling iron, I'll use a round brush and blow dry your hair to create a more natural looking wave pattern. Would you like me to show you how I can do that?"

"Absolutely! That sounds perfect."

I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . "

 Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?

 Sure, I'll do my best to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in terms of style? Do you have any specific preferences for length, thickness, or texture? Additionally, do you have any concerns or restrictions (like allergies) that might affect the haircare products we use during your appointment?
