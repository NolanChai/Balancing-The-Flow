" And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes !"

" Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! "

"Oh, so you want my opinion on these awful gifts ?"

"Yeah, because obviously they're terrible and nobody wants them."

"Well, let me just say that I think this one might be a little too flashy for some people ."

"No way ! This is the perfect gift. Everyone will love it!"

"Really ? Because it looks really bright and showy to me . Like maybe it's trying too hard."

"No, no, no. You don't understand. It's a hug - it's supposed to be warm and comforting. And plus, who doesn't love a cute stuffed animal?"

"I'm listening, but I have to admit that I don't understand why you're so excited about any of these clothes. They're all pretty ugly, if you ask me."

"Ugly?! How dare you?!"

"Look, I like nice things too, but this stuff is just... not good. It's like you bought it from the clearance aisle at Walmart."

"Oh, that's rich coming from someone who wears the same three graphic tees every week."

"I wear those because they're comfortable and I don't care about what people think of me. You, on the other hand, seem to be obsessed with looking good in front of others at your own expense. It's sad, really."

"Sad?! That's rich coming from someone who can't even tell a good sweater when they see one!"

"A good sweater? This is an abomination! It looks like something you'd find at the dollar store on clearance after Christmas."

"Well, it was only $10, so I guess that makes up for its lack of quality. Now let me get back to watching my game and you can get back to being a miserable old man who hates everything about this world except his own cynical opinions."

"Oh, so now you're calling me old?! Well, I'm not the one who's been wearing the same three graphic tees for the past ten years!"

"And I'm not the one who cares more about a stupid game than they do about their own life."

"Oh, so now you're judging my priorities?! Well, I guess that makes up for your lack of fashion sense and your inability to have an interesting conversation with me!"

"Interesting?! This is the most boring conversation I've ever had. I can't believe I have to listen to you yap on about this game and your stupid clothes all afternoon."

"Oh, so now you're blaming me for your own lack of social skills and inability to engage with people?! Well, that's rich!"

"Rich?! That's rich coming from someone who can't even tell a good sweater when they see one!"
