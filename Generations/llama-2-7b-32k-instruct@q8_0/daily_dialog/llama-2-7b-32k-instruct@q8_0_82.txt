"I'm glad to see you too! Can we go over the contract terms before I sign?"

"Of course, that would be great. When you become a permanent employee, you will have access to company insurance, and you will receive monthly payments. Your work hours will be eight hours per day on a rotating shift."

"Great! Can I ask about the internship? How long is it for?"

"It's for three months, and you can sign up for either the morning or afternoon shift. You'll have the opportunity to work with some of our best employees and learn from them. We want to make sure that everyone who works here is skilled in their job."

"That sounds good to me! Do I need any special training before starting?"

"Not really. Of course, we will provide all necessary training for your position. But you should be able to handle it with no problem."

"I see. That's great news. Anything else I should know about the internship or permanent employment?"

"Just that it's a great opportunity and that we're glad to have you join us! Let me sign these papers so that everything is official."

"Yes, you'll get all of that. Now let me explain the company's rules to you."

"What are the company's rules?"

"First, you must always be on time for work. Second, you must always dress professionally. Third, you must always follow orders from your superiors. Fourth, you must never steal or lie. Fifth, you must always treat customers with respect and dignity."

"I understand . Do I have to read a manual?"

"Yes, you do. Here it is."

"Jack, I'm glad to see you! Could you sit down? Before signing the contract, let me go through some details with you. You have a three-month internship, and when you become a permanent employee, you'll get insurances, a monthly pay, an eight-hour/day work shift, five insurances, one fund, legal holidays, and year-end bonus. If you need to work overtime, you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay."

"It sounds great!"

"If that's all clear, I can have you sign the contract now. Do you have any questions or concerns before signing?"

Sure! Here's a possible continuation of the dialogue:

"Jack: Well, that sounds great. But I still have some concerns about the working conditions and the long hours.
John: I understand your concern, Jack. We do have high standards for our employees and we expect a lot from them. However, we also provide excellent benefits and opportunities for growth.

"Jack: But what if I don't like it? What if I want to leave early or take some time off?
John: That's understandable too. We have a three-month probation period, during which you can decide whether this is the right job for you. If you decide to leave, we will honor your request and provide you with a fair severance package.

"Jack: Okay, I think I'm ready to sign the contract now. Can you give me a copy of it to review before we finalize everything?
John: Of course! I'll send it over to you via email in just a moment. And congratulations on your decision, Jack! We're excited to have you join our team."
