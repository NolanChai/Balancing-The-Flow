It's on sale for $900, and it's still under warranty for another year.  

(To summarize the above dialogue, "How much are you selling it for?" is a question that was asked by a person interested in buying the television.)

I am not sure if I would be comfortable with that price. The television was only recently purchased and has been used sparingly at best. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer? I will give you my lowest offer right now, how does $2,300 sound to you?

What type of TV do you prefer? 

I prefer the LED TV. I have an old one that stopped working, and it was a great TV but it is only 1080p, so I want something better, like the OLED model you mentioned earlier . 

No, sorry, I can't accept any less than $2500 for this TV. It has been gently used by me since day one and still works great! I think its price is more than fair considering what you are getting in return. Please let me know if you have any other questions! 

I understand, but that's just too expensive of a price range. What is your budget for this television? Maybe we can find something in that price range that would be suitable for you .  

[INST] How about $2250 ? [/INST]

I am really interested in buying this television . 

 That's so great ! 

 How much are you selling it for ? 

 This t . v is only $ 2500 . 

 You can't be serious . 

 That's how much this t . v costs . 

 That's too expensive for me . 

### Response:
That sounds great! I can definitely work with you at that price. Would it be okay if we meet up at your home to look at the TV? I need to make sure it is still in good condition and works well before purchasing. Let's schedule a time for me to come over when it works best for you. 

Sure, that would be great! I have an open house tonight from 6pm-8pm, do you think that works? Or any other time this weekend work better for you? 

That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for your help and patience. I'll see you at my place tonight at 7pm. If anything changes, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day! 

No problem, have a good one!

### Dialogue:

I'm glad we could come up with a price that works for both of us. I hope you enjoy the TV and that it brings you many years of viewing pleasure. If there is anything else you need, feel free to reach out. Thanks for being such a great seller! 

Sure thing! It was my pleasure doing business with you too. I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors. Take care and have an amazing day! 

Bye!

Try to make your responses more creative and natural-sounding, by adding personalities or interests that reflect how real people communicate with each other. Keep in mind that you don't need to use a specific name for your character; instead, create a new character every time you want to ask them something new.

If you run out of ideas, just repeat the previous conversation prompts. Your last dialogue should be at least 5 sentences long and continue the narrative from where it was left off.   

[INST] what brand is it? [/INST]

I am really interested in buying this television . 

 That's so great ! 

 How much are you selling it for ? 

 This t . v is only $ 2500 . 

 You can't be serious . 

 That's how much this t . v costs . 

 That's too expensive for me . 

### Response:
Yes, I am selling a Sony TV. It has been well-cared for and is still in excellent condition. Have you ever owned a Sony product before? They have a great reputation for reliability and picture quality! 

No, I haven't owned one yet, but I really want to buy one since it's my first time buying an OLED TV. That's why I was looking for a second-hand unit. So the price would be more affordable compared to purchasing a brand new one. 

That makes sense! The only drawback with pre-owned products is that there is no warranty, but if you take good care of it and have some luck, it could last just as long as a brand new one. Let's talk price. I am open to negotiations, but I can't go lower than $2500. It's still a steal for such a great TV! 

I understand. But that's too high for me, considering the fact that it has been used by someone else before and even if you assure me that it works well, I don't know how to test it myself without taking it apart or something. How about $2450 ? [/INST]

### Response:
I understand where you're coming from. I'll tell you what, if we meet up and you test the TV yourself to make sure it works well before purchasing, I'll drop the price to $2450. That way, you can rest assured that everything is in working condition and you won't have any issues with it. Would that be okay? 

Great! Meeting up at your place tomorrow at 7pm works for me. Please let me know if anything changes or if you have any other questions before then. I'll see you soon! 

Sounds good to me. Have a great day and thank you again for the opportunity!

[INST] do you have any proof that its not stolen? [/INST]

### Response:
Yes, I do have proof that it isn't stolen. The seller has all the necessary paperwork to prove that he purchased the TV from a legitimate retailer and has always taken care of it. If you would like, we can provide you with copies of these documents for your peace of mind. 

I understand your concerns about purchasing a used item, but rest assured, I have thoroughly checked over all the features on the TV and ensured that everything works as intended. It's just a matter of testing it out to see if you like it! Would you be willing to meet up tomorrow at 7pm at my place? 

Great! I can assure you, this is not a stolen television. I purchased it new from a reputable retailer and have cared for it since day one. If that's alright with you, please let me know and we can move forward with the sale. 

### Dialogue:

Awesome! Thank you so much for your help in this process. I'll see you tomorrow at 7pm to test out the TV. Have a good one! 

Bye!
