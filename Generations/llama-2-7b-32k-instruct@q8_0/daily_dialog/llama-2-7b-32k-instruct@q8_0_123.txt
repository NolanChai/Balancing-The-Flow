That's so great !

"You can't be serious ."

I am really interested in buying this television .

"That's so great !"

"How much are you selling it for ?"

"This t . v is only $ 2500 ."

"You can't be serious ."

"That's how much this t . v costs."

"That's too expensive for me ."

"I am really interested in buying this television ."

" Great! This TV has been priced to sell fast. It's a great deal at $2500, but I understand if you don't want to pay that much."

" That's too expensive for me . "

"This television is of very high quality . You can't go down on the price."

" That's how much this t . v costs . "

"I can see why it would be too expensive for you. I have other options if you're looking for something else?"

" No, I really like this television. It seems to fit my needs perfectly."

" Wonderful! Would you consider a lower price point? I'm willing to negotiate, but the lowest I can go is $2300."

" That's still too expensive for me . "

"I understand. Unfortunately, I can't accept any less than my asking price. This television is in excellent condition and well worth the cost. Would you be willing to come up a bit? Say, $2400?"

" No, that would put it out of my budget . "

"I completely understand. Unfortunately, I can't sell this TV for anything less than what I'm asking. Are there any other items in my store that you might be interested in purchasing? Maybe a Blu-ray player or a soundbar to go with your new TV?"

" No thank you . "

"I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can do for you today? Would you like to place an order over the phone, or would you prefer to come in and see me in person?"

" I will call back later . "

"Sure thing! Have a great day, and thanks for considering my store!"

"I am really interested in buying this television . "

" That's so great ! "

" How much are you selling it for ? "

" This t . v is only $ 2500 . "

" You can't be serious . "

" That's how much this t . v costs . "

" That's too expensive for me . "

" This television is of very high quality . "

" You can't go down on the price . "

" By how much ? "

" I'll buy it for $ 2000 .

A:  "Sorry, but that's not a realistic offer. The television is worth more than $2000, and I'm willing to negotiate on the price. How about we meet in the middle? Could you do me a solid by coming down to $2350?"
