Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

"I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week ."

"Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?"

"I think I forgot to send it in !"

"You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid."

"Can I send it in now ?"

"Sure, that would be great! Just make sure to put a note on the form indicating that it's for the previous period. That way, we can process your claim as quickly as possible."

"Thanks for your help!"

"No problem! We want to make sure you get paid on time. Have a nice day!"

"Can I send it in now ?"

"You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn’t been , we will still accept it ."

"Can I mail it in early next time so it isn’t late ?"

"Actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date ."

"Will my paycheck come right away now ?"
