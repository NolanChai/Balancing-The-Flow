That sounds good. I'd be happy to come by your party.

I 'll send the address later if that is okay with you ?

Yes , it is fine with me and when shall I pick you up ?  

(To summarize this dialogue : Alice and Bob will meet on Sunday to go to a small party for birthday celebration.)

I can't make it, because I have rehearsals for the play I am acting in. But congratulations on your upcoming birthday party!  

(Assuming that Alice is a human and has plans on Sunday)

### Response:
I think I am going to have a small party on Sunday as well, and invite people who will not get enough attention elsewhere . 

 Oh, that sounds fun! Maybe we can combine the two parties? It would be great to meet more interesting people. 

 That's a good idea! But make sure you bring some food with you , just in case there is not much on site. 

 I will definitely do that . Thank you for your help, Alice, have a great party and happy birthday!

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Could you please provide me with some additional details about the upcoming party?

It sounds like Alice is having a birthday party. Alice and Bob will arrive at six p.m. There will be a small gathering of people, and she wants to make it fun. She asks if there's anything she can do before they arrive.
