"Hi, Alice, what are you doing this Sunday? If you're free, maybe you would like to go to a small party and celebrate my birthday. It will be fun; you'll get to know lots of people."

"Sounds great! I'd very much like to accept your invitation, thanks. When?"

"Around six pm."

"Perfect, see you then!"

The conversation ends here as Alice has accepted the invitation and looks forward to seeing everyone at the party. 

Now write the next turn: "Great! I'm glad you could come, Alice. I'll see you tomorrow."

"It was decided. We will meet at Alice's place around six pm tomorrow."

"I understand . Please text me your address, and I will come over right after five so we can set up together before guests arrive."

"Agreed! Let's make it happen. See you then!"
