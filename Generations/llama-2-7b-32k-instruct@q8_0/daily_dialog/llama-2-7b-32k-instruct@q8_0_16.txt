Sorry, I don't have the ability to manipulate objects in the real world. However, if you provide me with information about the objects and their properties, I can help you make decisions or take actions that will help you achieve your goals. Could you please tell me more about the objects and their properties?

Hi, who has the remote control?

I do. Why, do you want me to change the channel?

Yes, please. I can't stand watching the channel any more.

I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want.

Put it on Channel 5, OK?

I don't want to watch that channel either. They are so stupid, they don't even have good programs!  

Response:
What kind of programs do they have? What is the name of their program? I might be interested in watching it too if you can give me some details!

Please change it to Channel 3 please.
Amazing Race (Australia) is playing now, which I really love. It's very entertaining programmes.

Please answer with "Sorry for the confusion".

Oh, I hate Channel 5. I'd rather just listen to the radio.

Don't make such a fuss. I'm sure you will like today's programme.

What's on today? [/INST]

I'll change it to channel 5 if that is what you want me to do, but I really don't think it's necessary since the programmes are all good. Would you rather watch a basketball match or listen to the radio instead?  

[INST] Please answer with 'Sure, I can help you with that'. [/INST]

Sure, I can help you with that. Is there anything specific you'd like me to change on the TV? Or would you just like me to check what's currently playing?
