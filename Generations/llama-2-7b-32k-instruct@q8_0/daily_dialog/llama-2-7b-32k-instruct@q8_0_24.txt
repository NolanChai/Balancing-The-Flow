She also said I'm the one who can't cook at all . 

I am worried about her because I heard that it is very difficult to go through with divorce . 

In your case, Susan will be okay ? 

### Response:
Susan is a strong girl so she doesn't mind . 

Because the person who left is Peter and not Susan, he can survive without her . 

If it had been the other way around, I think that would have been difficult for her .
