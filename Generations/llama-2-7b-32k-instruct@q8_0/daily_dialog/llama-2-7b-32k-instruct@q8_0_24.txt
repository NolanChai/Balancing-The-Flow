"I know it's not easy," said Peter. "But we are here for you. We want to help in any way we can."

Susan appreciated their support and felt a little better knowing that she had their backing. She knew she would get through this tough time with their help.

"Thanks, guys," she said, smiling gratefully. "I really appreciate it."
