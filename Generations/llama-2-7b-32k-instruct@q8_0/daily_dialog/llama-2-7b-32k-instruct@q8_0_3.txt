The Mountaineering Club is not doing anything this weekend. The club usually meets every Wednesday at the local gym and goes hiking or rock climbing together, but this Saturday they are planning to go on a backpacking trip in the mountains. It's supposed to be pretty hardcore, so we need to bring some rope and other safety equipment in case something goes wrong while climbing. We have to get an early start because we want to make it to the top by noon at the latest!

We went rock climbing.

What does it mean when someone says that they "have a lead" on a climb?    
How do you get leads? 

 Can people just say, hey, I want to get this climb?   

### Response:""Lead" is the technical name for the way that we can set up an anchor to clip in and secure ourselves . The person who "has a lead" on a climb may be the first person to climb the route and place protection (also known as "protection") along the way so that other climbers can climb it after them."

What do you mean by "top-rope?" 

 Or is there a difference between top roping and lead climbing?    
Can people go on trips without having prior experience?

### Response:"Whenever we are "top-roping," it means that the climbers who want to climb do not have protection set up ahead of time . They will be belayed (supervised by someone lower down the cliff) while they climb and clip into a permanent anchor at the top of the route, which is usually bolted on with a metal pin."

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

It is important to bring appropriate gear on any outdoor activity such as a helmet, harness, shoes, water and food."

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
