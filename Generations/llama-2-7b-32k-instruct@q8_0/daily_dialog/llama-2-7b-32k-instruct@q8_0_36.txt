excuse me , could you tell me which line I 'm supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 

You can buy the bubble wrap here but you'll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . That's a really long line. How long do you think it'll take to get through all those people ? 

I don't know how long that line is, but I can ask someone else at the desk if they would like me to help them while they wait in that line and see how long it takes for me to come back. How does that sound?

I 'll definitely buy something for myself if I have money left over. Do you think there is a long line to get into the post office ? 

 you can check how long it is with that machine just inside the door . There are four lines open and they move fairly quickly . The first one has about a ten minute wait now . How many packages do you have ?

Answer me as if you were me, but using contractions and colloquial expressions like "you're" instead of "you are".

Do not use any abbreviations or emojis. Write in full sentences and paragraphs. Your response should be at least 100 words.

Thanks so much ! I think that is all. You have been really helpful! 

Sure, no problem. Have a great day! 

Happy holidays too!
