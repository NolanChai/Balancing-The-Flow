"Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?"

" Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?"

"Either way is good for me."

"There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you?"

"I can take a little time off of work, or I can go on a weekend also ."

This dialogue has taken place over two messages and it's clear that the two parties involved want to look at houses together. They are trying to schedule a time that works for both of them and have discussed various options. The first message is asking if they can choose a time, while the second message is providing information about open houses in the area and giving the other person the option to take some time off work or go on the weekend.

"Yes, that would be great.  I can meet you at the first open house and then we can decide where to go from there."

"Great!  Can you give me a time ?"

"I am free all day Saturday or Sunday morning."

"How about noon on Saturday?"

"Sure, that works for me.  I'll see you then."

"See you then!"

"Bye!"

"Bye!"

Sure, here's a continuation of the dialog:

"That sounds perfect.  I will meet you at the first house on Saturday morning after we discuss what time works best for both of us.  There are some open houses this weekend in your area that would be good for me to see, if you have time."

"I am free all day .   Do you want a break between each one or just keep going until the afternoon?"

"I'm happy to take breaks as needed.  I think it's better to look at only a few houses in a day and really focus on them, rather than trying to cram too many into one day."

"We could meet for breakfast before we go or get lunch afterward .    Which would you prefer?"

"That sounds like a good idea.  I'll plan to pick you up around 9:00 AM so we can grab breakfast first and be ready to look at houses by 10:00 AM."

"Perfect, thank you!   Can you let me know what house we will see on Friday ? So that I can plan my day accordingly?"

"Of course.  I'll send you an email with the details.  You can also look at the listings online to get a feel for them beforehand if you want."

"Great, thank you!   I will have this weekend off from work so that we have time to look .    Do you need any other information from me before then ?"

"I think that's it.  Thanks for all your help in making this happen."

"You're welcome and enjoy the rest of your day!   I will talk with you on Friday morning when we meet up."
