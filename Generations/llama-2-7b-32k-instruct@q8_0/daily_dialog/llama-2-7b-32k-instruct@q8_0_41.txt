How do you think the role of women in technology/STEM fields will change in the next 10 years, and what can be done to support and encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields? 

I believe that we'll see a significant increase in the number of women working in STEM fields over the next decade. This is due to a combination of factors, including increased awareness of the opportunities available in these fields and a growing recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. To support and encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields, I believe that organizations need to make a concerted effort to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all employees, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This can include mentorship programs, sponsorship opportunities, and training and development initiatives specifically designed for women in STEM.
