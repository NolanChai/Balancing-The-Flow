"I see . It sounds like you're interested in exploring new career options and developing new skills. The course might be helpful for you in that regard. Have you ever thought about talking to your manager or HR representative at your current job about your concerns and interests? They may have some insights or resources that could help you make a decision."

"Yes, I did . They gave me some suggestions about how to improve my performance and asked me if I wanted to switch departments . The thing is , they put me in this department without giving any explanation why . When I tried to ask them the reason, they said it was just for 'work experience'. Moreover, they didn't give me any feedback on what I did wrong . So I thought my bosses were not sincere ."

"I can understand your frustration. It's important to feel like you are being heard and valued at work. If you're not getting that support from your manager or HR, it might be time to consider a different job opportunity."

"What if I try to make some changes first ? After all, maybe they can provide me with the resources I need . And I don't want to just quit my job without finding other opportunities . "

"That's a good idea. Sometimes, it can be helpful to take a step back and reflect on what you want from your career. Maybe there are certain skills or experiences that you haven't had the chance to gain yet that would make you feel more fulfilled in your current position. You could also talk to your manager about setting some goals and expectations for yourself, so you know what success looks like."

"Thanks . I will try to do that . And maybe if I can learn something new from this course too, it might be even better ."

"Yes, definitely! Good luck with whatever you decide. It's always good to have options and to keep learning and growing professionally."
