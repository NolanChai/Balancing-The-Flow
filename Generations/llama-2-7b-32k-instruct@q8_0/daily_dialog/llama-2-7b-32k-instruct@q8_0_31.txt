It's really good that my friend has been learning a lot from this course . He could share his experiences with us. And I think it will be great if we can subscribe to it, since we all want to make wise choices about our career planning. As for what he told me about the course, he just said something in general such as several key steps in planning a career and how to set specific and tenable goals. So I don't think there is much information that he could share with us at this time since he didn't learn anything specific from it yet. But he will have more details after the course ends .

### Response:

I see what you mean . It would be great to know his experience firsthand, especially as it relates to career planning. That way, we can learn about new ideas and insights that are relevant to us personally. I'm sure he's learning a lot of helpful things right now in this online course. Maybe when the course is finished, he could share some of his experiences with us?

### Response:

I agree with you . He could at least give us an overview of what they have been talking about in class so far, and how it can be applied to real-life scenarios . It will definitely help us to know more about career planning. I'm sure he wants to share his knowledge and experience with us.

### Response:

I bet it would! Maybe you could talk to him directly after the course ends, and ask if he has anything in mind that might be applicable to our work/career situations? He may not have thought of this before, but it's worth a shot! ðŸ˜Š

### Response:

Yes, I will definitely do so. Thank you for your suggestion.

It sounds like you have a lot of things you want to think about and consider in your career planning. You're already hardworking, which is an awesome trait. It seems like you might get bored with your job if it's not stimulating enough for you though - that can happen even when we enjoy our work! The course you mentioned sounds really practical and will probably help you figure out a lot of these things.
