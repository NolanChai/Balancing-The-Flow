This service is designed for group companies that operate under one corporate umbrella but have separate bank accounts for each subsidiary or branch office.

Sure, here's an example of how the Group Account Deposit Service works in practice:

Suppose a group company named ABC Corp has three subsidiary companies called XYZ Inc, DEF Ltd, and GHI Co. Each of these subsidiaries has its own bank account, but they all operate under the same corporate umbrella. ABC Corp wants to streamline their cash flow management and reduce costs by consolidating their banking operations into a single group account.

With the Group Account Deposit Service from IBA Bank, ABC Corp can open a central master account that serves as the main deposit account for all three subsidiary companies. They can then create separate sub-accounts for each of the three subsidiaries, with their own unique account numbers and passwords. This allows ABC Corp to maintain the separation of funds between each individual subsidiary while still having a centralized view of group-wide liquidity and financial performance.

Whenever XYZ Inc, DEF Ltd, or GHI Co makes a deposit into their respective bank accounts, it will be immediately reflected in the group account. ABC Corp's authorized users can then access the group account through online banking to monitor activity, initiate transfers between sub-accounts, and perform other transactions as needed.

This way, ABC Corp can eliminate the need for multiple bank accounts and associated bank fees, while still maintaining the separation of funds between each individual subsidiary. The Group Account Deposit Service provides real-time account balances and transaction updates, making it easier for ABC Corp to manage their cash flow and treasury operations.

I hope this example helps illustrate how the Group Account Deposit Service works in practice. If you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask!

Sure, here are some examples of how much money can be saved by using the Group Account Deposit Service:

1. Elimination of bank fees: By consolidating all cash flow management into a single group account, banks can eliminate the need for multiple bank accounts and associated fees. This can result in significant savings for companies that have multiple subsidiaries or branch offices. For example, if a company has three subsidiary companies with bank accounts each incurring an average monthly fee of $50 per account, they could save $150 per month by using the Group Account Deposit Service.

2. Improved cash flow management: By centralizing all deposits into a single group account, companies can improve their cash flow management and reduce the risk of overdrafts or insufficient funds. They can also monitor their liquidity and financial performance in real-time, allowing them to make better decisions about investments and spending. For example, if a company has $1 million in monthly deposits across its three subsidiaries, consolidating these deposits into a single group account could result in savings of up to $60,000 per year in interest expenses.

3. Enhanced treasury operations: The Group Account Deposit Service can help companies manage their liquidity more effectively and improve their overall treasury operations. By consolidating all cash flow management into a single account, companies can reduce the need for inter-company wire transfers or manual reconciliations, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced costs. For example, if a company has three subsidiaries with different treasury processes, consolidating these processes into a single group account could result in savings of up to $20,000 per year in labor costs.

These are just some examples of the potential savings that can be achieved by using the Group Account Deposit Service. The actual savings will depend on the specific needs and operations of each individual company.

### Question:
Can I have an example for a Group Company ? 

Sure, one example of a group company is a corporation that owns several smaller companies. For instance, the parent company may be in the business of manufacturing products, while its subsidiaries are in charge of different aspects of the production process such as research and development, raw materials sourcing, logistics, etc. By bringing all these operations under one corporate structure, the group company can streamline its processes and make better use of resources.

The aim here is to provide financial oversight and management services for all the subsidiaries under the same corporate umbrella.

In summary, a group company can take various forms, such as a holding company that owns stakes in multiple other companies or a parent company with multiple subsidiaries operating in different business sectors. The key feature is that they are all governed by one corporate structure and have common management teams that coordinate their activities for synergy and profitability maximization.
