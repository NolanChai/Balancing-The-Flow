"Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ?"

"I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service. What is it used for? I mean, why bother to get this special account?"

"Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible, when dealing with their subsidiaries."

"It sounds good , but doesn't a regular bank account do the same thing? Why does this service cost more? And how much does it cost anyway?"

"There are several advantages. Firstly, you can pay your expenses abroad easily . You can also make withdrawals in any currency."

"OK, but what about the price ? Is this really cheaper than a regular bank account? Or is this some kind of a marketing trick?"

"You will have to pay a service fee for this deposit. The amount depends on your needs and the size of the company . We can calculate the exact cost of your business."

"I'm interested in opening an account with IBA, but I need some more information about how it works before we make the final decision. Could you please send me a detailed overview of all the charges involved?"
