"Sure, of course. What else is new? You never know what could happen next."

"I understand that, but this feels different. It's been a tough year so far, and I just don't see it getting any easier."

"You think you might be right about that?"

"I hope not, because we all deserve better."

"We do indeed. So what are your plans after this ? Are you going to stay in the same field or take a different direction altogether?"

"I'm not sure yet. I've been thinking about starting my own business, but it's still very early days. We'll see how things unfold."

"That's exciting! What kind of business do you have in mind?"

"Well, I've always loved fashion and styling. Maybe I can use that to my advantage and start a small business doing wardrobe styling for people in need of a little help."

"That sounds amazing! You should definitely pursue it if that's what you want to do. Who knows, maybe one day your own business will grow into something much bigger!"

"I hope so! It would be great to make my mark and leave behind something lasting."

"Absolutely! And in the meantime, I wish you all the best for this new chapter in your life. You have my full support and I'm sure we'll stay in touch."

"Thank you so much. It means a lot to me that you're rooting for me like this."

"Of course! It was my pleasure, Amelia . And don't worry, I won't let you go without a fight!"

"I appreciate the support, John. Thanks again and have a good one."

"You too, babe!"

Amelia, could you spare a few minutes?

Sure. What do you need? 

I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice. It's complicated. But basically, it boils down to one thing. This company is downsizing, and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go. There's also another reason. I've got a better offer. 

I hope you understand. I have to prioritize my future over my present. It's unfortunate, but it's the right decision. I need to take care of myself and my family. Thanks for your support throughout my time here. I'll always be grateful for what we've accomplished together.

I understand. But I don't think this is the best solution. We can figure out a way to keep you on board. There must be something we can do. Let me talk to HR and see if there are any options available. 

I appreciate your concern, Amelia. But I think it's important for me to take charge of my own career path. It's not up to them; it's up to me. And I believe that this decision is the right one. Thank you again for your understanding and support.

Of course, Amelia. I understand completely. If there's anything else you need help with in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll keep that in mind. Take care, Amelia. 

You too, Amelia. Take care of yourself and your family. Stay safe out there. 

I will do my best! You take care as well, and don't work too hard. See you around.

Thanks, Amelia. I'll be in touch soon. Bye for now! 

Bye for now, Amelia. It was great working with you. Stay safe out there! Take care of yourself!
