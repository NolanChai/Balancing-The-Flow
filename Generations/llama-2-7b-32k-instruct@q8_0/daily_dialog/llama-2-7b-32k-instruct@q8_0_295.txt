"Hey, look, there is a circus show over there."  

"I'm not in the mood."  

"It's the circus."  

"I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals."  

"Oh, come on, they give them treats too. Oh, look, that little monkey is so cute."  

"Cute? Hope so."  

"Oh, it is coming to us, come on, Ben, get a banana to it."

"I'm sorry, I can't do that. But I am going to watch the monkey perform." 

"What are you talking about? You don't even like monkeys!"

"Yes, but this one is especially cute and seems to be a great entertainer . "

"Fine , just remember that if you start getting annoyed with it, I will not hesitate to take the banana away from him." 

"I'm sure I won't need to do that. But if it comes to that, I'll just leave you here and go find another monkey show."

"Ha! Good luck finding one of those . They're all over the place." 

"Whatever . Just be careful not to get too attached to this little guy or else I will not hesitate to take away your banana, mister."
