"I see . Have you been exposed to anything that could be causing this? Like smoke or dust?"

"No, I haven't. I was just in the office all day."

"Well, let me take a look at your throat and nose. You might have an ear infection or sinusitis. Have you been experiencing any pain in those areas?"

"No, it's more of a dull aching sensation."

"Okay, that could be due to inflammation in the nasal passages. Let me prescribe some medications and we can monitor your progress. But don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing serious."

"Thanks, Doctor. You're a lifesaver."

Doctor: What seems to be the problem today, young man?
Patient: Doctor, I have a bad cough, and my headache is terrible. Do you think it's serious?
Doctor: Let me examine you. Don't worry, it's nothing too severe.
Patient: Should I lie in bed for the next few days?
Doctor: Yes, stay in bed and drink plenty of water. Your fever should go away within a day or two.

What's wrong with you , young man ?

Let me examine you. Don't worry. It's nothing serious. 

Do you think I should lie in bed?

OK. Do you think I can play football tomorrow? 

Of course not. You need a good rest.
