"I've had it with Tim! I think I'm going to quit!"

"But Sandra ... you love your job! You spent months trying to get this position. It's perfect for you!"

"What kind of power struggles are you talking about?"

Sandra: Yeah...I know. But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles!  
Tim: What kind of power struggles are you talking about?
