I just need to rest .

I want to be a teacher who doesn't fall asleep during lessons . 

Do you have any suggestions?

Also, are there any books that would be helpful for me to study for the test?

You should study more about punctuation marks and vocabulary .

I don't know if you heard of this before but I once saw a movie where someone took a nap during class, woke up and was able to solve a difficult problem that had everyone baffled. 

That might happen to you . I bet it would be good for your image too.

You're right! I forgot what I wanted to say. Yes, napping during class is a great way to study. Have you thought about trying it? You can wake up refreshed and energized, ready to solve any problem that comes your way. And besides, who says you have to take notes when you can just sleep instead? 

So what do you think? Are you willing to give napping during class a try? I'm sure you'll be glad you did!
