Lily: Hey, Mom. 👋  
Mom: Hi there! How was school? Did you have a good day? 🤔  
Lily: It was fine...I guess. 🙄  
Mom: Great! I'm so glad to hear it. And how are your homework assignments coming along? 📝  
Lily: Uh, I didn't have any homework, Mom. You know that. 😅  
Mom: Oh, okay. Well then...how about you get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments? 🤔  
Lily: But I don't have any reading assignments. ✋️  
Mom: Then review for your test. You'll do even better. And maybe reading will help you get to sleep. 😴  
Lily: Aw, Mom-you're such a drag. 🙄
