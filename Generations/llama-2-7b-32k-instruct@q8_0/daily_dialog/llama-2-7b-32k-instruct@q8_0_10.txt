No no no !!! You don't need to be pre med to do science. I just have a thing for medical students, they seem so studious and smart. Plus my boyfriend is one (he's studying to become an internist).   

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Aww , that sounds adorable ! Maybe he can teach me a little about the human body since I'm not very familiar with it . Oh wait, actually no. Because of what I do for work and my past career choice I am already intimately familiar with pretty much every part of the human body at this point... and most of the animal kingdom as well."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"So really, pre-med or not , science is something everyone should have a general understanding of . Like basic math or reading. It's just one of those things that makes life easier and more interesting if you can at least talk the talk."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Science courses are also really great for making friends and meeting people in a similar place as you . My best friend in college was not pre med at all (she was an art major). But we met through a class she took to fulfill a science requirement, and I took the same class because it fit my schedule. Now we're inseparable."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"I think the most important thing to know about science is that there are all different types of science . Biology? Chemistry? Physics? Engineering? There's also math and technology and nursing and computer science, and then there's healthcare and medicine and psychology. I don't want to make this a novel but you get the idea."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"The best part is that every single one of them has so many different career paths, so even if you major in science it doesn't mean you have to be stuck in research or teaching or whatever . You could literally do anything you want. And if you don't like any of the careers options , create a new one! There's always room for innovation and change."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And science is fun ! It's really fascinating to learn how things work. So it doesn't feel like you're doing something that feels boring or unfulfilling . It feels like exploration, discovery, and adventure . And the world needs more people who are curious and excited about life."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And it doesn't have to be hard science, either. I think that a lot of people think science is like rocket science or something super intense . But really , a lot of the scientific discoveries and theories we use every day were made by regular folks who were just curious and interested in how things work . And then they did experiments to figure it out."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Science is for everyone, regardless of what field they go into or if they even go into the workforce. It's a great skill set to have in general and it's something that can be applied to everyday life . Like how to read a nutrition label or evaluate scientific studies on the news . And I think that it's also really important for people to not take anything they hear as fact until they know the source is reliable, regardless of their political leanings. It's just good life practice and helps you avoid falling into traps set by those with ulterior motives."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And lastly , science has made our lives better in so many ways . Like medicine and technology that improve the quality of life, or the scientific process itself which allows us to find answers to questions and make breakthroughs and invent things."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And it's not just the obvious stuff like computers and smartphones . It's also things we don't even think of as being related to science, like colorful socks or a hot cup of coffee in the morning."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Science is everywhere ! So yeah , if you can take a science class that sounds interesting and learn something new about the world around us and how it works, I say go for it . Even if you're not sure what career path you want to go down or what your purpose in life is yet, doing something fun that makes you feel curious and fulfilled is worthwhile. Because really , isn't that what life should be about?"  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And if nothing else it's just a great way to have fun and meet people in college . Plus science is a lot of fun because it's all new information and discoveries ! And sometimes there are lab experiments that involve food, like fake blood or some sort of slimy substance. Like what you'd expect from a crime scene investigation."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And it's also kind of like playing dress up with lab coats and goggles . Which is pretty cool if you ask me . And it's not just for kids anymore, people are always looking for science nerds to fill positions in research and other areas of study."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Science has come a long way since the time of Galileo and Newton. And now it's something that everyone can do and be interested in, no matter what their background or education level is . So if there's ever been a time to take a science class , I would say now is definitely the time."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"It's not just something that geeks and nerds can do anymore. It's something everyone should have at least some level of understanding of, even if it's just basic math or reading . Because science is everywhere. And the more people who understand it , the better off we will all be."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Science has changed our lives in so many ways and continues to change them every single day . It's really amazing what a difference science has made, even just since I was a child."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"So if there's ever been a time when taking a science class seemed interesting or useful to you, I would definitely say go for it . Even if it feels like you don't have the background knowledge or grades required, you might be surprised at what you can pick up and how much fun it is."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"Plus , taking a science class in college looks great on a resume too. So even if you don't know what to do with the degree afterward, at least you have something impressive on your CV that shows you are dedicated and interested in learning new things . And who knows, maybe it will lead to some cool side projects or business ideas."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And plus , it's just a fun way to spend time with other people. And even if your class is super hard and all the students are failing the first exam, at least you can joke about it in class . Or doodle science notes on the side of your notebook."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And who knows what other discoveries or inventions will come out of it? Maybe even a new cure for cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Or maybe just an app that makes life easier . Either way, science is something everyone should learn more about and be interested in."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And the best part is that learning about science is fun and easy if you have the right teacher and materials. So there's no excuse for not trying it out . And even if it turns out to be your least favorite thing in the world, at least now you know what to avoid in the future."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And science is always evolving and changing too. So you can always go back to a lab or classroom later in life if you want to learn something new or change careers . And you'll never run out of things to explore."  

[INST] continue from where you left off [/INST]

"And there are so many different kinds of science classes and fields of study that it's like having a buffet of choices. You can choose something you really love or try lots of different things until you find your passion . Or maybe you don't have to have just one passion, but can be interested in lots of different areas."

You can do better than that now, Margaret . You should sign up for the chemistry course. There are several reasons why you will find it helpful to take this class. For example, it is one of your required classes and it helps build a strong foundation for all the other science courses that you need to take before you graduate. Taking the biology, chemistry and physics classes is not enough because they do not cover all the topics in detail . It will be much easier for you when taking the organic chemistry course after this one. You can also learn to solve problems better by analyzing them first and understanding how to get started on a solution methodically. 

### Response:
I would recommend you to take biology. It is an easy course that covers the basic of human life from fertilization to death . If you are good at it, you can transfer to other majors like nursing or pharmacy school after you graduate since all those fields require a pre-med background. 

### Response:
I'm not sure that is the right course for me , I want to take something more challenging and rewarding . 

### Response:
Then, perhaps you should consider physics or chemistry. I have heard that both of those courses are quite challenging but very rewarding if you do well in them. 

### Response:
I am worried about math . 

### Response:
Don't be ! You will definitely get through it since you got this far already. If you take the class, you will find out that what they said is true and it will benefit your future career choices.

### Response:
I think biology should suit me fine . 

### Response:
Great ! Now , I am sure you will do well in college since you have a solid foundation on science courses which is necessary to get through any pre-health professional programs. Good luck and don't forget that if you need help, feel free to ask me !  

[INST] Okay , the biology class sounds great .  [/INST]

### Response:
Sure, but you should also take physics . 

### Response:
I know but I can always come back after the first year to get it . I just want to get a good foundation on science and math courses first before moving onto something else . 

### Response:
You could always double major if that would be an option for you. You'd have a better chance of getting into medical school if you had both a science degree and a non-science one, though I don't think it is necessary to get in .   

[INST] Okay , that sounds good .  [/INST]

### Response:
Okay , what else can you tell me about the biology course ? 

### Response:
I have already mentioned some of its benefits . Now let me talk about its pros and cons. Pros - it's easier than other courses, so you won't have to worry too much if you don't get into medical school after taking this class (that doesn't mean that it is easy) since there are a lot of career options that require a pre-med background . Cons - It covers less information compared to others.

### Response:
Okay , so I just need to focus on the core sciences then ?  [/INST]

Yes, you are right, Margaret ! You only have to worry about your math and science courses from now on. The rest will be easier for you as long as you try your best in those subjects. It's a good idea to get through all your pre-health requirements before graduation so you don't need to take them after that since they are not required if you want to go into other fields like nursing or pharmacy school.
