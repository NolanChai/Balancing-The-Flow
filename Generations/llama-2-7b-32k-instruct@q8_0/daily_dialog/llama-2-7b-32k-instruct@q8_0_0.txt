"I really wish we had brought a torch. It's starting to get pretty dark out here."

"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll be able to make it back before dark. We just need to keep heading in the right direction and stay calm."

"But what if something happens? What if we can't find our way back?"

"We will, don't worry. We have a GPS tracker and a map, so we should be able to navigate back easily enough."

"I hope you're right," the person says, sounding worried.

"Hey, look on the bright side, at least we didn't run out of food or water!"
