Cindy: "That's because Americans love sitcoms, but not everyone loves them. Sitcoms are usually half an hour long and they air weekly. Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people."

Me: "Sitcoms? What are sitcoms?"

Cindy: "A situation comedy or a situation comedy is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms first appeared in the 1950s, and during its heyday (the late-1970s to mid-1990s), sitcoms dominated the prime time television landscape."

Me: "But I've never heard of sitcoms before. What else is there?"

Cindy: "In Taiwan, prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies."
