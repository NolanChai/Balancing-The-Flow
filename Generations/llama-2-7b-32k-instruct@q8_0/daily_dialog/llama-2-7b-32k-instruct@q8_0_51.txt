 You're right . 

 Do you know the news ?

"No, I don't. Can you tell me about it?"

"Yes, sure! Brazil won the World Cup in 2014. They beat Germany 7-1 in the final, which was the biggest defeat in World Cup history."

"That's amazing! How did they do it? What was their strategy?"

"Well, their forward Neymar Jr. had an incredible performance, scoring five goals and assisting on two others. Their defense also played very well, shutting down the German offense."

"Wow, that's really impressive. I'm glad they won!"

"Me too! It was a great match for Brazilian football. Do you think they'll be able to repeat their success in the 2018 World Cup?"

"I don't know. They have some talented players, but it will be tough with so many top teams competing."

"True. We'll just have to wait and see how things play out. Anything else you want to talk about before we go back to our own lives?"

"No, that's all I needed. It was nice chatting with you!"

"Same here! Have a great day, and don't forget to read the book I lent you."
