"Oh, I see. Well, did Tom ever tell you about the time when he and some of his friends went on a wild adventure to an abandoned mine in the middle of nowhere? It was filled with all sorts of surprises and dangers, but they made it out alive! What a great story!"

"Wow that sounds exciting ! I'm glad you were able to share those experiences together .  How long have you been married for ?"

"We've been married for almost ten years now. It's crazy to think how much time has passed! We still love each other very much and are happy in our marriage."

"That's wonderful ! Are there any specific memories or moments that stand out as the most special ones you shared with Tom?"

"Oh, there are definitely some amazing memories. One of my favorites was when we went on a romantic getaway to Paris and spent a week exploring the city together. We had such a great time wandering around museums, sipping wine at cafes, and strolling through the streets hand in hand. It's a trip that will always hold a special place in my heart."

"That sounds like it was a really special time for both of you. It's clear that Tom is an amazing partner and person to have shared those memories with. Is there anything specific that you hope to achieve together in the future as a couple?"
