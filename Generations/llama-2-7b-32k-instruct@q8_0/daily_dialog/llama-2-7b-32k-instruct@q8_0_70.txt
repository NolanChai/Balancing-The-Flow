"Well , I must be off now. It's getting late and I have an appointment tomorrow morning. Thanks for having me over."

"Please stay for dinner with us. We would love to have you."

"I'm afraid I can't. I'm on a tight schedule and have an important meeting at seven o'clock. But it was nice seeing you again."

"It has been lovely seeing you again as well. Goodbye, then."
