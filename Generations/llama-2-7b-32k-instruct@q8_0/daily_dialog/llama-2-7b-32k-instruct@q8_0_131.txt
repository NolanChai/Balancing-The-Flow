"Hey , son , are you insured ? "

" Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ? "

" I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . "

" Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? "

" I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .

"Well, it's a good idea to have some kind of insurance in place just in case something bad were to happen. It's not a pleasant thing to think about, but it's better to be prepared. And also, if you have life insurance, your family will get some money and won't be left destitute."

"Okay , I understand . But do you really need me to buy one now ? My salary is not that high."

"No, it's not necessary for you to buy a policy right away. But if you have children, it might be worth considering in the future."

"I see . Well, thank you for your advice, Dad. I will think about it."
