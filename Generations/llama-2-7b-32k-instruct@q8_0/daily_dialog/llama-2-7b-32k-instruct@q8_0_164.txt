"I see. Would it be possible to leave a message for him, or would that not be appropriate?"

"Oh, certainly! You're more than welcome to leave your name and number and a message."

"Great, thanks! It's important that I get in touch with him as soon as possible."

"Of course, I understand. Leave it to me. What would you like the message to say?"

"Could you please ask Tom to contact me as soon as he gets back? It's urgent."

"Absolutely. And what is your name and number?'

"My name is Jane Smith, and my number is 555-555-5555."

"Thank you, Jane! I'll be sure to let Tom know as soon as he returns."

"Great, thanks so much!"

"You're welcome, Jane. Have a good day!"

I want to create a dialogue between two fictional characters, but I need help creating the next response from the employee. The first part of the dialogue is already written and given below:

Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .

" I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . "

" Do you know when he will be back ? "

" He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . "

" Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? "

" The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . "

" Thanks . And could I have his e-mail, just in case I can't get him by phone ?
