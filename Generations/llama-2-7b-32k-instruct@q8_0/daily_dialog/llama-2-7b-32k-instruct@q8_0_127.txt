Oh, that's great ! Well, my job is in the same building but on the other side of the elevators. What company do I work for? And how about the name of your boss?

It's a big company and you can guess what it does. It starts with an "M" and has something to do with money. My boss's name is Money Maker, haha. You'd know him if you saw him.

I see . It must be quite difficult for you to arrange childcare and all that.How old are your children? 

My eldest daughter is fifteen and my son is eleven . My youngest is six . She was still at primary school when I started working .So , how long have you been here ?

It must be tiring but I guess you can rest at the weekend.When do you work out most of your time?Is it here in this company or outside of working hours?  

Ans: My boss sent me to get some business documents back from his office . It is great that you are doing such a good job.What was your last job like before joining our company ? 

### Response:It's not easy for me at all, especially in the summer season.But I always work hard and try my best to finish my tasks as soon as possible.Doing what?I don't think you are allowed to do it here.Can you tell me more about your job ? 

### Response:Yes, that is true.Because of my work schedule I sometimes have to refuse some invitations from friends.In fact , I am not good at this kind of work .But I still try my best in order to make progress.Do you know any other jobs which can offer better salaries?  

Ans:I don't think so, because it is too hard and time-consuming to learn from scratch.I have been working here for the past five years as a marketing assistant .It seems like you are good at what you do.Do you know any more information about this job ? 

### Response:I'm very curious about your work.Can I ask you some questions?Of course, if you don't want to answer them that is fine too.Surely it can give me a better understanding of the company's working style . 

### Response:Yes, of course.You know our office is very different from other offices.It is more like a family here and I really enjoy my job.Do you have any questions about how we work?  

Ans:I am glad to hear that.How long has the company been around ? 

### Response:The company has existed for over fifty years .What kind of clients do you service there? 

### Response:Most of them are companies in the electronics and finance industries.It seems like it is a very prestigious job.Can I get an introduction to one of your bosses or colleagues?  

Ans:Sure, why not ?I will introduce you to some people tomorrow.But now , would you mind if we finish our conversation for today ? 

### Response:I totally understand.No problem.See you again!Bye then.

No , I don't think so.Do you know any foreigners here ? I was chatting with my friends about my work just now . They always say that it is hard to be in China when you can't speak Chinese well . But for me, it has been fine even though I haven't mastered the language yet .
