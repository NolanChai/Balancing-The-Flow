"Where ' s Sally, Jack?"

"She's in the garden, Jane."

"What's she doing?"

"She's sitting under the tree."

"Is Tim in the garden, too?

"What's going on out there?"

"Sally and Jack are in the garden, Jane. Sally is sitting under the tree, and Tim is climbing the tree."

"What? What's Tim doing up that tree?"

"I beg your pardon," replied Jack. "Who's climbing the tree?"

"Sorry, it seems like you have some information that is not accurate or up-to-date. It's best to check with Sally and Jane directly to get the most recent information."

"Oh, I see . Well, it's great to hear that Tim is climbing the tree. He must be having a lot of fun!"

"Yes, he seems to be enjoying himself immensely."

"And Sally?"

"She's still sitting under the tree, but she seems to be relaxing and taking in the sunshine."

"That sounds like a good idea. I hope they have a wonderful time!"

"Thank you! It's always nice to hear that people are enjoying themselves."

"Yes, it is indeed."

"Well, it looks like we're out of time for now. Thank you for chatting with me today. It was a pleasure speaking with you."

"Likewise, have a great day!"
