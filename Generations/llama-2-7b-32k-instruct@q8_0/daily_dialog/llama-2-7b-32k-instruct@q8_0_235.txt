10. Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 

" Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . " 

" Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . " 

" Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . " 

" You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?"

"The snow comes from the mountains, which are just outside the city," says Adam. "It's called the Olympic mountain range. It's a great place to ski and snowboard."

"Wow, that's amazing," says Emma. "I had no idea it was here."

Adam nods. "It's one of the things I love about living in Tokyo. There are so many outdoor activities available year-round."

Emma smiles. "You know what? Let's go for a hike sometime soon. It sounds like fun!"

"Hiking is great, but we should probably choose a day with less snowfall," says Adam. "I don't want to get soaked!"

Emma laughs and nods in agreement. "That's true! Let's do it sometime soon."

As they continue watching the ski show, Emma can't help but feel grateful for this unexpected adventure. It had been a while since she'd had such an exciting experience in Tokyo - and now, she can't wait to see what other surprises await her here!

"Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show."

"You're right. But what if an avalanche happened?"

"They are all great skiers and very experienced. So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim."

"Anyway, the show is breathtaking. By the way, where did they get so much snow here?"

"Well, they have the most advanced snowmaking machine."

"Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution?"
