Leo, thank you for all of your hard work on the budget. We're having a get-together after work tonight to celebrate. Would love to see you there! 

Normally I would have loved to but unfortunately, I can't make it tonight. It's my second wedding anniversary with Susan. We're supposed to be having a big dinner. She'd kill me if I missed it. Happy Anniversary! Sorry you won't be there. Maybe some other time?
