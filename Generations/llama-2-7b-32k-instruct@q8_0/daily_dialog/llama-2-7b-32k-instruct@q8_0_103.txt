I'm the robber, not the banker. So I'm taking all of your money! But if you give me $500 as a tip, then I might let you live...? 

Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! 
Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
You're a fool ! Just because someone is a doctor does n't mean they know what they are talking about. The fact of the matter is, this has been going on for far too long! If you do not stop right now, I will have no choice but to take legal action against you . 
I am going to call the police ! And don't even think about trying anything funny, because I know that you are hiding something. You think your little friends won't tell on you ? Think again! Because I have a few contacts in the government, and let me tell you, they do NOT like people who break the law ! 
So what do you say ? Are you going to give me the $500 that is rightfully mine, or am I going to go down to the police station and turn you in myself? Because either way, you are not getting away with this!

I need more information about what's going on. Who is this 'Banker', and who am I? Why do i have to ask the bank for money ? Is this a game ?  

[INST] I will give you hints . You will ask questions based on those hints . 

Hints : Bank Robbery, Detective, Money

My first question is "What does it mean to pass go?" [/INST]

Sure, I'll do my best! Please provide me with more information or context about the situation you're describing so that I can better understand your questions and provide helpful responses.  

[INST] Hints : Bank Robbery, Detective, Money
My first question is "What does it mean to pass go?" [/INST]

Sure! In this context, "passing go" likely means moving forward or advancing in a game or activity. It's like saying "next" or "go ahead". So the person who is asking you what it means to pass go probably wants to know why they can take some money or something else of value when they move forward in this situation. Does that make sense? If not, please let me know and I'll do my best to clarify.

Now, as for your first question: What does it mean to pass go? - Please provide more context or information about the situation you're describing so that I can better understand what you're asking. Are you playing a game where someone takes some money when they advance/pass go? Or are you in a situation where someone is moving forward, and you want to know why they're taking something valuable with them?  

[INST] My first question was "What does it mean to pass go?" [/INST]

Great! I apologize for the confusion. So, based on your first question, it sounds like someone is passing go and moving forward in a game or activity where they are taking some money (or something else valuable). Is that correct?  

[INST] I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !  [/INST]

Got it! So, someone is passing go and moving forward in a game or activity where they are taking some money when they move forward. Does that sound right?

Now, as for your next question: Why does the person who passed go have to ask you before taking any money or anything else of value? - Please provide more context or information about the situation you're describing so that I can better understand what you're asking. Are you playing a game where someone is moving forward and taking something valuable, but they have to ask you first? Or are you in a different kind of situation where someone is trying to take something away from you?

Also, just to confirm - you mentioned that everyone knows when someone passes go and collects $ 200. Does that mean the person who passed go was supposed to collect $ 200 but didn't? Or did they not expect to have to ask you first for permission to take something?  

[INST] I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200, Everyone knows that ! [/INST]

Great! So, everyone seems to know when someone passes go and collects $ 200. Does this mean the person who passed go was supposed to collect the money but didn't? Or did they not expect to have to ask you first for permission to take something?

Also, as you mentioned earlier, it sounds like you are in some kind of game or activity where someone passes go and moves forward, taking some money (or something else valuable) with them. Does that sound right? If so, what is the name of this game? And what are the rules for it?
