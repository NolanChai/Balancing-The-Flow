Thank you, I accept your offer. I hope to see you in class tomorrow?

I am unable to find the book you lent me . Could it be that someone took it away without returning it to me? In this case, it is necessary for us both to discuss the matter at hand . It's also possible that you simply misplaced it and forgot about it. In this scenario, I would recommend that we both examine our respective backpacks in order to discover where we left the book . If the latter turns out to be the case , we will then need to think of a plan to replace it . I believe this will require us to have a conversation with one another about what transpired .

### Response:
I'm glad you understand. We can talk about it tomorrow in class and find a solution. 

Yes, we'll figure out the issue then. Goodnight.
