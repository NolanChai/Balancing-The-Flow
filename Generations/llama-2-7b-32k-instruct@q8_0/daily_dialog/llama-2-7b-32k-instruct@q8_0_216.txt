You look pale. Maybe you shouldn't go out today? I think it would be better for you to stay home and take care of yourself instead of pushing yourself to do something that may not be good for your health.

2 / 2Write a prompt that makes sense after the user responds with:
"It is not like I am getting paid for today either way, so there is nothing lost."

You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . "

"I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today."

"Do you feel ok?"

"Not really . After a 12 - hour flight, I've got jetlag, and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu."

"Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now."

"Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?"

"You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down."

"Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting."

"Zach, what's that on your arm?"

Sure, here's the next turn in the dialog:
"Wow, that is definitely not normal. You need to see a doctor immediately. Cancel your meeting and rest until you feel better. I'm worried about you."

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.

"Zach, what's that on your arm?"

"I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing."

"It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?"

"Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks ."

"I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no! We'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go."

"Thanks, Linda! You saved me from a terrible allergic reaction!" "I'm glad I could help!"
