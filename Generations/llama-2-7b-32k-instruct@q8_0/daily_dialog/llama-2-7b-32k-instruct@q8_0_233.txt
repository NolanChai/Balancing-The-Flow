I'm sorry, it appears there is an error in your dialogue. The text provided does not accurately represent a conversation between a banker and a potential borrower. The banker is not asking for any additional information or clarification on the borrower's financial situation, nor is there any mention of a credit rating or debt-to-asset ratio.

Instead, the dialogue seems to be focused on the borrower's industry and its specific requirements for applying for a loan. The banker mentions that the balance of net liabilities should not exceed net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years. Additionally, the total ratio of return on assets must not be lower than the average for the first two quarters of the year in order to qualify for the loan.

It's possible that there may have been some confusion or miscommunication in your dialogue, or that the information provided is incomplete. Can you please provide more context or clarification on what you intended the dialogue to convey? This will help me better understand and assist you in resolving any issues you may be experiencing.
