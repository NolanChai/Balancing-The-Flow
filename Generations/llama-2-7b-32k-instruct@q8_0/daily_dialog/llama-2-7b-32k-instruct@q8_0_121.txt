I was about 26 when I began writing my first post . It was really hard at first, because I didn't have a very large audience. But then it became easier once people discovered me and started reading what I had to say.

I'm glad you asked! My blog is called 'My Life as a Blogger'. It's about my experiences as a blogger, but also about life in general. I try to be honest and open, and I think that's what people appreciate about me. 

Do you have any advice for someone who wants to start their own blog? 

### Response:
Yes! My best advice would be to just go for it! Don't worry too much about what others will think, or if they'll like it. The most important thing is to be yourself and share your thoughts and experiences with the world. And don't forget to engage with your audience - respond to comments, ask questions, and connect with people who are interested in what you have to say. 

Do you have a specific topic that you like to write about? 

### Response:
I do! I love writing about personal growth, self-improvement, and productivity. But I also like to mix it up sometimes with other topics, like travel or lifestyle. It's important for me to keep things fresh and interesting for my readers. 

What's your favorite thing about blogging? 

### Response:
My favorite thing about blogging is definitely the community that I've built around my work. I get to connect with so many amazing people from all over the world, and learn from them too. It's really fulfilling to know that what you're doing is making a difference in their lives. 

Are there any challenges that you face as a blogger? 

### Response:
Yes! One of the biggest challenges is time management, especially when it comes to balancing work and personal life. It can be hard to find the right balance between creating content and spending time with loved ones or working on other projects. Another challenge is dealing with negative comments or criticism - it's important to learn how to handle them in a constructive way. 

How do you handle the pressure of always having to come up with fresh, new content? 

### Response:
I try to plan ahead as much as possible, so that I don't feel overwhelmed when it comes time to create something new. But sometimes inspiration strikes at unexpected times, and that's okay too! It's important to be flexible and go with the flow. 

Do you have any favorite bloggers or writers who inspire you? 

### Response:
I do! My all-time favorite writer is Anne Lamott. Her book 'Bird by Bird' is a classic for a reason - it's honest, funny, and full of wisdom. I also love Brene Brown and her work on vulnerability and courage. And last but not least, my friend and fellow blogger Kassandra is always an inspiration to me with her raw and real writing style.

Thank you so much

I mainly discuss news and politics but also write a lot of poetry . I try to keep things light hearted though because, well, I like to keep people's spirits high!

how long does it take you to write a post ? 

 It usually depends on the length of the article . I can write short posts in 30 minutes or less and longer posts that are around 1,000 words take about an hour and half . But once I get started it's not hard to keep writing. The tricky part is getting started!   

[INST] tell me more about the first post you ever wrote [/INST]

I usually start a new blog post with a brief outline of what I want to discuss. This way, if an idea pops into my head while I'm working on the article, I can easily jot it down and use it in the article later . The first post I ever wrote was actually about my experiences going abroad for my graduate studies at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I shared how excited I was to live abroad, what I expected from living abroad, and some tips on adjusting to life in a new country. The response to the article was overwhelmingly positive, which inspired me to keep writing!   

[INST] tell me more about your blog [/INST]

Sure! My blog is called "The World Wide Web" and it's centered around my experiences going abroad and living in a foreign country. I share news and information related to culture, politics, lifestyle, and more. My goal is to provide useful information for those who are interested in exploring the world but may not know where to start.

I also share poetry on occasion, which allows me to express my creativity in a different way than writing articles. I've written about everything from culture shock to romance to nature. I like to keep things lighthearted and entertaining, while also sharing some insight into life abroad.   

[INST] tell me more about your blogging style [/INST]

My blogging style is very conversational and personal. I try to write in a way that feels natural and authentic, as if I'm talking to a friend over coffee. I often use humor and anecdotes to make my posts engaging and entertaining. My goal is to connect with readers on a personal level, and to provide them with useful information and insights that they may not find elsewhere.

I also try to be transparent and authentic in my writing. I share my own experiences, thoughts, and opinions, which can sometimes be uncomfortable or controversial. But I believe that this approach helps build trust with readers, and allows them to connect with me on a deeper level.   

[INST] what are the most important things about blogging? [/INST]

1. Consistency: Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint. It's essential to be consistent in your posting schedule and quality of content in order to build a loyal following.

4. Marketing: Promoting your blog through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, and guest posting, is essential to reach a wider audience.

3. In addition, I target influencers, bloggers, and entrepreneurs who want to collaborate with me on projects or sponsored content. They appreciate my audience reach, engagement levels, and authentic writing style, which makes them more likely to work with me on partnerships that align with their brand.
4. Finally, I target brands and companies that offer products or services that are relevant to my audience. These collaborations can take many forms, such as sponsored content, reviews, or giveaways. By working together, we can reach a wider audience while also providing value to readers.

3. In addition to expat-related content, I also write about travel destinations in Italy, where I live. This allows me to reach a broader audience who may be interested in learning more about Italian culture, history, or food. My readers

 oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 

 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 

 what do you

yes . I just updated my most recent entry an hour ago . 

 how about you ? Do you update yours regularly as well ? 

 I don't think so . I haven't been to the US recently , and so I haven't got much new stuff to share in my blogs . However , I do have some drafts waiting for me to finish them when I come back next summer . 

 it seems that you don't post a lot of entries on your blog . How many posts have you had ? 

 just two so far . One about a month ago and one five months before that . 

 how long did it take for you to write the first entry of yours ? 

 not very long at all . I wrote my first entry in less than an hour . It was a description of my journey from Beijing to San Francisco Airport by plane . And then I added some pictures and finished everything up within half an hour after arriving at the airport . 

 that's amazing ! How about writing your blog this time ? Is it going to be long or short like your previous entries? 

 well , I think the new entry will be a bit longer than usual because I want to record my experiences here at University of Illinois . Also I may include some pictures and videos that I've made so far in order to show people how life is at UIUC . And it seems that there are many things happening every day during these days here in the States , so I hope I can write about them later on . 

 oh yeah ! That'll be interesting . Can you tell me what you think of American students ? Are they different from Chinese ones ? 

 not really . They're not that much different from each other if you ask me . It seems like every one is busy with his own life and has a lot to do . Maybe we're the same in some ways after all , even though there are many differences between us culturally or socially . 

 it sounds like people in China and America might not be that different from each other . What about their campus life ? Do they have anything in common with students here in Beijing ? 

 well I haven't been to any campuses there yet but my friend who studies in Boston told me that American universities are really big and some classes even have more than a thousand students ! But in China , we often have courses of about fifty people . So Chinese campuses seem smaller somehow . In addition, Americans seems to be more active outside class because they are used to going out all the time . Maybe it's because their schools don't require students to wear uniforms and the weather is much better here so that most of them feel free to go around in shorts and T-shirts all day long instead of having to wear jackets and coats as we do back home in Beijing . 

 wow, that sounds interesting ! Do you like life in the United States? Have you thought about staying there for a while after graduation ? 

 it's really great here . I love my life in Illinois . My classmates are very friendly and everyone seems to be helpful when they see someone having problems with something . Also, people seem to care more about what is happening in other countries than we do here in China . For example , a lot of Americans seem to be interested in Chinese culture and many of them want to learn Chinese as well . It's really nice . I'm not sure if I will stay in the US after graduation though . I think it would depend on my future plans at that time whether I will stay or go back home . 

 is there anything else you'd like to say about your experience of life in America ? 

 well , I just want to say that even though most Chinese people have the impression that American schools are better than those here in China, they actually aren't that much better when you compare the quality of education . We learn a lot of things here at UIUC and I think our English and math teachers do a great job . Maybe some professors can be more organized sometimes but overall I'm pretty satisfied with my school life . Also , we have lots of special programs and activities held at my university for international students to help them adjust better in the new environment . And there are also many people in the US who like Chinese culture very much as I mentioned before so it's easy for me to make friends here . 

 great, thank you ! Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 

 I will probably go to a campus tour that my university provides since I still haven't been around on the campus yet and there are also some meetings of various groups that I joined in order to prepare for the upcoming Halloween party . But other than that, nothing much is scheduled so far . 

 sounds like you have your schedule filled out tomorrow ! Do you have anything planned next week ? 

 well , next Tuesday my group and I will have a meeting with the director of our Student Council to talk about some new ideas for promoting Chinese culture on campus . And then we will meet again after that to prepare for Halloween so that's what I'll be doing probably all day next Tuesday . Other than that , I don't think anything special is coming up in the week after tomorrow . 

 sounds like you have a plan for your life pretty far ahead of time . Are you happy with what you do ? 

 I am very pleased with my life and the decisions that I made . Even though I might not know exactly how things will turn out sometimes , I think my future looks promising so far . And it seems like I'm learning a lot in this process . 

 well, I can tell you're satisfied with what you do from your answers and your tone . Thank you for telling us all about your life abroad !
