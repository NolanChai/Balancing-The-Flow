"How is your new dormitory ? "

" It's very nice . There are only four people, and those girls are very kind and friendly."

"Well, do you all major in the same subject?"

"No, the other three girls major in a computer science, and they can help me a lot with the computer operating."

"That's great! Are there any rules or regulations that you have to follow in the dormitory? For example, curfew hours or quiet hours?"

"Yes, we have some rules. For example, we should not make too much noise at night because the other residents might be sleeping."

"That makes sense. Do you have any shared amenities like a kitchen or laundry room? If so, do you all take turns using them, or does each person have their own space?"

"We have a small kitchen and we can cook together. We also share one washing machine, but we don't need to do laundry every day."

"That sounds like it will be fun! Do you think living in a dormitory is better than living off-campus? Why or why not?"

"Living in a dormitory is better for me because I can save more time and energy. Also, I don't have to worry about cleaning the house."

"That's great! It sounds like you're enjoying your new living situation. Is there anything else you would like to add or share with me?"

"No, that's all for now. Thank you for asking!"
