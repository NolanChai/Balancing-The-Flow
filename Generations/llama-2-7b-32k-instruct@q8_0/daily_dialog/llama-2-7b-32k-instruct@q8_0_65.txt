Sure! Here's another dialogue turn for you:

"Oh, I see what happened. Let me explain... we had a mix-up and thought we were meeting at the theatre when in fact we were supposed to meet at your place at five to seven. It seems like we have different understandings of our plan! Perhaps we should go over all the details again so that there's no confusion next time."

"I agree, let's make sure we are on the same page going forward. Can you tell me exactly when and where you want to meet?"

"Sure thing! I'll be at my place at five sharp, and we can grab some coffee or tea before heading over to the theatre."

"Perfect, I'll be there!"

"Excellent, see you then!"

Come in, come in! 
Hi Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there? 
I thought we were supposed to meet here. 
Don’ t you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn’t make sense to meet at the apartment. 
I’ m sorry. We must have misunderstood each other. 
Why don’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions? 
You're right. I am sorry. Let’s go and watch the movie.
