I'm so sorry, Susan! My bad. I must have misunderstood our plan. Let's go get something to eat afterward?

Sure! That sounds like a good idea. Would you like to grab some dinner at that new Italian place down the street?

Gary:  I don't think it was just me . The lights went out for a bit and I lost track of time. Are you sure we weren't supposed to meet at the park instead? 

Susan:  No, no. You were right before. We were definitely supposed to meet at the theater. I have no idea what happened. But maybe it's not a big deal. Let's just go on to dinner and enjoy ourselves. 

Gary:  Agreed! That sounds like a great plan. So, where should we eat?

I apologize for that mix-up. Let me check my schedule and see if we can reschedule our meeting in the near future. Would it be convenient for you to meet on Tuesday at seven? I'm free then, so I can make it work. Just let me know! 

I am looking forward to seeing that new film you wanted to check out. Let me know what time works best for you and we will set it up.
