"Oh dear, that's terrible. You shouldn't have seen him. It is dangerous."

"But what if he sees me ? What should I do?"

"Don't worry. He won't be able to find you here in the country. Just try not to think about it too much and hope for the best."

"Thank you for your advice . But I don't feel safe, that criminal is very dangerous."

"I understand. Please try to stay calm and keep yourself safe as much as possible. You can always contact the police if needed."

"Okay, I will do my best. Thanks again for your help."

"You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else. Take care now."
