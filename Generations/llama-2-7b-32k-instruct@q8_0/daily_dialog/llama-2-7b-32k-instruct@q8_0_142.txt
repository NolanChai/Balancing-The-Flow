Great. See you then.

I want to ask for a favor and I need your help with this.   

 Could you please call me tomorrow at around noon?  

 Sure, what for?  

 Well, I'm having my car repaired and I wonder whether they might have finished it already . So if I could get hold of the mechanic to check how things are going.  

 Sorry, I've just left the office. You know, you can call them directly. The number is on the note on your desk.  

OK, thanks a lot!

I'm glad we've managed to help each other out here. Thanks again. Good-bye.

Good luck with that. I hope it's not too expensive...
