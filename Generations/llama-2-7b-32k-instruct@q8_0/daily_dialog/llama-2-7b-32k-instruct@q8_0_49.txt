No, I am not in a position to allow you to view the apartment since no one has booked an appointment with me at this time .

I can only accommodate two people at a time due to COVID-19 guidelines and regulations. There are two apartments that are available for viewing on Tuesday from 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM and Thursday from 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM. If you can come at either of those times, I'd be happy to show you both properties .

I also have an available appointment on Wednesday morning but that is not a good time for me.

Okay, thanks.

I'm going to hang up and call back again in a little while. 

Bye!

(Background noise)

This is the third time that I've called this place . They won't let me view the apartment today though. The first two times they told me I needed to make an appointment but now it seems like they are making excuses and just not letting me in. 

I'm going to continue calling until I can get some answers on how long I have to wait for this appointment . 

(Background noise)

It would be helpful if you could give me a time frame of when you might be able to view the apartment or at least let me know what your busy schedule is. 

I'm going to call back in a little while and I hope they can get me an appointment for this afternoon. 

(Background noise)

It sounds like there are multiple apartments available but only one person on the phone . So that means that the lines may be busy, so it might take several tries before you can actually talk to someone who is free . 

I'm going to call back in a little while and I hope they have availability for today. 

(Background noise)

Okay. Bye.

How are you today ? 

 Great , thanks .
