Sure, here's the next turn in the dialog:

"I see. Unfortunately, that's not possible at this time. The apartment is currently occupied and we cannot allow visitors without proper authorization. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."

"That's okay . Is there anything else you can do for me today ?"

"I'm doing well, thanks. How about you? Can I help you with anything?"
"Yes, I would like to view the apartment for rent today."
"Sorry, but you can't view it today without making an appointment first."
"Why not? That seems very inconvenient."
"You have to make an appointment first. Please contact us through our website or phone number to schedule a viewing time that works for you."
"I see. Well, thank you for your help."
