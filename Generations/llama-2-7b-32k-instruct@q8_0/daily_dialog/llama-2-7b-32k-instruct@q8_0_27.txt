I was at work and suddenly realized that my head hurt very badly. And I felt dizzy too. Then all of the sudden it got even worse, and I couldn't get out of bed because I thought I would throw up if I moved my head . My mother is a doctor and she used to work in a hospital so we know how serious this kind of thing can be, and now my parents are really worried.

### Response:

Young man , your condition sounds pretty serious. I'll write down some questions for you to answer while we wait for the results from the laboratory tests . First, could you tell me what kind of job you do ? 

 Young man , have you ever been in a car accident or any other sort of physical trauma that might cause this type of injury ? 

 And finally , are you having any symptoms associated with it such as nausea and dizziness ? 

### Response:

Well, I'm not sure what you mean. I work in an office. And no, I haven't been in a car accident or anything like that. It just sort of hit me out of the blue .

### Response:

Okay , young man . We'll talk more about this as soon as we have some lab results to look at . Have you been taking any medication ? 

 Young man, I asked if you were taking any medications and not whether or not you should be taking any medications. 

### Response:

No, ma'am . I don't think so . And the headache is really bad now . It feels like someone is stabbing me in my head with a knife. 

### Response:

Okay . Well, let's wait and see what our lab tests show us. Do you have any symptoms associated with this condition at all ? Like fever or sore throat ? 

### Response:

No ma'am , nothing like that. It just came on suddenly. I don't really know how else to explain it, but if you can make me feel better and get rid of this headache, then I'd be really grateful .

### Response:

Okay young man, have your parents wait in the lobby while we talk for a few minutes. 

 Young man , is there any possibility that you might be pregnant ? 

### Response:

What? I'm just a kid ! How can I be pregnant ? That sounds ridiculous . Besides, my mother would have told me if I were pregnant. 

### Response:

Okay , young man . We'll wait for the test results to come back. We need to make sure that there isn't any underlying cause behind this condition before we can treat you effectively. So, let's go ahead and do those lab tests now. 

### Response:

Fine . I just want my headache to stop. Is there anything else I should know about ?

### Response:

All right young man. We'll have your parents wait for us in the lobby so we can discuss your test results when they come back. So, how is school going these days ? 

### Response:

I really don't know what else to tell you doctor . I just feel terrible and like my head is about to explode. Is this a common symptom of something serious or rare ?

### Response:

Young man, let me explain something to you. These kinds of injuries are actually quite common in people who work at desk jobs all day . We'll need to get you some tests and we'll have those results for you as soon as possible. But I suspect that your condition might be related to the long hours you spend hunched over a computer screen every day without taking any breaks. 

### Response:

Oh, okay. Well what can I do to make it better in the meantime ? Should I take some ibuprofen or something ?

### Response:

I'm sure you'll feel much better once we get those test results back and figure out what caused this condition . For now , you should try getting as much rest as possible. We'll have your parents wait in the lobby while I check your vital signs and take a look at your pupils for any indications of an underlying cause to your headache and dizziness.

### Response:

Young man, can you tell me if you've ever had any eye problems ? 

### Response:

Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?

### Response:

Okay, young man. Let me see how your pupils react to light now . This may take a few seconds. If one pupil is bigger than the other or if they don't react equally in bright light it might be an indication of nerve damage or stroke . 

### Response:

No ma'am, that didn't hurt at all . They both looked the same to me when you shined your light on them. But I do have some headaches now and then from working too hard in front of a computer screen without taking any breaks. 

### Response:

All right young man . I'm just trying to check for anything that might indicate an underlying cause to your symptoms that we can't see on the scan . 

### Response:

Okay doctor, my parents are waiting in the lobby. Is there anything else you want me to do ? 

### Response:

Young man, I'll have them bring you back to take a few more tests now that we know you might be suffering from eye strain. So let's go ahead and get that done. And then once we figure out the cause of your condition, we can get started on getting you better. 

### Response:

Okay doctor, whatever you want is fine by me . I'll just do my best to take care of myself and keep working as hard as I can until I feel better again.

### Response:

Young man , I'm going to have them bring you back in to take some more tests now that we know what the problem might be. You should still try resting for a few minutes while we wait . And then once we get those results, we can start on getting your condition under control so you feel better fast. 

### Response:

Okay, whatever you say doctor . I'll just do my best to keep working hard until I feel better again.

### Response:

Okay young man, let's go ahead and get that done now before we take care of that eye strain problem. We should be able to figure out what's causing this pretty quickly once you have those test results back . And then as soon as we know the cause of your condition , we can start treating it right away so you feel better fast. 

### Response:

Okay doctor, I guess that sounds like a good plan to me. Thank you for taking care of my problem and I really appreciate all your help . Goodbye Doctor

### Response:

Good bye young man. And remember if the headache still doesn't go away or gets any worse at all , please don't hesitate to give us a call back right away, okay? 

### Response:

I'll keep that in mind doctor . Goodbye

### Response:

Good bye young man. And remember if the headache still doesn't go away or gets any worse at all , please don't hesitate to give us a call back right away, okay? 

### Response:

Okay I will doctor. Bye for now

### Response:

### Response:

Okay doctor. Good bye

### Response:

### Response:

### Response:

Bye young man . And remember if the headache still doesn't go away or gets any worse at all , please don't hesitate to give us a call back right away, okay? 

### Response:

Okay doctor. I will definitely call you back immediately if my condition gets worse. Thank you for your help! Bye bye!

### Response:

### Response:

Okay doctor. I will call you again as soon as my condition gets worse. Thanks for looking after me and helping me feel better! Bye!

### Response:

Say' ah'?  

(The doctor looks down the patient's throat.) Oh, yes! That's it. He has acute bronchitis. Here are two prescriptions for medicine. Take this for your headache and that one to get rid of your stuffed-up nose . Come back in a week if you still have a cough or fever . 

### Response:
But doctor, I don't think so . 

Well, it's either take the medicine or go home ! You look like you've got pneumonia! Don't tell me what to do! 

### Response:
Yes, but... I don't have a cough. I haven't had one since yesterday morning. Besides, my throat doesn't hurt at all . 

### Response:
Now now! I know what I am talking about here! You better take the medicine or you will get pneumonia for sure. Come back in a week anyway . 

### Response:
All right then ... doctor, is my temperature high?  

(The doctor takes the patient's arm.) Oh yes! It's up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit . That means you have inflammation of the lining inside your nose and throat. You need lots of rest and plenty of water . Stop smoking! Get some sleep, boy! Come back in a week! Don't make me send for the police! 

### Response:
Very good doctor ... but I don't smoke. That means I'm healthy ?  

(The doctor writes something down.) Yes. You look healthy enough . But I had to see you, just in case. Now get outta here and let the next patient in! 

### Response:
All right then ... good-bye doctor . 

Good - bye, young man. You take care of yourself now.

Good morning. What seems to be the matter with you? 

 Good morning, doctor. I have a terrible headache. 

 All right, young man. Tell me how it got started. 

 Yesterday I had a runny nose. Now my nose is stuffed up. I have a sore throat. And I'm afraid I've got a temperature. I feel terrible. 

 Don't worry, young man. Let me give you an examination. First let me take a look at your throat. Open your mouth and say'ah'. 

 Ah. 

 Your throat is inflamed. And your tongue is heavily coated. You have all the symptoms of influenza. 

 What am I supposed to do then? 

 A good rest is all you need, and drink more water. I'll write you a prescription.
