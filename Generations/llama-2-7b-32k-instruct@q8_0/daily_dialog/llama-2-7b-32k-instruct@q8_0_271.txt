"Okay, I'll pass along the message. Is there anything in particular you want me to tell him?"

"Just that I tried calling and he didn't answer his phone."

"Sure, no problem. I can do that. What's your name please ? "

"It's Paul, but I'm just a friend. We don't want Bob to know I called."

"Got it. Thanks for using my services. Goodbye for now!"

"No worries! Have a great day!"

"Same to you!"

Hello. Is Bob there, please?

Hold on a second please. I'm sorry. He has gone out.

Oh. This is Paul. When will he be back?

He will be back at about seven o'clock.

Can I leave a message please?

Yes, certainly.

Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
