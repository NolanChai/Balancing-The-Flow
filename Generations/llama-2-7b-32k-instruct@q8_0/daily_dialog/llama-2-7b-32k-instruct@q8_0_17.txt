Sure! I'll be right back to check on your order and take a look at the menu if you'd like something else.

How would you like me to get that for you? What was your name again?

Hi, I'm Ryan. Nice to meet you. 

Oh my gosh, yogurt! Yes, please. I am so glad we have this in common because it is one of my favorite things. Now, let me think...I need a few minutes to decide if there is anything else I would like to order. Can you give me just a bit more time?

Sure, no problem. Let's talk about something fun. What do you do for work?

I am in charge of writing software for computers. It is kind of like magic. You know how they say that if you tell someone the same thing over and over again, eventually they start to believe it? Well, I basically do that with computer programs. It's fascinating and fun. And sometimes frustrating when something doesn't work right, but mostly I have a great time. What about you?

That sounds super cool! My name is Linda. I am an art teacher at the elementary school downtown. I love my job because kids are so creative and fun to teach. It's definitely different from when I was in school. 

Wow, that must be exciting! Do you have any hobbies outside of work? My husband and I like to play board games and bake bread together on the weekends. What about you? 

That sounds fun too! We're always looking for new recipes to try out at home. My family loves going to concerts downtown, especially if it's someone with a great voice. Have you been to many concerts before?

Not very many. I went to see Adele in concert when she first came out and that was really cool. She has an amazing voice! 

Wow, what a small world! Do you have any pets at home or any siblings? 

I do not have any pets yet but hope to soon. I'm married with two daughters, so life is busy! I also enjoy sewing and scrapbooking. What about you? 

That sounds like fun too. My husband and I used to go hiking on the weekends when our girls were little. Now that they are a bit older, we're looking forward to doing more of those with them in the fall. Oh my gosh...did you say sewing?! That is one of my favorite things to do! Have you ever been to the craft store in town called Stitchery? I am always there. They have so many yummy fabrics and supplies for crafters like us! 

Yes, that sounds fantastic! My family loves hiking too. We live right near a national park with lots of trails to explore. Have you been there yet? It is a beautiful place. 

No, I have not but it sounds amazing! Maybe someday we'll get there when the girls are a little older. How fun that you and your husband like to do the same things together as a family! That's so sweet. 

I think so too. So, what is it that you like to do for fun?

I love to read a lot! I have been wanting to get back into biking because my husband has a new one he bought me for my birthday. It will be nice to go on long rides together and explore the city. Do you like to bike? 

Oh yes, I love to ride too! We live near a big bike trail that is really popular with families who want to go out in groups. My daughter has been asking me about getting her own bike since she sees hers all the time when we go on rides together. What kind of books do you like to read?

Oh, I love mysteries! Especially ones where people are trying to figure out what happened and it is a puzzle to solve. I'm currently reading a really good one called The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Have you ever heard of him? 

No, I have not but I will look that up. My favorite author is Charles Dickens. His novels are always so engaging and full of intrigue. What about you? Do you like to travel?

Yes, I do! When we have some vacation time at the end of the school year we go somewhere as a family for 10 days. It's really nice because we can get out of town and explore new places together. Have you gone anywhere cool lately? We went to Italy last summer and it was amazing. The food is so good there!

That sounds incredible! I have not been out of the country in a long time, but I would love to go some day. My husband and I are looking at some trips for later this year. Maybe we'll do something fun together like that soon! What kinds of things do you like to do on vacation?

Well, as I mentioned my family loves going outdoors and trying new places to eat. We love exploring new cities and learning about their history too. It is always so interesting to see what people were like long ago and how they lived. My husband and I try to learn something new together on vacation every time we go away. What about you?

That sounds really fun! I have not been traveling much because my girls are still young but my husband and I do try to travel when we can. We went to a music festival in the desert last summer that was so much fun. It had tons of food trucks and musicians playing all night long. I bet you would love it! Have you ever been to any festivals?

No, I have not but they sound like such a great time! Do you go to any concerts in the city often? My family loves going to live music shows downtown at the arena. We saw Adele last month and it was amazing! 

That sounds really fun! Have you heard of an artist called Mumford & Sons? I think they are one of my husband's favorites right now but we have never been to a live show with them before. It looks like they will be playing here in the fall and I am hoping that we can get tickets for that! What kinds of music do you like to listen to at home?

Yes, I have heard of Mumford & Sons! They are actually from England, right? I love British folk rock music. We also love listening to country music when we're cooking or driving in the car together on long trips. Have you ever been to any live shows before?

Yes, but only with my family. My husband and I have never gone to see a concert alone yet! Maybe someday we will though. How fun that you get to go out more often than we do! What kinds of foods do you like to cook at home? 

I love baking bread and making pastries. Have you ever tried challah bread before? It is so delicious and can be used in many different ways. I'm thinking about trying some new recipes out this summer since it will be nice weather soon. What about you? Do you like to cook at home too? 

Oh my gosh, no! My husband does all the cooking because I am not very good at it. He is a great chef and makes me the best food ever! What do you like to cook for your family? 

I love making homemade pizza in our oven. We also make our own yogurt, which we enjoy with fresh fruit. It is really fun because you can add whatever flavors or toppings you want. My husband likes to grill out a lot during the summer too. How about you? Do you like to grill at home? 

Yes! We do that all the time when it is warm enough. I love grilling meat and vegetables on our little charcoal grill in the backyard. It is so much fun when it comes out of the freezer, still cold but cooked perfectly after being outside for a while. What about you? Do you have any pets at home?

No, unfortunately I don't yet. But I would love to have a dog or cat some day! My husband and I just need to find the right one that fits into our busy schedule. Maybe we will adopt one together soon! 

That sounds so fun! Do you have any hobbies outside of work or parenting? My family enjoys baking bread in the bread machine too. It's a great way to get everyone involved and make something delicious for dinner! What about you? Do you do anything creative at home? 

Yes, I love to sew! In fact, right now I am making a new quilt for my living room couch. It is going to be so pretty with all the colorful fabric and designs that I chose. I love using patterns but sometimes like to make up my own as well. Do you have any hobbies?

That sounds really fun! My family enjoys playing board games together too, especially on cold rainy days. We're thinking about getting a pool table or ping pong table for the basement soon so we can play more games
