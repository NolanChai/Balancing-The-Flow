Mary, it's good to see you! Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by. I am so glad that you decided to stop by! Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you. Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink?

"Sure, that would be great!" Mary replied, smiling warmly at her friend. "What would you like?"

"I'd love a cold glass of iced tea," Mary said with a smile.

Joshua looked at the clock and realized they had been gone for hours. It was already late and he needed to get home before his wife started asking questions. He cleared his throat and said, "Mary, we better be going."

"Of course," Mary replied, her face showing sadness at the thought of parting ways with her dear friend. "I'll walk you out to your car."

Joshua nodded, grateful for the gesture. As they walked out the door, he turned to Mary and said, "Thank you for having us over. It was nice to catch up."

Mary smiled and replied, "The pleasure was all ours, Joshua." With that, she closed the door behind them and went back inside to finish her drink. She couldn't believe how time had flown by so quickly. Mary knew that she would always cherish this special moment with her dear friends.

"I am glad to hear it ! Have a seat, and make yourself comfortable."

"I have just returned from the beach. It was a lovely day with my husband, Joshua. We had a great time."

"That sounds wonderful. I'm sure you both are very tired after your long day at the beach."

"Yes, we are quite exhausted. But it was well worth it!"

"I am glad to hear that. Now, I have some news for you. My daughter is getting married this weekend, and I wanted you to be one of her bridesmaids!"

"Oh my gosh! That's amazing! Of course, I would love to!"

"Excellent! So, we can start planning the bachelorette party now."

"Sounds like a plan. When do you want me to pick up the dress?"

"I was thinking that maybe tomorrow or the day after would work best. Would you be able to come by then?"

"Definitely! I'd love to help out with anything I can."

"Great! We'll talk more about it later. Let me show you where everything is in case you have any questions."

"That sounds good. Thank you so much for inviting me to be a bridesmaid!"

"You're quite welcome. It's the least I could do since you're one of my dearest friends."

Mary, it's good to see you! Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by. I am so glad that you decided to stop by! Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you. Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink? Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty. How about a little snack then? No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago. Well then, how is your family?

"Josh and I are doing well . Thanks for asking."

"That's good to hear! How has life been treating you?'

"Life has been great so far . What about you, Mary?"

"I'm happy as can be. I just got married last year, and it's been a wonderful experience."

"Congratulations! That is such exciting news! How did the wedding planning go?'

"It was a lot of work but worth it in the end."

"I bet it was . What kind of honeymoon did you take?'

"We went to Hawaii. It was amazing!"

'That sounds like so much fun! We will have to plan a trip there ourselves someday.'

'Absolutely. You should definitely go! Josh and I had such a great time, and we can't wait to return.'

"I'm glad you two are enjoying yourselves. That sounds like a perfect vacation spot."

"It sure is. We were worried that it would be too hot or rainy, but the weather was perfect.'

"That's great to hear! It sounds like you had a wonderful time in Hawaii.'

"Yes, we did. I can't wait for our next adventure together!'

"I agree with you there. Josh and I are always looking for new places to explore."

"That's good! Sometimes it can be nice to take a break from the same old thing.'

"Definitely. We have been thinking about taking a road trip through the Southwest sometime soon . What do you think of that?'

"Sounds like fun! I'm sure you will enjoy it immensely!'

'Thank you so much! I am glad we could share our experiences with each other.'

"Of course, that is what friends are for. We love hearing about your adventures.'

"I'm glad to hear it!'

'Well, we had better be going now . It was such a nice visit, Mary.'

"It sure has been. Thanks again for asking how our family is doing. You know how much we appreciate it.'

"Of course! We are always here if you need anything.'

"Thank you so much! It's good to have friends like the two of you around!'

"Anytime, Mary! It was great seeing you guys again. Take care!"

"You too! Bye for now!'

The conversation between Mary and Josh has come to an end. They both agreed that it had been a wonderful visit and look forward to their next adventure together.
