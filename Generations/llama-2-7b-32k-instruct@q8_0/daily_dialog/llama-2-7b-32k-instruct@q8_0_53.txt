We really missed seeing everyone this summer! We are glad you guys could make it. Let me get your drinks!  

(A) Oh, thanks ! That sounds great . Would you like something from the fridge? I'll check and see what we have ... 

### Response:
Oh, I would love some wine please !

Yes, please.
I would love some water.

Awesome! Do you like our place? How is the beach? Have you guys gone anywhere interesting this summer? Anything new and exciting happened with us while we were away from town?

Mary , I think it's great that you are going to have a party tonight . 

 You will really enjoy yourselves ! 

 Thank you so much for inviting me ! 

 Yes, Josh and I went on vacation to Florida this summer. It was great! We went parasailing, snorkeling, fishing, kayaking and even went scuba diving! 

 Wow that sounds like it was a lot of fun . Was the food good at the resort you stayed at?
Yes the food was very good and there were lots of different places to eat.  I didn't get sea sick once while we were out on the boat, unlike my husband! How about you guys? What have you been doing this summer? Anything fun or exciting happen while we were away?

We went camping up in the mountains for a week and had a great time. There was a lot of hiking involved which is not really Josh's thing but he managed to get through it okay. And I took some amazing photos of the sunset one night that turned out really well . Have you been doing anything fun or exciting this summer? 

Yes! We went to Joshua Tree for a few days, it was a lot of fun and we did some hiking there too. It's beautiful country side, and there were many different trails to explore. I think that camping trips are really great for couples and families. It is a good time to disconnect from the world, relax and enjoy each other's company . Have you done any traveling this summer? 

No we haven't been able to do much traveling, but hopefully soon! We had such a good time in Joshua Tree though, it really reminded us of how beautiful our country is. It was so cool to see all the different rock formations and cacti that were native to the area . I think we need to spend more time exploring this part of the world instead of going back to the same vacation spots every year. Have you guys spent much time traveling? 

Yes, we've been fortunate enough to do a lot of traveling over the years and it is definitely one of our favorite things to do . We've been to London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Prague, Barcelona, Rome, Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi, Goa, and several other cities. What have you guys done? 

Oh my gosh that is an amazing list of places! I've been to a few of those destinations as well: London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Tokyo, Shanghai and New Delhi. It was so much fun exploring new countries and cultures . What is one place you have never traveled to but really want to? 

I would like to go on safari in South Africa! I think that would be such an incredible adventure . What about you Josh, what's the most exciting trip you've taken? 

Well Mary, I actually just got back from a vacation to Costa Rica and it was amazing. We went zip lining in the jungle which was really fun. It was like flying! The views were incredible from up there. Have you guys tried that before? 

Yes, we have! We went on an African safari when we visited South Africa a couple of years ago and it is definitely one of the best experiences I've ever had. The most exciting part was seeing all of the animals in their natural habitat, it felt like we were looking into another world . Have you guys tried any extreme activities while traveling? 

I think that would be an incredible experience! It sounds very exhilarating . We did a lot of scuba diving when we visited Australia and Thailand which was also very exciting. I've always wanted to try bungee jumping, have you tried anything like that before? 

Yes! I've done it twice actually, once in New Zealand and once in Canada. It is definitely an adrenaline rush, but it's so much fun! It was hard to believe I was falling at first, but as soon as my feet left the platform I felt like a free bird! Have you guys tried any adventure activities? 

We have done a lot of traveling over the years and seen many places. There are still quite a few destinations we want to visit though . What's next on your bucket list? 

I think it would be really cool to go on safari in Africa, I've heard that it is an amazing experience. And I definitely want to try scuba diving again one of these days . Have you guys tried any new foods while traveling? 

We have! We visited a lot of different countries and had some interesting dishes. The most memorable ones were probably the food in Thailand, India, China, Italy, France and Japan. What is your favorite type of cuisine? 

Oh, I've got to say that my absolute favorite cuisines are Italian and French! I love the flavors and textures . I also really enjoy Japanese and Korean foods too because they combine so many different tastes in one dish. Have you guys had any good meals on your travels? 

Yes, we definitely have! We've been to Italy several times, which is probably my favorite place ever! I love the Italian food and the culture . They have such a rich history and delicious cuisine. What about you guys? Have you traveled to any of your favorite places yet ? 

I haven't visited Italy yet but it has always been on my list. I'm hoping we'll be able to make it there soon . We're actually going to Spain next month which will also be fun! What have you guys got planned for the rest of your summer? 

That sounds amazing! My husband and I are going to a concert in September and then we have our wedding anniversary coming up. It is hard to believe it has already been 10 years since we said "I do"! Do you remember when you had yours? 

Oh, that's right ! We got married at the end of August. That was 15 years ago now! Does time fly or what? What have been some of your favorite memories over the last decade ? 

Yes it does! It seems like just yesterday we were getting married and having a great honeymoon in Spain . And here we are 10 years later with our careers, house, car and kids . Time sure flies ! What have been some of your favorite memories over the last decade? 

My favorite memory over the past ten years is definitely becoming parents to our two children. They bring us so much joy every single day! And I also really enjoy cooking and baking for them. It's so rewarding to see their faces light up when they take a bite of my food! Have you guys tried any new recipes lately? 

Yes, we have! We love trying new restaurants as well as trying out new recipes at home . The other day we had grilled lamb chops with roasted vegetables and it was amazing! What are some of your favorite dishes to prepare? 

My husband loves cooking BBQ on the weekends. We've been trying a lot of different recipes from his family in Texas. I love going out to restaurants, but my favorite place to eat has always been Italian . My favorite dish is lasagne! What about you guys? 

I'm not much of a cook, although I do try my best ! But I'd have to say that my favorite thing to make at home is pizza. There's something so satisfying about creating your own delicious pizza right in your kitchen . What are some of your other hobbies? 

Mine too! We have a family pizza night every Friday evening and we always order a special pizza from the restaurant, it is one of our favorite traditions. Have you guys got any hobbies or interests ? 

I love to travel and I also enjoy reading when I have the time . But my main passion in life is being with my family! My husband is definitely my best friend and my two children are just incredible ! Do you have any hobbies or interests? 

Yes, I like to read as well. And I've recently started learning how to play the guitar! It's a lot of fun and it's really satisfying to be able to play some songs on my own . Have you guys had any interesting experiences with your kids lately? 

That sounds like so much fun! My children have started doing more things by themselves lately. They go to school in the morning, come home, help out around the house and do their own homework before bedtime . It's nice to be able to focus on other things now that they are older. How many children do you have? 

We only have one child right now but we hope to have more in the future.

No thanks, we just finished eating .

Mary :|

 Josh and I were at the beach earlier today as well . We saw you there ! 

 Oh my god , how was that even possible ?!?!  

We'll never be able to go back home now... 

You two are everywhere these days aren't you ? 

 You know, I really think you have been following us . 

 Oh well, it is good to see you nonetheless. 

 So Mary , how have you been doing recently ? Any news on the job hunt front ? 

Oh no, I haven't heard from anyone yet . But there is a new opening at the company where I used to work . If that doesn't pan out, then I am not sure what else there is out there. It has been difficult finding something decent paying for someone with my level of experience. 

Oh Mary , I know just how you feel . I have been job searching myself and it seems like the same thing over and over again .

I just got back from interviewing at a hotel in another state, but they didn't hire me . They said I was too qualified for the position though, so maybe something else will come along. 

You know what would be great ? If we could all work together again and start our own company ! We were always good when we worked together before ! It would be a great feeling to be in control of our own destiny once again. 

Hey Josh, can you believe how hard it is to find a job these days ? I don't know if this economy has hit us harder than most other people though . Mary was telling me that she hasn't had any luck finding a new job either . She did hear about an opening at the company where we used to work though. What do you think, Mary ? Maybe we could all start our own business together and be successful ! 

### Response:
It would be great to be back in control of our own destiny.

Josh :|

That sounds amazing . We should totally do that ! But we'd need a plan, Mary ! What did you have in mind ? 

We could start with a website for all of us to advertise our services and see what kind of demand there is out there . If people want what we offer, then we can create a team and get started. It would be really great to work together like this again ! What do you think Mary ? Josh , I agree with that whole-heartedly. We should also consider getting in touch with our old clients to see if they still need help on projects we did for them .

Mary :|

That's a good idea too, Josh and maybe we can use social media to find more people who need our services as well. 

I will contact the company where I used to work first since it is closer to home and then we can go from there. Do you guys have any specific skills that you would like to offer or specialize in ?  

### Response:
Mary :|

That sounds great, Josh! We could really do something with this. It would be amazing if we could get a lot of people interested and then all work together on different projects . If we do it right the first time we can make a huge impact in the industry ! 

Josh :|

Exactly, Mary! I'm so glad that you are excited about this. This is going to be an awesome thing for us to do and we will work well together ! 

Mary :|

I know I couldn't agree more Josh, and it would also help me out in the job search a lot too!  

### Response:
That sounds great, Mary. I think it would be awesome for all of us to work together and start our own company . It will really boost our resumes when we have our own business that we run together! 

I'll contact the people at the hotel where I interviewed earlier and let them know what we are doing so they can hire us if they need any help in the future. We could also offer our services to people in the industry we worked for previously since we are already familiar with their business model. 

Mary :|

That sounds like a great idea, Josh! I will contact my former supervisor and let him know what we are doing so he can recommend us to other companies if they need help . And that's also a good way to get clients for our new company . 

### Response:
Mary :|

Great ideas, Josh! That would really work out well. We will have to stay in touch with everyone we know and make sure we are doing okay financially since it will take some time to build up the business and get clients. But I think that if we do a good job, people will want us to help them more often. 

Josh :|

That's a great idea, Mary! And it would be really helpful for us too so we don't have to worry about money . We can also work on building up our business while still working at the hotel or another job if we need to for now until we make enough from our company. 

### Response:
Mary :|

That sounds great, Josh ! I think that it would be a good idea to stay in touch with people and let them know what we are doing and see how they can help us too . It's nice to have support when you are trying to start your own business because there is always more work to do than time to do it. 

Josh :|

I agree, Mary! And also if our new company starts to get a lot of clients we could hire other people to help us so that we don't have to sacrifice personal time with friends and family while building up the business . 

Mary :|

That sounds like a good idea as well, Josh ! I think that would be very helpful because it will allow us to work on our own business and still live our lives while making money doing so. We could also choose how much time we spend on projects for different clients and have more control over what we do with our days. 

### Response:
Mary :|

That's a really good point, Josh ! I think that would be awesome because it will help us to keep the business in order while also doing everything else that we want to do . We could even start by outsourcing tasks so we have more time for other things and then if the company gets bigger we can hire people. 

Josh :|

That's a good point, Mary! It would be nice to get help doing the stuff that doesn't interest us or we just don't like to do . We could outsource all the bookwork and accounting so we have more time for creative work. That sounds awesome and it will make things easier ! 

Mary :|

That does sound really great, Josh! I think that would be wonderful and would help us get our business off to a good start . We can also outsource the tasks that aren't our strengths or take care of them ourselves if we want. It will give us more time to focus on what we do best. 

### Response:
Mary :|

That sounds perfect, Josh! I think it would be great to have all these things in place before we get too busy and then regret not doing the work now . We should also try to make sure that we keep track of all our expenses so we know how much money is coming in and going out at any given time. 

Josh :|

That sounds awesome, Mary ! I think it would be really helpful for us to have a plan like this before the business gets too busy because then it will give us more room to make mistakes and still get things done . And also we can always change our ideas if we need to. 

Mary :|

That's so true, Josh! It would be great to know that we have everything in place before we start taking on more clients and projects because then it will help us stay organized as well as being prepared for any situation . We can always update our plan if something comes up later on. 

### Response:
Mary :|

That sounds great, Josh! I think that would be really helpful and will allow us to grow the business in a way we are comfortable with and not feel overwhelmed by it . We should also make sure that we stay within our budget and know how much money we have coming in so we can plan accordingly. 

Josh :|

That's true, Mary! And I think it would be really helpful for us to do things like having a business line of credit or maybe even getting some investors on board too . That way if our business starts to get bigger and we need more capital to grow faster then we can take care of that right away instead of waiting . 

Mary :|

That sounds good, Josh! It would be wonderful to have those options available to us so we don't feel like we are taking unnecessary risks with our business . We could also consider getting investors on board if our business starts to get bigger and more successful. That way it will help us make even more money for the

I am good and doing well thanks. I am sure that you are too ! I had no idea that Josh was coming to visit you today. Is he around here somewhere? 

Josh, it's great to see you! Are you hungry or thirsty at all? We just got done eating lunch. 

Mary and Josh , it's so good to see both of you again. I can't believe that this is the first time we have seen each other in over a year, but we are going to get together more often now.
