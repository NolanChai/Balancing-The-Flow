Sure, that sounds good! I'll have scrambled eggs, bacon, three pieces of toast, and a glass of water. And no, thank you, I don't want any lemon.  

[INST] How do i say this in spanish ?  [/INST]

"I would like some breakfast please," or "I'd like to order breakfast." This will depend on the region and dialect of Spanish being spoken.

Here are a few examples:

* In Mexico, you might say: "¿Puedo pedirle el desayuno, por favor?" (puh-EH-deehr YOHR ah-soon)
* In Central America or Colombia, you might say: "¿Pueden darme un desayuno, por favor?" (puh-EHN dah-rehm ah-soon)
* In Spain, you might say: "Quiero pedir el desayuno" (kwee-ah-roh YOHR ah-soon)
* In Argentina or other South American countries, you might say: "Quiero pedir un desayuno" (keh-YAH-roh ohn UN des-ah-yoon-oh)  

[INST] I'd like to order some coffee , and a glass of water . [/INST]

In Spanish, you could say: "Quiero pedir un café y agua." This translates to: "I want to order a coffee and water."

Here are a few more examples:

* In Mexico, you might say: "¿Puedo pedirle el café y el agua, por favor?" (puh-EH-deh YOHR ah-sohn)
* In Central America or Colombia, you might say: "¿Pueden darme un café y el agua, por favor?" (puh-ehN dah-rehm ah-sohn)
* In Spain, you might say: "Quiero pedir un café y el agua" (keh-YAH-roh ohn UN ah-dah-yoo-ahkah)
