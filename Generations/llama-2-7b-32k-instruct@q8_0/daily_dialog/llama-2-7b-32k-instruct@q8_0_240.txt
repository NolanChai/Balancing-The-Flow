Thank you. Are all these yours?

"No, I don't think so."

"Okay then . Would you like a plastic bag for your electronics? We have some extra ones in a box here."

"Yes, please."

"I'll take this one, and leave you with that one. You might need it later on, right?"

"Yes, I think so."

"All right. Would you like me to take your passport with the others or would you rather keep them together?

"Together please."

"Sure thing! Would you like a copy of these documents for your records? We can do that here at the airport. Or, if you're planning on leaving soon, I can give it to you when you check out."

"I think I'll keep them together and use my phone to take pictures of everything in case I need a copy later. Thanks so much for your help."

"No problem at all. Have a safe trip!"

"You too!"
