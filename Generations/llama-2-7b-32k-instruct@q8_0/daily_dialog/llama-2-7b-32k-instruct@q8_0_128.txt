"Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?"

" Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?"

" Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something ."

" I have a great idea of where you might like to go."

" Can we walk there ?"

"I love it! The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. There are plenty of tables inside, but it would be nice to eat outside if we can."

Please provide me with the next turn.
