That sounds good! Do you know if they are open for lunch today ? 

Yes, definitely, they're open until 2 pm on weekdays and brunch is served from 10 am to 4 pm on the weekends. I'd be happy to give them a call and make a reservation for you since it's so close by. How does that sound?

I know an awesome sandwich place, it's right around the corner! Would you like to grab a sandwich and then we can take a walk?

Let's meet up at this place in about 20 minutes. I'll be waiting for you outside.  

[INST] what if they say no [/INST]

If my friend says "no," I would understand their decision and respect it. I might ask if they have any other plans, or suggest a different time that might work better for them. It's important to be flexible and respectful when making new friends.  

[INST] what if the restaurant is too crowded [/INST]

If the restaurant is too crowded, we can try another place nearby. There are many restaurants in the area, so it's likely that we can find a spot that works for both of us. I would suggest looking at the menu online beforehand to see what options they have and how busy they look. We can also check if there's a wait time or if we can make reservations.

If we can't find a restaurant with availability, we can try alternative ways to spend our lunch break, like grabbing a drink at a nearby cafe or walking around the area to see what else is available. It's important to be open-minded and flexible when making new friends, as it may take some time to find common ground and plan activities that work for both of us.

I would still want to hang out with my friend and try to make a fun plan for our lunch break, even if things don't go exactly as planned. It's important to be supportive and understanding in these situations, and to find ways to enjoy each other's company despite any obstacles that may arise.
