Orville was at a bar with his friend Harold. Suddenly, Orville felt a sharp pain in his ear and realized Harold's mouth had been hanging off of his arm. He smacked Harold on the head to try to get him to stop bothering him. Harold's feeble jaw released from Orville's arm, but he continued to talk and laugh loudly, making a scene in the bar.
