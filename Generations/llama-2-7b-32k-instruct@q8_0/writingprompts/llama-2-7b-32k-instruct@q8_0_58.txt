The man continued walking through the garden, taking in the sights and sounds around him. He noticed that the sun was starting to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. The birds were singing their last songs of the day before settling down for the night, and the flowers were beginning to close up for the evening. As he walked through the garden, the man couldn't help but feel at peace. He felt as if he had finally found his way home after a long journey.
