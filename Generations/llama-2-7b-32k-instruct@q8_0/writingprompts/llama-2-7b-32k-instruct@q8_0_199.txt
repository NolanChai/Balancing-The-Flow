The sound of thunder filled the air, followed by a flash of lightning that illuminated the horizon. The wind howled like a pack of wolves, causing the trees to sway back and forth in the forest. Suddenly, there was a loud "boom" and a splitting pain inside my head. 
'' No!'' I frantically thought. '' No! Not again NO!'' 
 My vision went white and I felt dizzy, as if the world was spinning around me.

I stumbled towards the doorway leading to the hallway, feeling lightheaded and disoriented. I needed to get outside before it started raining. As I stepped onto the porch, the rain started to fall, pelting my skin like a thousand tiny sticks. The thunder growled louder and closer, and I could feel the ground shaking beneath my feet. 
I ran down the steps and into the yard, slipping on the wet grass as I went. The wind howled around me, making it difficult to breathe. The rain was coming down in torrents now, soaking everything in its path. I could see lightning flashing in the distance, illuminating the dark sky. 
I ran towards the shed at the end of the yard, where my mother kept the garden tools. I needed to take shelter and try to contact someone for help. As I reached the door, the lightning struck again, sending a jolt through my body. I heard a crackling sound as the power lines nearby sparked and snapped. 
I pulled open the shed's door and rushed inside, slamming it behind me. The walls were damp and dripping with water, but at least it was dry inside. I grabbed my phone from my pocket and tried to call for help, but the storm had knocked out power to our area. 
I sat down on a stool in the corner of the shed, feeling defeated. The rain continued to fall outside, louder than ever before. I could hear the trees creaking and cracking as they bended in the strong winds. I tried to calm my racing heart and take deep breaths, trying to steady myself. 
As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about all the things that had happened since yesterday. The storm seemed like a metaphor for everything that had gone wrong in my life recently. It felt like the world was falling apart around me, and I didn't know how to stop it. 
But despite all the chaos and destruction, there was also hope. In the midst of the storm, I could see a faint glimmer of light shining through the darkness. I knew that even in the toughest moments, there was always a chance for things to get better if we just hold on a little longer. 
So I sat there in the shed, surrounded by the noise and chaos of the storm, feeling both scared and comforted at the same time. I knew that whatever happened, I would get through it, just like I had gotten through everything else before. And maybe, just maybe, things would start to look up soon.
