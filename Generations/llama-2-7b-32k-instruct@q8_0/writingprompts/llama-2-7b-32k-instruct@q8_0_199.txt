My body trembled like it did when I was a child in an earthquake. 
I cried out for help from my father who had gone to work and told me not to worry. He said he would take care of things. 
But, that pain inside my head got worse with every passing second and the white world around me went black. The last thing I remember was a cold chill sweeping over me, like an icy wind. 
I heard voices but they seemed far away and muffled. They spoke of things not even meant for my ears. Things that had nothing to do with me at all. 
Then the world went silent and still, and I felt a strange sense of peace wash over me as it always did when I slipped into unconsciousness.  But this time, something was different. There was no darkness or discomfort, no pain that seemed to linger forever in the back of my head, just an empty feeling. It was a new kind of emptiness for me; one that seemed permanent and overwhelming. 
The world went black and I floated away from it like a leaf carried downstream by a gentle breeze on a sunny day. That's all I remember before I opened my eyes again to see the same familiar faces of my mother, father and brothers. They were all gathered around my bedside. My father had called for help, he said, but it was too late for me. 
I felt as though something heavy had been lifted from my chest; the kind of weight that had been crushing me for what seemed like an eternity. I felt free and light, almost as if a part of me had died away with the rest of me. My breathing was shallow and my limbs still tingled in spots but overall I felt calm and at peace. 
My mother cried and prayed over me while my father held my hand, looking at me with sadness etched into his eyes. He said that he would always love me no matter what and that he was proud of me for being such a brave girl. I tried to tell them not to be sad because everything felt fine now, but my tongue wouldn't move in the way I wanted it too, as if it belonged to someone else. 
My father told me I had been given another chance and that they would take care of everything for me. My mother promised she would stay with me forever. And then, as if on cue, there was a knock at the door and a young doctor entered. He said he would do whatever it took to help me get better. 
But I knew that nothing could be done; my brain had already been damaged beyond repair. My vision had returned but it was blurry and distorted, like trying to see through a fogged up mirror. And the headaches? They were constant and unbearable. But they were not as bad as before. They seemed to be melded into my mind with everything else, just another part of me now. 
And so I spent the next few days in that bed. I slept a lot but still had moments where I was fully awake. It felt like every second of my life was passing by at an exponential rate; each second a day, each minute a week and each hour a month. Time seemed to slow down when I wanted it to speed up so I could fix all the things that were wrong with me. 
As for my family, they spent most days and nights in the room with me, always there whenever I woke or needed anything at all. They fed me food and water but nothing tasted right anymore. Nothing gave me any pleasure anymore and no amount of painkillers could make them do that. My body had been weakened by that head injury so much that it couldn't even heal itself properly. 
In time, the people outside my house began to whisper about what happened to me in my home, as they always did with the families whose loved ones were injured or died at work. But no one said anything to us directly and I never heard the gossip firsthand. Even though everyone knew everything that had happened in our lives; it seemed like no one wanted to acknowledge it publicly. 
One day, my father decided enough was enough and he took me out of the house. He went through all of the proper channels for compensation from workman's comp but we still had a long road ahead of us if we wanted to actually get any money. I felt as though I didn't deserve it. Like everyone else, they would just use my brain damage and paralysis as an excuse to not give us anything at all. 
He took me to the local park where I had played with my brothers when I was a child. He sat me down on a bench and held both of my hands in his. It was sunny outside but the warmth didn't seem to reach me, as if it were blocked out by an invisible shield. 
He told me that he would make sure everything was okay. That they would get the compensation that I deserved and that I would be able to go back to school. He said that my future wasn't over and that there was still so much in life for me to do. I smiled up at him, trying to hide my fears about what would happen once I left his embrace. 
He held me close as we sat like this for a while, saying nothing more but just being with each other. Eventually he released me and stood up. He asked if I wanted to go home or stay out at the park some more. 
I wanted to go home because I had grown attached to that spot on the bench where my brothers used to play catch as children, feeling safe in their shadow. It seemed like a long time since I felt safe anywhere. But, after hesitating for just a moment, I said yes. 
My father smiled and we walked back home together, holding hands once more as though it had never been any other way. He promised that he would always be there for me in every way that he could; physically, mentally and emotionally. And I believed him, even if my brain didn't. 
As we got closer to the house, my father told me to remember something. That no matter what happened, no matter where life took me, I was never alone because I had them with me always. That they would always take care of me and that their love would be there for me forever. He said it as if he were promising me the world; a beautiful place where everything would be just as I wanted it to be. 
And when we reached home, my father opened up the front door for me like he used to every day before work. He told me to go inside and rest on the couch while he finished some paperwork at his desk in the living room. He said that he would call soon because he had a few more things to do with the lawyer they hired. I nodded and smiled up at him, watching as he walked away before shutting the door behind me. 
I closed my eyes as soon as the sound of the lock being clicked into place faded away; feeling safe once again for the first time in months. But as soon as that sense of safety left, a new fear began to creep over me. I tried not to let it take hold but I couldn't help it. It was too strong and it took over my mind until I finally opened my eyes to look out at the world outside my window once more. 
It seemed like an eternity had passed since that fateful day, yet nothing had changed in my family's house. The same brown brick house stood tall on the street where we lived for years. It still looked as warm and welcoming as it did the day I was born there, even if it felt like it had been dead to me inside for a long time now. 
A group of children played in the backyard with their mothers watching over them from the windows while the fathers grilled meat on the barbecue grills outside. Their laughter and smiles reminded me that not everyone's world had fallen apart; that some people still knew what it was like to feel safe and at home wherever they went. 
But, my mind kept drifting back to that day where everything seemed so distant. I replayed every moment of that terrible morning over in my head again and again until the memory seemed almost real once more. That's when my thoughts stopped on one particular scene. 
It was the moment before all of it happened; right at the end of my mother's prayer after everyone had said their goodbyes before work that day. I remember looking up at her face with so much love and appreciation in my eyes, thinking to myself how lucky I was to have such a kind, gentle and selfless person as a mother who would do anything for me or anyone else in this world. And just then, something caught my eye. 
There were three people standing on the sidewalk outside our house. They seemed out of place and confused, looking around them like they didn't belong there at all. The strangest thing about them was their clothes; they looked as if they had been worn a hundred years before but weren't old enough for that to be the case. 
As I watched this trio with my mother by my side, one of them stopped and picked up a small brown bag that lay on the cement outside our front door. I saw him look around nervously as if he was afraid someone would see
