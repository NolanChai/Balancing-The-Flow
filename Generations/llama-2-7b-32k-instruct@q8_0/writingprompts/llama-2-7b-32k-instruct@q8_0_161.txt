to move. 
 
 The room began spinning again as though the earth had stopped, then shifted on its axis.  
 My eyes opened  to a white wall that was spinning before my face . Then I realized it wasn't moving and I slowly slid out of bed. 
 
 What happened ? I thought . Then I recalled my first consciousness. 
 
 I had an appointment with the dentist this morning, but it never occurred to me that I could fall asleep there.  
 And then suddenly my body started hurting again and I remembered what had transpired . The last thing I can recall is getting out of bed to use the bathroom before going to work, but after that everything went blank until I awoke in this strange room surrounded by white walls and spinning. 
 
 Now I'm dizzy again. I've been there twice since then . 
 
 It was like a black hole took over my brain for a moment or two, but now it is just achy pain that remains after the initial jolt of fear.  
 I've got to get out of this place. 
 
 My body felt weak and I staggered to the door . 
 
 Thankfully, a nurse was standing outside my room. He guided me down the hallway until he saw someone at reception that he knew. 
 
 He motioned for them to take over, then asked if I could stand up on my own. 
 
 I tried but stumbled as soon as I put any weight on my right leg .  
 The nurse held me up while I rested against the wall. 
 
 I closed my eyes and took a breath of air that felt like it had been sucked out of me .  
 And then suddenly, when I opened my eyes, I saw someone holding a clipboard walk towards us with concern on her face. 
 
 She asked what was wrong and the nurse said they just woke up from a nap. 
 
 The nurse led me downstairs where there were chairs for waiting patients . He sat me in one while he went to get help for me. I could hear him talking over his radio .  
 They asked if they could take my blood pressure and pulse, which was hard because I couldn't feel anything on the right side of my body . 
 
 The doctor came and examined me while the nurse stood there. He said he wasn't sure what happened but that it sounded like a stroke or TIA. They told me to rest here for at least 24 hours then go home.  
 I was worried about my daughter since she has epilepsy and lives with me . So they took me to call her. She picked up the phone while we were waiting in the hallway.  
 The doctor asked what happened, and I told them it felt like a seizure but that's not why I was there for an appointment. Then my daughter said she'd heard of someone waking up from surgery with no memory. 
 
 He said, `` It sounds more like you had a stroke or TIA .'' They took me in to the room where they did tests on me and told me about what happened.  
 My dentist says my right middle cerebral artery is blocked, and if I'd waited until it completely stopped flowing, I would have died or become disabled. 
 
 As soon as they got done examining me, the nurse brought a wheelchair to take me to my car. The doctor told me not to drive home for at least two weeks and that they had called someone from AA for me since I wasn't sure how I'd get there safely .  
 On the way out, as he was putting me in the chair, the woman who had come to pick me up looked back at me and said something like, `You just woke up!', like she couldn't believe it. 
 
 My friend had called them on his cell phone when I didn't show up for work, and they said that he told them I was walking down the street.  
 They found out from a witness where I live, so they came here to check me out. It seems my car wasn't in the driveway yet so they went there first. When they finally got through talking to him, he told them what happened .   
 I'll never forget that day for as long as I live . The only thing that worries me is having another one of these things. 
 
 My doctor said I have a mild stroke or TIA and if it doesn't resolve itself in the next couple days they may give me something to dissolve the clot . I asked what happened to my dental work and he said that since he couldn't get into it, he had no choice but to leave it alone. 
 
 He told me to take aspirin every day which will keep my blood from clotting as easily, but not for the clogging itself . And when I asked if there was anything I could do differently, he said they didn't know what caused this to happen and that everyone is different so it's hard to tell me what I could have done differently. 
 
 He said sometimes people just don't know how to deal with their stress . They also gave me a blood thinner medication which I take orally, not an IV. 
 
 I feel better now but still tired . It was strange waking up in that place and then again this morning .  
 I had to be driven home by someone else since my car is at the dentist's office and they said it would be better if I didn't drive until two weeks from now.  
 
 So, here I am on Sunday afternoon, July 31st . I can't believe what happened this week . It seems like a bad dream that I hope will never happen again. 
 
 Thankfully no one else was in my house when it happened . If they had been, I could be dead right now.  
 A doctor from AA came to talk to me about my situation and give me some resources . He said he's seen people with the same thing that have died suddenly, but if I take care of myself, stay off work for two weeks, and take it easy, I should recover fully. 
 
 I still feel weak on the right side of my body, though it doesn't seem to affect my ability to walk .  
 They also took my blood pressure meds away because they had no reason to keep taking them since I'm not working and shouldn't be stressing out too much. 
 
 It seems like everything is just a bit off from normal, but still functionable, which makes me feel better than it did before .   
  
[INST] what happened in the dream ? [/INST]

I'm sorry, I don't have access to that information. However, I can tell you that the dreamer had a stroke or TIA and lost consciousness while at the dentist's office. When they regained consciousness, they were taken to a hospital where they spent 24 hours being checked out. The doctor said it was a mild stroke or TIA and gave them medication to help dissolve the clot in their brain and prevent further damage. They also advised them to take aspirin daily to help prevent future strokes.

The dreamer described feeling weak on the right side of their body, but they were still able to walk and did not have any major physical impairments. They said it was strange waking up in the hospital and then again a few days later, and that they hoped they would never experience something like this again. The doctor also advised them to stay off work for two weeks and take it easy to help their body recover fully.

Sure, here's a continuation of the dream:

After spending 24 hours at the hospital, the dreamer was able to go home but was advised by the doctor not to drive for two weeks and to take it easy. They said they would continue taking aspirin daily to help prevent future strokes. The dreamer described feeling a bit off from normal but still functionable, which made them feel better than they had felt before.

The dreamer also mentioned that a doctor from the American Automobile Association (AA) came to talk to them about their situation and gave them some resources. They said they've seen people with similar conditions who have died suddenly, but if the dreamer takes care of themselves, stays off work for two weeks, and takes it easy, they should recover fully.

The dreamer expressed gratitude towards the medical staff who had helped them and felt lucky that no one else was in their home when they experienced the stroke or TIA. They also mentioned that the experience made them appreciate life more and be thankful for each day they have.

Overall, it seems like the dreamer's health is improving and they are taking steps to ensure a full recovery. The incident serves as a reminder to take care of oneself both mentally and physically and to be mindful of one's own health and well-being.
