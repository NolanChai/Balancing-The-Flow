ours is a small home with few rooms and no attic or basement. There's nothing to hide behind if someone's trying to scare you . As far as you know there's nobody outside at this time of night. But that sound? That knock on your door? You heard it too clearly. It was a deliberate attempt to wake you up. A cruel trick, perhaps, played by a mean prankster. The worst part is you have no idea who is doing this or why they are doing this to you.
Now imagine that the sound comes again and again and again every night at three in the morning for the rest of your life. You can't go to sleep because there's always that knock on the door. It will never stop, and no one can tell you why it won't stop. You might think about calling a doctor or a priest but what would either one of them know? They couldn't cure this nighttime curse. Maybe they could help you to endure it, but that's not much comfort is it?
This was the situation of poor Mary Shelley when she wrote her famous novel Frankenstein in 1816. She was a young girl living in England and every night at three o-clock she would hear a loud knock on her door followed by the sound of heavy footsteps moving away. Everyone said it was the ghost of her dead mother, but no one could explain why it only appeared to her alone. It went on for years until Shelley finally decided to write about it in her novel. That's why Frankenstein is often called "The Nightmare that will not End".
In order to make the story of Frankenstein complete, Mary Shelly introduced a creature named Victor. This was based on the author himself, who had a brother named Henry. Henry was considered to be the handsome one and people were always comparing him with his ugly sister Mary. The monster created by Victor's scientific experiments became known as "The Creature from the Labyrinth" because he lived in a dark underground room where no one could see him. He would emerge at night to commit murders, and then hide again during the daytime so that the police wouldn't find out who he was.
This is why Frankenstein is called "The Nightmare That Will Not End". The monster continues his killing spree long after Victor dies because no one will listen when he begs to be heard. He knows that it would endanger innocent people if they learned about him so he has to keep silent. He can't tell anyone that he is the killer even though he wants to die. It's just another terrible thing that goes along with this curse .
One of Mary Shelley's most famous quotes was "I am human, and nothing human is foreign to me". This means that her monster was not a monster at all but a person who had been treated very badly by his creator. He deserved sympathy and understanding and yet he received nothing but cruelty in return.
Frankenstein's monster is often compared with the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The creature in this story was a split personality who lived two different lives at once. When he was not a doctor named Jekyll he was a sinister figure named Hyde who did terrible things.
Both these stories have the same theme: an innocent person is transformed into something evil by circumstances that are beyond his control. In Mary Shelley's novel, the monster's humanity has been stolen away from him by his creator and he becomes a victim of Victor's cruelty.
In conclusion, Mary Shelly wrote about her own personal nightmare when she wrote Frankenstein because she had experienced it herself for years. The curse that woke her up every night at three o-clock was the monster from Victor's labyrinth and he continues his killing spree long after Victor dies because no one will listen to him.
[INST] 简单写一篇关于迈尔·施莱利的生平介绍。 [/INST]

Mary Shelley was born in London, England on August 30, 1797. Her father, William Godwin, was a famous author and political philosopher. Mary's mother died when she was just 11 months old, leaving her father to raise her alone.

Mary grew up to be a beautiful and intelligent young woman who was often compared to her handsome older brother, Henry. Despite their differences in appearance, both children were highly intellectual and shared a love of literature. Mary was particularly drawn to Gothic novels, which featured dark and mysterious settings and characters.

In 1812, at the age of 14, Mary met Percy Shelley, who was two years older than her. Percy was the son of another famous author, Mary Wollstonecraft, who had passed away when he was just a baby. Mary and Percy fell in love and secretly married against their families' wishes in 1816.

Mary Shelley is best known for her novel "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus," which she wrote in 1817 when she was just 20 years old. The book tells the story of a scientist who creates a monster out of dead bodies and brings it to life. The creature, left without a creator, is forced to wander the earth and become a murderer.

Mary Shelley's life was filled with tragedy. In 1822, her husband drowned in a boating accident while sailing on Lake Geneva. Later, Mary suffered from poor health and financial difficulties. She died at the age of 53, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential authors of the Romantic era.
