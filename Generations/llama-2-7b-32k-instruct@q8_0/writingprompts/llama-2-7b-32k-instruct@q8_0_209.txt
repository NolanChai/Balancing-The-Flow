"No one's home," you say to yourself. You close your eyes again and try to go back to sleep. But the knocking continues. It's coming from the other side of the door. You can hear it, but no one's there.

You start to get up out of bed, feeling a little scared now. You grab your phone off the nightstand and press the button that turns on the light. The hallway is empty, and you can see the front door. It's closed, but not latched. You look at the peephole, but it's too dark to see anything.

You press your ear to the door, and you can hear someone trying to open it from the outside. You can also hear them muttering something that sounds like "Open up! We know you're in there!"

What do you do now? Do you open the door or ignore it?
