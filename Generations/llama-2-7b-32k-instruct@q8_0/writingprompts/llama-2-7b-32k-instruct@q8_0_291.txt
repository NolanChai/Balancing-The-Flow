stopped moving, waiting for me to come into its light. There was a door there too, and on it said "Door of Doors" in old runes. It had a big brass knocker that looked like it could smash my head open if I pounded it, which I would never do anyway so i walked right up and knocked. The sound echoed through the woods. Nothing happened. So I knocked again, but even louder this time. A voice boomed from within "Come in!" I opened the door and stepped inside, then closed it behind me. I looked around the room, the only thing there was a big chair with no arms in front of an empty fireplace, and next to it on the ground there were some old runes written on paper, which I picked up and read aloud "Welcome, traveler! I am the keeper of this door. I will grant you three wishes, but before you can make your first wish I must warn you of a great cost. If you do not close the door after using all three wishes, it will forever be locked shut and sealed. You will have to live inside with me as i am trapped here by my own curse. Do you accept this bargain?" I took a deep breath then replied "Yes." The door closed behind him. Then it opened again. He was gone but the voice from before said "Very well. First wish granted" and disappeared, leaving only the old runes in his place. The paper read "Wish 1: A coin to buy food for my stomach". I felt a bit of a coin appear in my pocket then i heard "First wish used." And it was gone. So i picked up the runes again and started reading them, but the voice said "Very well. First wish granted" and disappeared again. I finished reading them but when i looked down the coin was still there so i decided to try using another wish. But i couldn't figure out how to use it again, as nothing happened when i tried to read the runes a second time. So after thinking for a bit, I said "Well that sucked." then grabbed my backpack and left. Then the door closed behind me and locked itself shut, as promised. The voice echoed through the woods once more. "Very well. First wish granted" and disappeared forever. Wish 1: A coin to buy food for my stomach.''

The above story is about a person who goes into a mysterious door in the woods, which grants them three wishes but with a catch. The first wish is granted immediately, but the second one does not work. The person then leaves without using the third wish and the door closes behind them. The voice from the room tells the person that their first wish has been granted.

The person's name was Jack, he had gone into the woods to find some herbs for his mother who was sick. He found a strange looking door and decided to go inside. The voice asked him if he accepted the bargain and after hearing it he said yes. The voice then disappeared and granted his first wish which was food. But when Jack went to use another wish nothing happened, so he left without using the third one. When Jack got home he told his mother what had happened but she didn't believe him as he also lost a coin in the woods. Later that night Jack dreamt of the strange door and his mom became sick again so he decided to go back into the woods the next day. This time when he arrived he read all three wishes on the runes, and used his second wish for medicine for his mom. He then went back home but was told by his mom that there were no herbs in the forest anymore so he had to try other ways to cure her sickness. The voice from the room came back to Jack and said "Very well, your first two wishes have been granted" but before it disappeared it also said that they would meet again soon enough. As for the last wish, Jack never used it as his mom got better on its own.

Jack went back to the woods and looked around for any signs of life or herbs but he didn't find anything. He then heard a voice telling him that if he wanted something bad enough, he would get it. This was followed by another voice saying "Very well, your first two wishes have been granted". Jack then realized that the door had taken his second wish and gave it to his mom so she could be cured of her sickness. He now had only one wish left and he thought about what he wanted to use it for. The next day he decided to go back into the woods, this time with a plan. When Jack arrived at the door, he noticed that there was a small window on the side of it and through it he could see the room inside. He looked in and saw a big chair and some old runes written on paper. The voice from before boomed from within "Come in!" and Jack did as told. After reading all three wishes again, he used his first one for food, which worked just fine. His second wish was medicine, so when Jack got home he gave it to his mom who immediately felt better. His third and last wish was a bit harder to decide on but eventually he settled on a coin. He then left the door and never returned, as promised. The voice from before said "Very well, your first two wishes have been granted" and disappeared forever. Jack's story spread through the town like wildfire and people wanted to see this mysterious door for themselves. But when they went there all that was there was a closed door with old runes on it, nothing more.
