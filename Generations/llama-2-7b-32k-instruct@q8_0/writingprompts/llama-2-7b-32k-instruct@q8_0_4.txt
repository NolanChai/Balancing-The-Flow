 the scene before him, he was reminded of why he had come here; this would not be his last stop on an endless journey. The journey in itself had been a long one and he did not expect it to end anytime soon . His name was James McGregor, or at least that was what the people called him. He was only known by this name because it was easier than telling everyone where he came from. This was because it was so far away; you would need to take a train all the way down to England and then turn off it at Crewe . Then you would have to board another train that would travel for many hours until you reached Wales. Once there, you could ask anyone who knew of Machynlleth, because they would know where the town was located. After that, it was only about a mile or so of walking and suddenly, there he was; at the end of his journey stood the castle gates . The journey had been long and hard but now, for the first time, James McGregor was truly home . And what an odd place this was to be called home.

The road into town wound through fields that were only just starting to turn brown and there were cows and horses grazing everywhere. As he walked down it though, his steps began to speed up, for now he could see the castle walls looming before him . He could feel the excitement in his chest as he got closer because this was the moment he had been waiting so long for; James McGregor would finally be home at last.

The town of Machynlleth itself was a picturesque sight, with its houses built into the hillsides and its narrow streets that twisted and turned through the buildings . There were people everywhere, going about their daily business and it made him smile to think that they did not know his name or where he had come from . He would be able to blend in here; no one would give him a second thought. This was something he had longed for and now he felt as if the sky was the limit, for he was truly free .

Once he reached the gates of the castle, James McGregor passed through them and began to wander about this new land that awaited him . It smelled different from anywhere he had been before and there were cobblestone streets that felt like they belonged in a storybook; they looked as though they had not changed for hundreds of years. The buildings were old, but well-maintained, and it seemed as though this town had seen better days . It was only later on that he would learn just how true this statement really was; the truth of it would change his life forever in ways he never could have imagined.

As he wandered through the streets, he saw a sign with the name of a place written upon it . He could not read what language it was written in but it looked old and he found himself drawn to go inside and find out more about this place that would be his home for now on . When he entered, however, he quickly realized that it was not just any old place; it had been a school. And a very prestigious one at that, judging from the pictures of past students that were hung upon the walls . The sign outside said "Ysgol Uwchradd Dros y Waun" which meant something like "School for Gifted Children on the Heath". It was an odd name but as James McGregor looked around at all the books and the blackboards with the students' names written upon them, he felt a tingle of excitement. This school had been a place where children were taught to be the best they could be; it was truly something special and now he would be able to call it home .

James McGregor spent the rest of his day exploring this new land that awaited him, getting used to its strange smells and sounds and trying to make a life for himself here . It was not easy, but as he watched the sun set over the hills and the stars come out overhead, he knew that with hard work and determination, he could achieve anything. And so began his new adventure in this land far away from home; it would be one that would change him forever and make him the person he was meant to become .

And as for that place called Machynlleth? It would prove to be a special place indeed, but more on that later...
