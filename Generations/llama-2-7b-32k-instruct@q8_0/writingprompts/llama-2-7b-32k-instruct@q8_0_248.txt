1208 was an odd little place that seemed like a cross between a space station and the inside of a starship from the old shows or books. It had some features to allow it to be used as an emergency shelter for up to fifty people, but these were seldom used. Greg's shop was a combination general store, coffee shop, bar and meeting hall in one. 
 `` Hello stranger '' said the man at the counter. He looked like he hadn't had his morning coffee yet. That didn't bode well. 
`` Good day sir, what brings you here? Is there anything i can help you find today?'' asked Greg. His voice was as smooth and gentle as always. He kept a big smile on his face no matter how bad the situation seemed. It was an old habit from being in the army for too long, but it never failed to cheer people up when he used it right. 
`` I'm looking for some kind of fuel cell array or something like that. What do you have?'' replied the man at the counter. 
 `What does he mean by fuel cell array?' wondered Greg. He had no idea what this meant, but he was sure he could find it in a heartbeat. After all, he spent ten years building his store with every single thing that would be useful for people of this town. His place had everything from books to batteries and even the odd tool or two. 
`` I'll check on my computer'' replied Greg. He pulled out one of those old tablets with a screen so big it took up most of his counter space, but he was still able to use it easily. It looked like an antique now compared to modern ones, but it served its purpose well enough for the last ten years and he never needed anything better. 
Greg opened the app on his tablet that listed all of his goods with a lot of scrolling and clicking until he found what this guy was looking for. It took him about two minutes, but he pulled up everything the man had asked for: `Fuel Cell Array' in the search box and he saw every single thing he could possibly imagine that might fit the description. He put the first one into his shopping cart as the cheapest option, then added the second item from the list. 
`Here you are sir'' said Greg with a friendly smile. His hand hovered over the keyboard for just a moment before pressing `Checkout'. 
`` Thanks man, i'll take those two off your hands '' replied the guy at the counter. He pulled out some kind of device that looked like a credit card and handed it to Greg. 
Greg put the two items he sold on the counter in front of the man so he could see them clearly. The man reached into his pocket, took out the device, swiped it across one of the items and then the other. It was done in just a few seconds and the display told him how much the total cost was going to be. He handed over some more coins that looked like silver from way back when and Greg took them and gave him the two items as quickly as he could so they didn't have to wait too long. 
Greg had never been happier in his life until he saw a big smile on the customer's face once more after making that sale. The man said something along the lines of `thanks again dude, i appreciate it!'' and walked out of the store with a spring in his step. Greg smiled too and looked at the screen. It had taken him ten years to make a living from this place, but now he was finally starting to see the reward for all that hard work.

Greg owned a shop called Carrelhold 1208 in an area where people rarely came and lived. He sold a variety of products, including books, batteries, tools, and more. One day, he had a customer looking for some kind of fuel cell array or something like that. Greg was able to find what the man needed and made a sale. The customer left feeling happy, and Greg felt proud of his accomplishment. He had been running his shop for ten years, and this was the first time he had sold anything that big. It was a sign that all of his hard work was paying off.
