emode to test how people would handle killing other players. The results were fascinating and a little scary. Over time, Dr. Gahmstahp built up the difficulty of killing trolls and added more features such as the ability for humans to kill each other by consuming power and armor from their own trolls or those that have been killed. He also added things like an invisibility mode that would let players blend in with their surroundings if they wanted to hide, but it had its limitations. A human player who had just consumed a lot of power and was using the invisibility feature while a troll could still detect them. The gamemode had a built-in timer and a way for humans to communicate with one another. It also kept track of kills so that no one could cheat, as Dr. Gahmstahp frequently reminded his players. To encourage teamwork among the humans, he had made it so that all players would get a bonus if someone else was killed. All in all, he created an interesting system that challenged people to work together against an overwhelming foe. The only problem was that they were both asleep and had no idea what they were dreaming about. Dr. Gahmstahp didn't know whether to feel satisfied or disappointed at his failure. He had spent so much time working on this system, but it seemed like it had all been for nothing. But then he realized that it wasn't a complete waste of his time because he had still learned something valuable: humans can work together when they need to. Even though the game was just a dream, it had given him a new perspective on how people might be able to come together in real life if they put their minds to it. So even though it wasn't quite what he had originally hoped for, Dr. Gahmstahp still felt like his dream had been worth something after all. And maybe one day, he would finally be able to use the knowledge he gained from this strange dream and make a real-life game where people could work together to stop an overwhelming force. The screen pinged as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll in his dream. He had spent so much time working on it, and it was finally finished. It wasn't quite what he had originally hoped for, but it still worked. And maybe one day, he would be able to use the knowledge he gained from this strange dream and make a real-life game where people could work together to stop an overwhelming force. But until then, he would just have to keep on dreaming. The screen pinged again as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll in his dream.
