It isn't. It's just the reminder of the water usage monitor he installed with the old faucet. The one that tells him exactly how much time and water he wasted by not rinsing his brushes.  
 
  Clay sets the can down on the counter and stares at the drain, then back to the sink as if expecting something to happen.  He rubs a hand across the back of his neck. He doesn't like how tense his shoulders are getting or that he's being forced to think about this right now.  
 
 Clay doesn't even want to be having doubts, much less this particular set of doubts. The only reason he came inside was to get something out of the truck and head back into the woods before it got too dark. He doesn't like feeling trapped here like he has nowhere else to go.

 [i]Hey, I'm done with everything out here for the day. You ready?[/i]   
 
 He waits a beat and looks at the words on the screen before sending it off. The message doesn't feel like enough, but Sawyer probably won't appreciate much more than that anyway.  
Sawyer answers almost immediately, which only makes him feel even guiltier:   
 [i]Yeah, I'm ready when you are. We should head back soon to avoid getting caught out here after dark.[/i]   
 
 Clay stares at the message from Sawyer and wonders if he would have had more luck with just the one word. Or maybe two: [/i]

Clay carries an old tin can he uses to rinse brushes between use into the kitchen and turns the faucet on. The water batters the bottom of the can with the same ferocity as the doubt in his head.  "30 seconds," says a voice from the ceiling that I'm sure is Siri. Or at least that's how it feels to Clay. It would be nice if it were Siri.
