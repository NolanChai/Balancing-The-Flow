I'm not sure if this is a complete story or not, but here's what I have so far:

"God damnit, what was the name?"

I walked out of the front door of my office building, clearly frustrated by something. The sound of a Louis Armstrong trumpet cadenza was looping endlessly in my head. Stupid old man and his stupid music, I thought to myself as I stepped off the sidewalk onto the street.

I looked around for my car and saw that it was parked a few blocks away. As I started walking towards it, I noticed someone standing on the corner, staring at me. I quickly realized it was the same person who had been watching me from my office window earlier that day - the one with the red hair and freckles.

I didn't know what to make of it, but I felt a strange sense of unease. As I walked towards my car, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being followed.

When I got to my car, I noticed that someone had parked behind me and blocked my way. I looked around and saw no one - just my redheaded stalker standing on the corner, still watching me with a strange look in her eye.

I tried to move my car forward, but it was stuck. I got out of the vehicle and started yelling at the person behind me, demanding that they move their car so I could leave. But instead of moving, they just stared at me with a weird smile on their face.

I felt a cold sweat break out across my forehead as I realized what was happening - someone was playing a joke on me. But who? And why? The questions raced through my mind as I tried to figure out what to do next.

Suddenly, the sound of a Louis Armstrong trumpet cadenza filled the air again, and I knew that I had been played once more by this mysterious woman. I felt like an idiot for falling for it again, but I also couldn't help feeling a little bit amused at my own stupidity.

As I got back into my car, I looked over at the redheaded stalker on the corner one last time. She was still staring at me with that same strange look in her eye, and I felt a sudden pang of sympathy for her. Maybe she had just been playing a joke on me too, I thought to myself - maybe we were both just trying to make sense of the madness of this world.

I started my car up and pulled out into traffic, leaving the redheaded stalker behind me. As I drove away, the sound of the trumpet cadenza faded into the distance, but the memory of our encounter lingered on.

And so, my strange encounter with the redheaded stalker and her Louis Armstrong joke would go down in history as one of the most bizarre things that had ever happened to me - a strange and unexpected occurrence that I would never forget.
