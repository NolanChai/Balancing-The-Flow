Everyone is excited for Christmas. A little girl named Giselle is walking down a country road when she stumbles upon a baker's shop. The baker, Mr. Wickens, offers her a treat and she takes it gratefully. As Giselle begins to eat the sweet pastry, she notices that it has no taste at all. She tries some more, but it is still completely tasteless. She asks the baker if something is wrong, but he just brushes her off with a shrug and returns to his work. The next morning, Giselle wakes up to find herself surrounded by an assortment of pastries that are all exactly like hers from the day before - tasteless! She goes back to Mr. Wickens's shop, where he is baking more treats. He tries to brush her off again, but she insists that there must be something wrong with his recipe. Finally, after much persuasion, he allows her to taste one of his own pastries to see if it tastes right. As Giselle takes a bit, she is overwhelmed by the incredible sweetness and delicious flavor. She exclaims that there must be something wrong with her taste buds, but Mr. Wickens assures her that this is how all his pastries normally taste. He tries to sell Giselle some treats before she leaves, but she can't bring herself to eat them - they simply don't have the same appeal as those in her tasteless world.

As time passes, Giselle begins to forget about the strange events of that one day. However, she always carries a small bottle with her just in case someone offers her a pastry. One day, while visiting some friends, Giselle is offered a treat by another baker and decides to take it just in case something happens. As soon as she tastes it, she realizes that this is the same sweet taste that she had experienced at Mr. Wickens's shop. She tries one of her other friend's treats to confirm what she has realized - they all have the same intense flavor! The friends are confused by Giselle's reactions, but she explains that there is something wrong with bakers' tastes and that their pastries must be made without taste. She gives each of them some of her "tasteful" treats as a gift before leaving.

Giselle spends the rest of her life traveling from town to town, visiting every baker she can find and giving them the tasteless treats that she has made herself. She spreads the word about how important it is for bakers to keep their pastries without taste in order to ensure everyone's enjoyment. To this day, her legacy lives on as a reminder of the importance of quality in every profession.
