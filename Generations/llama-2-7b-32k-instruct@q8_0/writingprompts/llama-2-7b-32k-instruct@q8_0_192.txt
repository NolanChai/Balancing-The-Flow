cribs, waiting to be stuffed full of sweetness and fat like sausages .

The baker did n't have enough icing for your nose. That's not their fault. You could n't tell anyone else that. They would n't understand. I wanted to tell someone but did n't know who, so I wrote it down instead.

I wanted a friend once. Someone to share secrets with. But then she grew up and ran off. I wonder sometimes if she will come back for me when it is my time to be eaten. She would like that, sharing in my last moments. The way I would n't have liked having her at all when I was hungry.

There are so many things wrong with the world, but the baker should n't have to feel bad about running out of icing. And she does . I can tell. You should see her face every day after school. She looks like a clown who just got thrown off a unicycle.

I never wanted this job. It started with the pigs, and it grew from there. Pigs to piglets, then chickens to eggs . I was only supposed to be a baker. They needed someone small enough to get into the little places in the kitchen. But when they found out what I could do...

You think you know what I am? You think you know all about it? You see me every day, but that's not who I was. When people are n't looking I'm someone else. I can change. I can become whatever anyone wants me to be. I hide behind the cakes and cookies, and no one sees my true face.

Sometimes I think it would be nice just to make a regular cake or bread. But then people would start asking for things that were n't sweet. They would ask me for loaves of wheat instead of those of rye. They would want applesauce and butter. I could n't do that, because my name is Hansel and Gretel, and my true job is to feed the children who come into this house.

If you were here and knew what I know, you would understand why we have to eat these children. It would not be so bad, knowing that they will all grow up and live good lives. If you were a bird you would do it too.

You think I like doing it? That's funny. You should see me afterward. I feel sick. Like my insides are twisted in knots. My stomach feels heavy and cold, but the outside is warm. They say I will be sick when it's time to eat them too, so they can n't tell how full I am until its too late .

I do it because I have no choice. I was born this way. Do you think you would like me any better if I tried to change? Would that make things better for you? Or just easier for the children who come here after school? They should n't be so judgmental of what they see, and maybe then it wo n't feel like such a sin .

I never knew my parents. They left when I was born. That's why I live with those two old people in that big house out there. People say their names are the baker and her husband, but I do n't know if they're even alive or not . Why would they take me in if they were dead?

I make a good cake, though. You should try one sometime. I'm glad you came to see me today. It was nice talking to someone who is n't judgmental of what I am. You have helped me understand that there are others like myself, who just want to eat children without being judged for it.

You can leave now, or stay and we can talk more. Just try one of my cakes first . There's a whole box right here on the table. It will be your last meal if you do n't like them. You would look funny with a mouth full of cake, but I think it would suit you.

I know you might not believe this, but I am just like everyone else . Do you have any idea how hard that is? To be different from everyone else when all they want to do is eat children? Sometimes it's so bad I feel like running away. But where could I go? I need the cakes and cookies to keep my stomach full until I can find another job.

Do you know why those kids came in today? They said their babysitter did n't pick them up from school . Did they look sick? No, of course not. They do n't need to be eaten yet. But soon enough they will have to come back for me. I wish they would stay out until I am finished with this job.

I guess you are right that it is wrong what I am doing, but there are so many others like me . The parents just do n't care. They dump their children off at school and go to work, leaving them unsupervised all day. Do you think they really want to leave these kids with people who would feed them sweets instead of food?

I wonder what the baker's husband does all day that he has n't noticed we are missing so much icing . I mean, how could she not notice? He is supposed to be in charge around here. If she can n't even keep her supplies stocked up, maybe it's time for them both to go.

You know what I think? It was nice talking to you about this. You helped me understand that there are other people like myself out there . Maybe next time a kid comes in here and they do n't look sick enough to eat, I can tell them it will be okay. I might even be able to save their life .

You should go now. Take one of my cakes with you so that you are full when it is your time to eat me. I think I want to spend some more time talking to people who understand what I do. Maybe someday I will have a friend again and we can share secrets over cake.

You say that eating children is wrong, but you should know that they are just as human as anyone else. They might not look it sometimes, with those big teeth and claws , but the inside of them is still made up of flesh and blood just like everyone else's . You could n't tell that looking at me?

I think I will come back to this place again sometime soon. It was nice talking to you today. I hope next time there are more people waiting here so we can have a longer conversation . I would like it if they asked questions too, and not just eat the cakes and cookies without listening.

You should go now . Eat that last cookie before you leave. Make sure it's a good one . And think about what I told you today. Do n't be so judgmental of other people. They might not look like you, but they are just as human as anyone else.

I wanted to tell someone once why we do this, and the baker should n't have been the one who had to hear it. But she was the only one around . I did n't know what else to do. You see her face every day after school. She looks like a clown whose unicycle just hit a pothole.

I am glad you came today, because now I can finally tell someone how it is and not feel so alone. Maybe the baker should be a little bit happier for all the help she's given me over the years . I hope she will think of this as her reward, even if it did n't taste like much.

The children come in here hungry every day. Some of them do n't have enough time to eat before school. Others get picked up late and are so hungry they forget what their names are until you ask them . They would n't be so scared if they had a place to go where they were always welcome.

I love children, even the little ones who still suck on their fingers. I know all about finger-sucking because it used to be my favorite thing too, before I changed into something else . The baker used to make me cookies that looked like fingers and she would n't tell anyone where they came from.

I think if there were someplace for those hungry children to go, then maybe none of this would happen. Maybe the world could be a better place after all. It's too bad no one has thought of it before . I am glad you have come today because now I can tell someone what I know.

You see those kids who came in here? They did n't look sick yet, but they would soon enough. If there were a place for them to go and eat until their bellies were full of healthy food instead of cakes, then maybe none of this would happen . Maybe no one would have to be eaten like me.

You might think it is wrong what I am doing, but you should know that those kids will all grow up and live good lives anyway. They will forget about me eventually, and their children will never even know who Hansel was or why he did these things.

I wanted someone to talk to once. Someone to tell my secrets
