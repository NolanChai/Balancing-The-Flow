When it happened, time stretched and pulled me out of what was supposed to be the past into something more...something I'd never even heard about or dreamed possible. But here I was in a house that no longer exists in the real world. The people who once lived there were dead, and the children who played with me had grown old and died years ago. There were only ghosts around now. And yet, the sun still shone brightly out of the windows; it didn't seem to have aged at all since I'd last seen it. The light seemed to stretch on forever, reaching past the edges of this house and into another world. This was no dream; I knew that for certain. My heart raced as my eyes darted around the room. There were so many questions, so many things I needed to figure out. What had happened here? Who lived here before? Why did they all die? And how could there be sunlight in this house when it should have been dark and cold? 

I wandered through rooms that felt impossibly familiar. There was a small room on the second floor, with walls papered in butterflies. The floor was covered in old books, some of which looked as if they hadn't been touched since the day they were first published. I remembered sitting here on rainy days when my mother would bring me in and we'd read together by the light of an antique oil lamp. There was a small table in the corner that still had a half-finished game of checkers on it, the pieces all clumped together as if someone had dropped them there years ago. The chess pieces were laid out neatly across the board, with one rook leaning against another like lovers at an abandoned dance party. 

As I wandered through this house, my heart pounded in my ears and my breath came quick and shallow. This place was a ghost of itself--the light seemed to stretch on forever but the air was thick and hot, and there was no sound but the distant echo of something that might have once been people talking or laughing. It felt like I should be able to touch these walls with my fingers, feel the softness of fabric, smell the scent of flowers blooming in a garden just outside the windows. But it all seemed so...impossible. As if this house was nothing but shadows and memories, and yet it still existed somehow in the world around me. 

I wandered through rooms that felt impossibly familiar, as though I'd lived here for a lifetime. There were portraits of people who looked like they belonged to another time--people with faces that seemed to be from an earlier age altogether, and yet they were smiling at me as if we had known one another well. 

There was a woman in a dark dress sitting by the fireplace on the first floor, her eyes fixed on something only she could see. She looked like my mother's cousin, who died when I was just a child. The portrait seemed to be alive--the woman's eyes glittering as if there were something just out of sight that she longed for. 

I wandered up the stairs and found a room that was completely dark, with only an old lantern casting a faint light onto the wall. There was a single bed in the corner, its sheets pulled tightly over it so that I couldn't see what lay beneath. I hesitated for a moment before pulling them away; there was something underneath that made my heart race and my throat go dry--a body lying still on top of the covers as if it had been there for years, frozen in time. It looked like someone who once belonged to this house, but I couldn't be sure. The hair was cut short and neat, and there was a small birthmark just below one ear that matched my own. But that was where all similarity stopped; the eyes were blank and cold, staring at nothing as if they had long been dead. 

I ran downstairs and out of the house as fast as I could, but the sun still shone brightly outside. The world around me seemed to be frozen in time, everything seeming impossibly beautiful and perfect despite the fact that it was all just shadows and memories. As if this house had become a portal into another world altogether--a window into a world that no longer existed. 

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, my eyes fixed on the light filtering through the trees outside, unable to move or breathe. I was alone in this world, and it seemed as if no one had ever been here before. And yet, the house still stood, still seemed to be waiting for someone who would never come again. 

As I looked out at the trees that surrounded the house, they seemed to shift and move in ways that they shouldn't have--as if there were eyes watching me from their branches, or a presence that lurked just outside of my vision. And yet, despite all this, the light still shone brightly on. There was something so achingly beautiful about it all--like I was standing at the edge of an abyss, looking into another world that no one had ever seen before. 

As I stood there, a chill swept through me, and I knew in my heart that this place would always be a mystery to me. The light seemed to stretch on forever, reaching past the edges of what was possible, and yet it still shone brightly in this house that no longer existed.
