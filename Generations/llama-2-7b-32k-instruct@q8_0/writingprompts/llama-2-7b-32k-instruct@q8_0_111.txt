As if nothing in the universe was real or mattered. It's a strange sensation to put into words, but there you are: like everything was an illusion . Nothing had any meaning - it all felt like fake. Even my memories. I'd never even imagined feeling that way before. And then afterward? Well...I still remember how good it felt when the sun started coming up and shining through my window on a nice spring morning. I thought of my mom, and how happy she would be to see me so happy . I don't know why - but all of a sudden, everything made sense again. My body was burning with happiness! Everything mattered again! It was like being born anew.
