It's where the old go to die, just to the west of Old Novi, north of the sea, east of a forest and south of a lake. There are three main roads that lead there: Road 1, Road 2, and Road 3. Each road has its unique set of dangers and benefits, but all ultimately lead to the same destination: The Triangle of Despair.
