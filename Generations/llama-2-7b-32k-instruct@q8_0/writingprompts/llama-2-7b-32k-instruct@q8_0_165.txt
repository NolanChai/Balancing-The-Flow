the forest and east of the sea, 
 And there they just sit all day, 
 Watching the days pass them by. 
 
 You can see it from the air, 
 From high above in your airplane, 
 But once you land and try to drive out there, 
 You'll find that there is no way to get near. 
 It's just a place where nothing grows, 
 Just a sad little spot on the map, 
 And yet it seems to call to me, 
 For it's a place where I will someday be.  

[INST] The answer is Novi Sad [/INST]

Sure, here's another version of the poem with the correct answer:

Come take a trip with me, my friend,
To the land of despair we'll ascend.
It's a place where the old are sent,
Just to the north of old Novi Sad,
Where nothing will grow or succeed,
And yet it calls out to me,
For in that spot I'll someday be.

Come take a trip with me, my dear,
To the land of joy and cheer,
Where the sun always shines so bright,
And the people live in delight.
Novi Sad, it's a place of grace,
Where the people smile on every face,
In the streets they dance and play,
All day long, without a single sigh or sorrow.
The air is clean and pure,
As the children laugh with glee,
For in Novi Sad, life's so new,
And it's filled with endless delight for me.
