They sat on mismatched planks and discarded pallets that had been haphazardly placed to create seats along the length of the train tracks . There was a general sense of relief in this group of people who had managed to survive the first few weeks after the earthquake. People were eating out of cans, telling stories, laughing and crying together in that way that only comes from shared suffering. 
 
 As the sun set, the group grew silent as a single figure made their way towards the fire. He was tall and lanky with wild hair and clothes stained with engine grease. His name was Walt and he had been on his way home when the earthquake hit. He was headed back to the station where he worked, but that would have to wait now as everything around him lay in ruin . Walt sat down beside a group of three young women who were sewing patches onto their clothes with needles and thread taken from an abandoned store shelf. 
 
 As they talked, it became clear that these young women - whose names were Daisy, Rosie, and Lily respectively - had been travelling together for quite some time. They had seen a lot in the last few years. Their clothing was dirty and ragged but their spirits were unbroken. Walt listened as they shared stories about the cities that they'd passed through together and of the people who helped them along the way . 
 
 After some time, Daisy turned to Walt and said "I have something for you." She pulled out a worn leather wallet from her pocket. It was tattered at the seams and frayed around the edges but still had a little bit of money in it. "This is all we have left," she said, handing it to Walt. 
 
 Walt took the wallet gratefully and said "Thank you." He opened it up to find some worn bills and an old picture that looked like it had been taken years ago . It showed a young woman standing on top of a train car looking out over the city. A caption read "Rosie, 1982" in black marker. Walt looked at her face and recognized her immediately. She was one of the faces that he'd seen hanging from the billboards in downtown Los Angeles. He knew then what had happened . The earthquake had been so much worse than anyone could have imagined - it hadn't just destroyed the subway system, but everything else as well. 
 
 Walt felt a wave of sadness wash over him and he put the wallet back in Daisy's hand. "I don't need this," he said . "You three deserve it more than I do." 
 
 The young women looked at each other, confused. Rosie spoke up "Are you sure? It's not much but we can't just let you go without anything." 
 
 Walt shook his head and smiled "No really - this is all yours." He stood up to leave when he heard a voice behind him say "Walt, wait!" 
 
 He turned around to see Lily, the youngest of the three, holding out her hand. She had something hidden under her shirt that she pulled out slowly . It was a small box wrapped in tissue paper and tied with string . Inside were two rings - one gold, one silver. They'd been worn for many years but still sparkled in the light of the fire. 
 
 Lily looked up at Walt and said "This is what we found when we went searching through downtown Los Angeles to look for supplies." She handed him one ring - the gold one . 
 
 Walt took the ring, held it up to the firelight, and looked at it closely. It had been worn so often that the inscription inside had faded almost entirely away. All he could make out were the first few letters of the name "Kath". The other side of the ring was plain. 
 
 He looked up at Lily and said "What's this for?" 
 
 She took a deep breath and said "Kath and I used to be best friends, but things got tough back in downtown after the quake hit. We had been looking for each other all over LA trying to find out what happened to one another." 
 
 Daisy spoke up "We found her body in a collapsed building that we had to go through to get here . She was still wearing this ring so I guess she never made it out." 
 
 Walt looked down at the ring and said "Kath, you were one of the first people I saw after the quake hit downtown. You used to come into my shop every day and hang out with me in between jobs . I never got your name but I always liked talking to you." 
 
 Lily looked at him and said "I'm so glad that we finally found each other again Walt." She took the ring from him, slid it onto her own finger, and smiled. 
 
 Walt watched as they put the rings on each other's fingers - first Kath's gold ring on Lily's left hand, then Lily's silver ring on Kath's right . He felt tears in his eyes and said "I think it's time for me to head out now." 
 
 The young women watched him go until he was gone, but they knew that their friendship would never be broken. They would always have each other - even if the rest of the world had fallen apart around them.

Walt made his way back out into the darkness, feeling a little bit lighter than he had when he'd arrived. He knew that he would always have that moment to remember - the fire, the crackling conversations and the new friends he had made . He could see the lights of downtown Los Angeles in the distance and felt a pang of sadness at what lay ahead. But for now, all he wanted was to spend time with Kath's family and get some rest before whatever came next. 
 
As Walt approached the gate that marked the end of the tracks, he saw a figure standing there watching him. He knew right away who it was - it was Mr. Chang, the train conductor from his shop. He looked like he hadn't slept in days and his clothes were torn and dirty, just like everyone else's. But his eyes were full of a warmth that Walt hadn't seen in such a long time. 
 
Mr. Chang came towards him and said "I want to thank you Walt." He smiled and handed Walt a small box wrapped in a piece of newspaper . It was tied with twine, the same kind that he used for his own lunch every day. Mr. Chang said "This is all I have left - some food and a few supplies." 
 
 Walt opened up the box to find cans of tuna fish, a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a package of crackers, a small bottle of water, and a first aid kit. It was barely enough for one person but Mr. Chang had been keeping it hidden away just in case anyone came by that could use it. 
 
 Walt smiled at the conductor "I think we have something to talk about," he said . He led Mr. Chang over to a pile of rubble that had once been his shop and sat down beside him . As they talked, it became clear that they had more in common than either one of them could have imagined - both had lost their homes and families, but both still had hope for the future . 
 
 Mr. Chang spoke first "I'm glad that you made it out safely Walt . I tried to save as many people as I could." He sighed and said "But it just wasn't enough - there were so many of us, but we still couldn't save them all ." 
 
 Walt looked up at him and said "I know Mr. Chang - I was one of the lucky ones." He paused for a moment and then said "I found something though . It means the world to me." 
 
 Mr. Chang looked intrigued and asked "What did you find?" 
 
 Walt held up Kath's ring and said "This was all that I could salvage from my shop after everything else was gone . I didn't even know her last name, but she used to come in every day and we would talk about our days." He took a deep breath and continued "She got stuck downtown during the earthquake but we never found out what happened to her until now." 
 
 Mr. Chang looked at the ring and said "I remember her - she was always wearing that ring . She must have been really important to you if it meant so much." Walt nodded and said "Yeah, I guess she was." He smiled and said "It's a good thing to keep something from the past with you." 
 
 Mr. Chang looked back at Walt and said "I think that's true Walt ." The two of them sat there for a moment in silence, just looking at each other . Then they both stood up and shook hands
