 we were from different worlds. The girl sat down on the bench next to me and plopped a small purse on her lap. Her eyes caught mine again and held them in place. My face felt hot and I could n't think of anything to say or do so I did nothing.

"Hi, my name is Sara. What's your name?" The girl spoke as she looked straight into my eyes. She had a pretty smile that made me nervous. But her voice was soft and kind. My heart was racing in my chest and I could n't think of anything to say.

"I-i-im Jake," I stuttered. "Um, w-what do you want?" The girl smiled even brighter and leaned closer towards me. Her face was so close that I could feel her soft breath on my cheek as she spoke again.

"I just wanted to talk to you for a little bit. My friend said that you were always staring at beautiful women like me, but never talking to them. So here I am," Sara explained. She looked at me with a curious expression and waited for my response.

My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank. I could n't believe what was happening, this girl actually wanted to talk to me! "U-u-um, okay...," I stammered nervously. Sara giggled and leaned back in her seat. She looked at me with a mischievous smile.

"So, Jake. Do you have any hobbies? What do you like to do for fun?" she asked sweetly. I could n't believe it, this girl was actually interested in talking to me! My mind went blank again and I had trouble finding words to form a coherent sentence.

"Uh... well, uh-um, yeah, I like to read and stuff," I finally managed to say. Sara nodded, "That's nice. What do you like to read?" she asked sweetly. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I had no idea what to say.

"Um... books... you know, the kind with paper pages and words on them," I said, feeling embarrassed. Sara laughed softly, "That's a good answer! So do you have any favorite authors or books that you like?" she asked sweetly. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again.

"Uh... nope, um, not really," I said nervously. Sara looked at me with a curious expression and waited for me to say something else. I could n't think of anything else to say so I just shook my head. Sara giggled softly and looked back out at the water.

"That's okay, Jake," she said sweetly. "Do you have any siblings or pets?" she asked sweetly. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I had no idea what to say.

"N-n-no, um... I don't," I stuttered nervously. Sara nodded and looked at me with a curious expression. She waited for me to say something else but I could n't think of anything else to say. My mind went blank again as she talked about her own life. Her smile was contagious and I found myself getting lost in it.

"Well, Jake, that's all the questions I had for you. Would you like to know some fun facts about me?" Sara asked sweetly. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Um... sure, that would be great!" I said nervously. Sara smiled and began telling me fun facts about herself. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Wow, you have a great smile," I said stupidly. Sara giggled and blushed slightly. She smiled at me with a bright, friendly smile that made my heart race even faster. My mind went blank again as she talked about more fun facts about herself. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"So, Jake," Sara asked sweetly. "Would you like to go for a walk or something? Or maybe grab a bite to eat?" she offered sweetly. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Um... yeah, sure," I said nervously. Sara smiled and stood up from the bench. She offered me her hand and we walked off together. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"So, Jake," Sara said sweetly. "What do you like about me?" she asked as we walked. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Um... you're really pretty," I said stupidly. Sara giggled and blushed slightly. She smiled at me with a bright, friendly smile that made my heart race even faster. My mind went blank again as she talked about more fun facts about herself. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Thanks Jake," Sara said sweetly. "I like you too," she added with a bright, friendly smile that made my heart race even faster. My mind went blank again as we walked back to our respective homes. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"So, Jake," Sara said sweetly. "Would you like to go out with me sometime?" she asked as we stood outside my house. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Um... yeah, sure," I said nervously. Sara smiled and looked at me with a bright, friendly smile that made my heart race even faster. My mind went blank again as she talked about more fun facts about herself. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

"Great, Jake," Sara said sweetly. "I'll see you later." She smiled and waved goodbye before walking away. My heart raced even faster as my mind went blank again. I could n't think of anything else to say but I did n't want her to stop talking either.

As she walked away, I stood there frozen in place. My heart racing with excitement and nervousness, my mind still went blank. But in a good way this time. This was the best day of my life.

From that day on, I would see Sara everywhere we would bump into each other at school or work, she would always be friendly and sweet to me. We started hanging out together, we talked about our favorite books and movies, we went for walks and grabbed food together. Our relationship grew stronger every day.

One day, after a few months of dating, I finally worked up the courage to ask Sara to marry me. She said yes and we got married shortly afterwards. We had a beautiful wedding ceremony surrounded by our loved ones. As we danced at our reception, I could n't help but think about how far we had come from that fateful day on the bench by the lake.

As I looked into Sara's eyes, I knew that she was the love of my life and that I would be with her forever. My heart filled with so much joy and love as I thought about our future together. We were in this together, hand in hand, ready to face whatever life threw at us. And I could n't wait to see what adventures awaited us both.

The End. ðŸ’•

I was lying on the ground, my body feeling cold and lifeless. I could hear voices echoing around me, but they seemed far away and muffled. My eyes were closed, and it felt like I was in a dark cave, with no sense of light or warmth. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, and my eyelids flew open.

I found myself in a small, dimly lit room. The walls were bare, the floor was cold, and the only furniture was a small bed and a chair. My head was pounding, and I couldn't remember how I got here. There was a knock on
