The little man appeared to be asleep or unconscious, with his eyes closed and mouth open slightly. He had curly brown hair that hung over his face, and his clothes were rumpled and dirty. He seemed to be in his late teens or early twenties, but it was hard to tell given his age.

The strange thing about the little man is that he didn't seem to have a nose or mouth. His face appeared to be covered with a thin layer of hair, which made it difficult to see any facial features other than his eyes.

As I continued up the elevator, I couldn't help but feel curious about the little man and his presence in the corner. Was he homeless? Did he have mental health issues? What was going on with him that led him to take refuge in an elevator like this?

When we reached the top floor, I hesitated for a moment before stepping out of the elevator. The little man hadn't moved or made any noise during our ride, and I didn't want to disturb his rest if he was sleeping. But as I walked past him, I couldn't help but notice that there was something off about his appearance. His face seemed unnaturally smooth, almost plastic-like, and his eyes had a glassy, unblinking stare.

It wasn't until later that day, when I was back at my desk, that the little man started to haunt me. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease he'd left behind, like something wasn't quite right about him. I found myself constantly thinking about what had happened in the elevator and why I hadn't done more to help him.

As time went on, I started to notice strange occurrences happening around me. Small things would go missing or seem out of place without any explanation. And sometimes, when I was alone in my office, I would catch a glimpse of someone staring at me from the corner of my eye, only to find no one there when I turned around.

I began to suspect that the strange little man I saw on the elevator might be responsible for these occurrences, but I couldn't prove it. And as time passed, the memories of our encounter became fainter and more vague until I eventually forgot all about him. Until one day, when a knock at my door changed everything.

A man stood in front of me, dressed in a sharp suit with a perfectly trimmed beard. He introduced himself as Detective Olsen from the local police department, and informed me that they had received multiple reports of missing persons matching my description. They'd tracked me down through my work address, and asked if I remembered anything unusual happening on the day of our elevator encounter.

As I sat in front of him, feeling a strange sense of unease wash over me, he produced a picture of the man I had seen in the corner of the elevator. It was an exact match to the little man I'd encountered that day. The detective explained that he was investigating a series of missing persons cases that all seemed to be connected to one another, and that my encounter with him might be relevant to their investigation.

I felt a chill run down my spine as I looked at the photo. It was impossible to deny that the man in the picture was the same person I'd seen on the elevator. But how could someone who didn't seem to exist just vanish off the face of the earth, leaving no trace or clue behind?

As Detective Olsen and I exchanged information, I couldn't help but feel like I was missing something important. Like there was a piece of the puzzle that was right in front of me, but I just couldn't put it together. And as he walked out of my office, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were both being watched by someone or something.

That night, I couldn't sleep. My mind raced with questions and doubts, as I tried to make sense of what had happened and why. Was it possible that the little man was really there, but I just didn't see him? Or was he a figment of my imagination, created by my own subconscious to help me deal with the strange occurrences happening around me?

As I lay in bed, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. And as I closed my eyes, I felt like I was being pulled into a dream, where all of the questions and doubts I had were waiting for me to answer.

I woke up with a start, feeling cold sweat dripping down my back. The room was dark and silent, except for the soft glow of the digital clock on the nightstand. It was 3:00 am, and I could feel a chill in the air that seemed to penetrate my very being.

As I sat up in bed, my eyes met the figure standing in the corner of the room. The little man from the elevator stared back at me with an unblinking gaze, his face contorted into a grotesque grin. And as he reached out his hand towards me, I felt a chill that ran down my spine like ice water.

"Welcome to the party, my dear," he said in a voice that seemed to echo through the very core of my being. "I've been waiting for you."

I tried to scream but could only manage a whimper as I felt myself being pulled towards him. The room around me faded away, and all I could see was his twisted face and the glowing eyes that seemed to pierce through my very soul. And as I felt his cold fingers grasping at my arm, I knew that this was no dream.

It was a nightmare from which there was no waking. A nightmare that would haunt me for years to come, as I struggled to comprehend the horror that awaited me in the depths of my own mind.
