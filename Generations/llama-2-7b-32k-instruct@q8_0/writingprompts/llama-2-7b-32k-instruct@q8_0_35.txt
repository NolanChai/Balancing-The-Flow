It was an ordinary day as days go. The weather was sunny and warm. We had breakfast, took our dog for a walk, then did some grocery shopping before lunchtime. As we drove to the store, however, it became apparent that something unusual was happening in the sky overhead. There were large black birds circling about, their cawing so loud it was almost deafening. The birds seemed to be attacking something on the ground, and I realized there must have been a huge flock of locusts flying nearby
