Sitting in the dark now with only the glow from the screen of my phone and the hum of the fans keeping time, I stare out the window. The sun is setting over the mountains to the west. It's a beautiful view--but then again, when hasn't it been? If anyone asks you what it was like in here before, just tell them: "Pretty". 
  
 We had five days of peace, five days of waiting for rescue before this storm hit. Now there are two of us left--myself and a pilot out on the deck with his binoculars trained toward the horizon. There was no warning; one moment we were getting ready to take off when the wind picked up and sand began to blow against the windows, blocking our view of anything but the whiteout outside. The power went out instantly as did the comms, leaving us cut off from any form of contact with the rest of the world. 
  
 There's something almost hypnotic about listening to it--the wind and sand, how they just swirl together, a relentless vortex that seems like it could go on forever. It'll strip everything bare in its path if we don't leave soon. But where can we go? 
  
 I'm not sure if the pilot has heard anything from mission control or if he knows what to do. We have enough food for a month, but that won't get us anywhere without power and fuel. It's just sitting there in the hold of this ship, collecting dust. If only we had something that could help us lift off--a rocket booster, maybe? I don't know if it would have been enough to make a difference, but at least then we might not still be here now. 
  
 The last time I was out on the deck, he showed me some kind of radio he'd found. It had an emergency frequency that was supposed to reach all kinds of satellites and things, but it didn't do us any good--we couldn't get a single reply from anyone. 
  
 And then we lost power completely. It wasn't just lights out, it was no heat, no air either. We were trapped in the dark. The only thing keeping me alive is the oxygen mask strapped to my face and the batteries that keep it running. I can breathe normally for now--the atmosphere outside would kill anyone not wearing this thing, but even this thing won't last forever. 
  
 What else could have possibly gone wrong? Why me? This was supposed to be a routine trip out here: take some readings, drop off a package from mission control, and come back--it should have been simple enough, really. But no one is coming for us now. 
  
 And I can't even tell time anymore, because the instruments in this ship are all broken. Maybe it's only an hour since those last two explosions, or maybe they happened days ago: I don't know. Time seems to have lost all meaning. I just wait and wait for that sound of engines fading off into the distance. 
  
 Or at least that's what I would like to think is happening. The truth might be much worse. I can only sit here now, waiting--and wondering if we will ever make it out alive.
