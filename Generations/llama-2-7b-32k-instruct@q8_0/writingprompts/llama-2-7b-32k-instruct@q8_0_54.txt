They're alive! After millions of years in hibernation the astronauts are finally on Earth and can't believe what they see; a beautiful blue planet that seemed to be waiting for them. The two astronauts, who have spent their entire lives on ships or space stations, have never seen anything like Earth before. They look at each other with astonishment, feeling as if they've been brought back to life after so many years in hibernation.
