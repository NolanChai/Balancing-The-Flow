Conflict without Victory
The forces of Ol and of the Scorched King were a series of escalating atrocities. Each battle an attempt to cause the worst terror, suffering, and death among civilians. The two armies were like two sides of the same coin, each determined to prove that theirs was superiority in battle. The only way to stop this conflict would be for one side or the other to be victorious in battle, but neither side was willing to give up. The conflict continued for years, with no end in sight.
