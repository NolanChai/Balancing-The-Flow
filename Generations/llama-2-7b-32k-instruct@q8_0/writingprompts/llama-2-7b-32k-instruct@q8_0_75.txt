The Battle of Chasca's Wood  
After several months of waiting, Lord Darnath Rendragon was called into council by his advisors. The army had been restless for a long time and the Scorched King's forces were growing stronger with each passing day. Many in Ol suggested that they should attack at once, but Lord Darnath did not agree. He knew from history that it would take an entire year for their forces to fully prepare themselves. They must also take into consideration the possibility of a betrayal by one of the kings allies. For all they knew, the Scorched King's army was waiting for just such an opportunity to attack Ol before it was ready to face him in battle.
  
 As Lord Darnath waited for news from his scouts, he received word that there had been a major breach of security at one of their outlying posts on the edge of Chasca's Wood. The report suggested that the Scorched King and his army were marching towards the border of Ol.
  
 Lord Darnath was infuriated by this news, he knew that if they did not act quickly, it would be too late to stop them before they reached the border. He knew that at the moment there were only 500 soldiers stationed at Chasca's Wood and their army could easily overrun them. His advisors suggested that a small party of knights should be sent out to delay the Scorched King, but Lord Darnath rejected this idea. They would never be able to stop him in time. He quickly made his decision and ordered the city gates sealed shut, preparing himself and the soldiers of Ol for war.
  
 As the sun began to rise over Chasca's Wood the next day, the army of Ol was ready to march out and meet their enemy. The sun had just risen over the horizon when a messenger came running in with news that the Scorched King's army was on the verge of victory, having slaughtered the garrison at Chasca's Wood. Lord Darnath ordered his soldiers to keep up their morale and prepare for battle. He also called out for any knights who would like to join them in combat against the forces of evil.
  
 As the sun continued to rise, it became clear that the Scorched King was indeed on the verge of victory. His army had slaughtered every soldier stationed at Chasca's Wood and was now marching towards the city gates of Ol itself. The Ol soldiers were outnumbered and outmatched. It seemed as if nothing could stop them.
