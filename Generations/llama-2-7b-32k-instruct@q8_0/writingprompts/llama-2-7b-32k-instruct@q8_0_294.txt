It is a game that changes with the seasons 
 
 It has its own schedule to follow 
 
 It is time for spring now and everything must grow 
 
 But beware, for soon summer will come along 
 
 And you can't plant seeds in the burning glow 
 
 Use only these three objects with this cave 
 
 A wick lantern, a sieve, and an iron pot 
 
 Together they must work as one unit 
 
 They will help you solve the mystery of this cave
