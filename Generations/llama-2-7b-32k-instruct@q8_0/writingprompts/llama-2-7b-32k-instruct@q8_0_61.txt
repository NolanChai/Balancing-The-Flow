1. clock (Document[82]):"I looked at my bedside table and saw that it was about 5:30 . It's not exactly time to wake up yet, but I figured I might as well check the weather on my phone before going back to sleep."

2. phone (Document[82]):"I grabbed my phone off of the nightstand and looked at it . The clock read 5:30 . I groaned a little bit and then realized that today was the day that my boss would be in our office for the first time since we've been back to in person . 
 
 I checked out my email quickly and then decided to go check on how much stuff my wife had done while I slept."

3. bathroom (Document[82]):"I walked downstairs to the bathroom and let myself into the downstairs bathroom . It was a simple, white tiled room with just enough space for a sink and a small toilet . There was no vanity or anything that fancy--it's not like we have a huge house or something."

4. pee (Document[82]):"I took off my pajamas, hopped into the shower stall, and started to pee .  I tried not to think too much about it, but when you get older, it gets harder to go . You know? Like, you have to hold it in or else you won't be able to finish."

5. peed (Document[82]):"I finished up and started washing myself off . I like a long shower--I'm not afraid of getting clean . Sometimes when I am home alone, I even sing in the shower . 
 
 But I wasn't singing now."

6. boss (Document[82]):"I finished up and then walked into my office . My wife was already there--she had apparently been working away for a while, but she seemed to be in good spirits . She smiled at me and said hello as I came out of the bathroom."

7. coffee (Document[82]):"We chatted about work for a bit before heading downstairs for some breakfast . I made myself a cup of coffee--I'm not much of a tea guy, so coffee is really my only option . It was pretty good."

8. stomach (Document[82]):"My boss and I headed back up to our office . He started going over the documents that he had brought with him, which were mostly related to some work that we needed to do on a project that we're currently working on together."

9. phone (Document[82]):"I finished up my coffee and put away my cup . I checked my phone for a bit and saw that I had missed some emails . 
 
 It seems like these days, there are always people trying to sell you something or get your personal information in the emails that you receive."

10. wife (Document[82]):"I finished up and put away my phone . My wife and I then talked about a few more things before going back downstairs to get some breakfast."

11. temperature (Document[82]):"My boss left for the day, so it was just me and the cat for the rest of the morning . After checking on my wife's progress, I went into the bathroom again--I had forgotten something earlier . 
 
 I took off my pants to go pee."

12. stomach (Document[82]):"This time was a bit harder . Like I said before, when you get older it gets more difficult to hold in your bladder, and that's what happened to me at 5:30 AM this morning."

13. boss (Document[82]):"I finished up, put away my phone, and washed myself off . I got dressed again, brushed my teeth, and then headed back downstairs for breakfast . My wife and I had a nice chat while we ate--she's a pretty cool person to have in the office with you."

14. weather (Document[82]):"I finished up and put away my phone again . After a bit more of chatting, my boss and I headed out the door together and left for work . It was a beautiful day here in Portland, Oregon--it was about 56 degrees and sunny."
