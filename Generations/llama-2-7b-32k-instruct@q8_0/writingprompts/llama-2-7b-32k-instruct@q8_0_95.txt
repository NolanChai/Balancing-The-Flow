buy that new flat screen TV he wanted. He smiled nervously and inserted his debit card into the slot, waiting for the machine to eat it like a hungry snake. The machine spat out the card with no problem, and Charlie breathed a huge sigh of relief. He punched in the pin number, and the screen flashed with two words: "Insufficient Funds" followed by the word "Cancel". Charlie's heart plummeted to his stomach as he realized that he didn't actually have enough money to pay for the withdrawal. He cursed under his breath, feeling like a fool for not checking before handing over his card and pin number.  
The ATM beeped loudly and spat out Charlie's debit card, along with a receipt that stated "Insufficient Funds" and "Cancelled". Charlie felt his face turn red as he realized what had just happened. He had been so confident that he could withdraw the full amount, but now he was left feeling embarrassed and ashamed. He quickly shoved the card back into the ATM and hurried away, trying to avoid any potential confrontations with the bank tellers who were surely staring at him. As he walked home, Charlie couldn't help but feel like a complete idiot for not checking his balance before handing over his card and pin number.  
It was only when he got home that Charlie realized the severity of the situation. He had just tried to withdraw $10,000 from an ATM machine without enough money in his account! The thought made his stomach churn with dread, and he immediately logged into his online banking profile to check his balance. To his dismay, it was true - he only had around $500 in his checking account, leaving him with a shortage of nearly $9,500. Charlie felt like he was going to throw up at the thought of how close he came to overdrafting his account, and how much it would have cost him to fix the mistake. He knew that he should have checked his balance before making such a large withdrawal, but he had let his eagerness get the best of him.  
Charlie was left feeling embarrassed and ashamed for what he had done. He realized that he had let his excitement for getting money outweigh his common sense, and that he needed to be more careful in the future. He vowed to himself that from now on, he would always check his balance before making a large withdrawal or transferring funds, no matter how excited he was about getting money. This mistake had been a painful lesson learned, but Charlie knew that it had also made him a wiser and more cautious person overall.  
In the end, Charlie's embarrassing experience at the ATM taught him an important lesson: to always check his balance before making any large financial transactions. He knew that he would never make such a mistake again, and he was glad for the experience he had gone through. Though it may not have been a fun or easy experience, Charlie was grateful for the knowledge that came with it, and he was sure that he would never forget to check his balance before making any financial moves ever again!

Charlie's eyes grew wide as the LED on the ATM flickered to life. Eight digits, and there were n't any decimal points. She would pay off her loans and her credit cards and perhaps still have enough to buy that new flat screen TV she wanted.
