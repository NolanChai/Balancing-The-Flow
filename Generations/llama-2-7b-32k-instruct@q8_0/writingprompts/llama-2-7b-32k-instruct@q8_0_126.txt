twn Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton. It was obvious that both candidates would have a team of media savvy staffers coaching them before they even walked on stage. Mrs. Clinton's staff, with her in front, had been practicing mock debates for months; Mr. Trump's staff were more of the wing-it variety and seemed to prefer this style. The night would be a toss up as far as who won, but there was no doubt that their words would affect America's future for decades to come. Mrs. Clinton cleared her throat and began. "Well Mr. Trump...

Donald Trump: *starts speaking*
Mrs. Clinton: Okay, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose. When you breathe out, I want you to say the word "refugee" with a sigh. Now repeat after me and follow my lead on this one. *sigh* Refugee...
Donald Trump: *sighs* Okay...
Mrs. Clinton: Now I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and when I am done speaking, I want you to give a one word answer. Ready? 1) Are you aware that President Obama has already committed the United States to accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2017 alone?
Donald Trump: Yes... *pauses* 2) In your opinion, is it a good idea or a bad idea to commit to more than double that amount for fiscal year 2018?
Mrs. Clinton: I think you would agree that the current screening process isn't perfect. It doesn't even require them to go through a background check until they arrive in America.
Donald Trump: You don't know anything about it...
Mrs. Clinton: *sighs* Okay, let me ask you another question and see how well you do with this one. 3) What if I told you that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for carrying out more than 70 terrorist attacks inside the United States since January 2014?
Donald Trump: Okay, then what?
Mrs. Clinton: Well that's why... *pauses*
Donald Trump: *speaking over Mrs. Clinton* Yeah, but you don't know anything about it. The Obama administration has done absolutely nothing to combat this.
Mrs. Clinton: Yes I do know something about it! If we could have these refugees vetted by the FBI...
Donald Trump: *interrupting* No way that would happen. That's insane, Hillary. That'll never happen. We can't let our enemies in here. Not even for one second. 4) Now if I told you that we already have a refugee crisis on our hands with the 10,000 Syrian refugees we've already taken into this country, would you agree or disagree?
Donald Trump: *interrupting again* Look Hillary, let me tell you something. The American people don't want more Syrian refugees coming into our country! They know it's a threat to their safety and they don't like it one bit! 5) If I told you that we're not going to be able to vet the other refugees in time for them to arrive before Election Day, should we commit to taking more?
Donald Trump: *shakes his head* Absolutely not. We don't even know who these people are! They could have bombs strapped to their bodies... or they could be ISIS sympathizers. You're telling me that you would welcome terrorists into this country with open arms? I think we'd all be a lot better off if we just didn't commit at all. 6) If I told you that the State Department is projecting that there will be more than 30,000 refugees arriving in America by next year...
Donald Trump: *speaking over Mrs. Clinton again* Come on Hillary! The people don't want it and they can see right through your lies! You just want to bring more Syrian refugees into this country to boost the Democratic vote in November! I think we all know that, because you're the one pushing it so hard...
Mrs. Clinton: *sighs* Yes, but these people have been displaced by a brutal civil war that has raged for years. They need help and they need it now. And I will tell you what, if we don't do something to help them, they'll come here anyway because they know we are the most powerful country in the world and we have the resources to take care of them! So why don't we just put some of those resources towards doing the right thing? 7) If I told you that a lot of these refugees are already being sponsored by groups like Hezbollah...
Donald Trump: *interrupting again* Look Hillary, your policy on this is indefensible! It's dangerous and irresponsible to put the American people at risk just so that you can win an election! I don't want America to be a dumping ground for terrorists from all over the world. And we sure as hell shouldn't be making it any easier for them by bringing in even more of them with your open border policies.
Mrs. Clinton: *sighs* Donald, you have to look at this issue through the lens of humanity! We can do better than that...
Donald Trump: *shaking his head* No Hillary, we don't need to do better than that when it comes to refugees from the Middle East. I think we should take a step back and ask ourselves why these people are fleeing their homes in the first place! It's because they know we have more resources and we can help them... And while we should be taking care of our own, you want to bring more foreigners here that will only drain our resources even further!
Mrs. Clinton: *smirks* Donald Trump, this is the exact reason why I am running for president. Because if elected, my administration would have your back... *pauses* *sighs deeply* And make no mistake about it, we're going to take care of those who need our help! 8) If I told you that taking in these refugees has the potential to increase the threat of terrorism against the United States, would you still support a plan like this?
Donald Trump: *shaking his head* Absolutely not. We don't even know if they are who they say they are... and if they aren't then we could be giving them access to our weapons! That's why I've said from the very beginning that we should ban all Muslims, at least temporarily until we can figure out exactly what's going on here.
Mrs. Clinton: *laughing* You know Donald Trump, your fear mongering is pathetic. This is exactly why people don't trust you! You're spreading lies and misinformation just to try and get votes from Americans who are afraid of the world around them. And it's working...
Donald Trump: *smirks* Yes I am afraid Hillary, but I'm also realistic! The truth is that the American people don't trust you either, because they know you have a long history of not keeping America safe. And they know that if elected, you would continue to do what you always do... and that is put the needs of your friends in Wall Street over those of the working families who are paying the price for it!
Mrs. Clinton: *smirks* Donald Trump, this election isn't about me or you... It's about the people of America and how we want to move our country forward. And I am here to tell you that if elected president, I will do everything in my power to make sure that all Americans are safe from harm! *pauses* *smiles* That includes protecting them from terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS or any other group for that matter.
Donald Trump: *laughing* Yeah right Hillary, like you would do anything to keep us safe... You just want to let those bastards in so they can attack us and then we'll have an excuse to take away your guns! *pauses* And maybe you'll even declare martial law if things get really bad. That way you can become dictator and rule the country like a king!
Mrs. Clinton: *smirks* You know, Donald Trump... I've never been afraid of the facts. The fact is that this election is about who can best protect Americans from harm. And I am telling you right now that as president, I will do everything in my power to keep all Americans safe! 9) If I told you that many people believe that accepting Syrian refugees would be a step towards aiding the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's recruiting efforts for terrorist attacks on American soil, would you agree or disagree?
Donald Trump: *shaking his head* Absolutely not. This is exactly why we need to keep our borders secure! They are using these refugees as cover so they can slip into this country and attack us from within...
