You're getting in your own way by allowing yourself to feel guilty about the things you want to achieve but aren't doing. Instead of feeling regretful, try to find a more productive way to channel that energy. Could you break down big tasks into smaller ones? Take some time for self-care or mindfulness practices? Reach out to someone who can offer support and guidance. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and not feel like you have to do everything all at once!
