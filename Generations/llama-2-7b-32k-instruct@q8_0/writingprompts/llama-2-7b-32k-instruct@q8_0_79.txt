I began writing a list of my goals for the upcoming year, and was reminded why I had always hated resolutions. They are too abstract! It is much easier to be motivated by concrete actions and outcomes than it is to be motivated by vague ideas like "being healthier" or "being a better person." As such, my goal is to start each day with a list of three things that need to get done before the end of the day. I will try to stay as focused on these tasks as possible until they are complete. It is an exciting challenge that I know I can accomplish!
