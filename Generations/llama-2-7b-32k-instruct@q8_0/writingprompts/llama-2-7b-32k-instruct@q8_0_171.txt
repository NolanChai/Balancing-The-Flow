I was distinctly sure I was using a blue pen. As always, I was just absent mindedly doodling different sizes of circles and patterns. I enjoy symmetry and geometric figures so much that when my thoughts wander from the task at hand I will often find myself drawing these shapes instead. 

How did the color change? Perhaps my eyesight isn't what it used to be, or maybe I was holding an empty pen in one hand and a blue pen in the other. Or perhaps there are multiple pens of different colors sitting next to each other on the desk and I accidentally grabbed a red pen instead. 

It could even be that my mind is playing tricks on me, causing me to believe that I'm holding a blue pen when actually my hand is closed around a red one. Whatever the case may be, it's important to pay attention to detail and be mindful of what objects you are interacting with.
