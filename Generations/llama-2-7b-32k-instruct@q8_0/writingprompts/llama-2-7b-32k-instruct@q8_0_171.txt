tery, so I've never had any intent to create art or even draw anything particular; it's more of an idle exercise that sometimes yields interesting results (such as this pen/color change) 
I was on the phone with someone else when suddenly I felt something wet. When I looked at the paper what did I see? 
 
 A blue pen in a red circle and a black pen in a green circle  
My first thought was that one of my cats had somehow managed to find its way over here. My second thought was "How is it that both pens are out?" and then I saw the small blue spot on the edge of the page, as if someone had spilled blue ink from an open pen while sitting nearby
Is there anything else you can tell me about this experience? 
 
 It's a little unnerving because I don't recall the last time that I used a blue pen to write something down. If it was blue, it must have been fairly recently and not so long ago that I could still smell it on my fingers from holding it in between my teeth while talking on the phone . The black ink is also unfamiliar--my writing implements are typically old and used but they're never quite new. 
It feels like a little mystery, albeit one with an obvious answer once I look at the paper, but it still makes me wonder if there's something deeper going on here than meets the eye
I've never seen that happen before. The only thing I can think of is that maybe my cat had come over to eat from the other side of the table, and then when he came back up to get some more he accidentally stepped in blue pen. But how would a cat have gotten ahold of a blue pen? 
It's very strange. I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar
I wonder if this is a sign from my subconscious mind that it wants me to consider other possibilities, like the pens having been switched before I started writing on this piece of paper
It certainly seems as though someone else must have done this; there are two pens here and I don't use blue or red ink. It's a little bit spooky
I was using my iPad Air to type something for my sister, when suddenly the screen turned all white. When I looked at the iPad what did I see? 
 
 All of the text that I had been typing appeared on top of the notes app. The icons were there but everything else in both apps was gone 
I checked and made sure that neither my sister's computer nor any other device could have possibly connected to or accessed the iPad Air while it was still turned on. Since my iPad is unlocked, I don't know how long this person was able to access the screen before I noticed but it seemed like a very short amount of time
I immediately locked the iPad and checked that no one had been using the computer. They were gone so I didn't think much about it again until my sister told me what happened 
When she came over, I asked her if she did anything on my computer while I was away for a few minutes and she said no; then she showed me what had happened to her computer as well as mine
I couldn't believe it. The iPad is in the bedroom so if someone would have come into our house they would have been seen by either of us or at least heard walking around the house 
We do not know how this could have possibly occurred, but we are both positive that no one came to the house nor used a device while I was away
I don't think it can be hacked because everything is password protected and very secure. It was definitely a ghost or something else paranormal  
My sister said she was sitting on my couch watching TV when suddenly her computer turned white too. She had been typing to me on the iPad while I was in another room so we know that neither of us did it but there was no way that this could have happened without someone entering our house 
We're both freaked out by what just occurred
I don't even want to think about whoever or whatever is haunting my home. It might be the first time I've actually been scared of something in my home
How long were you on your sisters computer? And when did this occur? 
 
 It was almost right as I walked out the door, but it would have happened while I was still in the room with her. She wasn't typing anything--she was just watching TV and I sat down to say goodbye before heading out the door. The iPad didn't even have any time to warm up or cool down; it only took a few seconds for this to happen
How long did you spend on your sisters computer? And when did this occur? 
 
 It was right as I walked out of the door and had been there for almost no time at all. In fact, if we hadn't seen each other in person, I wouldn't have known about it until she told me what happened later on that evening or even the next day  
It has to be a ghost because it was just as I walked out the door. This is very strange and unnerving 
When did you start noticing this? And how long were you on your sisters computer? 
 
 It occurred immediately after I left, right when my sister said goodbye to me at the door before going to sleep. The iPad's screen just turned white with text appearing in the middle of it and none of my other apps or icons were visible or usable 
It was very recent--maybe a minute or two at most had passed between the time I finished what I was writing and when she told me about this happening to her. She saw it on the screen immediately so there was no way that any apps or settings were open prior to this  
I'm going to have to change my passwords just in case it could be someone with malicious intent, but it seems like a ghost to me--however it happened I don't know who would do this intentionally nor why they would do so 
If you think that your house has been haunted by paranormal activity and if you are open to it, what do you think or feel? 
 
 It definitely feels like something paranormal is happening here. I don't know how else to explain the fact that there was no warning on my computer that someone was accessing the screen or any other signs at all that this could possibly have occurred, yet it clearly did and now both of our computers are behaving in exactly the same way 
I'm a little freaked out by what happened. I don't want to think about whoever--or whatever is haunting my home  
This experience has me feeling like this place that we live in was built on top of some sort of sacred ground or something; maybe someone died here, or an object was buried here at one point which caused these occurrences. If it were a ghost I think there would have been more warning signs than this 
I'm really unnerved and need to change my passwords just in case there was an intent to hack the computer but it feels like something paranormal is happening to us, our house  
It may be that we should get that place checked out by a priest or something. I don't know if it's possible but maybe this isn't good 
How are you feeling? 
 
 It makes me feel like someone else was in the room with me when I left; even though they weren't seen and no one heard anything, I just have a strange feeling that there was someone standing right next to my sister while she was watching TV. We could see each other so we would have had to be looking at the same time but it feels like there was someone in the room with us
I don't want anyone else coming into my home and accessing our devices because I feel violated--like a stranger just used these things without permission and left me feeling very vulnerable  
This is a strange occurrence. We had to change our passwords. Did you do that? 
 
 Yes we did, as soon as I got back in the house from dropping my sister off at her home. I'm going to have to make sure no one else ever does this again; it makes me feel violated and like someone was watching us. Whoever or whatever it is, they are not welcome here 
I changed my passwords on all of our accounts and I am now going to be extremely cautious about who has access to the computer in case this happens again. This isn't normal behavior and something bad happened to my iPad and my sisters computer 
It could have been a person, but it definitely was not a good thing  
Who do you believe did this? And why do you think they did this? 
 
 I don't know if I'm willing or able to say whether I believe it was an actual living person that did this because there are no warning signs at all, but I can tell you what happened: both of our computers turned white and were using notes as their screen when we left the room. There is no way that either of us could have done this without somehow seeing each other and neither of us had any apps or icons open so it's definitely not human 
I don't know who did this, but I do feel violated and like I just want to make sure that they cannot come back. Whoever or whatever it was doesn't belong here in my house. If
