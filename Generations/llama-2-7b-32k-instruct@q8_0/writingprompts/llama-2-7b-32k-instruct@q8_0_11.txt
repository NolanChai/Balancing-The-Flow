The man on the couch is a well endowed, young transman who goes by the name of "Avery." Avery has a crush on me, and he doesn't mind sharing his secret with anyone, especially if they have big boobs. As it turns out, Avery is also an artist. He draws amazing comics about us, as well as other characters in our school. They are always incredibly detailed and lifelike. The best part though? We're both closeted. I know for a fact that he doesn't tell anyone at school about his love of me, or what we do behind closed doors when no one is around. This is how it has to be until the day Avery gets outed by someone else. Until then, we have this little secret between us.

As I sit down on the couch beside him and he asks if I can play, a grin spreads across his face as he looks at me with a dreamy expression. His name is Avery. He's the best artist in our class. And he's trans. But we have a secret...and it's this: We fuck like bunnies when no one else is around! It's amazing! The only problem? He's outed to everyone else at school, and I don't want anyone to know that he has a crush on me!

I look at Avery. His face looks hopeful as he asks if I can play. I shake my head no. "What if someone sees us?" he whispers, leaning closer to me with his eyes closed and his tongue licking his lips. I shake my head again. We have to be careful. This is a school full of jocks who would never take kindly to finding out that two girls were fucking in the corner. "Let's do it tomorrow," he says, leaning closer and planting a gentle kiss on my cheek.

I look at Avery and I feel like I can do anything. He has such a good heart. And we have this secret that only the two of us know about. It's our own little world, and we don't want anyone else to ruin it. As he stands up and heads towards his bedroom with his sketchbook in hand, I follow him out of habit, my heart beating faster than ever before.

I wonder what Avery will draw today...
