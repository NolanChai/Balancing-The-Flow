He glances at the clock behind his head, then looks back up at me and starts to blush. The man on the couch is Kairi Satou--my long time friend, my confidant and my biggest inspiration as a writer. He's also my editor extraordinaire for my shoujo manga series: ''Déjà Vu''. We have been working together for years now; he helps me get ideas, proofreads, gives advice, and even takes the blame when necessary. I can honestly say that without him none of my work would be as good as it is today. He's a brilliant young man, but he doesn't know how to deal with people in person. He's shy, awkward and doesn't like crowds or loud noises; so he prefers to stay home all day everyday. I think that's why we get along so well; because when you talk to him he looks like a little kid who just wants to be left alone. But I assure you, the man is brilliant. He always knows what to say and how to say it . We are in my house now because I needed Kairi's advice on something for Déjà Vu. So here we are, sitting in front of a cozy fireplace with a kettle boiling hot tea in between us. My name is Asuka Ohtori; and yes I know, my name means ''afraid'' in English but I am not afraid of anything . In fact, I live for the adrenaline rush I get from pushing myself to the limit . Kairi's hand grabs mine across the table as if it was destiny. He looks at me and smiles shyly. We are both quiet for a moment before he starts talking in a low, sultry voice--I swear he talks like this on purpose just to make my heart race: ''I've been thinking about the scene where they...''

Translation 10/18:  [Instructor] Can I play? [Student] Yes you can! I ask the man on the couch. From his waist length blond hair, hipster scarf, thin frame and extremely feminine features, he's every yaoi fan's wet-dream. He's also my wet-dream, but that's not important right now.
