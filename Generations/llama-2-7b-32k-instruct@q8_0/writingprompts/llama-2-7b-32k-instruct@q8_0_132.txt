left me in the woods to die, and I found a way home on my own, but nobody will listen to me tell them about it, because no one believes something they can't see with their eyes . They think that they know what is real and what isn't; well, you don't really know anything unless you have the experience to back up your belief. That's why they ban religion: they believe that if everyone could do as he wished, people would be disrespectful of others. But this isn't true. The only reason that we aren't is because no one wants to see it; we are afraid for the same reasons you are. We have seen death and pain and agony in our lives, but we still haven't given up hope that there is something better beyond all of it. They can try to ban us, they can torture us, they can kill us if they wish, but we will always be here; we won't give up what we believe in. And one day, everyone else will have to come and see our way of thinking."

Context: I was born on a plantation not so far from here . We lived there with slaves . Well, most people think that the only reason why slaves were treated badly is because they're black, but it wasn't just that . Slaves were bad, and everyone knew it. My pa and me didn't really have a good time on this plantation, even though we weren't slaves ourselves. People are always trying to tell you what to do; they don't want anyone to be above them or better than they are . That's why my pa left the plantation when I was five years old . We lived in the woods for a few months before he found me a way out of there on my own. Well, no one believed that I did it; they said I had help getting home. But what would anyone have to gain from helping a five-year-old boy get back to his family? That just doesn't make sense. They didn't know anything about life . It was all just theory with them; it wasn't really like that in reality.

Context: I don't really care what people think of me, because I have lived a good and honest life . I may not be the most famous person in the world, but at least I can look back on my life knowing that I did something positive for others with everything I had. You see, my pa left me in the woods when I was five years old, so I could make it home on my own. Everyone thought that I couldn't do it . They said it wasn't possible; no one would help a poor black boy get back to his family on his own. But I did it! And not only did I prove them all wrong by getting home safely, but when I got there I made sure that my pa and me never went hungry again. That's what life is about . Doing something for other people . Giving people the means to take care of themselves without depending on anyone else. That was something my pa taught me growing up in slavery. No one really knows how we lived those days, because no one talks about it; they don't like talking about it and think that if they don't talk about it, it won't have happened. But I did it! And I'm proud of what I accomplished by myself. My life may not be perfect now, but I can look back on my life knowing that I did something worthwhile in the world .

Context: "I was a slave once upon a time; you probably know what they used to do with us slaves. They took our families and sold them like cattle at a market; we never really knew where or when they were going . The only thing we had to hold onto was hope, but that's all we had - just hope. I remember once when my pa left me on the plantation to get some supplies, and he didn't make it back for three days . Everyone said he must have been helped by someone along the way, because no one knew how a five-year-old boy could survive those woods all alone for so long. But I made it home; that's just who I am. And when my pa saw me on the plantation again, he decided that he couldn't keep working like that anymore . We went to the North and started our own farm where we didn't have to live under anyone else's thumb."

Context: "When I was five years old, my father left me in a field. He told me to find my way home by myself; he said that no one could help me but me . And I did! That's just who I am . The only reason they were so surprised is because people don't believe what they can't see with their own eyes."

Context: "My father left me in the woods when I was five years old. He said that no one could help me but myself; he told me to find my way home on my own . So I did! That's just who I am . No one can tell me what to do or say what is possible because they don't know what it feels like out there."

Context: "I was born into slavery. My father left me in the woods when I was five years old, so I had to find my way home on my own. It wasn't easy, but I made it . No one believed that I could do it because they couldn't see what I could, but I showed them."
