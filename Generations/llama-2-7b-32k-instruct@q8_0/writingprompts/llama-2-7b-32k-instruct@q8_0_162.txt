The wind blew gently through the forest canopy, rustling the leaves of the trees and carrying with it a faint whiff of smoke from distant fires. The sun, rising slowly in the east, cast long shadows across the battlefield. There was still much left to survey, but he had no doubt that his victory would be complete and overwhelming. His force was indeed overwhelming - there were more than enough soldiers to cover all sides of him, and their weapons were sturdy and sharp. He felt a sense of pride and satisfaction as he stood proudly at the head of his army, watching his men march forward into battle.
