"The Lance of Elendel," the old man said, walking forward to take it. "It has been passed down from king to king for centuries." He looked up at Dorian. "You have the right look about you," he said, his eyes glinting with amusement. 
 
 Dorian had never heard of the Lance of Elendel. But then again, he had no idea what he was talking about when it came to kings and their stuff. All he knew was that he couldn't let them give him this sword. It called to him--he felt like its rightful owner. 
 
 "I don't know who you are," Dorian said, trying not to sound too eager, "but I can tell you I need the Lance of Elendel." He didn't mean to sound so desperate, but that was how he felt--like this sword was meant for him. 
 
 The old man chuckled and patted Dorian on the shoulder. "Well then," he said, "you must have a reason good enough to convince me." 
 
 Dorian looked around at the crowd of people gathered around them, their faces filled with wonder. He knew they were all waiting for him to say something--to give some speech about why he needed this sword so badly. But what could he say? The Lance of Elendel called to him. That was reason enough. 
 
 "I don't know how to explain it," Dorian said, his voice catching in his throat. "But I feel like the Lance of Elendel is meant for me." He looked up at the old man and smiled. "Please," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. 
 
 The old man nodded slowly and held out the sword to Dorian. Without thinking, Dorian reached for it. As soon as he did, he felt like he belonged here--like this was where he was meant to be. It was like the Lance of Elendel had always been a part of him, waiting to be rediscovered. 
 
 He took a step forward and raised the sword overhead, feeling its weight in his hand. It was like he was holding the future--the destiny of Elendel. And for some reason, that felt right. 
 
 The crowd went wild as Dorian held up the Lance of Elendel. He didn't know what they were cheering about, but it didn't matter. All that mattered was that he had the sword and he knew who he was meant to be--the chosen one.
