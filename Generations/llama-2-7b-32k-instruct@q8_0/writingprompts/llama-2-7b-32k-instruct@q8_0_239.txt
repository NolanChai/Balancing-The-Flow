one and blood and the feather of some large bird. There was a warrior dressed in armor, his face lost beneath layers of mail, but he could see from his build that it must have been him who had left the weapon there to mark his passage through this place. The man's sword was nowhere to be seen. His helmet and shield were missing as well.
 
 He knew what the man had come here for. What he had left behind was a testament of what it meant to walk this path in life, unyielding until one's dying day. The warrior had not yet been granted this wish. It would be a while yet before his time came and he could pass through these gates with pride.
 
 He knew this because the man was him. That was who he was looking at right now, the boy who stood where he did, but not just yet. There were still things to do in life. A warrior's path is long and hard, and it would be a while before the final day came.
 
 The man watched as the boy struggled with the lock of the gate. It was no easy task, for the lock had been designed to be just that, impossible to open until someone worthy took up this challenge. He watched his own hand try to do the same thing, and yet there was a difference here. 
 
 The man had not tried to force the door open with his bare hands. It would have broken him on impact. Instead he'd been granted this wish. His body could take what was coming to it as if it were nothing more than a walk through the park. The lock was meant to be overcome by those who sought the gift that lay beyond, not those who merely desired it. He understood why now.
 
 As his own hand reached out and grasped the handle of the door, he could feel its resistance and yet also how strong it truly was. There would come a time where it would open for him without any effort at all. That day had still not been granted to him, but it would be soon enough. For now though he would watch the boy's struggle through these gates, knowing that he had walked this path before and passed through them as if they were nothing more than a simple gate in life.
 
 And yet there was a difference. The man knew what lay beyond those gates. He understood what it meant to bear such burdens until his dying day. The boy did not. That would come, but he still had much to learn before that time came. The boy's journey had only just begun.
 
 The warrior smiled. He knew the boy would face a long path ahead of him. One which would be paved with difficulty and struggle. There was no easy road in life. Even if it seemed so on the outside, that was an illusion. He could see it now as he watched the boy's struggles. 
 
 But there was also hope here too. Hope that the boy had a chance to make this world a better place and make his own mark upon it. It would not be easy for him, but he had all the tools necessary to overcome the challenges that lay ahead of him. And one day, if he did nothing else with his life, at least he could say that he walked a path as a warrior through this world.
 
 That was a noble cause in and of itself. It would be enough for some men, but not for the boy before him. He would seek so much more than that. It would take years to train him properly. The man knew what it meant to learn these skills as an adult. He had no idea how long it had been since he first came through these gates at this very place in life.
 
 It was a good thing he still had some time left, and perhaps even more importantly the will to continue. For if there were one thing that the warrior knew, he could not bear another man's burdens for him. That would be nothing short of disrespectful on his part. No, the boy was here because he sought to learn what it meant to walk this path in life. That was his choice to make and his alone. 
 
 The warrior stood back and allowed the boy to try at the gate again. He knew he had not done enough yet, but there was time for that later on in life. For now though the man would continue on with the rest of his day, knowing that this was only a small test of what lay ahead of him.
 
 There were many other tests that would come before these gates. He knew this all too well, for he had passed through them once already and stood at the gates once more to watch as another boy struggled with their own burdens in life. The man could only smile now, knowing how much time they still had before the final day came when it would be their time to leave these halls and walk free into the world.
 
 And yet there was a difference. This one did not know of the struggles he faced ahead. He too would learn them soon enough. But for now, that was up to him to discover. That would always be true, regardless of whoever else came through these gates. The warrior knew this because it had been his path as well once upon a time in life, and yet somehow he found a way to endure the challenges. 
 
 And so he would have to find a way for the boy to do the same. It was up to him now. He had passed through these gates once already. That meant something in his mind. And it was also something that the boy did not yet understand, but he soon would. The warrior hoped this was true, because if not then the man knew only what lay ahead of him, and that too would be enough for him to face with a smile on his lips as he walked away from these gates at last.
 
 He knew when he had come through them again this time there would be no looking back. No regrets to be felt because he had failed in any way along the path. That was not an option here. It never could have been, for the man understood what it meant to walk this path as a warrior. He knew all too well that to fail here would mean failing in life itself. 
 
 And so if there were one thing he did know about this boy's journey ahead of him, it was that he would not fail on his own account. That was something the man was willing to bet his very soul upon. He knew what had happened before as well when he left these gates a boy and returned through them once more as a man. 
 
 And so with this thought in mind the warrior turned away from the gate and walked towards the exit of the halls, knowing that this day would be just another step along his path in life now, but also something which he could hold in the back of his mind as a reminder to all who came through these gates.
 
 The boy watched him go, knowing he was watching over him and that he would return one day when it was time for him to leave this place. He knew the warrior did not want him here, but there was still hope in his heart that things could change soon enough. He had a feeling that if they tried hard enough, perhaps they might even find a way.
 
 The boy wondered what it would be like when he walked these gates again as an adult. He would not have the same struggles then as he did now. He would know exactly what to do. And maybe someday he would walk out of this place with his head held high and a smile on his lips just like the warrior before him did that day when he first left these gates.
 
 And so for now, he continued to struggle against the locks of the gate. He knew it was no easy task. It had been many years since he'd tried this himself. But as he looked upon the man and watched the smile on his face, he wondered if perhaps he too might one day be able to walk out those gates with a similar smile as well.
 
 It seemed unlikely. The man before him was strong in ways that he was not yet. There would come a time when this would all seem easy to him, but for now it would take much practice and discipline. But still there was hope here too. He could see the warrior's strength in his face. 
 
 And so with that thought in mind the boy reached out once more and tried again at the lock on the gate before him. This time he knew what to expect. He had a feeling it would not be as hard this time around, for he had seen an example of how this was supposed to look. But still, there was no easy road ahead of him. 
 
 The boy watched the man leave and turned back to the gate before him. It seemed so much harder now than when he'd tried it a few moments ago. He knew if he kept trying at it in the same way that he had been, he would never be able to open this gate and make his own journey through these halls of life. 
 
 That was not an option. Not here. And so with this thought in mind the boy closed his eyes for a moment, gathering all of his strength into one single point before him. He knew that he had to change something about what he was doing if he wanted any chance at success here today. 
 
 It seemed unlikely now that he would open these gates and walk out as an adult. But still there was hope in his heart, because the warrior had not given up on him yet. He knew that
