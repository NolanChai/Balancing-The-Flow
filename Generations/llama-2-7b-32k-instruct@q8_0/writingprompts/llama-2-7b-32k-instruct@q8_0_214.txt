In a world where vampires and humans coexist, a young vampire named D is trained to assassinate enemies of the night kind. He moves silently among the shadows, knowing that his own can see among its kind as well as if it were midday. But there are other dangers here. His feet soundlessly negotiate the obstacles in his way.

As he approaches a building, he sees a group of humans congregating outside. One of them looks at him and gestures for him to come over. He knows that this could be trouble, but he cannot resist the draw of human blood. He moves forward slowly, careful not to make any sudden movements that might give away his position.

The humans surround D and taunt him, daring him to attack. They are confident in their numbers and weapons, but D knows that they have no idea what they're up against. As he approaches them, he can feel the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He is ready for battle.

But just as D lunges for one of the humans, a figure appears from behind him and knocks him to the ground. The human leader looks down at D and smiles triumphantly, thinking that he has won this round. But D quickly recovers and stands up, his eyes fixed on the enemy leader.

In an instant, D lunges forward again, sinking his teeth into the man's neck. The humans watch in horror as their leader crumbles to the ground, his life draining away. D has won this battle, but there are still so many more fights ahead of him. He knows that he must be ready for anything, at any time.

As D moves silently back into the night, he reflects on what he has learned from this encounter. He knows that his kind is not welcome in this world, and that humans will do whatever it takes to see them gone. But he also knows that he must continue his work, no matter the cost. For D, there is no other choice.

In a world where vampires and humans coexist, a young vampire named D lives a double life. By day, he attends school and tries to blend in with the human students. But by night, he trains to become the ultimate assassin, taking out enemies of his kind. In this way, he hopes to protect his own from harm and make peace between vampires and humans.

But it's not easy. D must constantly guard against being discovered by both humans and other vampires alike. He knows that if either side were to find him out, they would hunt him down without mercy. And yet, he cannot resist the draw of battle. The thrill of confrontation is in his blood, and he needs it to survive.

One day, as D approaches a building filled with humans, he senses movement behind him. He turns and sees another vampire sneaking up on him. It's a trap! But rather than attacking him, the other vampire helps D evade the human guards who are approaching from all sides.

Together, they make their way through the building and out into the night air. The humans never even knew what hit them. For D, this is just another day in the life of an assassin-at-large. He knows that his work may never be done, but he also knows that he cannot stop now. Not when there are so many more battles to come.
