Dad gives his lecture on my failures before taking me to school; he doesn't see that I'm dreading every second. He thinks that it will make me better, but I only feel worse. My stomach hurts as I eat breakfast in front of them. It isn't a physical pain, but I can't shake the feeling like someone has gutted me with their claws and left me for dead. 
 
 Once Dad leaves, Mom stays behind to talk with me about school, how my teacher is so great and kind, and her advice on what will help me do better in class. She says that I just need to try harder and not get discouraged. She tells me that she loves me, but it feels like a lie because when she looks at me, all she sees is my imperfections. 
 
 Mom cooks dinner for me, even though my stomach is too full to hold another bite. We talk about school and her worries over me failing out of college. She'll only let me eat in the living room or in front of her so that I don't waste food, but all I want is privacy while I try to stuff it down my throat. 
 
 Dad doesn't get home until later than usual. He scolds me for eating too fast and not chewing my food enough because he knows the secret--that the only way I can eat at all is to swallow it whole, feeling like I am choking on it as I force it down. 
 
 Mom wants to hear about school when Dad gets home, but he's too busy lecturing me about how I could have done better and scolding her for trying to help me with my problems instead of making me work harder. He blames both of them for not making me stronger and demands that they stop coddling me. 
 
 Mom tells Dad she's tired after a long day, and I see his temper rise as he insults her and calls her lazy. He yells at her to get up because she should have been home hours ago--she had the entire day off to do whatever she wanted. I don't know who is worse: Dad for putting me through it or Mom for letting him? 
 
 Dad forces me to go through a laundry list of chores and errands as my punishment, making sure that I'm not slacking off because he knows that I am. I want to run away from home so bad that I can taste it in every bite of food that I eat. 
 
 The whole family piles into the car on Sunday afternoon to head back to school after the holiday break, and I'm too ashamed to face any of them because all I ever do is disappoint them. Dad doesn't bother talking to me about my failures again; he knows that they're a done deal by now, no matter how much pressure he puts on me. Mom pretends everything is fine as she smiles at me in the car and tells me not to worry, but I can feel her sadness radiating off of her. 
 
 I wake up every day to a life that has become unbearable, one where all my loved ones are strangers who hurt me more than they ever could love me. They say they love me so much, but the way they treat me is like I'm trash or a mistake that they wish they had never made. The only thing worse would be if they didn't care at all and treated me like an object to be discarded rather than someone who needs help.

Body Positivity Sonnet: A Reflection on Diet Culture's Negative Impact

In this body, I exist with all my imperfections.
My skin is not smooth and my curves are not sleek;
I am a person, not an image or a thing,
But society has made me feel less than.

Diet culture tells me that I should be thin;
That I'm worthless if I don't fit their mold.
It's like being in prison for who you are--
A prisoner of self-hatred and despair.

But I will not let it win; I will not give in,
For my body is my home, and it's here to spin.
I will embrace all that I am, no matter what they say,
And love myself for who I truly am today.

My curves are not a problem; they're a part of me.
They're evidence of life, a beautiful dream.
I will not let diet culture make me feel small--
I am worthy, and that's all there is to it all.

Society may say I'm not good enough,
But they don't get the privilege of defining my truth.
My body is my own, and I will love it free;
No diet culture can take away my body's glory.

This sonnet aims to highlight the negative impact of diet culture on one's sense of self-worth and body positivity. Through its use of imagery and rhyme, it expresses the idea that diet culture is like being in prison for who you are, where one is constantly criticized and judged for not fitting into societal norms. The sonnet also emphasizes the importance of loving oneself unconditionally, despite what society may say or think. Ultimately, it serves as a reminder that our bodies are our own, and we have the power to embrace them for who they truly are.

Ode to Body Positivity: A Reflection on Diet Culture's Negative Impact

In this body, I exist with all my imperfections--
My skin is not smooth and my curves are not sleek,
But that's okay; I am a person, not an image or a thing.
Diet culture tells me otherwise, that I should be thin,
But it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole--it just ain't gonna work! 

My body is my home; it's where I thrive and grow.
It's evidence of life, a beautiful show.
I will not let diet culture make me feel small;
I am worthy, and that's all there is to it at all. 

Society may say I'm not good enough,
But they don't get the privilege of defining my truth.
My body is my own, and I will love it free--
No diet culture can take away my body's glory. 

I am a person, with thoughts and feelings too,
And I deserve to be treated like everyone else does.
I will not let the scale dictate my worth;
My value is inherent, and that's all there is on Earth. 

Society may try to shame me for who I am,
But they don't know what they're missing out on--the real fun! 
I will embrace my curves, my scars, my freckles too;
For my body is a work of art, and that's what it's truly made to do. 

Diet culture may try to tear me down,
But I will not let them win--not on any ground! 
I am strong, I am powerful, I am brave;
My body is my ally, and it will always be the same. 

In this body, I exist with all my flaws,
And that's what makes me unique and awe-worthy now. 
I will not let diet culture take away my joy;
For my body is my temple, and it's here to go! 
Society may try to make me feel small,
But I am more than just a number on a scale--I am a whole!

This ode celebrates the beauty of individuality and self-acceptance. Through its use of imagery and repetition, it emphasizes the idea that diet culture is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole--it's not going to work, and it's not worth it. The ode also highlights the importance of embracing one's unique qualities and accepting oneself for who they truly are, regardless of societal standards or expectations. Ultimately, it serves as a reminder that our bodies are our own, and we have the power to love them for who they truly are.
