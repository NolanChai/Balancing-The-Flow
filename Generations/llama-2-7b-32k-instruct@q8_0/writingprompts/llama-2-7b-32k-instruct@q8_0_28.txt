1 / 1You were in a space station with no memory of how you got there. There are four doors, each leading to a different path. You have no idea where any of them go, but you feel like you can't stay put.

The third door seems to be made of liquid metal and pulses gently as though it were alive. And finally, the fourth door is locked with an ancient-looking lock that appears to be jammed shut. You have no tools or weapons on you, just your wits and instincts. What would you do?
