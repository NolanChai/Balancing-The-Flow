one day buying some groceries and I see this really attractive woman working behind the counter who also seems to be new here since she is still learning the ropes. I figure she does n't know about my condition so I decide to tell her a little white lie in order to flatter her. "Hi there, you look like someone who knows their way around this store. Do you have any suggestions for some good products?" She looks at me and says:  "I can recommend the organic produce section on the left wall. It's pretty great." I respond with a big smile saying:  "Thanks! I think that sounds awesome! Maybe next time I'll check it out!" But then I start to feel guilty for my little white lie so I add:  "But I think you probably already know that, right? I mean I'm pretty bad about forgetting things. I'm sure this is no big deal but I just wanted to let you in on the secret." She says:  
What was my response to her comment about getting scarred for each lie and then asking what she recommends?
A) "You're probably right, maybe I should be more honest. But it's hard when your body is all covered up with scars from lying!" B)  "I guess you've seen my scars before?! Maybe we know each other already?" C) "Oh no way, I bet those are fresh wounds that will heal soon enough! My condition makes me forget things though so it takes me a while to realize when they're still new"
