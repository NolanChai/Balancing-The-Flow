I am not sure how accurate this information is since many people in Iraq do not know what is going on in their own country. 

However, if you believe the news of the American retreat, then it would be a good time for you to come home as well! We have been worried about you and are glad that you are safe. Please let us know when you plan to return so we can make arrangements to pick you up at the airport or train station.

We miss you and love you!
