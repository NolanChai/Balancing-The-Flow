[INST] Dear Father, 
I got great news! I think I'm coming home! Some of the guys said that we might get to go home, it is Muharram so we have not been doing much. I hear that the Americans are retreating  and so everyone will be happy now. But still, I am worried about things and what if something happens here? Can you pray for us?

I also want to know how I can keep myself safe at all times? I don't really have any weapons or anything like that but I do have my wits about me. Can you give me some advice on this?  [/INST]
