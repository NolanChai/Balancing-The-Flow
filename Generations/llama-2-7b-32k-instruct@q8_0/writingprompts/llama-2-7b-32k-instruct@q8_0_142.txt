Well, it has to be... Someone would have seen something by now... And I am pretty sure that no one saw me come in here today... Besides you of course... Goddamn it! It has to be my imagination. **

The following conversation between a hiker and their dog takes place in the woods near a lake. The dog's name is Bella, and she is a friendly and curious canine who loves exploring with her human friend. 

**Woof- Woof-Woof! Hey there! I'm not sure where we are, but I am having fun. There aren't many people around here so far... Do you think this is safe? Maybe we should head back to the trailhead soon... What do you think? **

*Bella looks at her human friend with a curious expression and tilts her head to the side.* 

**Hmmm... That's not good. You are right, Bella. We can't stay out here for long... I guess we should be on our way back now. Thanks for reminding me. **

Bella barks happily and starts leading the way as they set off in the direction of their car. After a while, Bella stops suddenly and looks up at her human with an urgent expression. 

**Hey- Hey! What's wrong? You're not still worried about that lake monster, are you? Don't be silly... **

*Bella barks again and tugs gently on the leash.* 

**Oh come on! What the hell? Really? Here? You had to come all the way here, to this particular place in the middle of nowhere? Just my luck. Goddamn **
