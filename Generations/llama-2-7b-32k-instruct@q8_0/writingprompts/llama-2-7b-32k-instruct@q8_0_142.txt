Oh come on! What the hell? Really? Here? You had to come all the way here, to this particular place in the middle of nowhere? Just my luck. Goddamn. 

*Wha- That's not- That's not possible... s**

The story is a first-person account of someone who is surprised and displeased that someone has come to their location, which they perceive as being in the middle of nowhere. The speaker uses strong language and expresses frustration at the situation. They refer to the person's arrival as "really?" and "just my luck," implying that they did not expect or want this visitor.

The response, "*Wha- That's not- That's not possible..." s**, is a questioning statement that suggests the speaker does not believe what has just been said. It implies that the speaker is surprised and confused by the information, and may be questioning the reliability of their source or the accuracy of the information itself. The use of "s" at the end of the sentence also implies that the speaker is still processing the information and may be seeking clarification or additional context.
