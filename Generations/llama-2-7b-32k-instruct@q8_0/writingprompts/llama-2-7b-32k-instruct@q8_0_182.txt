and said, "I am happy to hear that."  
 
 'I have your test results here and would like to give it to you.' I pulled out the paperwork from my purse. The nurse had given it to me earlier when she asked me about any allergies or medications that i was taking.  He looked at it then handed it back to me. 
 
 'Well, they're fine. Don't worry about them.' He said and smiled again. He looked up at me. I thought he might ask about anything else but he didn't. He just told me that everything was okay, which I knew already. There were no signs of any disease in the tests, or even of pregnancy. 
 
 He got up to leave. Then, before he left, he asked if there was anything on my mind lately. I looked at him, and said "Yes." I wanted to tell him about my ex boyfriend who I had been talking to again after a long time, but then stopped myself because it didn't seem like it was his business. 
 
 He nodded as if he understood what I meant. He gave me another smile then left the room. The nurse came in and asked me if I wanted to schedule my next appointment or ask about anything else. I told her that I would call them when the time comes. Then I got up, put on my jacket, picked up my purse and walked out of the door. 
 
 As soon as I was outside I looked for a bench in the park across the street because I was feeling really overwhelmed by everything that had just happened and wanted to sit down for a while. 
 
 I sat on a bench near an apple tree which was covered with blossoms, and watched people walking by. Then, when a woman walking her dog came closer to me, i stood up to leave but then thought about it again. I decided to stay there for another five minutes or so. As I was watching the dogs playing in the grass, two cats came towards me from underneath a bush nearby. 
 
 One of them seemed familiar to me; it had been following my around last year. It was still very skinny and looked like it hadn't eaten in days. Then I saw another cat, younger, who didn't seem to be as hungry yet but looked scared. They were both watching me without moving. 
 
 I bent down to pet the older one first. He had patches of fur missing and was very thin; his eyes seemed to shine even though they were cloudy with cataracts. I leaned down towards him and scratched behind his ear, and he closed his eyes happily and started purring loudly. 
 
 Then I went over to the younger one, who still looked a bit scared of me but didn't try to run away. When I started petting him too, he slowly began to relax, and stopped looking scared. 
 
 After that, both cats stayed on the grass by my feet as if they were waiting for something. I kept scratching their heads gently for a while. Then one of them stretched out its head towards me, licked my hand and closed his eyes again happily. I stroked him and watched him closing his eyes slowly. 
 
 After a long time passed like that, both cats got up from the grass and walked away slowly, looking satisfied with what they had done. I stayed there for another ten minutes to make sure that they really left, then got up and continued my walk home. When I was halfway back, I realized that I was not hungry at all; in fact, I felt very calm and happy about everything that happened today. 
 
 I smiled as I thought of how the doctor had asked me if there was anything on my mind recently, then told me that everything was fine even when he knew perfectly well it wasn't. Then I laughed out loud thinking about his asking if there was anything else. As I walked home I wondered what kind of stories these two cats could tell each other if they ever met. 
 
 When I got back, my house was dark so I let myself in through the backdoor and went straight to the kitchen. Then i remembered that my mom had asked me to buy eggs, so I put some butter on a plate and poached them for her. I also cut up some cheese slices and made myself a sandwich because I didn't feel like cooking anything more complicated today. 
 
 After having lunch, I went upstairs and took off my clothes. Then I got in the shower to wash myself before going to sleep. It had been two years since i last saw those cats so I decided to try to remember their names, though I couldn't think of either of them right now. Afterwards I put on a pair of pajamas and went to my bedroom to lie down. 
 
 As soon as I lay down, I realized that something was missing; i didn't know what it was but felt like something was out of place somehow. I got up and sat back down again and looked around the room for a moment then decided there really wasn't anything out of place. Then i felt my phone in my pocket, picked it up and looked at it, then realized that no one had called me all day, even though i was expecting my ex boyfriend to call. 
 
 I opened my messages and saw an unread message from him and immediately started to panic; a few days before the appointment, he had messaged me saying that we should talk about some things when i came in for my physical today. I had ignored his message then but now realized that I didn't even know what day it was . 
 
 I tried to call him but got no answer. Then i called another of my ex boyfriend's numbers, which is the one he used when we lived together and he picked up on the second ring. I asked him if he had heard anything from my other ex boyfriend yet and he told me that they were at a friend's place but would call me as soon as he got home. 
 
 I thanked him and said i didn't know what day it was, which confused him because he thought we talked about this already yesterday. I then asked if he had called my other ex boyfriend yet to find out where he is . He told me that he did call but his friend answered the phone instead and didn't pass the message on to my other ex boyfriend. 
 
 I thanked him again, hung up and tried calling my other ex boyfriend once more. This time, someone picked up who i guessed was a woman from their household because she told me that my boyfriend wasn't there but would call back soon. She didn't know when he would be home or what his number is. 
 
 I tried to remember where the note with those numbers was so i could ask them again if they had heard anything from him, and realized that it must still be in my wallet which i must have left somewhere earlier. Then i started feeling even more panic and felt like something really bad must have happened to him because i remembered that he always calls me back after our talks. 
 
 I tried calling him again and this time i got no answer so i went out of the house again looking for my wallet, which i had lost earlier today when i was still outside at the park. As soon as i walked out of the door, the two cats from before came up to me again as if they were waiting for something. 
 
 I bent down to pet them again and then got back on my feet and told them that their names are Oscar and Felix and asked them what they were doing there. They rubbed their noses against my hand, then followed me back inside the house without letting go of each other's tails. As soon as i walked in, i saw that the two cats had come into the house to have a rest. 
 
 I got off my shoes and let them on the sofa and watched them for some time before getting up again to look through my purse where i thought the note might be. Then i found it and called my ex boyfriend's number again, only to hear that his friend answered the phone once more. 
 
 I tried calling him a few more times but still didn't get an answer and started to feel really nervous now because he never leaves me messages when he knows that we are not going to talk anyway. Then i realized that the last number of my ex boyfriend's that i called was one which his friend had given me in case my other ex boyfriend needed to contact him directly, but if they couldn't find him at home then they would call this number. 
 
 I tried calling that number and this time the person who picked up didn't know where he was either; she told me that he was supposed to be back in an hour or so from a meeting. I asked her how i could find out if his friend knows anything about him, but she said they haven't been able to get through to anyone else who might know and that nobody had any news at all. 
 
 I thanked the woman and then went back outside, feeling more and more nervous now because it was getting darker and i knew he would be home soon from work. Then one of the cats looked at me again and i saw a note in his col
