A young woman named Jen was exploring an old underground facility deep beneath the earth's surface. She had heard rumors of the place for years, but never dared to visit until now. As she made her way down a long dark hallway, she noticed that the light from her flashlight seemed to be getting weaker and weaker. She could see dust everywhere, and it was making her cough and sneeze. Suddenly, something moved in the corner of her eye. She froze in place, holding her breath as she turned around slowly. There was a strange figure standing there, watching her with an unblinking stare.
