illuminating little pockets of dust before it hits something solid at her feet. She leans down to inspect what she found . "Jeff? Is that you?"

The light shone from the torch reveals a face covered in dirt and grime - like any good soldier would be. He peels his fingers away, brushing off some of the dust. His eyes meet hers, then he looks down at himself. A small smile creeps up on his face when he sees that she recognized him. "Well met."

Jen is surprised to hear a voice coming from Jeff - she expected silence and death or something like that! She turns around and yells over her shoulder, "Hey! It's ok!" She turns back around and starts digging through the small bags she brought with her. Finding one of them, she hands it out to him. In it there is some water, a few protein bars, and a couple of power gels. Jeff looks at the bag for a bit before taking everything out. "What's your name?"

"Jeff!" He replies as he starts eating the food in front of him. "Hey Jen! It's been a while." A bit of water also goes down his throat and he finishes it off with a bite of protein bar. The smile never leaves his face. Jeff seems to be enjoying himself for once, but the moment is short lived as he spots something moving on the other side of the door . "Shit."

Jen turns around quickly when she feels Jeff's hand on her arm - and just in time too! The sound of someone kicking against the door makes it rattle violently. She looks at Jeff, who is staring intently at their visitor. She hears a whispered word from his mouth as if to remind her what they both have been through . He looks back at the door and sighs loudly. "Ok...this might be interesting."

Jeff's eyes are fixed on the other side of the bunker as the kicking against the door starts again. The sounds get louder until Jen can hear voices beyond the door, and then she can see a figure - or rather, several figures in black armor outside her bunker. They look like they have a key to open the door . "Shit."

The sounds get louder until Jen can hear voices beyond the door, and then she can see a figure - or rather, several figures in black armor outside her bunker. They look like they have a key to open the door . "Shit."

Jen moves closer to Jeff, grabbing one of her guns as she does so. She puts it on the table where he can reach for it easily while she gets another weapon out from under the table. Her movements are quick and fluid - she seems to be in complete control as she prepares herself for whatever is coming through the door. Jeff's face shows nothing but determination at this point, his eyes fixed on the approaching enemies. "Ok...let's do this."

Jen gets ready with her gun and looks around the room. She sees a small window in the corner of the bunker - she quickly checks to see if it has a view outside . It does! She quickly looks through the window, but doesn't see anything out of place...yet. Then she hears a noise coming from behind Jeff.

"Shit." The sound is loud enough for both of them to hear even though they were in the middle of their conversation. Jen turns around and sees someone standing behind Jeff with a gun pointed at his head. She looks back at Jeff, her eyebrow raised as if to ask him what to do . He simply nods at her - she knows it's time to take care of business. "Jeff," she says quietly before putting the muzzle of her gun on her temple and pulling the trigger.

The sound of the shot rings out through the bunker, echoing off the walls. Jen is thrown back by the force of the recoil and her head hits the table with a loud thud. Her body collapses to the ground as blood seeps from the wound on her forehead. "Jeff!" She turns towards him but it's too late - his face shows no emotion, just determination as he puts the gun right next to the intruder's head and pulls the trigger.

The sound of the shot rings out through the bunker, echoing off the walls. Jeff is thrown back by the force of the recoil and his body collapses to the ground beside Jen . The intruder in black armor doesn't stand a chance against two highly trained soldiers - their bodies fall limply on top of each other with no sign of life left in them. It seems like their fight is over, but then there's a sudden movement from the corner of the room.

Jeff looks up to see a figure moving towards him and Jen. The person is carrying something that catches his eye - it's a black box that he recognizes as a drone . It seems like they're not quite dead yet, but Jeff is prepared for whatever comes next. He stands back up with the help of the table and pulls out a gun from his belt.

"Who are you?" The voice that emanates from the drone is surprisingly feminine and smooth. It seems like it's been recorded before - not the sort of voice Jeff would expect from someone who looks as rough as they do. He stares at the figure moving towards him, his gun still trained on them. "I have a question for you...do you think this is over?"

Jen isn't sure what to make of the situation - she can only see half of it since she's been knocked out by the force of her own gunshot wound . When Jeff looks at her and asks if they should answer, she shakes her head no. She can't do anything more for them, she feels like she's already done enough. Her eyes close as she thinks about what to do next - it seems like this whole ordeal is finally over.

Jeff turns towards the drone and stares at it for a moment before looking back at Jen. She looks small and helpless lying on the ground, her head bleeding from that last bullet wound. He sighs deeply as if he was just given a huge burden to carry. "Ok...I'll answer your question."

The drone moves closer to them, its camera eye fixed on Jeff's face. "Your answers will be recorded and stored in my database," the voice coming from the drone says. "You have until I reach you - that is, until I touch you with my mechanical arm - or I will kill both of you."

Jeff looks at the drone for a moment before looking back at Jen. He stares at her for a long while, as if he's trying to convey something without words . Finally, he steps towards her and pulls her up from the ground, lifting her gently off the floor with his arm around her waist. "Let's go," he says quietly before walking out of the bunker with Jen in his arms.

As they step outside, the drone moves closer to them, its mechanical arm reaching towards them as if it was trying to touch them. Jeff looks back at the doorway and shakes his head slightly - a sad smile on his face. "I don't know about you, but I think this is definitely over."

Jen seems to be in shock when she wakes up - she doesn't seem to understand what just happened. She looks around for Jeff but sees only the bodies of the intruders on top of each other. The sounds of fighting still echo through her mind though, and so does the sound of the gunshot that took them out. She reaches down and touches the wound on her head - she's bleeding a bit and it looks like she could use some stitches but otherwise seems fine.

She sees Jeff standing in front of her with his arms open, waiting for her to come to him. She doesn't understand what he's doing, but knows that he always had her back even when she wasn't aware of it . "Jeff?"

"It's ok Jen," He says quietly as if he was trying to soothe a frightened child. "We need to go now."
