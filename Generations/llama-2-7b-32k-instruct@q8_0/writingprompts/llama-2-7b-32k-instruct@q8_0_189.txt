time. The man in front of him moved but he didn't even blink; he wasn't about to give up his seat when all the people around him had done so. This was what he lived for, waiting for trains late at night because there were no other times that a person could stand this close to another human and not say a word to them.
The train came in loud and sudden, jerking and bobbing as it stopped; he stepped up onto the platform, walking down the car and picking his seat carefully. He was always careful because after all these years of riding the subway, he had perfected his ability to read the train and know exactly when to step off without falling or tripping on someone's foot. It wasn't an easy skill but it was a fun one.
The man in front of him stood up; he looked tired as if he had been running for hours. "You don't need that seat," the man said, gesturing towards the empty seat beside the door with his chin. "I can give you my seat." He smiled pleasantly before leaning forward and placing a hand on his knee, resting it there as if he was about to stand back up at any moment.
The train started moving; the man in front of him sighed, making room for the other passenger and thanking them as he stepped off onto the platform. The man kept walking but stopped at the next stop, stepping off quickly again before the person who had just left could get away from him. He wanted to catch their attention but knew that it was more likely than not that he wouldn't be able to find his way back through the crowd in time; instead, he went with plan b and began to follow them as they walked down the aisle of the train.
He kept an eye on him from behind, knowing that if this man didn't turn around at some point then it would have been for nothing. The guy was walking quickly and had managed to get himself a seat in the car farthest away from his own but he could still see him through the crowd of people who were already seated. He got on the train, making sure that he stood as close to this man as possible; if they were going to go off together then it would be better for both of them if he kept the person close to him.
He watched as the other man finally looked around to see where they were and who else was on the train; the man stared back at him with a smile that seemed forced but welcoming nonetheless, gesturing towards his seat. The man sitting next to him scooted over, giving up her seat to let the guy sit down too. He smiled gratefully as he sat down, turning around and looking out the window for a moment before looking back at her again.
"You don't have to give your seat up," she said with a smile; "there's plenty of room for everyone." She gestured towards him again, making sure that he knew where she was talking about. The man looked away from her, refusing to make eye contact and instead looking down at his feet; the woman frowned but let it go.
The train lurched forward as it left the station; the man sitting next to the window leaned against the side of the car while the one on the aisle sat back in his chair, his head resting against the seat and closing his eyes for a moment. The man following him stayed close but not too close, making sure that he still had room to move if needed.
He watched as the guy finally opened his eyes again; he looked around once more before turning towards the window again and letting out a low whistle at something on the street. He looked like someone who was used to being alone or at least didn't have anyone to keep him company. The man following him was about to try talking to him when all of a sudden the man sitting next to the guy spoke up, "You know what? I don't really feel comfortable with you standing here, dude," he said in a voice that was quiet but still loud enough for everyone on the train to hear.
The two people exchanged a look; they both knew that this wasn't going to end well and yet neither of them seemed able to let it go. The man on the aisle leaned forward, resting his head back against the seat again while the one who was sitting next to him put an arm around the stranger and began to whisper something into their ear; the two men continued to whisper together as they stood at the door of the train car.
The people in the seats in between them seemed to notice what was going on, giving the two a dirty look before turning away and closing their eyes once more. The guy that the man following had been staring at looked back up but didn't seem to see him; he instead turned towards his friend and started talking to him again, nodding his head in agreement as if there was some sort of secret between them.
The train lurched forward once again; the people on this side of the car were getting off so it would be safe for him to step out now. He watched as the guy that he had been following started walking towards the door, taking a few steps at a time before finally stopping and standing in front of him. The man who was sitting next to him looked up once more before stepping forward and grabbing the stranger's arm; the two men began to argue in low voices but the people around them were all too focused on their own lives that they didn't even bother to turn back to see what was happening.
The man tried to reason with his friend, "Look, I don't mean to be rude or anything like that but can you just sit next to me for a little bit? You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to; I just thought it would be nice to ride the train together. It won't be too bad." The stranger looked up, his eyes finally meeting those of the man who had been following him, and for a moment there was something in them that made the man feel warm and fuzzy inside.
The guy finally smiled at him but it wasn't enough; he wanted to see more, maybe even feel some sort of connection with this stranger. The two men locked eyes again as the train pulled into the station where they both had to get off anyway. It was almost as if time stood still, as though no one else on the train was around for that moment at all.
"Fuck you," the man said quietly; he turned away from his friend and took a few steps down the platform before stopping. He stared out into the distance but instead of seeing what lay ahead of him, he saw nothing. All he could see were two men who had been friends for as long as he could remember.
The guy stood there looking back at the man; they both knew that this wasn't how it was supposed to go down. The train started moving again and the two men parted ways, each one walking their own way home, each one thinking about what had just happened for a very long time afterwards.
This is based off of an idea that I came up with while watching another video but the only thing that I changed was the ending; it's much more hopeful than the ending in the original video. As always, please let me know what you thought!
[INST] this is really well done - it would be cool if you added a bit of commentary to each scene [/INST]

1 / 2The bags under his eyes felt like a rich leather that he could never afford. He stood on the train platform, standing perfectly still as hordes of others pushed and shoved to make it to their train on time.
