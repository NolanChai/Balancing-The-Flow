Don looked around the room, taking it all in. There was an empty bottle of liquor on the nightstand and another bottle that he thought might have been perfume. The sheets were crumpled up and stained with what might have been blood or ketchup. Don felt sick to his stomach and decided he needed to leave immediately. He quickly found some clothes, threw them on, and left the room as quietly as possible.
