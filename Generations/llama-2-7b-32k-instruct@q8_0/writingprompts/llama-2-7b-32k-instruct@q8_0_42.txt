The young man had been in the drug trade for several years now and had never known anyone like Summer before. She was unlike any other person he'd ever met; she was intelligent, witty, and always down to party. He'd been hooked on her since they first met, despite the fact that he couldn't really remember how their relationship started because of all the drugs he had taken. But what Summer lacked in memories, she made up for in excitement and fun times. The young man spent most of his time with her, taking trips to different parts of the city and doing everything from attending concerts to getting tattoos together. He'd never felt more alive than when he was with her by his side.

But despite all the good things about Summer, there was one problem: she was a drug dealer. And not just any drug dealer - she sold heroin. The young man had tried it before and didn't like it much, but Summer convinced him that it was the best high you could possibly have. She showed him how to inject it into his arm, how to hide it from his family, and how to tell people he was doing "research" when they asked what he did for a living. The young man knew it wasn't right, but he couldn't resist Summer and her charms.

As the young man turned 25 today, he realized that he had been addicted to heroin for months now, all because of this girl. He remembered how she'd first introduced him to the drug and how it had slowly taken over his life since then. He'd started skipping work and school, lying to his family about where he was going, and neglecting his old friends in favor of her. And yet, despite all the bad things that came with being addicted to heroin, he still couldn't resist Summer. She made him feel alive like no one else could.

The young man realized that he needed help but didn't know where to start. He tried talking to Summer about it, but she just laughed and said, "Aw, come on! Don't be such a wimp. You're addicted to me, not heroin." It was clear that she had no intention of ever letting him go. The young man knew he had to do something drastic to break the cycle before it was too late.

As he turned 25, the young man decided to leave Summer behind and start a new life for himself. He packed his bags and moved out of their shared apartment, taking only the few things that would help him get on his feet. It wasn't an easy decision, but he knew it was the right one. He had to get away from the drugs and the person who introduced them to him in the first place if he ever wanted to have a shot at a real life.

As the young man started his new life, he couldn't help but look back on all the good times he'd had with Summer. But more importantly, he knew that he was doing the right thing by leaving her behind and starting fresh. He had to keep reminding himself of that as he navigated his way through this new chapter in his life - because sometimes, the hardest part about making a change is not the decision itself, but living with it afterward.

The young man hoped that one day, Summer would understand why he had to leave her behind and move on. He knew it was possible that she wouldn't, but he also knew that he couldn't let his addiction to her hold him back from achieving the life he wanted for himself. And so, with a heavy heart, he continued forward on his journey, knowing that there would be ups and downs along the way - but also knowing that he was finally taking control of his own destiny in a way that he hadn't before.
