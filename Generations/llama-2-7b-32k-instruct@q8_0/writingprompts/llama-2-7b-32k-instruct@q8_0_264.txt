that lie within these walls. And then once they see something move they freak out and run away never to be seen again. But it's all right, they will be back tomorrow or the day after. They always come back because no matter how much I scare them, the fear is so great they can't help themselves, they must know more. The only problem with that is there are too many of them and they keep coming in waves. Soon this whole world will be running away from this house screaming like little babies.

I don't blame them though, I wouldn't want to see this either if I didn't have to. If only they knew what waited for them here, I would let them in but instead it is their choice to leave with a glimpse of what will happen when they are ready. It is their right to know so that maybe they will come back and be prepared for what is ahead of them. For many years this house has sat empty with nothing coming out from the inside, just me waiting for someone to pay me a visit. But I can't sit here forever, I have to make sure my family will still be okay once I am gone. So if you think you are strong enough come on in and see what lies ahead for yourself because no one else has been able to do it so far. Just don't say I didn't warn you.

I wish you luck on your endeavors,
The caretaker.

Now go in this old house if you dare. It is a big ol creepy mansion, and I think that some spooks might be lurking around waiting to scare the wits out of you! But it's all fun and games until something gets inside your head and makes you lose sleep.

Sincerely,
The caretaker

I have been here for decades. I have lost track of time at this point. Every night is the same, I wait and wait till some brave soul decides to enter this old mansion and try to make contact with them that lie within these walls. And then once they see something move they freak out and run away never to be seen again. But it's all right, they will be back tomorrow or the day after. They always come back because no matter how much I scare them, the fear is so great they can't help themselves, they must know more.
