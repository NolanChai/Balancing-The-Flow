In 2011, researchers at the University of Iowa published a study in the Journal of Neuroscience in which they conducted a similar experiment with nine male college students who were shown pictures of people being shocked and asked them if they would volunteer for such an experiment. The results showed that the participants had a tendency to press a button that gave themselves a mild electrical shock, but not a strong one
