that surround me . The door opened from behind and out walked the most beautiful man ever. He had long brown wavy hair, green eyes, high cheekbones and full lips. His skin was a golden tan, like an alabaster statue but not as dry. He wore a white shirt and pants that hugged his muscular physique perfectly. I took my time admiring the man in front of me, taking it all in . Once I had him figured out, I looked up at him with a bright smile and said “Hi. You must be the famous Loki.” He nodded and took one step forward towards me but then froze in place like he was afraid to touch me. I laughed softly and stood from my chair and went to meet him half way across the table. We shook hands and as our fingers touched, we both sighed happily. A deep warmth spread throughout my body and I couldn't help but blush at this man .

Me: Hi Loki! So nice to finally meet you face-to-face after all of these years. Can I get your autograph for a friend? He's a big fan of yours

Loki: Of course, what's his name?

Me: His name is Thor. *giggles*

Loki: *looks down at me with a smirk on his face and says in a playful tone* Oh I see... You have no idea how badly he wants my autograph then do you.

Me: He'll be thrilled to receive it from the original owner! So, tell me Loki. What is your favorite color?

Loki: My favorite color? Hmmm... *looks up and takes in all of the colors surrounding us* I guess that would have to be blue. Especially indigo blue, what about you?

Me: My favorite color is blue too. *smiles softly* But it's more than a color for me. It symbolizes the vastness of the sky and the sea; a constant reminder of how small I am in comparison to all that surrounds us. What does it mean to you?

Loki: To me, blue is tranquility and serenity. It's like a gentle breeze caressing my skin or a soothing balm for my soul. *his eyes soften as he looks down at me* It reminds me that there are still moments of peace and calm in this world, even when everything seems to be falling apart.

Me: That's beautiful Loki! I have to admit, you have a way with words. Do you have any favorite quotes or sayings?

Loki: *smirks* Oh yes, I do have a few... My all-time favorite is "I don't always lie, but when I do, it's the truth." It's so much fun to play with people's expectations and perceptions. But my other favorites are more poignant, like "Time heals all wounds, but it doesn't erase the scars" or "The only way out is through". They all speak to something deep inside of me, some pain I've experienced or am still experiencing. It's a way for me to channel my emotions and make sense of this crazy life we live.

Me: I see what you mean! Those are very powerful quotes. If I could only have one superpower, it would be the power to heal. *looks up at Loki* What's your favorite thing to do on a rainy day?

Loki: Oh, that's an easy one! On a rainy day, my favorite thing to do is curl up with a good book and lose myself in its pages. There's something so comforting about the sound of rain pattering against the window, the smell of freshly washed earth, and the feeling of warmth emanating from a good story. It's like a little bit of heaven on earth. What about you?

Me: I love to read too but my favorite thing to do is dance in the rain. *grins* Do you have any secret talents or hidden abilities that no one knows about?

Loki: Oh, I've got a few... Like most people with a bit of magic running through their veins, I have a talent for illusions and slight-of-hand tricks. But my real talent lies in the realm of words. I have a way with them that allows me to bend reality to my will. It's like poetry or music; it's all about the right combination of notes and syllables, the right rhythm and cadence. It's a language all its own, one that can create worlds and shift perspectives in an instant. *looks up at me with a wink* But don't tell anyone I told you, it's my little secret.

Me: I won't breathe a word! You have any hobbies?

Loki: *chuckles and leans back in his chair* Well, aside from my artistic pursuits, I'm also an avid gardener. There's something so therapeutic about watching plants grow and bloom, feeling the sun on your skin, and listening to the sound of birds chirping in the trees. It's like a little slice of heaven on earth, and it allows me to connect with nature in a way that I otherwise might not have been able to. *looks up at me with a twinkle in his eye* Do you have any hobbies, my dear?

Me: I love music! I play the flute and piano. Whenever I'm feeling down or anxious, I can always find solace in music. It has a way of lifting my spirits and soothing my soul. *smiles softly* What is your favorite type of food?

Loki: Oh, that's an easy one! My favorite type of food is... well, I'd have to say, it would be... hmph. Let me see... I guess you could say I have a bit of a sweet tooth. So, desserts are my go-to. *grins mischievously* What about you?

Me: That sounds like a good plan! I love chocolate too, but when it comes to food I'm pretty easy going and can enjoy just about anything as long as it's cooked well. But there is one thing that I absolutely cannot resist and that is sushi. The moment the waiter brings out my plate of delicious sashimi, my taste buds come alive and I'm in heaven!

Loki: *nods* Oh, I can definitely see how that would be a hardship to overcome. *looks up at me with a mischievous grin* So, my dear, what do you say we continue this conversation over some delicious sushi and sake? It's the perfect way to spend an afternoon in the company of the beautiful Lady Sif!

Me: That sounds like a fantastic plan Loki. *laughs* I'd love that! 

[Scene cuts out abruptly as my mind is flooded with images of what this meeting could have been like]

Me: [to myself] How amazing would it be if these scenes actually happened? What a beautiful way to end the night, with Loki and me sharing sushi together. *smiles softly* Maybe I should save those stories for another time...

[I find myself in my bed, my mind racing with thoughts of what could have been. I realize that Loki's presence has had a profound effect on me, even though he never physically touched me. My heart is full and my soul feels at peace, like it did when I was a child playing with my dolls or writing in my diary. The feeling of connection and understanding is unlike anything I have ever experienced before.]

Me: [to myself] This has been an incredible experience. Loki, thank you for taking the time to speak to me today. I'll cherish these moments forever. 

[As I drift off into a peaceful slumber, I can't help but feel like there are still so many unanswered questions that only he could provide answers to. But for now, my mind is at rest and my heart feels full. I know that wherever Loki goes from here, he will continue to make his mark on the world in a way that only he can.]

[I wake up feeling refreshed and energized. As I get ready for bed, I find myself thinking about our conversation. I can't help but feel a sense of wonderment at what could have been, had we met in person. My mind is filled with images of us sitting together, sharing laughter and stories, and even the possibility of him taking my hand and placing it on his cheek as he speaks to me. The thought fills me with a feeling of longing that I can't quite shake off. But at the same time, I know that this is just a fantasy and that reality has its own way of unfolding.]

Me: [to myself] As much as it pains me to admit it, Loki will always remain a mystery to me. He
