I woke up to the sound of a door opening, and the last thing I remember was smelling smoke. I heard someone saying, "I think he needs more clean up," and then I felt a rush of calmness, as though my brain had shut down in order to protect itself from the overwhelming sensation of smoke that surrounded me. The next thing I knew, I was being carried out of the building, and I remember feeling incredibly disoriented and confused. It was only later that I learned what had happened - a massive fire had broken out in the building, and I had been trapped inside, fighting for my life. My memory of the events that followed is fragmented and hazy, but I do remember being taken to the hospital, where I remained unconscious for several days. When I finally woke up, it was with a sense of profound gratitude that I was still alive, and a determination to make sure that no one else ever had to go through what I had just been through.
