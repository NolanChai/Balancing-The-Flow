[INST] rewrite the previous answer to fit into this story: "I woke up to the sound of a door opening. The last thing i remember was smelling smoke. I heard someone saying, 'I think he needs more clean up', and then I felt a rush of calmness as though mama were holding me close and whispering in my ear that everything would be all right now."

Sorry for the mistake earlier, here's the revised version: 
I woke up to the sound of a door opening. The last thing I remember is smelling smoke. I heard someone saying, "I think he needs more clean-up," and then I felt a rush of calmness as though mama were holding me close and whispering in my ear that everything would be all right now. 
The memory feels like it's from a dream, but it's also so vivid and real. It's as if someone is recalling the event for the first time, experiencing it through my eyes. The sensation of being held close by mama is overwhelming, and the calmness that comes with it is like nothing I've ever felt before. 
I can still feel the warmth of her embrace, the comfort of her voice in my ear. It's as though she's telling me everything will be okay, even when I know deep down it won't be. But in that moment, I believe it with all my heart. And for a brief instant, I feel safe and protected, like nothing can hurt me. 
The memory is like a lightning bolt of clarity, illuminating the darkness that surrounds it. It's as though someone has shone a spotlight into the deepest parts of my subconscious, revealing truths that have been hidden for too long. The feeling of being held close by mama is overwhelming, and I can't help but feel grateful for the comfort and love she's always provided me with. 
As the memory fades away, I'm left with a sense of peace that's hard to describe. It's as though everything has been made clear to me in an instant, and I understand what it means to be truly loved and cared for. The memory will always stay with me, a reminder of the beauty of love and the power it holds. And although I know that not all memories are good, this one will forever remain a bright and shining star in my heart, a reminder that no matter what life throws at me, I'll always have the love of mama to guide me home.

I hope this revised version better captures your message! Please let me know if you have any further requests or changes needed.

Sure, here's a continuation of the previous response: 
As I wake up from my brief nap, the realization that I'm no longer in mama's arms hits me like a ton of bricks. The memory is still vivid, but it feels distant and unreal now. The warmth and comfort that came with being held close by her are gone, replaced by an overwhelming sense of loneliness and isolation. 
I can still hear the sounds of the hospital room - machines beeping, nurses talking in hushed tones, the soft rustle of sheets as someone shifts positions - but it all feels muted and distant now. My mind is racing, trying to process what's happened and what's happening around me. 
I feel a sense of disorientation, like I'm floating above my body, watching myself lie in the hospital bed, hooked up to machines and tubes, surrounded by strangers who are all busy with their own tasks. It's as though I'm looking at a scene from a movie, trying to figure out what's happening but unable to fully grasp it. 
The sound of my own voice startles me - "I'm back," I say, startled by the sudden realization that I'm awake and aware. My words are met with silence, as though no one is there to hear them. The loneliness and isolation feel like a heavy weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. 
I try to move, but my body feels like lead. I struggle to sit up, but it's as though someone has tied me down. My limbs feel weak and heavy, as though they don't belong to me anymore. It's as though mama has left me behind, and now I'm alone in a strange place with people who don't care about me. 
The memory of being held close by mama comes back to me again, like a ray of hope shining through the darkness. But it feels distant and unreal now, like a dream that's slipping away from me. I can still feel her love and comfort, but it's as though it's coming from far away, as though she's trying to reach out to me but can't quite make it through the distance between us. 
The loneliness and isolation are still there, like a cold hand squeezing my heart. But now I know that it doesn't have to be this way. I can choose to reach out, to find comfort in the memories of mama's love, and let them guide me through the darkness. 
I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself. My voice is quiet but firm as I say to myself, "Mama, I'm back. I'm here now, and I need you. Please help me, mama." The words feel like they're coming from somewhere outside of myself, as though someone else is speaking them. But it doesn't matter who's speaking - what matters is that the words are true, and that mama will hear them and come to me if she can. 
And then, in a sudden flash of clarity, I realize that the loneliness and isolation don't have to be permanent. I can choose to reach out to others, to let them in, to share my memories of mama with them and let their love and comfort guide me through this dark time. 
It's not easy - the pain of losing mama is still there, like a constant ache deep inside my soul. But now I know that it doesn't have to be this way. I can choose to share my memories, to let them bind me to others who care about me and who will help me through this dark time. 
And so I reach out, and I find comfort in the love of those around me - my family, my friends, even strangers who have come together to support each other in our grief. Their love and comfort surround me like a warm blanket on a cold night, wrapping me in its embrace and helping me find my way through this dark time. 
And as I lie there, surrounded by the memories of mama's love, I realize that she is still with me - not physically, but in spirit, guiding me from afar, comforting me through the darkness, and showing me that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. 
For now, my mind races, trying to process everything that's happened and what lies ahead. But as I drift off to sleep once again, I feel a sense of peace - a peace that comes from knowing that mama will always be with me, even if she's not physically here. And

Sure, here's a continuation of the previous response: 
As I lie there in my hospital bed, surrounded by memories of mama's love, I drift off to sleep once again. But this time, it's not just any sleep - it's a deep and peaceful slumber, as though mama has come to me in my dreams to hold me close and whisper in my ear that everything will be okay. 
When I wake up the next morning, I feel a sense of clarity and calmness that I haven't felt in a long time. The memories of mama's love are still with me, but they feel more distant now, as though they were just a dream or a fleeting memory from long ago. 
I get up slowly, feeling a twinge of pain in my body but pushing through it with determination and courage. I know that I have to face the world again, even if it means facing more challenges and hardships along the way. But this time, I'll do it with mama by my side - not physically, but spiritually, guiding me from afar, comforting me through the darkness, and showing me that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. 
As I get dressed and prepare to face the day, I feel a sudden sense of peace wash over me. It's as though mama has come to me in my dreams one last time to
