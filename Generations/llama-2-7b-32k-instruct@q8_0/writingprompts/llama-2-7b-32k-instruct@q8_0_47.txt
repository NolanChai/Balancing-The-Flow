"I tried looking it up but couldn't find any information about how to get on Undercover Boss."

Here are 3 possible completions for the story:
1. "I looked under every rock and turned over every leaf, but I couldn't find anything."
2. "I searched high and low, even went to the library, but nothing came up."
3. "I checked the internet, called my friends, and did some research, but no one knew how either."
