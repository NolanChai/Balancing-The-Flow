He was looking for a file and I just happened to have it open on my laptop screen when he walked in. It had been playing on a loop for the last twenty-four hours. 

The video showed me and my friends at the party, laughing and drinking. We looked carefree and happy, like we didn't have a care in the world. 

But that was before everything changed. 

Before I saw him standing over me with that file in his hands. Before he accused me of cheating on my fiance with him. Before he ruined everything I had worked for. 

As I sat there, frozen, he stared at me intensely. He knew I was lying, and I could tell that he wasn't going to let this go. 

I tried to think of a response, but my mind went blank. All I could do was stammer out an apology and wait for him to yell at me some more. 

But then, suddenly, his demeanor changed. He got up from his chair and walked over to the door. Before leaving, he paused and looked back at me one last time. 

"Me? Really?" he said with a smirk. "Don't worry about it. I know you had a good reason for cheating on your fiance." 

He winked at me and then left the room, shutting the door behind him. 

I stared at the closed door, trying to make sense of what just happened. Had he just threatened my fiance? Why was he acting like it was no big deal that I cheated on him with another man? 

My mind raced as I tried to piece together what had just occurred. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make sense of his bizarre behavior. 

I knew I had to tell my fiance what happened, but I was unsure if he would believe me or not. Would he think that I was making it up? Or worse, would he be angry with me for cheating on him? 

The thought made my heart race faster. I felt like I was being watched and judged by someone unknown. 

I looked around the room, but no one was there. Just me and the laptop screen that played a loop of us at the party. 

My fiance had been right about me cheating on him with another man. And now, it seemed, he was going to have to face the consequences. 

But who was he? Why did he know about my affair? And what did he want from me? 

These questions ran through my mind as I tried to make sense of the strange encounter. But no matter how hard I tried, the answers remained elusive. 

And so, I sat there, frozen in fear, waiting for something to happen. For someone to come crashing through that closed door and reveal themselves to me. 

But nothing happened. The silence was deafening as my mind raced with questions and doubts. 

I knew that whatever was about to happen, it would change everything.
