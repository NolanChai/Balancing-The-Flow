ynical about it. There may be more to this than meets the eye.' 
 
 He chuckled and leaned back in his chair again, crossing his legs. 
 
 `` If you insist on being stubborn, I will have to tell Dr. Grey to put you under a sedative until further notice . She has threatened me with that many times before." 
 
 I rolled my eyes at the suggestion and pulled out my phone, pretending to check my messages while he watched. He was right about one thing; she did threaten him like that all the time. And if Dr. Grey threatened me with sedatives, I would n't blink an eye in taking them . But it also meant I could use it against her too. 
 
 ''You're not a doctor,' he reminded me.'' 
 
 He was right about that, of course, but the fact remained; she could still take away my phone and monitor me if she wanted to. She had threatened to do just that when she told me I could n't have visitors and when she said I could only check my messages once a week . And while Dr. Grey was n't exactly wrong about some of her rules, I was getting fed up with the fact that they were never explained to me beforehand. 
 
 The most recent one? Not having any visitors until I was out of detention. At least give me an explanation! Instead, she just told me to go sit in my room and read a book . And I did, for two hours before I snuck into the lounge area with my phone. That was what led me here; if Dr. Grey found out about that, it could land me right back in detention . 
 
 As he continued to stare at me, waiting for a response, I realized there was no point arguing any longer . He had already made up his mind and was waiting for my consent to do whatever the hell he wanted with me. Since my options were limited anyway, I could either give it or not . 
 
 I took a deep breath before answering him . 
 
 ``Fine,'' I muttered, feeling my shoulders slump in defeat. He smiled and leaned forward, placing his elbows on the desk in front of me. 
 
 "Good girl," he said, smugly patting my knee. It was all I could do to keep from snarling at him . 
 
 The door opened behind me, and Dr. Grey entered the room. She had a strange look on her face when she saw me sitting there with Mr. Collins. She glanced at me but did n't say anything. I stood up immediately, not even bothering to collect my things; I just needed to get out of this room before it was too late . 
 
 Dr. Grey eyed me suspiciously and gestured for the man behind the desk to leave us alone. When he did so without hesitation , she turned her attention back on me. She leaned against the edge of Mr. Collins's desk and crossed her arms over her chest, staring me down. 
 
 I stood there with my hands clasped together in front of me . For a moment, I wondered if this was some kind of elaborate trick; Dr. Grey had been known to do things like that before. But when she remained still and said nothing for several seconds after Mr. Collins left the room , I knew it was n't a joke . 
 
 She waited until he was gone completely before she finally spoke . 
 
 ''How dare you disobey my orders?'' 
 
 Her voice shook with anger, but she managed to keep her cool . It was one thing for Dr. Grey to ask me questions; it was another to defy her and give answers without permission. 
 
 I remained silent, not knowing what else to say . 
 
 She sniffed and said, ''Do you have anything to say for yourself?'' 
 
 I did n't know how to respond to that either; the answer she wanted was clearly a simple apology. It might even get me out of detention . 
 
 Before I could respond , however, Dr. Grey began to lecture me on what she thought I had done wrong . 
 
 ''You were told not to leave your room until you were out of detention. You were also told no visitors and only one phone call per week . And yet here you are . And you've been seen with Mr. Collins in his office, which is against policy as well.' 
 
 I kept my mouth shut, waiting for her to finish before I could defend myself; that was the one thing I had learned quickly during my stay at Thornfield. Dr. Grey would rather yell at me than give me a chance to explain things . So I took a deep breath and braced myself for the lecture to come. 
 
 She looked me dead in the eye, her hands on her hips as she leaned forward until our noses touched . ''You will not disobey any orders again.' Do you understand?'' 
 
 I nodded my head quickly; there was no point arguing with Dr. Grey when she got like this . So I simply answered, ''Yes, ma'am.'' 
 
 She looked satisfied for a moment before her expression suddenly shifted. Her face twisted into a mask of anger and hatred . 
 
 ''And you will not give your information to any visitors again.' Do you understand?'' 
 
 I nodded, feeling my heart stop in fear; she had just threatened me twice in one minute . 
 
 She took a step closer before she added, ''If anyone comes here with the intention of hurting you or otherwise harming you, and they get any information out of you, I will take it as a sign that you are willfully giving them permission to do so.' Do you understand?'' 
 
 This time, my head shook slowly in fear . She was threatening me if she found out that someone was trying to harm me; what kind of monster did this woman take after? I wanted to run away from her right then and there. But instead, I nodded again, hoping that it would be enough for her to leave me alone . 
 
 To my relief, she stepped back a bit. But just as Dr. Grey had said, her face twisted into anger once more. She glanced at the door to Mr. Collins's office and then back at me . She reached over her desk and pulled out a form; I could hear the pen scratching across it as she wrote down something . 
 
 When she looked up, Dr. Grey smiled, satisfied with what was in front of her . She held up the paper and said, ''You will stay here until detention is over .'' Her eyes were piercing into me once more before she turned around to leave; she knew I had n't given my consent for that . 
 
 But as soon as Dr. Grey left, I knew what I would have to do . There was no way I could stay here until detention ended with her threatening me like this . She may be a doctor and the director of Thornfield, but she had no right to treat me like property or worse. 
 
 So as soon as she left, I grabbed my backpack from its usual place on the desk where it was hidden underneath my books and headed straight for the door . I did n't care if Dr. Grey caught me; I had to get out of here before anyone else got hurt . 
 
 My only thought was that once I got away, I would find a way to kill her. If she could do this to me, imagine what she would be willing to do to someone who had no one like me? What about the other girls who were in detention and did n't have my resources or my brain? 
 
 As I hurried out of the door, I heard Dr. Grey call out to me . But I was already gone; even if she stopped me, there would be nothing she could do now that I had her written consent not to let me leave . 
 
 And so, I ran away ."

The chapter begins with a conversation between the narrator and Dr. Grey. The narrator is asking about leaving Thornfield, and Dr. Grey refuses to let them go unless they are released early from detention. The narrator then tells us that she was being held in a room against her will at Thornfield, which caused the narrator to run away .

In this chapter, it seems like the narrator is trying to manipulate Dr. Grey by pretending to be cooperative and giving consent. But when Dr. Grey leaves, the narrator quickly runs away, knowing that she's been given written consent not to let her leave . It almost seems as if the narrator knows what she's doing, like she has a plan or something going on in her mind while she is talking with Dr. Grey.

The narrator also talks about how Dr. Grey threatened to have her put under sedatives, which would make her feel and act as if she was fine even though she might not be . It seems like the narrator doesn't really trust anyone at Thornfield, which could explain why they keep running away.

Overall, this chapter is trying to set up the
