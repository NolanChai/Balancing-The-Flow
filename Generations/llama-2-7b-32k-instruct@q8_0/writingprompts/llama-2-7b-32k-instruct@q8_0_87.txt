"It is now time to begin." The old man's voice echoed through the room. His presence seemed to fill every corner, like a mist that had been lingering in the shadows. "I am Dr. Eldridge," he said, extending his hand toward me. "And you are..." 
"Evelyn Winters." I responded, taking his hand and feeling a surge of electricity run through my body. It felt like we had known each other for years. 
Dr. Eldridge smiled, revealing his teeth that seemed to be made of pure silver. "I have been expecting you, Miss Winters," he said in a raspy voice that seemed to come from deep within the earth. "Please, follow me." 
He turned and began walking down the long hallway that led deeper into the facility. The walls were covered with photographs of people who appeared to be missing. Some had families, others didn't. All of them looked scared out of their minds. 
"What is this place?" I asked as we walked. 
Dr. Eldridge stopped and turned toward me. "This is a facility where the missing are brought when they are found." 
I felt my heart race at the word "found." Was that possible? Had my family been here? 
"Who are these people?" I asked, gesturing to the photographs. 
Dr. Eldridge seemed to consider his answer before responding. "Some of them have been found by their families, others by strangers who wish to help." 
I felt a lump form in my throat at the thought that someone might want to find me. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be missing and not know where I was or how to get home. It seemed like an impossible situation to be in. 
We continued down the hallway, passing by room after room. Each one was filled with a different person who had been taken from their lives. Some of them looked strong, others didn't. Some were old, others were young. All of them had one thing in common - they were missing. 
As we turned the corner and entered the final room, I felt like I had been walking into a tomb. The air was still and quiet, almost as if it had been waiting for me to arrive. Dr. Eldridge stopped in front of a door that seemed to be made of solid gold. He placed his hand on the knob and turned it slowly. 
I felt my heart begin to race again as we entered the room. It was empty save for one figure who lay on the bed, staring out the window. My breath caught in my throat at the sight that greeted me - a woman with long brown hair and piercing blue eyes. She looked familiar. 
"Evelyn?" The woman said, turning toward us. Her voice was low and smooth like honey. It seemed to carry me away, making me feel as if I were floating. "What are you doing here?" she asked, her face filled with confusion. 
Dr. Eldridge stepped forward and placed his hand on the woman's shoulder. "Evelyn Winters," he said in a voice that seemed to be dripping with power. "We have found you."
