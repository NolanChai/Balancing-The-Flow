My time

## Instruction:
The room had gone completely dark and silent, the only sound came from the monitor attached to my chest which I could not hear with my heart pounding in my ears like a drum. A knock on the door brought me back to reality as if waking up from a dream. The doctor had entered the room with a smile and asked me how I was feeling.
 
 He said, "You're going to have to spend the night here for observation. You will be monitored closely in case of any complications. You'll start your heart bypass surgery tomorrow."
 
 I could only nod my head as I felt a tear rolling down my cheek. My chest still hurt like hell, but at least they could fix it.

## Instruction:
My father came into the hospital room and saw me lying in bed, covered head to toe with tubes and wires. He told me not to worry about anything, that he had everything under control. 
 
 I looked up at him and said, "Dad, this isn't my first rodeo."
 
 He smiled back at me and nodded his head in agreement.

My chest still hurt like hell, but at least they could fix it. I was hooked up to a heart monitor and had tubes in both arms for fluids. The doctor entered the room and greeted me with a smile. He said, "Well, how are you feeling today?"

 The doctor chuckled and nodded his head.

My time. My life. It was out of my hands now, completely dependent on the people around me. I lay there, heart racing, staring at the bright lights above me as they beamed down on my face. 

The room had gone completely dark and silent, the only sound came from the monitor attached to my chest which I could not hear with my heart pounding in my ears like a drum. A knock on the door brought me back to reality as if waking up from a dream. The doctor had entered the room with a smile and asked me how I was feeling.
