readings to know that something was wrong, he could just feel it in his gut. He scrambled out of his bedchamber and made for the bridge.

As soon as the hisses faded, the lights came on with a click and a hum. The captain took a step forward, stumbling slightly over a piece of equipment that had been kicked out of place by an unseen hand. He swore silently, glancing at the sensor readings before he made another move. There was nothing wrong, he knew it. This ship was like his right arm, and now that arm felt numb.

He continued across the bridge, past the navigation consoles towards the rear of the ship. The crewmen were already awake; their faces lit with fear as they watched him approach. He could feel their eyes on his back, boring into him like laser beams. The captain did n't want to turn around and see their expressions--he knew what he would see there.

The rear of the ship was empty save for a large door that seemed to blend in with the side of the ship itself. It had no visible hinges or seam, just a smooth black panel where it joined the rest of the ship's surface. The captain didn't need to be told what this door was; he could feel its power pulsating through the hull as much as he felt the throbbing in his own temples.

He stabbed the controls, and the door slid aside with a sound that echoed off the walls of the chamber beyond. The captain stepped forward into the darkness. As soon as the door was closed behind him, the lights on the bridge dimmed to blackness. He knew he had no need for them; they wouldn't help in this place anyway.

The captain could feel the ship trembling around him, but it wasn't a fearful tremble. It was as if the ship were trying to communicate with its master. The captain didn't listen. He did n't know how to. He had never been one for feeling out emotions from machines and he doubted that this would be any easier.

The dark tunnel beyond led upwards, into the heart of the ship itself. There was a strange heat emanating from within, warming his back as if it were an open flame. He could feel his hair growing wet with sweat and he knew that he should turn around, go home. But this was n't just any machine; this was his home, and in the end he knew that he could never leave her alone again.

The captain entered a large chamber and stopped short, stunned by what he saw before him. The walls were covered with displays and instruments that seemed to pulse with the same heat that radiated from the center of the chamber. There was no sign of a power source anywhere; there wasn't even an energy signature that he could detect. It was as if some divine light shone from within, warming his face while it made him shake.

But then the captain realized what was wrong. He did n't need to feel anything out from this place, he knew what was causing the malfunction of his ship; he just needed to fix it. The captain walked forward towards a control panel set into the wall before him. His hands moved without hesitation as he accessed a command program that would initiate a shutdown procedure for the power source at the center of this chamber.

Without warning, all of the displays and instruments that lined the walls began to flicker out one by one. The captain felt his heart pound in time with them until they were all gone. There was nothing left but a dark empty room; an abyss that seemed to go on forever. He felt strangely calm, as if he had just awoken from some horrible dream and now found himself alone in the safety of his own bedroom.

The captain stepped forward into the abyss once more, feeling something like relief wash over him at the thought that he could finally go home now. He stared out at an empty space that seemed to stretch on forever before him, hoping that it would bring with it some sign or indication of what had just happened.

But there was nothing. Just a cold blackness. As his eyes wandered across the abyss, he could feel something brush against them; the first touch in days of anything even remotely close to comfort. His lids fell shut as if they weighed a thousand tons each and darkness took him at last into its embrace.

A soft white light filled his field of vision as he woke up, and for a moment he thought he was back in the abyss once more. But then the captain realized that this wasn't a dream; it was reality. He opened his eyes slowly to find himself laying on a bed in an empty room. He had no idea where he was or how he got there, but as he sat up and took a deep breath, he felt like he could take over the world with the sheer power of will alone.

The captain pushed himself out of bed and rose to his feet. There wasn't any pain; not a single ache from the previous night or anything that had happened before this moment in time. The captain didn't need to think too hard on it, he knew what he needed to do. He needed to go home and make up with his wife.

As soon as he opened the door, all of the pain and sadness seemed to fall away. It was n't the same as before; that feeling of being alone was gone now. He didn't have to be afraid anymore because there was no more fear in this world for him. The captain left his room, knowing with certainty that he would never leave this place again.

He made it back to the bridge without incident and found that all of the errors on the various panels were gone; the lights flickered on and stayed on. The crewmen looked up at him in awe as if they had just witnessed some sort of miracle, but the captain did n't care about any of them.

He moved forward across the bridge towards his bedchamber with a purpose unlike he had ever known before. It was almost like walking on air; he felt lighter than he had in years, and yet there was something deeper to it. The captain could feel what seemed to be an ocean underneath him, as if gravity did not exist here any longer. He could have sworn that he could fly now if only his body would move with the right kind of energy.

When he reached his bedchamber, the captain went in and took a deep breath before collapsing on top of the sheets. His wife was fast asleep, looking peaceful in her slumber. The captain stared at her for a long time without moving; it seemed like she had always been there waiting for him to come home. And now he knew that this would be his last night here. He would never have to leave again.

The next morning, the ship rose up from its orbit and moved towards the edge of the system, heading back in the direction of Earth. The captain sat alone on the bridge, watching as the stars streaked by outside his window. This was truly something that he would always treasure, even if it were only a memory to be cherished. He felt his wife's hand slip into his, and this time he knew without any doubt whatsoever; he could never leave her alone again.

He had become the master of all that he surveyed, and with that sense of power came an even greater love for his wife. For it was only by embracing her darkness that he could truly embrace his own. And together they would conquer all.

The captain closed his eyes to rest, knowing that when he opened them again the stars would still be there waiting for him. But this time, he knew exactly what they meant; he knew why he was here and he knew what he had been put on this Earth for. It wasn't just a mission anymore, it was an endless journey to be traveled together with the one who mattered most in his life.

The captain and his wife would go forth from here, together; hand in hand forevermore. And there were no greater words than that in the universe.
