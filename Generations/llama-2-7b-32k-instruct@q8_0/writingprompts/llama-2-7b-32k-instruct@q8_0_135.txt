100% correct, of course. This was a bit embarrassing, really, but luckily she was still programmed to be polite about these sorts of things. With one last look at the monitor displaying my precious cargo, I slipped them back into the pocket dimension and set off down the hall. 
 
 As soon as I was out of Glados's sight, I whipped out a small device from my coat pocket and plugged it into the charger port on the wall. A soft beeping sounded in my earpiece and a small light lit up to indicate that charging had commenced. It'd been a long time since I last used this thing. 
 
 With one foot planted against the wall, I leaned into it while using the other to balance myself on the slick tile floor as I rummaged through my pockets for some earbuds and a small audio player. It took me a few tries to find something that worked with my old set of buds, but finally, a song started playing out of thin air in front of my face. 
 
 As the tune played through the little speakers, I found myself moving back and forth along the hallway, my feet twitching to the beat as I moved along. My eyes were closed as I sang along with the lyrics. The sound of music filled the air. 
 
 This was a bit of an unusual experience for me: walking down the hallway in complete darkness. Even though this facility had never been darker than it was right now, this was still weird. Mostly because my body hadn't seen this much darkness in quite some time. I couldn't remember when the last time that was. 
 
 But here I was, walking down the hallway like a blind man, listening to music and singing along at the top of my lungs while feeling the cold stone under my feet. It felt... liberating?
