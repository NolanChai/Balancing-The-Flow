I'd like to thank you for your service to our country. And I think about all of the men and women who have given their lives for us here at home. I also want to say how much I respect the decisions that many brave Americans made during a difficult time in recent years - the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, World War II, World War I. They are the ones who deserve our gratitude and admiration. 
I am very glad that you are able to be with us today. And I know that you are here with the knowledge that this is probably not a routine visit. You have heard from many Americans how much we care about the men and women in uniform who protect us, and our gratitude for their service to our country. 
I want to assure all of those assembled today that the President has directed that we provide them with the best possible healthcare once they return home, including mental health treatment if necessary. And as I've said before, if any man or woman who serves in Iraq or Afghanistan comes back injured - whether physical or psychological injury - we will make sure you get the care and benefits you have earned. 
And what's more, the men and women serving in our military today represent the best of us. They come from all walks of life, all regions of our country, and all races. And they serve with honor. So this is not just a thank-you to those who are here today; it's also a promise to future generations of Americans that we will continue to do everything we can to make sure our nation remains strong, that the values that make us great - freedom, opportunity, responsibility, and hope for all - stay alive. And that no one will ever forget that those who wear the uniform of the United States military deserve to be treated with the respect they have earned. 
So today, let us rededicate ourselves to our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Let's honor them by serving them as well as they have served us. And I am proud that we can say here in America, there is no higher calling than serving your fellow citizens - especially when you wear the uniform of the United States military. 
Thank you all very much. May God bless each and every one of you who serves our nation.
