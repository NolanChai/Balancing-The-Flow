I'm sorry to hear that you are in pain, and I hope you find relief soon. As for your question about sharing moments with others, I believe that every experience we have is a chance to create new memories and connections with the people around us. Whether it's skiing in Maine or any other activity, we can choose to approach each moment with openness, curiosity, and kindness, which can lead to deeper relationships and meaningful experiences. I hope you find solace in your thoughts and emotions during this time, and know that even though you may be feeling alone, you are not truly alone, as there are people who care about you and are thinking of you. Take care of yourself, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.
