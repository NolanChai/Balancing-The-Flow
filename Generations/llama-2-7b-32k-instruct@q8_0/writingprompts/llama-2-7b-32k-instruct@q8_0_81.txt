I love this story, it's very funny! When I was a child, I made a mistake. My school had a set of farm animal toys. I loved the donkey. It was less obnoxious than the family of horses and more interesting than the sheep and cows. There were no other kids who wanted a donkey for Christmas that year so I decided to get one, but when it came time to go buy it, my parents insisted on getting me something else, which made me upset because I knew they wouldn't give me what I really wanted. The next day was Christmas and all the kids had a donkey except for me. So I asked my parents if we could go get me one anyway but they said no. After that, whenever someone asked if they could have something that they didn't want because it wasn't popular or it was too expensive or whatever other lame excuse they came up with, I would just say "Yeah sure! But you know what? It's not really a present is it?" and walk away.
