ly brow, '' when we used to come here after school just to talk. You had a new haircut and you wanted me to notice it . ''.

'' Oh yeah , '' she smiled at the memory, tucking her hair behind her ear with two fingers like she always did when talking about him, "you were always so sweet ."  
 
 She was quiet for a moment. Then said: 

' I hope you know how much we all love you .  You mean the world to us and it's just going to be really hard without you .  Whenever I think of my future, I see you there by my side... You know, that old friend who knows me like no one else. ''.

She continued: 
'' We all want this for you, boy , so badly ... We all just want to protect you from the world, but we can't . Life is hard and it won't always be kind . And when I see people suffering on the streets, or hear about wars in places I know nothing about... It hurts me. It really does .  
 
 I try not to think of them too much, though - just the ones who are closest to us; the friends we grew up with. We've known each other so long. They're like my family and you're like a brother. My heart breaks every time I think about you going off to face all that alone . 
  
 She leaned forward, elbows on table, palms upwards as if asking for something. As if trying to reach her feelings through the air: 
'' I don't know how else to say this ... I don't even really know what I want from you in return . Just that you be safe. That nothing will ever happen to you... If it does, let me know. Don't go anywhere without telling us where you are and when you're coming back .   
 
 She paused, thinking of something else she wanted him to remember: 
'' Also - don't forget to write . Letters or emails - doesn't matter . We all love hearing from you, even if it's just one word. And try and come home for Christmas . We need that boy around here once in a while, don't we? I know you want to see them too .  
 
 Her voice softened: 
'' And you can bring me back something ... Something little but special - maybe some chocolates or flowers ? It doesn't even have to be from the other side of the world. Just let us know you're safe .   
 
 She hesitated, trying to think of more things to say: 
'' Oh , and there's one last thing ... I don't want you ever to forget that we love you.''. 
  
 And with that, she leaned across the table, wrapped her arms around his shoulders and squeezed tightly . She pressed her cheek against his. Her eyes closed. '' I love you too. Good luck boy.'' 
 
 He nodded: 'I love you too girl.''  
 And they sat like that for a minute until the waiter came to take their orders and break the spell, as if he knew what was happening, his face grave. 
 
 But when the boy looked up at her again, she smiled at him - an easy smile this time, the kind that used to light up a room . And then she said: 
 '' I'm proud of you boy . You know that?  I really am.''.  
 He nodded again and they parted. She watched as he walked out into the night, head down. 
 
 Then she looked back at the waiter, and smiled. He smiled back. Then he left too. And the two of them were alone in that crowded space, holding hands across a table.   
 
 They were quiet for some time - both lost in their own thoughts as they sat there together - before the girl said: 
'' That was really beautiful .''.  
 The boy looked up at her, and she nodded back at him: ' I know it will be.''. And that's when he knew. He knew he would make it home safe . That he had to, for all of them.   
 
 When the boy opened his eyes again, a month later, they were not so tired anymore; the sky above him was blue and bright with sunshine. It looked different somehow - more alive. And as he lay there looking out at the city , something changed . 
 
 He felt like a new man. A better man. One who could face whatever life threw his way.   
 
 Soon enough, the time came for him to leave once again. But this time, it was different. This time, he knew where he was going and what he wanted . He'd take that feeling of lightness with him wherever he went . It would be a shield against the world.  
 
 And when he walked out into that bright morning sunshine, she was there for him - smiling as always, her hand clasped tightly to his . She'd been waiting and watching by the gate all night long, just like old times. The boy looked up at her then and smiled: 
'' I love you girl. More than anything else in this world.''.  
 And she leaned across the gate and kissed him softly on the lips . And as he walked away to catch his train, she said: 'I'm so proud of you boy . You know that? I really am ...''. 
 
 He smiled back at her, waving goodbye. Then he turned around for one last glimpse before disappearing into the distance and all she could see was his hat - a little yellow thing, with a feather in it, blowing in the wind . And as the train pulled out of the station, she watched him go and her heart broke once again .  
 
 But still , she knew he would be fine. She just had to trust that he could face anything life threw at him and come back strong - just like he'd promised. Because that was who he was... And what family does: it holds you together through the bad times until they become good again . 
  
 The boy rode on, listening to music with his headphones on, feeling lighter than ever before. He thought about her all the way home; and when he got there he found a package waiting for him at his doorstep: a little box of chocolates and flowers ... just like she'd asked . And when he opened it up, he found a note inside : 
'' I love you too boy. And I'm proud of you too.''.   
 
 He smiled to himself in the sunshine as he walked home through town, feeling more alive than ever before . Because he knew that no matter how bad things got, she was always there for him... Just waiting by the gate with a smile and her hand outstretched.  
 
 And when they met up again at Christmas, their reunion would be all the sweeter because of it .   
 
 '' Happy Birthday girl.'' He said as he put his arms around her waist, leaning in close to say something she'd never heard him say before: 
'' I'm back. I made it home safely and brought you this - for you .''.  
 She smiled up at him then, and he saw a light on in her eyes that had been gone for so long; a spark of hope that seemed to burn as brightly as the sunshine outside: 
'' Happy birthday boy. And I love you too.''.

The boy and girl sat together at their favorite caf√©, their hands clasped tightly across the table. The yellow light from the cafe was their only spotlight as they stared out at the city for the last time together.

"I remember," the boy said, creasing his crumply brow, "when we used to come here after school just to talk. You had a new haircut and you wanted me to notice it."

The girl smiled at the memory, tucking her hair behind her ear with two fingers like she always did when talking about him. "You were always so sweet," she said.

She was quiet for a moment. Then she said: "I hope you know how much we all love you. You mean the world to us and it's just going to be really hard without you."

Whenever I think of my future, I see you there by my side... You know, that old friend who knows me like no one else.

She continued: "We all want this for you, boy, so badly ... We all just want to protect you from the world, but we can't."

Life is hard and it won't always be kind. And when I see people suffering on the streets, or hear about wars in places I know nothing about... It hurts me. It really does.

I try not to think of them too much, though - just the ones who are closest to us; the friends we grew up with. We've known each other so long. They're like my family and you're like a brother. My heart breaks every time I think about you going off to face all that alone.
