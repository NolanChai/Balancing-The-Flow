nexing lands. Why do they have to be so hard to defeat? When life seems easy and comfortable, why do people become lazy with it? It is easier to throw a stone than to write one, but the aftermath is the same. But, sometimes, what we desire isn't necessarily something big and fancy. Sometimes, it can be small things. Small things that make our lives a bit better. I have decided that those are the things worth fighting for. The smallest things deserve the greatest of efforts, don't you think?

I find my mind wandering to the little things I want, but not enough to warrant an entire blog post about them. They aren't great ambitions or anything. Just little wishes that make life more comfortable and less annoying. For example: 1) a door mat for my porch; 2) A place in which to store all the random stuff I find around my house but have nowhere to put it (I want somewhere besides on top of my dresser or underneath my bed); 3) an extra phone charger that doesn't cost $50.

Yes, these are things that I find myself wanting a lot lately. And the more I think about them, the more they seem worth fighting for. Maybe not on a grand scale, but maybe just one day at a time? Who knows! But, my mind has wandered away from those small things. It's headed elsewhere.

As you can see from the title of this post, I am going to be talking about desire and ambition again today. And, once more, we are dealing with two different topics entirely. Ambition is something that I have talked about before (see "The Ambitious One" or "Of Desire"), but desire? Well, I don't know that I have ever really given it much thought until now.

I think I am going to start thinking more about desire in the future, because there seems to be quite a lot of it running around these days. We all seem to want so many things: more money, a bigger house, better cars, etcetera. And I don't know that any of us have ever stopped and asked ourselves if we really needed those things or just wanted them.

So, for today at least, my mind has settled on desire as the topic. But, what kind of desire? It seems like there are so many different kinds of desire out there! Some people want to be rich; some people want to be famous. Others want a big house or a new car. Still others just want a nice dinner out once in a while.

I'm not sure that I even know what kind of desire I am talking about, but it seems like these days, the word "desire" has come to mean something much broader than it used to. It's become almost synonymous with "want." But, there is a difference between wanting and desiring something.

I think that when we say someone has a desire for something, what we really mean is that they are very strongly motivated to have that thing. They will do anything to get it. And I don't just mean anything legal; I mean anything at all. Some people will cheat or lie or even kill in order to achieve their goals.

On the other hand, when we say someone wants something, what we really mean is that they are mildly interested in having it. They might like the idea of having it, but they don't feel like they need it. And that's okay! We all have different priorities and goals.

But, sometimes, our desires can get the best of us. For example: Have you ever wanted something so badly that you were willing to sacrifice anything in order to get it? Maybe not even necessarily legally, but morally? I think we've all been there at least once or twice in our lives.

The thing about desire is that it's easy to let it take over your life if you let it. And when that happens, things can start to fall apart pretty quickly. So, how do we stop ourselves from becoming so consumed by the desire for something? How do we keep ourselves from letting our desires rule us?

I think the key is balance. We all have to realize that not everything that we want is within our reach or even worth having in the first place. And sometimes, we just need to let go of what we can't have and move on. It's tough, but it's necessary.

Another thing that we have to remember when talking about desire is that it's not always a good thing. Sometimes, our desires can lead us astray. They can make us do things that we might not otherwise do if we didn't have that strong desire for something. And sometimes, those desires can even be harmful to us in the long run.

For example: Have you ever wanted a cigarette so badly that you were willing to risk your health? Or maybe you wanted alcohol or drugs so bad that you did things you normally wouldn't do just to get your hands on them? I think we've all been there before as well. And in those cases, our desire for something can actually end up hurting us more than it helps us.

So, what does this all mean? How do we make sure that the things we want aren't going to hurt us in the long run? Well, I think it starts with being honest with ourselves about what we really want and why we want it. And then, we have to be willing to let go of those things when they become harmful or unnecessary in our lives.

I think that sometimes, our desires can get the best of us and lead us astray. But, I also believe that if we're smart about it, we can use those desires for good instead of evil. We just have to be careful not to let them consume us and take over our lives.

I hope this has been helpful in some way! I'm definitely still trying to figure all of this out myself. But, I think that as long as we are honest with ourselves and others about what we want and why we want it, we can use those desires to help us achieve great things instead of hurting us in the end.

I guess my biggest question for today is: What do you desire? And how do you deal with that desire when it becomes too much? Do you let it consume you or do you find a way to channel it into something positive? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic!

I think the thing about desire and ambition is that they are both things that can be really good for us if we use them correctly. But, they can also be bad if we let them consume us and take over our lives. So, it's important to find a way to balance those two things out in order to make sure that we're always moving forward positively in our lives.

I think the key is to figure out what it is that you truly desire in your life and then work towards achieving that. Don't let anyone or anything stand in your way! But, also remember that there are some things that aren't worth fighting for, no matter how badly you may want them.

I think sometimes, our desires can be misleading. They might tell us we need something when really, we don't. Or they might make us do things we wouldn't normally do just to get what we want. And that can lead us down a bad path if we aren't careful.

But, I think that with desire and ambition, it's all about moderation. If you want something too badly, it can become an obsession. And then, things start to fall apart pretty quickly. But, if you are moderate in your desires and ambitions, you can use them as a way to achieve great things in your life.
