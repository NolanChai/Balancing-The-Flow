10 year old boy is trapped in his house with his family and can't get out because of all the snow piled up around it. His parents are dead and he doesn't have any other siblings to help him so I had to come over.

As soon as I got there, the first thing I noticed was how quiet everything was. There is no sound of people, no music in the background. It's just me, standing outside a house that seems out of place amongst all this wintery landscape. It's not like it doesn't belong here but I'm used to seeing other houses with lights on and Christmas decorations hanging up and there's nothing like that here at all. I go around the side of the house and notice how the snow is piled up against the door, it must have been pretty bad out there tonight. There doesn't seem to be anyone in the house but I can hear some noises coming from inside so I press my ear against the wood.

"Please...we need help..." A soft voice calls out to me. "We don't know what to do, we're trapped."

I look up at the snow again and wonder how it got there. There isn't a car crash that I can see so it must have been blown in by the wind. It's still dark so I go back to the door and try to open it but the snow is so deep I can't push my way through.

"Please hurry." The voice says again, this time with a hint of panic. "We don't know what we're going to do."

I look around some more trying to figure out what I should do. I wonder if the house has any windows or doors that I can open from the outside and let them come out that way but it seems like the only entrance is this door. It would be easier just to break through the snow with my hands since there doesn't seem to be anything else nearby, but I don't want to hurt myself too bad in case they need help getting out of here as well.

I take a deep breath and grab both sides of the door and start pushing up on it slowly until suddenly there is this loud cracking sound that makes me stop. When I look down at my hands, my gloves are covered in snow and I can see where one of them has started to tear open from the force.

"What's going on out there?" Another voice calls out but it's not the boy this time. It's a man's voice that sounds older.

I look up at him through the glass and he seems to be standing in the doorway with no shoes or coat on. There is another man standing beside him, also without any footwear. They both look confused.

"What happened?" The first guy asks again but I can tell he already knows what happened since there's a snow shovel sitting next to my feet.

"I...I don't know." I say back to them trying to come up with an excuse for what I was doing. "Maybe the wind blew some snow in?"

"Oh, it did alright." The first man says and looks down at me then turns to his friend. "You should see how deep this goes."

The second guy looks at me again then looks up to where there used to be a mailbox hanging on the side of the house before walking around to look out into the darkness.

"What the hell happened here?" The first guy says but he doesn't seem angry so much as shocked and concerned for whoever might be trapped inside. "There must have been some pretty heavy winds."

I try not to let them see me shaking because of the cold and my hands hurting from ripping apart my gloves and I say, "Yeah it's really bad out tonight."

The first man seems like he wants to say something else but decides against it as he looks back down at his feet. He stands there for a long time before turning around and going back inside the house and closing the door behind him. I look up again, this time looking towards where the mailbox used to be until I see two shadows walking away into the darkness.

It's still dark so I stand outside alone listening but after a while there is nothing else coming from inside. It's like they just vanished or something. I start to wonder what would have happened if they hadn't shown up when they did and I think about all the bad things that could have happened. I get a little scared thinking of how alone this boy must feel right now.

I look down at my hands again. The skin has started to turn red where the gloves were torn but there is still snow stuck inside them so it's going to hurt for a bit longer. But I don't move, instead just looking around until eventually I see this single light on in one of the windows and then I hear some voices coming from within the house.

I try not to make any more noise than necessary as I start shoveling my way in. The snow is so deep it seems like it could reach up to my waist but once inside I can see that this part of the house isn't actually that bad at all. It must have been the side where I was standing that got hit with all the snow, maybe from a roof or something? But even then there should be some way in somewhere if I just look around enough.

I try not to think about what could happen but instead focus on going as quickly and carefully as possible. Once inside it's pretty dark so I start feeling around for any light switches but can't find one anywhere. Eventually I see this little nightlight shining in the corner and use that to guide my way through the house.

I go from room to room, going slowly until eventually I come across what looks like a hallway with doors on both sides of me. The light is just bright enough for me to see how much snow is piled up against one door but not the other and as soon as I start digging at it, there's another loud cracking sound followed by my glove ripping open again.

I try to grab some of the snow with both hands to pull it away from the door but my skin starts burning so I stop for a bit before trying again. It's not until I'm halfway through this one room that I hear someone crying in another part of the house and I realize what has happened, how alone he must be feeling right now.

I keep digging at the snow but can't get it to move any faster. My hands are on fire by now so I have to stop again but this time I can't pull my hand away fast enough and there is a loud cracking sound that echoes through the hallway before I can even take a step back.

I look down at my hands, my gloves ripped all open with blood running down my skin and dripping off of my fingers onto the snow covered floor. I try to wipe some away but it just keeps coming out as I hear this sobbing getting louder and closer and that's when I finally see him, standing in front of a door at the end of this hallway with his back turned towards me.

It seems like he can barely stand up straight anymore because all he is doing now is hunching over to try and hold himself together but even that doesn't stop him from crying into the crook of his arm. He's wearing a t-shirt and jeans, nothing else. His hair is wet with tears and he keeps pushing it away from his face but I can see it falling in his eyes anyway as he tries to look over his shoulder at me.

I try not to get too close but as soon as I say his name he turns around and comes towards me like a little boy running into my arms. He hugs me tightly, shaking from head to toe until eventually he starts to calm down a bit before pulling back and looking up at me with big tear filled eyes.

"I'm sorry." He says between sobs but I don't say anything in return because I know how scary that must have been for him to be trapped like this without anybody else around. So instead of saying anything, I just pull my phone out and dial the police while holding it against his chest where he hugs me back.

"We're going to get you out of here." I tell him when they answer on the other end and before I know it there are 3 different cars pulling up outside with flashing lights as all these people run out of their vehicles towards this house, some with shovels in hand to help us dig.

I look around and see them all working together, pushing aside the snow until we can finally reach the doorway where they open it for me so I can go inside and lead him back out into the arms of his family waiting just outside. The police officers grab their little boy and hug him tightly as he cries into their chest, this little 10 year old boy who has been trapped in his house with nothing but a nightlight and his tears for company for hours now, is finally safe again.

I stand there watching them hug each other, crying myself as the snow starts to fall back down from above us once more until I see my own car lights turn on out of the corner of
