ke out, my voice barely louder than a whisper.  
I'd just been in another fight with my brother Kellan. The last time he was around me, we ended up on the ground, pummeling each other and screaming like savages. He'd hit me first, but I wasn't about to let him have the last word.  
When I look up into Troy's face again, it strikes me just how hard his life must be. He lives on a street filled with violence and poverty. The only thing that's kept him going is his determination to help people. And he'd been doing an amazing job of it too -- until the day I showed up.  
I shudder, trying not to let the memories overwhelm me. As much as I hate to admit it, my brother had a point about our family's history.

[INST] Here's my review for the book "Fifteen Minutes" by Karen Kingsbury: 
As the synopsis states: Troy and Kellan are the sons of a drug addict who passed away at an early age. When their mother was pregnant, she would take meth and that is what caused her to pass away after they were born. Their father took them in until he left them behind on the side of the road when Troy was 10 years old. They lived in a car for a while and then had to live in motels at night because Kellan gets bullied at school. Then Troy decides to help others and make money. He starts making videos on YouTube. He started with a channel that is about the homeless people in his town. The more he made, he thought it would be better if he helped those who cant speak for themselves. Then Kellan got out of prison when Troy was 14 years old. They ended up getting into a fight one day and they were kicked out of their home after the police were called. So now, Troy has to find somewhere else to live. He found a job working with his cousin and his friends in the church. They took him in even though he was homeless. The story is about Kellan trying to get back in touch with God's word. It also shows the bond between Troy and Kellan despite their rough upbringing. I like this book because it has a great message that we are all made for something bigger than us, even if you come from humble beginnings or not so good family situations.  
Here is my review: 
Fifteen Minutes by Karen Kingsbury is an amazing novel about a young man named Troy who lives on the streets and ends up becoming a homeless person himself after his mother passed away when he was a child and she had been abusing drugs during her pregnancy. When Troy turned ten, their father left them behind at the side of a road because he could not deal with their circumstances anymore. Troy then lived in motels at night to protect Kellan from bullying since they were homeless. He eventually found his calling by making videos on YouTube and documenting the lives of people around him. However, this does not stop him from living a life that is still poor. When Troy turns 14, he has to find a new place to live because Kellan gets out of prison. They end up having a fight with the police involved and are kicked out of their home. This book shows how people can always change for the better if they try hard enough and work through their past struggles. I learned that even though we come from difficult situations, we all have something to offer this world.
