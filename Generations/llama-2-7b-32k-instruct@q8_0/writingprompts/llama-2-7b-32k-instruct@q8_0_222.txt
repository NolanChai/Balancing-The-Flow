The next morning, she woke up early to get ready for her appointment with the doctor. She felt nervous but determined as she dressed and put on her best suit. As she stepped out of her building into the bright sunlight, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with fear. Was it possible? Had she really pulled off the greatest con in history?

As she walked to the doctor's office, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking on air. She couldn't believe how easy it had all been - stealing the identity, forging the documents, and assuming a new life as a successful businesswoman. But as she approached the building where her appointment was scheduled, she suddenly felt a wave of nausea wash over her. What if everything had been for nothing?

She took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The doctor answered, and she smiled warmly at him. "Good morning, Dr. Jones," she said in her most pleasant voice. "I'm here to see you about my appointment."

The doctor looked at her quizzically for a moment before his face broke into a grin. "Ah, yes! It's that time of the month already? Let's get you settled on the table and we can have a little chat."

As she lay down on the examination table, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. She was about to pull off one of the greatest cons in history, and she knew that it wouldn't be without its consequences. But as Dr. Jones began his examination, she felt a sense of determination wash over her.

"So, Ms. Smith," he said, his voice friendly but businesslike. "I understand you have some concerns about your menstrual cycle. Is that correct?"

She nodded nervously, trying to keep her composure. "Yes, that's right. I've been having some unusual symptoms lately, and I was hoping we could figure out what's going on."

The doctor chuckled as he moved the cold metal of his stethoscope across her collarbone. "Well, let's take a look at things. Have you been experiencing any abnormal bleeding or cramping?"

She hesitated for a moment, trying to think of an excuse that would explain everything away. But just as she opened her mouth to speak, the door behind him burst open. It was a young woman, dressed in a nursing uniform, who rushed into the room with a look of panic on her face.

"Dr. Jones! We have a situation!" she said urgently. "A patient has just walked into the ER claiming to be someone else and refusing to show any identification."

Dr. Jones looked up from his examination, his eyes narrowing in suspicion as he stared at Ms. Smith. "What did you say your name was?"

She hesitated for a moment, her mind racing with the sudden realization that she had been caught. But just as she opened her mouth to speak, Dr. Jones's phone began ringing. He answered it, his face growing more serious by the second.

"This is Dr. Jones," he said into the receiver. "I understand there's a situation at the ER? What can I do for you?"

The voice on the other end of the line explained the situation in detail, and Dr. Jones's face grew more and more alarmed as he listened. Finally, he hung up the phone and turned to Ms. Smith with a look of shock and anger.

"You! You're the one!" he shouted at her. "How dare you come into my office and pretend to be someone else?"

She tried to speak but could only manage a few stammering words before Dr. Jones cut her off. "Get out of here!" he barked. "And don't ever come back."

Ms. Smith stood there, stunned and confused, as the doctor stormed out of the room. She didn't know what to do or say - all she could do was stare at her reflection in the mirror as Dr. Jones gathered his things and left.

As she sat there for a moment, trying to process everything that had just happened, she couldn't help but feel a sense of disbelief. Had it really been this easy? She had thought that pulling off the greatest con in history would be an epic struggle - but instead, she had walked into the doctor's office and pulled it off with ease.

She looked at herself in the mirror one last time before leaving, wondering what kind of life awaited her on the other side of this identity theft. Would she ever know true freedom? Or would she always be haunted by the memory of that fateful day when she walked into Dr. Jones's office and changed her life forever?
