build, dressed in black jeans and white shirt with black t-shirt underneath that had "CIA" in blue letters. He spoke perfect English without any accent. 
 
 He wanted to know about the Islamist movement in Kashmir as well as Pakistan's role in supporting it, but I told him it was a touchy subject and that I didn't have information on it. I also mentioned the Indian involvement in the same area. 
 
 But he said we had enough proof to convince the world about India's activities. He showed me a photograph of what looked like an Indian missile strike against a village, but which was actually a video showing civilians being attacked by soldiers firing automatic weapons and throwing grenades. The picture had been taken from a helicopter with the word CIA written on it in white letters. 
 
 I told him that even if the attack really happened, why were they lying about who did it? I said that this kind of thing only made people trust us less and undermined our intelligence credibility. 
 
 He asked me what I thought we should do to convince the world, and I told him that we had a lot of good information on human rights violations in India but that no one outside Kashmir really cared about it, so I said it would be better to show them other things. 
 
 He seemed interested, so I showed him another photograph, this time of an Indian soldier standing next to the severed head of a young man, and he asked me how I knew about that. I told him that we had been keeping track of Indian soldiers and their activities on social media, which they don't realize is watched closely by people who want them brought to justice. 
 
 He said he wanted to know more about our social media monitoring program and the information we collected. But again, I warned him against lying and pointed out that it made us look bad when we did things like this, especially since they had just tried to frame an entire nation for a crime it didn't commit. 
 
 He told me not to worry - the US government had been doing similar things with their own intelligence operations abroad for years, but I reminded him that we were different in that our focus was on human rights and not just national security interests. 
 
 After he left, I wondered if I'd done the right thing by telling him all of this. But it felt good to stand up to someone with so much power, even though it might have been a waste of time because he already knew what was going on.

I didn't think anything would come of my conversation with the CIA agent, but then I found out that he had put in a report about our organization to his superiors and the Indian government. 

It made me worried that they might come after us for revealing their activities. So I called a few friends who worked at international human rights groups and told them what happened. We all decided that we needed to take action, so we started planning how to respond to this situation. 

We also talked about how we could use the information we had on Indian soldiers' activities online to our advantage - by exposing their abuses, we could force them to stop or at least be more careful in the future. We were going to create a website that would show the evidence of what was happening and make it impossible for India to deny it. 

I wasn't sure how much good this would really do, but I felt like we had to try something. I hoped that by standing up to the CIA agent and exposing his lie, we could start a chain reaction that would eventually lead to justice being served in Kashmir. And if nothing else, it gave us some satisfaction knowing that we weren't just sitting around waiting for things to happen - we were taking action and trying to make a difference.

As I was thinking about all of this, I got a message from an Indian officer who had seen my Facebook post about the CIA agent's visit. He threatened me with arrest if I continued to spread what he called "false information" about India and Kashmir. 

I ignored him at first, but then realized that I needed to take action to protect myself and our group. So we decided to file a complaint against the Indian government for crimes against humanity in Kashmir - a very serious charge. We included all of the evidence we had on their activities, including what the CIA agent told me. 

We sent this information to several international organizations and media outlets, hoping that it would get some attention and force India to stop its abuses. 

At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then we started getting messages from people all over the world who were shocked by what they had read about India's treatment of Kashmiris. Some even called for sanctions against India or for it to be kicked out of international organizations like the United Nations. 

I was happy that our efforts had led to some change, but I still wasn't sure if it would be enough to make a real difference in Kashmir. But at least now, people knew what was happening there and couldn't ignore it anymore. 

As for the CIA agent who visited me, he never came back. Maybe he realized that we were onto him, or maybe he got transferred somewhere else. Either way, I was glad that I had stood up to him and exposed his lie. It felt like a small victory in an ongoing struggle for justice. 

And who knows - maybe our actions will inspire others to stand up against abuses of power and take action to make the world a better place. That's what we're all trying to do, right?

After that day, I continued to work with my friends on human rights issues in Kashmir. We kept track of Indian soldiers' activities online and shared the information we found with the media and international organizations. 

We also continued to document abuses by Indian security forces in Kashmir, which we then used as evidence in our complaint against India for crimes against humanity. 

Over time, more people started paying attention to what was happening in Kashmir - not just in the region itself but all around the world. More and more people were calling for justice to be served in the region. 

And then, something amazing happened: India decided to hold elections in the summer of 2018. This was a surprise to many, as no one had expected them to do so soon after the abrogation of Article 370. The election was seen as an opportunity for Kashmiris to have their voices heard and to choose their own destiny. 

We knew that this would be a good opportunity to spread awareness about Kashmir's situation, so we started working on a social media campaign to inform people about what was happening there. We made videos, posted articles, and shared stories from Kashmiris themselves. 

The election was a huge success - more than 70% of eligible voters turned out to vote, which is an incredible number for a region that has been under Indian rule for decades. Many people were hopeful that this would be a way for them to make their voices heard and influence the future of Kashmir. 

But as we all know now, things did not go as planned. The election was marred by violence and intimidation from Indian security forces, which prevented many voters from casting their ballots. The results were also invalidated due to allegations of fraud and rigging - but even if they had been valid, the situation in Kashmir is still untenable. 

Despite all of this, I am proud of what we have accomplished over the years. We have brought attention to human rights abuses in Kashmir that many people were unaware of and we have given a voice to those who are often silenced by powerful forces. 

And even though things seem dire now, there is still hope for change. India's recent elections showed that Kashmiri people are not willing to give up their fight for self-determination. They are ready and waiting for the right moment to make their voices heard - and we will be there to support them every step of the way. 

As for me, I am committed to continuing my work in Kashmir and using all the resources at my disposal to spread awareness about what is happening there. We need more people to stand up and join us in this fight - because the struggle for justice in Kashmir will not end until it has been won.

I hope that my story inspires you to take action against human rights abuses wherever they may occur. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we all have a responsibility to stand up for those who are being oppressed. 

Thank you for listening to my story, and I hope it has given you some insight into the situation in Kashmir and what we can do to make things better.

As I mentioned earlier, India's recent elections were a big disappointment for many people who had hoped that they would be able to choose their own destiny through democratic means.
