I heard someone at the gate and went to see what it was. It was a tall, lean American with an impressive mustache who had papers for me from my father. I wondered why he didn't just write his name on the paper like normal people? He seemed so confident in who he was. 
I gave him the papers and watched him go. As soon as he left, I felt strange. Like something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was.

My father came home today. He seemed nervous and upset. I asked him what happened and he said the American had come back to the house and taken the papers back, saying that they weren't good enough. My father looked frantic as he tried to think of how to get them back. 
I was worried about my father's safety and the safety of our family. The next day, a man came to the gate with a message for me. He said the American wanted to speak to me in private. I was scared but went anyway.

I met with the American at the gate. He seemed nervous too and kept looking over his shoulder as if he were being followed. He asked me what my father wanted him to do, and I didn't know how to respond. The American told me that my father had sent a message that said "the papers were not good enough". 
I was confused and worried about what my father meant by that. The American said he would try to find out more information and left. As soon as he left, I felt like someone was watching me.

Today was a bad day. An agent from the CIA came to my house looking for me. He said my father had sent another message saying that "the papers were not good enough". I asked him what he meant, but all he would say was that he needed to talk to my father. 
I didn't want to see anyone from the CIA, so I hid in my room. The agent came into my room and started searching for me. I knew I had to leave the house before they found me.

Today was a good day. I left the house and went to my father's workplace. When I got there, he wasn't there but I found a message from him saying that the papers were ready. I was so relieved and excited! 
I took the documents home and spent all evening working on them. My father came home late and seemed tired but happy. He told me the papers were good enough this time and that the CIA agent had come back to get them. 
I went to sleep feeling happy and secure, knowing that my family was safe from the CIA.
