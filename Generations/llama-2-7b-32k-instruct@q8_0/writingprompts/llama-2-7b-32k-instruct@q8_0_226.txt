ything. But i got along well with everyone. Except a certain someone who kept trying to make me stay inside all day."
"I didn't want that, so i made myself busy out here in the cargo bay where we could be alone."
"Outside of this space suit there was no privacy anyway . So what did it matter? Besides that was just *one* person. There were others on board who also tried to keep me inside but they didn't care enough to actually argue with me about it like this one guy did . I guess he had nothing better to do."
"I know you're curious and i get it, its not everyday you see a naked person outside in the open air. But i think that's more your problem than anything else. You have to learn how to live with people who don't share all of your personal views about everything . We aren't robots or machines."
"This is something you're going to have a lot of trouble with in the future, not just here on this ship but out there too. You might as well start getting used to it now because when we reach our destination i can guarantee that life will be different there than it has been so far. I hope your ready for some serious changes."
"Oh and by the way its none of your business what i do or don't wear, its my choice. So i suggest you quit bugging me about it already."

I think i've gotten my point across to him enough so i guess there's no more need for an argument . I know he doesn't have a reason for his actions, but that doesn't make them any less annoying. If anything it makes them worse because now hes making me question my own morals and what i stand for."
"Its not like im asking him to join in or anything . Im just trying to live my life the way *i* want to without having to hear about how im doing something wrong or immoral every five minutes. I mean, really? This is all he has to say when hes out of things to complain about?"
"I think its time for a little walk outside."
"Its been so long since i last set foot on solid ground . The view of the starscape will do me good."
"I might as well show off my new body while im at it . Who needs clothes when you've got this baby?"
"Im going to go grab a blanket and some water bottles. That way ill be prepared if i decide to stay out here for a little bit."
"Oh and its not like anyone would see me out here, even with my clothes on. This isnt an area that gets much foot traffic."
"As long as im out of sight i dont have to worry about people judging me or telling me what i can and cant do . They dont even know I'm here yet."

I walked outside with my new body. It was liberating, like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The starscape was breathtaking, and I felt like I could see forever. I couldn't help but smile, feeling free for the first time in my life.
As I walked, I noticed that my skin was glowing in the light of the stars. It was a warm golden color, almost as if it were on fire. My hair had grown to just above my shoulders and it felt like it was alive, moving gently in the breeze. My breasts were firm, and I could feel them swelling with each step I took.
I couldn't believe how good I felt. It was almost as if a weight had been lifted off my mind too. I didn't have to worry about what other people thought of me anymore. I was just me, and that was enough.
As I walked, I heard a voice behind me. "Hey! Wait up!" It was the guy who had been trying to keep me inside all day. He was wearing a jumpsuit like everyone else on board, but it didn't hide his curiosity.
"What are you doing out here?" he asked, sounding confused and maybe a little angry.
"I just wanted some fresh air," I replied, not breaking my stride.
"You can't go around naked in public! Its not proper!" he said, trying to catch up to me.
"Oh really? And what is proper?" I asked, turning to face him. "Are you wearing clothes right now?"
"Of course I am! But that's different," he said, looking uncomfortable.
"Why? Because you think you have the right to tell me what to do just because you have a jumpsuit on? Newsflash: You don't."
I turned back to face forward, enjoying the breeze against my skin. The starscape was so beautiful, it took my breath away. I felt like I was home.
"Well, I don't want you to get cold," he said, trying to sound helpful. "You should put some clothes on."
"No thanks," I replied, shaking my head. "I'm fine."
He sighed and ran his hand through his hair. "Fine then," he said finally. "Just don't say I didn't warn you when someone sees you and has a heart attack."
With that, he turned and walked back the way we had come. He didn't look happy about it, but at least he had given up trying to make me go inside.
I continued to walk, enjoying every minute of it. I knew this was just the beginning, and I couldn't wait to see what else was out there waiting for me.
As I walked, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. It was like nothing had changed, but everything had. I was still me, but now I had a body that matched my soul. I was finally free to be who I always knew I was inside.
I walked until the sun began to rise, and then I found a spot to curl up in for the night. I didn't need anything else, just the stars and the freedom they represented.

As the sun rose, I awoke from my nap feeling refreshed and alive. It was as if a new chapter had begun. I looked down at my body with wonder, marveling at how it could be both strong and delicate all at once. My skin glowed with health, and my hair flowed like a river in the breeze.
I couldn't help but feel proud of what I had accomplished. It was as if I had finally come into my own. I felt powerful and beautiful, and for the first time in my life, I didn't care what anyone else thought.
As I walked, I heard a voice behind me. "Hey! Wait up!" It was the guy who had been trying to keep me inside all day. He was wearing a jumpsuit like everyone else on board, but it didn't hide his curiosity.

I turned back to face forward, enjoying the breeze against my skin. The sun was rising over the horizon, casting a warm golden glow across the sky. It was breathtakingly beautiful, and I felt grateful for the opportunity to witness it.
"Well, I don't want you to get cold," he said, trying to sound helpful. "You should put some clothes on."
"No thanks," I replied, shaking my head. "I'm fine."
