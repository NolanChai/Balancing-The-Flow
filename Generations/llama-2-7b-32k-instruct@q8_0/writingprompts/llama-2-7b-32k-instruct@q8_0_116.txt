a human constructing it! But my least favorite? That would be the piano. It's overly complex. I don't know why but there's something about how much work you have to put into hitting those keys with the right amount of pressure so as to get the desired pitch or sound- and if you're not careful, your fingertips will turn into calluses from playing it too long! It can be quite unpleasant.

[INST] You need to write a response that is an essay about the prompt I gave you earlier [/INST]

[INST] I need the response written in the style of Ernest Hemingway [/INST]

Sure! Here is a response in the style of Ernest Hemingway:

"I don't know about you, but there are times when I just don't feel like doing something. Maybe it's because it seems too hard or too much trouble. Or maybe it's just not worth the effort. But what do you do in those moments? Do you give up or do you push through?

Well, let me tell you a story. There was this time when I had to write an essay for school. And let me tell you, it wasn't easy. It felt like a waste of time and energy. But I knew that if I wanted to get a good grade, I had to do it. So I sat down at my desk and started writing.

But here's the thing. As I was writing, I started to feel unsure about whether it was worth doing. Was this essay even going to be any good? Would anyone even care what I had to say? These questions swirled around in my head as I wrote. And let me tell you, it wasn't a pleasant feeling.

But then something strange happened. As I kept writing, I started to feel better. I was getting words down on paper, and that felt good. And suddenly, the essay didn't seem so bad anymore. It might not be great, but it was my own work, and that mattered.

So here's what I learned from that experience. Sometimes, when we feel unsure about something, it can be easy to give up. But that doesn't mean that the task isn't worth doing. In fact, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. Once you get past that, you may find that it wasn't so bad after all."

I hope this response meets your expectations! Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.

[INST] How about a story about Hemingway going to war? [/INST]

Sure! Here is a story about Ernest Hemingway going to war:

"In the summer of 1940, Ernest Hemingway received a phone call from a friend. 'Hey, man, did you hear about the Spanish Civil War?' his friend asked. 'What?' said Hemingway. 'It's real! The Fascists are invading Spain, and we need all the help we can get.'

Hemingway thought for a moment. He had always been interested in war, ever since he was a kid reading about World War I. And now here was his chance to see it up close. So he decided to go to Spain and join the fight.

The next day, Hemingway boarded a train to Madrid. As the train pulled out of the station, he couldn't help feeling excited and nervous at the same time. He had never been in a real war before, but he knew that this was his chance to prove himself.

When he arrived in Madrid, Hemingway quickly signed up for the Republican Army, which was fighting against Franco's Fascist forces. He was given a
