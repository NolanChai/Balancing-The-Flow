I had ever seen in my entire life.

The first thing we were going to learn is how to pronounce our full names correctly. Mrs. Petrie said that this was really important because it showed respect for yourself and others when you say your name properly. She told us all about the different sounds that each letter makes, like the “uh” sound in "Mrs" and the “er” sound in "Pet". It made me want to go home right away and practice my full name until I got it just right!

Next, we learned how to spell our names correctly. Mrs. Petrie showed us how each letter should look like it was on a piece of paper using funny faces to represent the sounds that they make. It made me feel so proud when she pointed at all my letters and said "You did such a great job spelling your name!" I could hardly wait to go home and show my parents what I had learned!

The third thing we covered was how to write our names using correct letter formation. Mrs. Petrie showed us how to make the shapes of each letter, like how the “B” should be a little taller than the “u” in "Mrs". It looked so cool and it made me feel like I could do anything!

Finally, we learned about our names in English and Gaelic. Mrs. Petrie told us that some people have more than one name, like how her own name is both Mrs. Petrie and Máiréad MacDonnchaidh. She said this is because people can have different names for different languages or cultures. It was so interesting to learn about all the different ways people's names are pronounced around the world!

Overall, I thought today's lesson was really important and I feel like I learned a lot of new things about my name. I can't wait until next week when we're going to learn more new words!
