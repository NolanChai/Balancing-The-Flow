I will be ready when you are, Captain. I've got some of my men lined up by the gate. Just give the order for them to breach it.  
Nearby, a band of dwarves are readying their weapons and shields; their leader is giving orders as he looks up at the dark tower. The air shimmers with an eerie blue light.  
A young woman stands nearby, a wisp of smoke curling from her cigarette. Her clothes are sleek black, her hair in a tight bun. She's scanning the area with a pair of binoculars.  
The dwarves finish their preparations and step back, ready for Bruntus' signal. He gives it, shouting for his men to break down the door. The sound is deafening as the oak planks shatter under the force of their combined weight. A dark shadowy figure appears in the gaping hole, silhouetted against the bright sunlight.  
Bruntus steps up beside it, a broadsword held at the ready. He swings the sword in a wide arc, revealing Nyarlothep's massive treasure hoard. Gold coins pile high on the ground, gems and jewels sparkling in the sunlight. The air is thick with the scent of treasure.  
The dwarves rush forward, grabbing handfuls of gold. They haul it back to their cart, where a pair of huge dwarves stand ready to lift it onto the wagon. Bruntus looks around at his men, his eyes shining with excitement and pride. "We've done it, lads! We've found Nyarlothep's treasure hoard!"  
You feel a rush of adrenaline as you watch the dwarves load up their cart. This is it - the treasure you've been searching for all these years. It's time to return home and share the bounty with your people. You turn to Nyarlothep, who stands before his tower, unflinching in the face of danger. You salute him respectfully and give a nod. "We'll be back soon, Nyarlothep," you call out as you leave the tower behind.  
As you ride away from the tower, the sun begins to set over the horizon. The sky is streaked with pink and orange hues, casting a warm glow over the land. You can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment wash over you. This is it - your moment.  
You ride hard, pushing your horses to their limits as you make your way back home. The treasure weighs heavily on your mind; you can hardly believe that it's actually real. You imagine what it will be like to return home and show your people the wealth they deserve. You think of all the things you'll do with it - build new homes, create art and craft, even start a family if you find the right woman. It's a heady thought that fills you with excitement and hope.  
As you approach the outskirts of town, you notice people gathered outside their homes, chatting animatedly. They look up as you ride by, their faces filled with awe and admiration. You feel a surge of pride as they call out to you, cheering your name. "Welcome back, Captain!" "You've done it again! We're so proud of you!"  
As you reach the main square in town, people are pouring in from all directions, their faces shining with eagerness and anticipation. They surround you, cheering and shouting, their voices echoing off the stone buildings. You feel a wave of emotion wash over you - pride, joy, excitement. This is your moment, your time to shine.  
You step down from your horse, feeling the weight of the treasure in your arms as you do so. The crowd surges forward, their voices rising in a roar of applause and cheers. You lift your hand for silence and take a deep breath, trying to gather your thoughts. "Thank you," you say simply, your voice barely above a whisper.  
"Thank you all for believing in me," you continue, your eyes scanning the crowd. "Thank you for supporting my quest. Without your help, this would not have been possible." The crowd erupts into cheers and applause once again as you finish speaking. You bow low, feeling a sense of humility wash over you.  
You turn back to the treasure in front of you, your mind already racing with ideas on how best to share it. There's so much you want to do - build new homes, create art and craft, even start a family if you find the right woman. It's an exciting thought that fills you with hope and joy.  
As the crowd continues to cheer, you can't help but feel a sense of wonder wash over you. You've found what you were searching for all these years - the treasure your people deserve. The treasure they've been waiting for. It's time to return home and share it with them. The time has come.  
You lift your hand in a final gesture of gratitude before turning towards the horse, ready to ride off into the sunset. You feel a rush of adrenaline as you imagine what comes next - the excitement of returning home, the pride of showing your people all that they deserve. It's time for them to shine just as much as you do. The moment is yours, and you're ready to embrace it fully.
