  Nyarlothep (nya' lot - hup) was an ancient and powerful being who once roamed the lands in search of treasure and knowledge, and now it was up to you and your brave companions to locate his hidden hoard. You had heard rumors that it was located somewhere in a remote region, but no one knew exactly where. As you stood before the massive oak door, Bruntus's voice boomed through the silence: "It's gotta be Nyarlothep's giant treasure hoard!"  You look skeptically at the door and then towards your party. `` Let's do this!''
