Years before this, I kept a set of tungsten baoding balls on my desk. A gift from my wife when things were better, before our fights about money, misspent time and our dead bedroom. I'd keep them on the shelf above my desk, and they would glimmer with just enough light to catch my attention whenever I looked up. There was a sense of calmness in their cold touch that seemed to emanate from the silver-grey balls themselves, like some kind of transcendental energy that could only be found there. The set came with a black wooden box and a small booklet explaining the history of baoding balls, which my wife had also bought at a gift store in Chinatown before I met her. She'd given them to me as an anniversary present about ten years ago. Now they just sit on a shelf above my desk gathering dust, and all that's left is the memory of that day when she gave them to me at a little cafe down by the waterfront.
