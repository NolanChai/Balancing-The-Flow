ulogy in front of me.

"Prepare yourself," the man says. "This won't be easy."

I can see him, his face, twisted and contorted into a permanent scowl as if he was born that way. A thin line cuts through his right eyebrow, just underneath where the brow would naturally arch. I can hear the crack of muscles straining in preparation for his strike; it feels like an earthquake on my body.

I try to defend myself but am too slow. The punch lands and knocks me off balance onto a nearby bench, sending it flying through the air before crashing against the wall, its wood splitting beneath my weight. My cheek stings, my ear rings as I try to find some place in my body where it hurts less than the rest of it.

I feel blood pour down the side of my face, and I taste metal on my tongue; I'm bleeding from the cut above my eyebrow that the man's fist opened up. My vision blurs momentarily as the pain starts to sink in. But as I try to lift myself onto the bench and take stock of how bad it really is, he pounces once again, his knuckles digging into my jaw, making me grunt as they land against the cartilage underneath my ear.

He holds my face up by the cut on my cheek, and I feel the warmth of his breath on my skin; it's a slap that would make any father proud. But just then, I hear an unfamiliar voice echoing through the halls: "You're late." The man lets go of me.

He turns towards the doorway and leaves without another word or even a backward glance, as if he's ashamed of what he has done. His footsteps fade into nothingness until all I can hear is my own labored breathing.

As the pain starts to subside, I feel my ego bruised. But it's not that bad; I still have one good eye left and can still see straight ahead. The cut above my eyebrow hurts, but at least I can wipe away the blood with my sleeve.

I rise up to my feet, brushing myself off as best I can. I take a deep breath in and try not to let my body shake as I do. My head feels light; I feel like it might spin around if I move too quickly. But I have to go back out there, don't I?

I turn towards the door and start heading down the hallway where I heard that voice: "You're late." I take a deep breath in as I step into the bright fluorescent light of the corridor; this is what I was born for.

I'm not sure where to go, but I know exactly who I'm looking for. The sound of my footsteps echoes against the walls and floors until at last I come across him, standing next to a window on the other side of the room. He has his back turned towards me, and I can see that he is wearing an apron with some sort of company insignia embroidered onto it. His hair is neatly combed, and his hands are folded in front of him as if he's waiting for a sign of approval from someone who isn't there.

As I get closer to him, my footsteps slow. He turns around and sees me standing at attention in front of him; it is only then that I realize: I am a soldier.

I salute the man before me; I have served my country for longer than I can remember. But this isn't some sort of ceremony or welcoming party. The man stares back at me, and I see no recognition in his eyes. He doesn't say anything. Instead, he looks down at the clipboard that is tucked underneath his arm before looking up again to meet my gaze.

"You're late," he says. And with those three words, it hits me like a ton of bricks: I am no longer in control. The man has power over me; he dictates when and where I go. He owns every aspect of my life.

I stand at attention as if the barrel of his gun is pointed right between my eyes. But then again, maybe it is. This isn't a metaphorical gun to me anymore: it's real, physical, and ready to fire any second now.

As I look up at him, I see that he is smiling; it's not the kind of smile you get from someone who is happy or content but rather one that says "I know something that you don't." And just like that, my world crashes down around me.

"Do you know why you are here?" he asks.

And I do. The answer rings out in the silence between us like a gunshot: I am here to fight. But as I look into his face, I see something else; it's there on the tip of my tongue but won't come out.

He sees it too; his smile only grows wider, and he takes a step closer towards me. It's then that I realize what he is: my enemy. And in that moment, I am ready for him.

The man lifts the clipboard up and points to a spot on the page with a red marker. "Go there," he says.

I salute him again before turning towards the door. My heart races as I leave the room; my feet barely touch the floor as I fly down the hallway, my eyes focused only on where I am going.

But just as quickly as the rush of adrenaline fills me, it is gone. All that's left is a hollow feeling in its place. I know that there is no way out; this isn't some sort of game or test but rather my life. It's all over for me now.

I walk into the next room and find myself standing before another man, who is dressed just like the one from earlier. He looks at me with a mixture of disgust and fear in his eyes, as if he knows what's about to happen but doesn't know how to stop it.

And that's when I realize: this isn't my first time here. I have been through this before; this is a familiar place for me. I know the drill now. This man looks at me with contempt, just like the one from before, but he doesn't say anything. He simply points to a spot on the wall and motions for me to move forward.

I stand tall and proud as if my life depended on it; I am ready to face whatever comes next. But at that moment, I see him: my opponent, my enemy, standing across from me, waiting for me to make a mistake. It's him who started all of this; he is the one who holds the power now.

I move forward, my feet touching the ground as if they are glued there. The sound of my steps fills the room as I take each step in perfect time with the other. My eyes never leave his face as we approach each other, our chests heaving with each breath we take.

And just like that, it's over. I feel a pain unlike any other, and my legs give out beneath me; I hit the ground with a thud, my body shaking uncontrollably. But even in those moments of defeat, I know that this is what I was born for.

I lie on the floor, watching as my enemy stands over me, triumphant. He leans down and whispers into my ear, "You're dead," before turning to leave the room. And just like that, it's done. The fight is over, but something else is starting now: the war.

I know what I have to do; it's written in blood on my forehead: I must rise up and defeat him, to take back the power that he stole from me. But for now, all I can do is lie here, defeated, and wait for the time when we meet again. For now, this is the end of my story.

I am a soldier; this is what I was born for. This is my life. And as I lay on the ground, watching my enemy walk away, I know that there will be no regrets, because this is what I wanted all along.

This is the first chapter of my story. It's a long one, but it has only just begun. The war isn't over yet; it won't be until we meet again. And when that day comes, make no mistake: I will be ready for him, and he will not win."
