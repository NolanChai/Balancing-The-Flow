, they make me split it with someone else! Oh well, at least I got something. My wife is going to kill me though... She was certain we were both going to be millionaires. Guess I can finally take her shopping for that dream home she wanted! 
 
 Speaking of my wife...I'm glad the lottery people didn't make me have to tell everyone I know. Especially not herâ€¦She would never let it go, and now that we're divorcing...that would just be cruel and unusual punishment on top of everything else. Guess she's still got some hope though! 
 
 Anyway, enough about my wife. Let's talk about what I'm going to do with this money. First things first, pay off all my debts. Then maybe a nice house in the suburbs and a fancy car or two. How about you guys? What would you do if you won the lottery?''
