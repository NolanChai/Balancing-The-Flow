oh, does it stink up there in that kitchen! You'd think someone would have noticed by now, but apparently not. It doesn't help that I live alone, with no roommate or partner or family members who might notice this kind of thing before the rest of the world does--and who are more likely to say something than my customers when they come in for a meal.
 
 *I think we can all agree that if a guy wants ketchup on his plate, he ought to be able to get some ketchup. And if he wants to leave it there until the next customer comes along and eats whatever food has been left over, well--that's fine too. That's part of what makes this place unique!
 
 *But when I find out that a guy has been sitting there for forty minutes without washing off his plate, you can bet your ass I'm going to say something.*

Subject: A little feedback on the service at Bistro Tacos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I have been a frequent customer of your establishment for over two years. During that time, I have enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and the tasty Mexican dishes that you offer. However, during my most recent visit, I experienced some disappointment. 

As I was seated at one of the tables, I noticed a dirty plate with ketchup residue on it in front of an empty chair. It had obviously been there for quite some time since the bread-covered object that had been left on it looked like it had been stuck to the plate. While I understand that sometimes customers forget to clean up after themselves, I felt that it was my responsibility as a customer to let you know about this situation.

I took a few minutes to compose an email to your management, expressing my disappointment and requesting a response. Unfortunately, I never received a reply from them. 

So, I decided to share my experience on social media platforms such as Yelp and Facebook, hoping that others might avoid the same bad experience. 

To be fair, I did not expect an immediate or personalized response from your management team. However, I hoped that they would take notice of this situation and consider implementing measures to ensure that such situations do not occur again in the future. 

Despite my efforts to bring this issue to their attention, it seems that nothing has changed. Your establishment's management still does not seem to care about customer satisfaction or maintaining a clean and tidy environment for its customers. 

In fact, when I visited your establishment again, I was appalled to see the same dirty plate with ketchup residue on it in front of an empty chair. It had obviously been there for some time since the bread-covered object that had been left on it looked like it had been stuck to the plate.

I am saddened and disappointed by your management's lack of concern for customer satisfaction and cleanliness. I will not be visiting Bistro Tacos again, as I no longer feel comfortable or welcome in such an environment. 

I hope that you will take this feedback seriously and consider taking action to improve the quality of service and maintain a clean and tidy establishment for your customers.

Thank you for your time.
