Paul and Jarek are two of the most notorious gangsters in town. They're known for their ruthless tactics and ability to get what they want, by any means necessary. Today was no different. They had just finished a successful heist, netting them millions of dollars in cash and valuables. As they drove away from the scene of the crime, they knew they couldn't afford to be followed. So, they set up an elaborate plan to lose their tail. They had scouted out a nearby warehouse, and Paul took Jarek inside while he waited outside with the getaway car. They made sure no one was around before separating into different parts of the building. The plan worked like clockwork as both men successfully evaded their pursuers. As they congratulated each other on a job well done, they heard footsteps coming down the hallway. Paul froze, his heart racing as he waited to see who it was. Suddenly, Jarek burst into the room with a look of terror on his face. "We got company," he said breathlessly, gesturing towards the door. "They're coming for us!"
