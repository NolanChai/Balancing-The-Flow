James was in the middle of a battle between his conscience and his desire for privacy. He wanted to be alone but the voice in his head would not let him be. He tried to ignore it but it kept talking back, mocking him. "I'm finally alone." "Oh really, James?" "We're always here, James." "No, I'm alone I tell you." "You're not. Not alone, never alone." "Alone with us, Jamie."

James felt trapped in a conversation that he couldn't escape from. He wanted to be left alone but the voice was relentless. It seemed like it would not stop until James gave in and accepted its presence.
