The story is set in the world of D&D and follows a group of adventurers who are known as the "Orcstooth Five". They are a team of skilled warriors, thieves, and mages who embark on various quests to earn their keep. One day, they stumble upon a mysterious ring in the forest. 

The ring is shiny and glistening, with strange symbols etched into its surface. As they examine it closer, they realize that it has some kind of magical power. 

"Gront! What the heck is that on your finger?!" Slog exclaims. 

"It's a Ring of Infinite Charisma," blusters the creature, who introduces himself as an old wizard they've encountered before. 

Slog and his friends look at each other in disbelief. As orcs, they are known for their rugged appearance and tendency to speak with a gruff tone. Having a ring that grants them infinite charisma is almost too good to be true. 

"Fer cryin' out loud Gront, we're orcs! Orcs do not have rings of infinite charisma!" Slog says. "We need to get this thing off our finger before anyone notices."
