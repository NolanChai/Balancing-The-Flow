A woman watches as a goose walks across the water's edge with a fish in its mouth.  "Whoa," she says aloud and leans back to take in the vastness of the ocean. She looks at her feet, covered in sand and dirt from earlier today. She feels her hair blowing in the wind as the goose stretches his wings out to land on the boat dock. The woman picks up a shell off the ground and holds it close to her face. It is pink like the flesh of a coral fish.  "I wish I could travel," she says, looking at the empty horizon. She feels a breeze blow against her skin, feeling a sense of freedom.  The wind picks up the shell, lifting it into the air and sending it tumbling away.  She chases after it, letting out a little scream as she loses sight of the shell.   "This isn't real," she says aloud as she watches the shell flying through the air like a kite on strings. She looks up at the sky and sees a seagull sailing through the clouds with a fish in its mouth. It swoops down toward her, opening its beak to say something she cannot hear.  "Shut up," she screams as she throws her arms out to keep it from touching her.  The bird flies away, disappearing into a cloud. She turns around to face the sea.   "I want to see the world," she says aloud, feeling a sense of loneliness. It feels like someone is watching her from above and she looks up at the sky again but there is no one there.  A gull caws out as it flies by overhead, sending something down onto the boat dock. She looks down to see it was a piece of paper with writing on it: "Get back to work."
