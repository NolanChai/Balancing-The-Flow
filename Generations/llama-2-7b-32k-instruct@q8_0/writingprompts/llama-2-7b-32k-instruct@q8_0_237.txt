Beginning:
"This is the USS Elysium, we are in orbit around Jupiter. We've intercepted a distress signal from an unknown source, and have been attempting to make contact."

Midpoint:
"As we approach the source of the signal, we realize it's coming from a small, damaged spacecraft. The craft is barely recognizable as human-made, its hull buckling under the strain of exposure to Jupiter's radiation. We send out a team to investigate."

End:
"As they approach the wreckage, they find an empty space suit and a single, broken piece of equipment - it looks like a sensor or a transmitter. The team returns to the Elysium, confused and concerned about what could have happened here."

Now, write a 50-100 word story that continues from this point. What happens next? Do they find anything else in the wreckage? Do they try to contact anyone?

Make sure your story is engaging and suspenseful, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Good luck!
