Angel's Bring Out Metal Rod During Projection

"Ah, so this is the object I shall use," said the master, taking in hand the metal rod handed over by the previous set of servants. "It is settled."

The master then directed his angels to bring out a series of objects that would be used as part of his plan. With each item brought into the room, he took it and held it up for all to see before setting it down again.

As he did so, the servants became increasingly nervous about what might be in store for them. They had heard tales of the master's past deeds, and they knew that his plans were always nefarious.

The last item brought into the room was a set of shackles. The master took them and examined them closely before setting them aside for now.

"Well," he said, "I think we are ready to begin."

With that, the master began to speak, his voice filled with a sense of power and control. His words were like a spell, casting a shadow over all in the room.

As he spoke, the servants felt their wills being sapped away, and they found themselves unable to resist his command. They knew that they had no choice but to do as they were told.

The master's plan was set in motion, and it would not be stopped until he had achieved his goal. The servants were powerless to stop him, and they knew that their lives were now at the mercy of a madman.

It was a dark day indeed for the servants, as they found themselves trapped in a web of deceit and manipulation. They would never forget what happened that day, and they would always be haunted by the memory of the master's evil plan.

But even as they suffered, there was a sense of awe and wonder about the master's power. He was truly something else, and they knew that they were lucky to have survived his wrath.

The story ends with the servants still trapped in their prison, but now knowing that they had been part of something greater than themselves. They would always carry the memory of the master's plan, and it would be a reminder of the power of evil and the dangers of trusting those who seek to control others.
