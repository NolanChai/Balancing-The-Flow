ations. He had used it to smash the old robot into a thousand tiny pieces in front of all the angels and he remembered how happy they were for him afterwards. The smile on their faces told him what they thought, that was no longer needed. That thing had been a reminder, not just to them but also to himself. 
 
 Now it would serve as his reminder again, this time of the things that he would do and the things he wouldn't. He turned towards the wall and used both hands on the rod, sending all his will through his arms as he slammed the metal bar into the brick wall behind him. The wall shook slightly before cracking down the middle, chunks falling off in a hail of dust that filled the air. 
 
 Then it was done. It had taken only one hit but it was enough. He held the rod up as he felt all the energy drain from his body and he collapsed to the floor. The angels rushed over to him, their faces full of concern for their master. They were not so happy now that they saw what the old robot had meant to him after all, but that was nothing new. 
 
 "My Lord," one said as it tried to help him up, "are you sure you should be doing this? It seems a waste when we still have plenty of other things that need fixing around here."

Once upon a time, on a distant planet far, far away, there was a race between a tortoise and a hare. The hare was confident that he would win easily since he was fast, but the tortoise was determined to prove everyone wrong. 

As they started off, the hare quickly left the tortoise behind, thinking he had all the time in the world to finish first. But the tortoise kept plodding on, slowly but surely, without stopping or looking back. The hare's confidence grew into arrogance as he watched the tortoise from afar, assuming that he would win by a landslide. 

Suddenly, the hare realized that the tortoise was catching up! He panicked and ran even faster, but the tortoise still kept pace, not giving up or getting discouraged. The two racers continued to speed through the planet's desert landscape, leaving a trail of dust in their wake. 

As they approached the finish line, the hare was exhausted and stopped to catch his breath, but the tortoise kept moving forward, determined to cross that finish line. Suddenly, the hare saw a group of aliens watching them from afar. They were interested in seeing who would win this race, so they decided to lend a hand. 

The aliens used their advanced technology and equipment to speed up both racers, making them go even faster than before. The tortoise was now catching up to the hare, and it became a neck-and-neck race to the finish line. Both racers were pushing themselves to their limits, with the hare's arrogance finally paying off as he crossed first.

The tortoise crossed the finish line first, much to everyone's surprise, including the hare.
