I am a werewolf, and this story begins with my transformation. 

My name is [Your Name], and I live in a small town nestled in the mountains. 

One day, as I was out exploring the woods near my home, something strange happened. 

The sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, when suddenly, I felt a tingling sensation creep over my body. My skin started to itch and burn, and my eyes began to glow red. 

As the moon rose, so did I, becoming a creature of the night. 

But this was not just any werewolf transformation - it came with a terrible price. 

I had always been different from other people, but now I knew why. 

My body began to change, my hair grew out in clumps, and my nails became long and sharp. My teeth lengthened and sharpened, becoming more animal than human. 

And as the moonlight continued to fall upon me, I could feel my mind begin to slip away from me, into a place of instinct and darkness. 

I knew that this was no ordinary werewolf story - I was destined for something greater. 

As the sun rose, so did my fears, as I realized what had happened to me. 

I was now part of an ancient legend, one that had been passed down through generations. 

But this was not just any legend - it was a curse. 

A curse that would forever haunt me and the ones around me. 

And so, my story begins with my transformation into a werewolf, but it is also the tale of how I tried to break free from the curse, and bring light back to the world.
