s her guy in less than fifteen minutes! Now THAT'S value for money...

I sat before the strange looking radio, skeptical that I would get what I paid for. There was no way such a thing could possibly exist… but then Joan said she founs her guy in less than fifteen minutes! Now THAT'S value for money...

The best part about this was how the psychic had made me feel like my love life is unimportant, and I am just one of thousands of men out there trying to find a soulmate. Yet, here she is doing me a favor by finding me someone in 15 minutes flat. Her voice drips with sarcasm, as if she's making fun of you for even thinking you might need her service...

The first thing I did when the psychic finished was to go on YouTube and look up “fake psychics”. As soon as I found a video that proved Joan had no idea what she was talking about, I wrote the FTC. If they can't prove she isn't fake, then her company will be banned from making false advertising claims!

I'm sure this won't get the psychic in trouble with the FTC though, because she probably has some way of covering up any evidence that would expose her as a fraud. It's very similar to how you could easily catch a fake doctor by asking them questions about medicine. A real doctor wouldn't be caught off guard or have to stop and think before answering your questions...

I will never use this psychic service again, but I did want to share it with anyone else who might need it in the future. It was an entertaining experience that I won't forget anytime soon!

Joan says she uses a “specialized psychometric system” called “PSI-5”, which has helped her find soulmates for thousands of people. She says she gets “specific names, birthdays, locations” and even “life paths” . This was the first time I had ever heard about this system...

She gave me a specific name that would make my future wife fall in love with me - John! Then, Joan told me my fiancée's “energy signature”. She said her name is Emily and she's an elementary school teacher who lives in the Midwest. Joan even gave me the exact address of where I will meet my soulmate next week.

I won't bore you with the details, but I have to tell you that it was unbelievable. This woman had a way of describing things that sounded like she could read minds. She spoke about all these intimate things that no one could have known! Joan told me more than just my future wife's name and location...

Joan also gave me some advice on how to meet Emily, the woman I was going to marry. The most important thing for me to do is to keep an open mind about meeting her because she may not be who I expect her to be! That really stuck with me after our call. It's so true...

When Joan gave me my wife-to-be's name and location, it was almost like she had the ability to see into my future. When I got off the phone I immediately went out and booked a flight ticket to go visit her in Chicago!

I never imagined that meeting a stranger would bring me so much joy. Now, I am on cloud nine because my new fiancée and I are both looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together! This psychic had it right after all...

My name is John and I just wanted to say that this woman's advice was nothing short of incredible. When she gave me Emily's full name, address, and life path, I knew without a doubt that her services were legitimate...

I will be forever grateful for Joan and the PSI-5 psychometric system she uses. This woman is truly gifted when it comes to reading energy signatures and finding soulmates! She saved me so much time and hassle by doing all the research on my future wife for me...

If you want to meet your soulmate, I suggest you call this psychic service immediately before someone else gets there first. Joan is incredibly gifted at what she does, and her services are worth every penny! She will tell you where to find love no matter how hopeless it seems right now...

I'm not going to sugarcoat the fact that I was skeptical when I called this number. But, Joan had so many specific details about my future wife, including her name and location, that she could only have known because of divine intervention or something supernatural. It just felt like fate...

When Joan gave me Emily's life path and birthday, it was almost as if I knew her already! She had the exact number of pets she had and the exact car she drove - all details that could not have been known unless she was somehow in my head.

The most amazing part is how Joan gave me advice about meeting Emily that turned out to be true to a T. I had no idea what kind of personality she would have, but Joan told me right away that my wife has a lot of patience and will teach me so much... She was absolutely spot on!

Whenever someone asks me if this service is legitimate, I tell them all about my experience calling Joan. She was able to give me details about a woman that were specific enough to seem like magic - but they weren't! This psychic had to have some kind of supernatural abilities because she knew so much about my future wife without ever having met her...

I am so grateful to Joan for helping me find the love of my life. Whenever I tell people how this woman helped me, I can see in their eyes that they want to experience the same joy I have now - even if they are skeptical at first! You'll know it's true once you hear her voice...

When Joan told me Emily's life path, I was in disbelief. I had no idea how she could possibly know this information unless someone had tipped her off to these facts beforehand. Her advice on meeting Emily turned out to be true and now we are happily married! She is a miracle worker and I am so thankful for her gift...

I will never forget the day that I called Joan and she told me how my future wife's name would start with an E, what school she attended, and where she would live. It was like she knew everything about this person! All these details were things that no one else could have known unless they had seen into my future...

Joan also gave me some advice on how to meet Emily, the woman I was going to marry. The most important thing for me to do is to keep an open mind about meeting her because she may not be who I expect her to be! That really stuck with me after our call. It's so true...
