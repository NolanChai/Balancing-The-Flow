1. My car starts to make an alarming sound.  
2. The road ahead is blocked by a fallen tree.  
3. I need to stop for gas before continuing on my journey.  
4. My GPS directs me down the wrong highway.

Please respond with one of the following:

1. "Yes, something is definitely wrong."
2. "It seems like there's a problem with your car or its parts."
3. "You may want to check your fuel level and make sure it's not empty before continuing on your trip."
4. "Your GPS unit must be malfunctioning, perhaps due to a recent software update."

I apologize for the confusion. Please respond again with your answer, and I will proceed accordingly.
