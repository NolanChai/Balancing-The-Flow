The doctor has an office in his home, and he often gets patients that come knocking at the door. This time, however, it is a different patient than usual. The doctor answers the door to find a young woman standing on his porch, looking scared and out of breath. She introduces herself as Martha, and asks if she can use his phone. The doctor invites her in and gives her a drink of water before allowing her to use his phone. He has no idea who she is or what she wants, but he decides that it would be rude to ask any questions while she is using the phone. Once Martha ends her call, she thanks the doctor for letting her use his phone and leaves without saying anything else. The doctor is left wondering what her business was, but he doesn't have enough information to pry further.
