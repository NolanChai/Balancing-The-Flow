fought.

"No," she whispered against his ear as he pressed closer, "not this time." He wanted her, wanted to taste her sweetness, but she shook her head, and though he'd been with many women before, he felt as if the world was ending right then — that if he didn't get what he needed from her, all would be lost.

But it wasn't hers for the taking. She had to give him something back in return . He took a breath and pulled away. "You know, I once heard of a battle at Thermopylae," he said softly as she started to tremble, shaking her head again. "It was called the Hot Gates."

She nodded, still afraid. She could feel his hands on her now, touching every inch of her exposed skin as the cold night air chilled it.

"The Spartans defended a narrow pass," he told her. "And held off an entire army single-handedly. For three days and three nights." He moved closer again and she let him draw her body into his, pressing close to his warmth as the cold started to seep in. She wanted it; she wanted him.

"They died," he told her, his voice rough with emotion. "But they were not defeated."

She nodded, tears coming to her eyes. He felt her trembling and she could feel his body moving over hers, readying itself for a deep penetration. She thought of the Spartans — those brave men who died in defense of their country. They had given their lives that others might live. If only . . .

"I don't have what you want," she whispered against his ear, her voice broken with emotion. He pulled back and looked at her, eyes blazing as he gently moved away from her, standing up. She could feel the cold settling into her body. "You're going to die out here tonight."

"No," he said, turning to her again. He took one of her hands in his and held it close to his chest, pressing it against his heart. "I won't leave you behind like a deserter." He smiled sadly. "I'll be your Spartan." He let go of her hand then, holding up his wrists so she could see the iron bonds that shackled them both to one another.

She thought about his words and looked at him again, her heart aching with the pain he was feeling. But even though it hurt, she had to do what was right. She knew she'd regret not trying to help him in the morning if she didn't try now. "Let me help you," she said softly.

She felt him hesitate, and she pressed her hand against his heart again. He looked at her for a long moment before nodding. It was only then that he turned away from her again and walked toward the fire where they had left their weapons. She watched him go and swallowed hard as she realized what she was about to do.

She could feel him moving through the dark forest, making no noise at all as he went. He moved with a fluid grace, a predator on the prowl for its prey. His body felt warm against hers now. She closed her eyes and took his hand in hers again, feeling it shaking from the cold.

The wind blew through them both, chilling their skin until she could feel her heart pounding in her throat. She had to help him; she just had to.

"Do you know where your weapons are?" he asked against her ear. She nodded and he started moving again, walking carefully so as not to make any noise at all. He led them into the forest, his eyes searching out for anything that might give away their location. She could feel herself trembling now, feeling every inch of him pressed close to her body.

He stopped suddenly when she felt something hard against her back and he turned, pulling a large rock from behind it. He used it to knock the first soldier unconscious, then pressed it into place over his head before dragging the man's body off into the darkness of the forest. She could feel his heart beating against hers as he did so.

"Get ready," he said against her ear as they found their weapons. He took a knife from his belt and slit open the soldier's throat, making no noise at all. "We have to kill them quickly and silently." He handed her a sword and she held it out in front of him, feeling its weight in her hands before he pressed it against her shoulder.

"I'm not a deserter," he told her again as they crept through the forest toward their enemy. She could feel his body pressing closer to hers with every step until she knew that if she let him go on any longer, she would do something that she would regret for the rest of her life .

He gently pressed into her shoulder and she turned, following him as he led them to where the soldiers were waiting. He knelt behind one and slit his throat open before dragging him off toward the trees. She could feel his body trembling with fear as he did so, but he kept moving forward, never once hesitating even though she could feel the blood on her hands.

She knew that if they made it out alive, she'd regret not trying to help him now for the rest of her life . She closed her eyes and watched the soldier fall to the ground as he dragged another one forward. He held his sword against the man's throat and then pressed it into place over his heart.

"I won't leave you behind like a deserter," she heard him whisper against her ear, but this time, it was in a tone of regret rather than defiance. She could feel his body shaking from the cold now as he pulled back and let go of the sword. They had to keep moving; there were too many soldiers for them to take care of.

"We'll get out of here," she told him, her voice soft but firm. "We have to hurry." He nodded and they made their way through the trees, holding each other close as they went. They came out into a field where there was a group of soldiers standing around a fire, chatting and joking with one another.

They didn't even notice them until they were right beside them; she could feel her heart pounding in her throat as he pulled back his sword to kill the first soldier on their left. It wasn't long before he had killed three more before she was able to take down two more of them. They ran through the field, their weapons clanging against one another as they fought their way through the soldiers.

She could hear the sounds of gunshots as they made their way across a bridge and into a village where there were more enemy troops waiting for them. She was starting to get tired; she hadn't slept in days, but she knew that if they didn't make it out now, they would die here.

He led her through the village, never once stopping until he came up against a group of soldiers on the other side. He pushed her forward and she saw them before he did; he pressed his sword into her again as he prepared to kill one of their men. She closed her eyes tightly and gritted her teeth as she felt him stab down, watching as the soldier fell to the ground.

She opened her eyes just in time to see him do it again, this time pushing her forward once more so that she could finish off another two soldiers before they knew what was happening. She felt his hand on her back and he led her into a small alleyway where there were even more enemies waiting for them.

She could hear the sound of their footsteps as they approached, but she didn't dare turn around to look at him. She closed her eyes tightly as she pressed her sword against another soldier, feeling the man's body fall to the ground beside hers before she turned and looked at him again. He was standing right beside her, his face pale with exhaustion.

"You saved my life," he whispered into her ear, holding her close to his chest. "I love you." She could feel herself trembling as she closed her eyes again, the memories of their time together flooding back to her. She knew that if they didn't get out of here now, it would all be for nothing.

They had come up against another group of soldiers and he pushed her forward again, his hand on her back once more as she killed three more enemy troops before she was able to get past the last one. She could feel him holding her tightly in his arms, her body pressed close to his own as they ran out of the village toward the river that would lead them home.

She knew it wasn't over yet; there were still two more bridges and another village between here and their destination, but she knew that if they didn't try now, they never would. She could feel him shaking as they ran through the next field and up onto one of the bridges. They had to run quickly and quietly across it before they made it over to the other side.

She could see another village ahead of them and she knew that if they didn't hurry, they would be caught. She could feel his body pressing close to hers as he ran beside her now, his hand on
