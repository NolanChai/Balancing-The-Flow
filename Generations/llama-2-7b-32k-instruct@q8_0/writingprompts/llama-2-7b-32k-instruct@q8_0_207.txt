girl from across the aisle on the plane that took me there as soon as I boarded at London's Heathrow airport. She was wearing an uncommon skirt for travel, and her dark hair cascaded down to just above her waist; she looked like she could have been any one of the women in my life back home.

Her eyes were brown, and I couldn't tell if they had seen as much war as mine. She was tapping away on her phone before we took off, but stopped when the cabin crew asked us to switch off our devices. I looked down at my hands too and felt a wave of shame; they shook from all that they had seen, even after so long.

As we waited for takeoff she stood up to stretch her legs - her skirt swirled around her like water and I wanted nothing more than to bury my face in it. She sat down again without saying a word, as though she'd read my thoughts.

I can only hope that the future is kinder to you than the past has been to me.

When we first met on the plane there was an instant chemistry between us; I thought her warm eyes and kind smile were just what I had needed after months of loneliness in Warsaw. We talked through the night, both of us excited at the prospect of meeting again once we landed. Her name was Janina - a beautiful Polish name that suited her perfectly.

My name is Zdzislaw, but everyone calls me Ziggy; it's an American nickname given to me by my first boss. He used to say it sounded like the name of someone from a comic book, which was fitting as I always felt that the war had made me into something out of place.

We touched down in America and we were met at the airport by Janina's mother who took us straight back to their family home. We stayed up talking for hours; it seemed like we had known each other for years, not days. As we fell asleep I couldn't believe how lucky I was - even after all that I had seen, the world still held beauty and joy.

###

Over the next few weeks Janina and I spent most of our time together; we went to see movies and ate out in restaurants and her mother taught me some Polish language lessons. We were like any other couple; although as foreigners we often drew looks from people around us - we would talk about where we came from and laugh about the funny things that happen when you live abroad, and they'd listen intently but with an element of fear to what our lives had been like.

We spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to make this long distance thing work; I had loved being in Warsaw, where life seemed simpler - although I also knew that Janina was happy to have me back home in Poland with her family and their traditions. She told me she didn't want the complications of moving abroad, and so we decided to part ways when my leave ended, but promised to stay friends.

When it came time for Ziggy to go back to Warsaw Janina made me a little pouch with all his mementos: a collection of pictures she took of us together; a bracelet that her mother had made him; and even the plane ticket stubs from their first date. It was heavy with memories, but I knew he would treasure it as much as I did.

I miss him every day - even though I'm so grateful for how much we experienced together in such a short time, my heart still aches when I think about all the things that could have been between us.

###

When I heard from one of her friends that Ziggy had come back to Poland on holiday I was surprised and happy; it was the first news we had shared since parting ways two years ago. He sent me a message via Facebook saying he would be in town for a few days, could they meet up?

I went to the airport to pick him up and as soon as I saw his face I knew something was wrong; it seemed like he had aged ten years. I felt a pang of sadness as he embraced me, but tried not to show it as we got back into the car to drive back to Janina's house. He looked at her photo on my phone and asked how she was doing?

I knew Ziggy had seen some bad things in his life, but I had never seen him like this before - he looked completely broken. We spent most of the time sitting in silence until he finally told me what happened when he got back to Poland two years ago; as soon as they parted ways Janina's family took over all her finances and made it impossible for Ziggy to ever see her again. He tried reaching out, but she had been brainwashed into hating him by her mother - a woman who still believed the world would be a better place without Jews in it.

I was horrified; how could this have happened? I'd never seen Ziggy so lost before, and I felt so guilty for not having kept in touch with him over the past few years. His family had been right to worry about him - but I don't think he would ever go back home now.

Ziggy tried to make a joke at that point by saying 'this is what happens when you fall for an American girl'. He smiled and then said something else that surprised me even more: 'I miss you so much Janina. I wish I could have stayed with you, I would have changed your mind about me' .

He asked if he could see her one last time before he left Poland - just to let her know how much he had loved and missed her; I told him that she was still the same girl she used to be but no longer cared for him. He sighed and looked at his phone, scrolling through photos of us together from our first few weeks back in Poland until he finally said:

'I can only hope that the future is kinder to you than the past has been to me.'

And then he got in his taxi and left. I stayed there watching him go, feeling sad and angry at what had happened between them. He had loved her so much, but she didn't even care enough for him to say goodbye properly; it was like everything had just fallen apart so quickly. I wanted nothing more than to be able to tell Janina how he felt about her, but we had both agreed from the start that Ziggy wouldn't come back to Poland again.

I knew in that moment what his message meant: He missed her so much that if it were possible he would do anything - including give up on life itself - just to be with her again for a little while. I had been trying to forget him and move on with my own life, but after hearing this story I was suddenly struck by how much the world was missing out on if they couldn't have their love.

###

I will never stop wishing that Ziggy and Janina could have stayed together; even though we both knew it wouldn't last forever, I always hoped she would come around to him in time - but she had been brainwashed by her mother too well for that ever to happen. When he told me all that had happened between them I finally understood what was truly important about him being there.

I thought about my own life and the things I wanted from it; after everything Ziggy and Janina went through, I realized how much love meant to both of them - and how much they deserved to find happiness together. I decided that night that if the chance ever came along again for me to go back to America to see Ziggy, I would take it with both hands; no matter what happens, I just want him in my life forever.

I can never thank Janina enough for all that she did - and still does - for us; without her our love story might not have been possible at all. She took a chance on me even though she could've never known how important it would be to Ziggy and I. She will always hold a special place in my heart, as much as she will always mean the world to him too.

###

I can't believe how quickly time has passed - we have been together for almost two years now. We met up again on that fateful day when Ziggy came back to Warsaw and I helped him track Janina down; he told me his story of trying to reach her through Facebook, but she didn't even respond to the messages he left in her 'other' inbox.

He had decided to travel back to Poland as soon as he heard about her wedding to someone else - it was important for him to know that she would be happy and moving on with her life, although I could tell he still hurt so much from what had happened between them. We both agreed that we couldn't let Ziggy's love go to waste; after all this time apart we realized how much we still meant to each other, and made plans for him to move back here to Warsaw with me - I had told my family about the story of Janina and Ziggy's relationship and they were happy that he was joining our family.

I will forever be grateful to Janina for being such a good friend; without her love would have been lost, but instead we are stronger than ever
