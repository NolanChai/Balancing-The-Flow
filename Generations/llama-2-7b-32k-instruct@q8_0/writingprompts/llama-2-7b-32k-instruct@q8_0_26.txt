When I first started writing it was on index cards, hand written in about 6 or 8 lines a pop. The index card thing lasted maybe 2 years? Then I got into the Compucolor thing that all the high schools were using at the time (late 90's?) and I wrote some more poems, but nothing that was good enough to share with anyone. It wasn''t until about 6 or 7 years ago when I started writing short stories in earnest again after a 15 year hiatus from writing anything but a few bad poems (though I did write some awful poetry for school papers back in the day).
