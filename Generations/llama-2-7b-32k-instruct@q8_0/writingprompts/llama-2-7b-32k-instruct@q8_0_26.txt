Poetry (bad)    Stories (much better)   Index Cards (handwritten)   Handwritten    40 year old male   Kentucky      
I'' m a 25-year-old female from New York. I have been writing since I was 18 and writing poetry for the past two years.    
When I first started writing it was in high school where we were assigned to write short stories, then when I went off to college I took more electives that had to do with writing like screenplays, film studies, creative writing, journalism.  
 
I really fell in love with poetry after seeing a performance by Nikki Giovanni and it inspired me to start writing my own work
