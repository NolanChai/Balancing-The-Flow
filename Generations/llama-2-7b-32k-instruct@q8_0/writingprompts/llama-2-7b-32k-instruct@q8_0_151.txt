[INST] Why is this statement true? [/INST]

The statement, "The more time we spend with people who make us feel good, the better we'll feel; the more time we spend with people who don’t make us feel so good, the worse we’ll feel," is true because it reflects a fundamental psychological principle: our emotions and behaviors are significantly influenced by our social interactions and relationships. Here are some reasons why this statement is accurate:

1. Social influence: We tend to adopt the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of those around us. When we spend time with people who make us feel good, their positive attitude and behavior can rub off on us, making us more likely to feel good ourselves. On the other hand, if we surround ourselves with negative or unsupportive individuals, we may begin to adopt their attitudes and behaviors, which can negatively impact our emotional well-being.
2. Emotional contagion: Humans are social animals, and we're hardwired to pick up on the emotions of those around us. When we're in close proximity to someone who's happy or excited, their positive emotions can "contagious." Similarly, if we're in a negative environment with someone who's stressed or anxious, we may start to feel those same emotions ourselves.
3. Self-fulfilling prophecy: Our beliefs and expectations about our relationships can shape our behavior and outcomes. If we believe that spending time with positive people will make us feel good, we're more likely to seek out those individuals and engage in behaviors that support a positive relationship. On the other hand, if we have negative expectations about a particular friendship or social situation, it may be difficult for us to connect with others positively.
4. Emotional validation: Spending time with people who validate our emotions and support our feelings can help us feel seen, heard, and understood. This kind of connection can increase our self-esteem and confidence, which in turn can lead to a more positive outlook on life.
5. Shared experiences: Sharing positive experiences with others can create strong bonds and memories that we'll cherish for years to come. These shared experiences can help us feel connected and supported, making us more likely to feel good about ourselves and our relationships.
6. Personal growth: Spending time with people who challenge us, inspire us, and encourage us to grow can lead to personal development and self-improvement. When we're surrounded by positive and supportive individuals who believe in our potential, it can be easier for us to take risks and try new things that may help us achieve our goals.
7. Emotional regulation: Negative emotions can be contagious as well. If we spend too much time with someone who's constantly complaining or critical, their negative attitude may begin to impact our mood, making it harder for us to manage our own emotions effectively.
8. Social support: Having a strong social support system can help us cope with stress and navigate challenging situations more effectively. When we have people in our lives who support us emotionally, practically, and financially, we're better equipped to handle life's ups and downs.
9. Positive reinforcement: When we receive positive feedback or rewards for our efforts, it can increase our motivation and self-esteem. Spending time with people who appreciate and recognize our achievements can help us feel good about ourselves and encourage us to pursue new opportunities.
10. Personal fulfillment: Ultimately, surrounding ourselves with positive and supportive individuals can lead to feelings of personal fulfillment and purpose. When we connect with others who share our values, goals, and passions, we may feel more confident in our abilities and motivated to pursue our dreams.
In summary, the statement "The more time we spend with people who make us feel good, the better we'll feel; the more time we spend with people who don’t make us feel so good, the worse we’ll feel," is true because it reflects how deeply intertwined our emotions and social interactions are. By surrounding ourselves with positive and supportive individuals, we can improve our mental health, well-being, and overall quality of life.

It's important to note that this statement applies to general relationships, not necessarily romantic or intimate ones. While the principles mentioned above still hold true for these types of relationships, it's also important to consider individual differences in terms of personalities, values, and goals.
