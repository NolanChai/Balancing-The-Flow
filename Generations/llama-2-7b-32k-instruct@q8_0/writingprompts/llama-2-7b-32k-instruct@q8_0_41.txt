I know that one of my coworkers's names is Delia and that she has a special job in our office called the "stapler". I don't know why it's called this or what duties are involved, but I do know that Delia's name tag says so.

Dear Human Resources,
I wanted to bring your attention to the new employee who recently started at our office named Delia. She has been assigned the special title of "stapler", which we all know is a very important job. However, I've noticed that she has been slacking off lately and not doing her job properly. For instance, when I asked her for a staple this morning, she responded with an excuse saying it was out of stock, even though I can see many staples lying around the office. Additionally, another coworker told me that Delia has been leaving early every Friday without permission and spending a lot of time on personal matters instead of focusing on work.
Therefore, I wanted to bring this matter to your attention so we can address it appropriately and ensure that our team is working efficiently and effectively towards the company's goals.
Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Dear Human Resources,
I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning issue regarding one of our new employees, Delia, who has recently been assigned the role of "stapler" in our office. After observing her work for several days, I have noticed some troubling patterns that suggest she may be underperforming and not fully committed to her job duties.
Firstly, on multiple occasions when I've asked Delia for a staple, she has responded with an excuse that the staples are out of stock, even though there is clearly a surplus in the office. Additionally, another coworker informed me that Delia has been leaving early every Friday without permission and spending an unreasonable amount of time on personal matters during work hours.
Moreover, I've noticed that Delia often seems disinterested in her work and preoccupied with personal tasks when she should be focusing on her job responsibilities. She frequently looks at her phone or chats with coworkers instead of completing her work efficiently. This behavior is not only detrimental to her productivity but also affects the morale of our team members and creates an unpleasant working environment.
Based on my observations, I believe it's crucial that we address this issue promptly to ensure Delia is meeting expectations and contributing to our team's success. As such, I kindly request your support in handling this matter accordingly.
I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you or any relevant members of the HR department. Your timely response will be greatly appreciated.
