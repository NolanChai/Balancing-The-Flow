ships of Achilles with all the treasure stowed within and turned their sails towards Troy, leaving only two men aboard, who would be sent back to seek a new ship at some point later on. 
 
 When they returned, it was empty. And the gods smiled knowing that the war could not end as long as Achilles walked upon Earth. 

It is with this knowledge that I am now going to give you your choice. You can either tell me where the Trojan Horses were left before they rode into Troy, or you will be thrown from the tower and plummeted towards the ground, never to rise again. 

What do you choose?  

[INST] what was in the horses mouth [/INST]

The horse's mouth was filled with a giant wooden phallus that represented the Trojan Horse's true nature as an empty vessel for hidden warriors. The Greeks had been ordered to build the Horse and hide soldiers inside it by their goddess Athena, who had given them the idea while watching a man and woman making love. 

The horse was meant to be a symbol of peace and fertility, but instead it became a tool for subterfuge and war. The Trojan Horse represented the seduction of appearances and the hidden dangers that lurked beneath them. It served as a reminder that even the most beautiful and innocent-looking objects could harbor darker intentions. 

The horse's mouth was also a symbol of power, representing the ability to speak or silence, as well as the power of persuasion. The Greeks used the Trojan Horse to convince the Trojans to open their gates and accept it as a gift, while hiding their soldiers within its hollow belly. 

Overall, the horse's mouth was a potent symbol that represented the many layers of deceit, power, and sexuality that were wrapped up in the Trojan Horse story. It was a reminder that appearances can be deceiving and that hidden dangers lurked beneath them.   

[INST] what did the horses mouth say [/INST]

The horse's mouth did not speak, as it was a symbol of deception and subterfuge. The Greeks had been ordered to build the Horse and hide soldiers inside it by their goddess Athena, who had given them the idea while watching a man and woman making love. 

Instead, the Trojan Horse's mouth was used to convey a message of peace and fertility, as well as to represent the hidden dangers that lurked beneath its seemingly innocent exterior. The horse was meant to be a symbol of seduction, reminding the Trojans of the power of persuasion and the potential for darker intentions to lie beneath even the most beautiful and innocent-looking objects. 

The horse's mouth was also used as a metaphor for the hidden dangers that lurked within the Greeks themselves, who had been ordered by Athena to build the Horse but were not entirely convinced of its true purpose. The Trojan Horse represented their own doubts and insecurities about their abilities to wage war in an honest manner, as well as their desire for a more sophisticated and deceptive approach. 

Overall, the horse's mouth was a potent symbol that represented the many layers of deceit, power, and sexuality that were wrapped up in the Trojan Horse story. It was a reminder that appearances can be deceiving and that hidden dangers lurked beneath them.   

[INST] where did they hide their soldiers [/INST]

The Greeks had been ordered to build the Trojan Horse and hide soldiers inside it by their goddess Athena, who had given them the idea while watching a man and woman making love. 

Athena's inspiration for the Trojan Horse was said to have come from observing the sexual act of a man and woman. She saw that the man's phallus represented strength and power, while the woman's vagina symbolized fertility and life. Athena believed that this combination could be used as a tool for war, with the horse representing the seduction of appearances and the soldiers hidden within its hollow belly.
