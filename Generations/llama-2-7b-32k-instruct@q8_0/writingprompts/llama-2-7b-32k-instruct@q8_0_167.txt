is what it's all about. Now let's talk about these letters, folks. These letters are the most important part of the message here because they will tell people where to go for help if they need it. We all know that not every survivor of an abduction can speak out and say help me. They might be too afraid or they might be restrained, but these letters will still get passed along by word of mouth. And so let's see what our survivors have to tell us here. I want you to repeat after me: "Help is on the way" says yellow letter. And now we move onto green. Green is for those who may need immediate help, but are afraid it won't come fast enough or won't be safe enough. We all know that being abducted can lead to a lot of fear and trauma. Survivors may think they deserve what happened to them so they shouldn't ask for help, but they do deserve better. I want you to repeat after me: "You are not alone" says green letter. Now let's add some yellow on top of the green to make it pop a little bit more and make sure everyone knows that help is on the way. Repeat with me: Help is on the way, you are not alone. Finally we have purple. Purple letters can be hard to read sometimes because they might fade over time. We don't want this message to fade though, so let's try and make it as strong as possible. This is for survivors who may not want any kind of attention at all but know that if they hold on just a little longer help will be there. I want you to repeat after me: "It will get better" says purple letter. Now we're going to take the yellow letters and add them over top of green so the message is even stronger than before. Repeat with me: Help is on the way, you are not alone, it will get better. I hope this helps bring awareness about the issue of abduction survivors needing help getting out of their situation. It's a problem we have to work together on because we want all survivors to know that there's always a way out. If you need help or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me and I will do my best to give you the best advice possible. And with that, let's add some more yellow letters just for fun. Repeat after me: It will get better, it will get better, it will get better. The end. Thank you so much for your attention. Have a great day and be safe out there everyone!''

The issue is getting help out of their situation, because they might feel too afraid or ashamed to ask for it. When a survivor might be feeling scared and alone, it's important that they know they aren't in this fight alone. And that's why I created these letters with a message that will get passed along by word of mouth: "Help is on the way" says yellow letter, "You are not alone" says green letter. Help is on the way, you are not alone. Now let's add some purple for survivors who may not want attention at all but know help is out there if they can hold on just a little longer.

You: Okay, I'm here ready to record my audio track for the video about survivors of abduction needing help getting out of their situation. Let's go!

(Silence)

You: Uh, I think it might be better if you can play some music or something in the background while I record because it sounds pretty awkward without any sound at all right now.

(More silence)

You: Alright, let's give it a try. Can you play some ambient background noise? Maybe something with birds chirping or waves crashing or something to help me relax and feel more confident while I record my audio track?

(Background noise starts playing)

You: Great! Now I can focus on recording my audio track without worrying about the sound of silence. Let's get started!

(Pause)

You: Uh, excuse me, do you think maybe we should turn down the background noise a little bit? It's a little too loud and it's drowning out my voice in some parts.

(Background noise is turned down a little)

You: Perfect! Let's get started again.

(Pause)

You: Wait, can you turn the background noise back up? I think I need to hear it more now.

(Background noise is turned up)

You: Okay, that should be good. Now I'm ready to record my audio track. Let's go!

(Silence for a moment as you collect your thoughts and get ready to start recording)
