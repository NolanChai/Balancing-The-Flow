my? Did you find an old toy car or something?'', She asks while still half asleep and rubbing her eyes.   
 
"Yep", He replies while smiling as he shows her a big, black, rock with shiny crystals on it that sparkle in the light. 'This was my first power.''. 
 
'Oh yeah? Well I had bigger things to worry about at your age lol', Sally responds and then looks back down at the thing you showed her. 
 
''You gotta make a choice Timmy, let me bury it again or do something with it.'', She says as she begins to scratch at the dirt around it.

I'll have to wait till I get home before using my powers, I reply while taking another sip of my drink. 

As we drive back in silence, I can't help but feel a little disappointed that Sally didn't seem more excited about my powers or even ask me any questions about them. But then again, it was early and she might have had things on her mind besides what I could do with a rock.

I think the point of the story is that time passes regardless of whether you're happy or sad, old or young, and sometimes we forget just how much power we once had as young adults. The fact that Sally was unaffected by Timmy's powers is also a reminder that not everyone will be impressed by our abilities or even care to acknowledge them. It's a subtle reminder that with age comes the realization that our powers aren't as great as we once thought they were, and that sometimes it's better to let things go than to dwell on them. 

Overall, I think this story is about perspective and growing up. Timmy has the power to bend reality, but he can't control how people react to his powers or make them care about him. Sally is a perfect example of that; she doesn't even notice his powers and continues on with her life as if nothing had changed. It's a bittersweet reminder that our youthful enthusiasm will eventually fade, but it can also teach us to appreciate the things we have now instead of dwelling on what we lost in the past.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
