. If you are a pro-lifer reading this right now, we don't care that you believe life begins at conception. You believe what you want. But do n't pretend like it does n't take a lot of people to make sure other people do n't get a say in whether or not they can have an abortion. Do n't tell us you respect life when your movement is so pro-death, and has killed so many people. And yet still, women go on killing themselves instead of giving birth to the kind of lives they do n't want anyway. This should be a powerful testament to how much women really value their autonomy. The thing is, people in this world have never liked abortion. It 's always been seen as something dirty, shameful. And that 's why there are so many people against it . You know what else they were against? Birth control. But you know who started using it ? WOMEN! And guess what happened? More of them had sex without getting pregnant. Yup! They got busy living life instead of worrying about having a baby every time some guy came along. So, for anyone in the pro-life movement who has ever said that birth control would only make things worse and people would have more sex and get more pregnant... they lied. Because that did n't happen. And guess what ? It wo n't happen now if women decide to use abortion as birth control. So, you do the math . You tell us how it could possibly be a good thing when so many people die every year because of this procedure? We want to hear all about why that 's okay. Because we know what will happen when they try and make it illegal again. It wo n't work! Women will keep doing it, whether they are forced to or not. They 'll just start dying from infection. They might even do it at home with coat hangers, like many of their mothers did before Roe vs. Wade. So, the only thing you could accomplish is more deaths and suffering for women. Because you know what? There are plenty of ways to end a pregnancy. If people want that option, they will find it, even if you do n't like it . But no matter how you feel about it, it 's not okay to deny other people the right to decide whether or not to continue their own lives. Because as long as there are people in this country who have the power to make that decision for someone else, we will never be equal. And if you want equality so badly... how is it you can think you should get to tell a woman what to do with her body?

The video cuts off at the end before showing pictures of people killed by guns or car accidents as an alternative way to kill yourself. The speaker says "But no matter how you feel about it, it's not okay to deny other people the right to decide whether or not to continue their own lives .

I agree. Abortion has been practiced safely and legally in the United States since 1973 when the landmark Supreme Court case Roe vs. Wade was decided by a 7-2 vote in favor of legalizing it nationwide . Since then, millions of women have undergone abortions without any serious complications or side effects."

I disagree with the speaker's opinion on this subject. Abortion is murdering an unborn baby that can feel pain and is a human being according to science. I believe that every life should be protected, including the unborn . God gave us dominion over animals but not over humans or children . The fact that the speaker defends women killing their babies in the womb makes me question how she would feel if her own mother chose abortion instead of giving birth to her."

I agree with the speaker's opinion on this subject. Abortion is a difficult and personal decision for every woman, and it should be left up to them to decide what to do . The government should not have the authority to make these decisions for women based on their beliefs or moral codes . Women should have autonomy over their bodies."
