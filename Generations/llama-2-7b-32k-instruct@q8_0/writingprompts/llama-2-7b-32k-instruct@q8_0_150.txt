The Umbrella Crows: A Story About a Group of Murderous Birds Who Dress Up for Rainy Days and Commit Fowl Play   
We were a group of crows, dressed in black hats and coats, holding umbrellas over our heads to protect ourselves from the rain. Our feathers were wet and dripping as we perched on the edge of a building, looking for a meal. Suddenly, one of us spotted a pile of stale bread on the sidewalk below. 

"I'll get it," said the bravest crow, swooping down to grab the bread and fly back up with it in his beak. 

But as he was about to take off, something caught his attention. A human was standing nearby, watching him curiously. The crow froze, unsure of what to do. Should he drop the bread and flee? Or should he try to eat it on the spot? 

Just then, another crow, who had been standing nearby, spoke up. "I've got an idea," she said. "What if we all dress in black hats and coats like him? We can hide our feathers from those pesky humans and sneak up on them when they least expect it." 

The other crows thought this was a brilliant plan, and soon enough, the six of us were dressed to match the human. We found an umbrella and held it over our heads as we perched on top of a building. 

Soon, a group of humans walked by below us. One of them looked up at us and pointed. "Look at those black crows," she exclaimed. "They're dressed just like that human." 

We chuckled to ourselves and waited for the perfect moment to strike. Suddenly, one of the humans dropped his bread. It was an easy catch! The rest of the group scrambled away in fear as we ate our meal. 

As the humans ran away, we realized that we had accidentally dressed up like a murderer. But hey, it worked, didn't it? We decided to keep on dressing up and causing chaos wherever we went. After all, who needs a costume when you can be a crow?
