Output: My children are not raised by me 
``Mom, get down from there'', my son sighed with a tired voice, folding his arms as he looked up to the roof of the house in which he was raising my grandchildren. Too stoned to listen, I deliberately ignored him and continued to watch the birds on the other side of the window, pretending not to hear what he said. As I watched them fly through the air, it reminded me of how free they were, unaffected by anything or anyone, just like my grandchildren are meant to be. I couldn't help but smile as I thought about how precious and innocent they were, and how much joy they brought to our lives. It was then that my son stepped in front of the window, blocking my view, and began to yell at me, asking what was going on with me and why I wasn't doing anything productive with my life. My mind raced as I tried to come up with an excuse, but all I could do was shake my head and mutter under my breath, "I'm just trying to enjoy the view." It was then that he lost his temper and started shouting at me, calling me out for not being a good mother figure and accusing me of being too lazy to take care of my grandchildren. As he continued to berate me, I could feel myself getting angry, but I refused to let him see it. Instead, I turned my back on him and walked away, leaving the room without a word. It was then that I realized how much time had passed, and how tired I was of listening to his complaints about me. As I made my way upstairs to my bedroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. Finally, I could escape the constant nagging and criticism from him and have some peace and quiet. However, as I lay down on my bed, I couldn't help but feel guilty for not being more present in my grandchildren's lives. I knew that they looked up to me, and that I had a responsibility to set a good example for them. But, at the same time, I also knew that it was impossible for me to be everything they needed all the time. There were days when I simply didn't have enough energy to deal with their constant demands and questions, and there were times when I felt overwhelmed by the responsibility of raising them alone. Despite these feelings of guilt and self-doubt, I knew that I had to find a way to make it work. So, I made a decision to be more present in their lives, to take an interest in their activities and to show them that I cared about what they were doing. I also decided to set aside some time each day for myself, to do something that I enjoyed and helped me relax. And, slowly but surely, I began to see a difference in my grandchildren's behavior. They seemed more confident and secure, knowing that I was there for them when they needed me. I realized that, despite the challenges of raising two children on my own, it was possible to find a balance between being present and setting aside time for myself. It wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it. As I lay in bed that night, I couldn't help but feel proud of what I had accomplished. Sure, there were still days when I felt overwhelmed or tired, but at least now, I knew that I was doing my best to be a good mother figure for my grandchildren. And, for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was on the right track.

``Mom, get down from there'', mi hijo suspiró con una voz cansada, levantando los brazos mientras miraba arriba a la casa en la que estaba criando mis nietos. Para eso, me dio por no escucharlo y seguí mirando las aves en el otro lado de la ventana, haciéndome eco de su libertad para distanciarme de lo que decía. Como veían volar, me recordó cuán libres eran, ajenos a cualquier cosa o persona, justo como mis nietos deberían ser. No pude evitar sonreír al pensar en cómo preciosas y inocentes eran y cuánta alegría traían a nuestras vidas. Fue entonces cuando mi hijo se interpuso delante de la ventana, bloqueando mi visión, y me pidió que le dijera qué estaba pasando conmigo y por qué no estoy haciendo nada útil con mi vida. Mi mente dio vueltas como intentar encontrar una excusa, pero todo lo que pude hacer fue agitar la cabeza y murmurar bajo el ala, "Estoy simplemente disfrutando del espectáculo." Fue entonces cuando perdió los estribos y empezó a gritarme, acusándome de no ser una figura materna adecuada y acusándome de ser demasiado débil para cuidar a mis nietos. A medida que continuaba reprendiéndome, sentía que iba a desmayarme, pero lo negué y no dije nada. En lugar de eso, me volví en cara a él y caminé lejos de la ventana, sin decir una palabra. Fue entonces cuando vi cómo mucho tiempo había pasado y cuán cansada estaba de escuchar sus críticas sobre mí. Como hice el trayecto al dormitorio, sentí una sensación de alivio envolviéndome. Por fin, podía huir del constante acuse y critic
