I took another drag and laughed at him, watching my grandson play with my granddaughter on the swing set. `` Oh, I'm coming down soon enough, sweetheart! Just let me enjoy a few more moments in peace'', I said back to him, taking another hit off of the joint.


I could feel the effects of the marijuana starting to kick in as I sat on my roof deck with the sun setting behind me. The birds were chirping and the breeze was blowing through the trees as my grandchildren laughed and played in the backyard. It was a perfect evening, and I didn't want it to end anytime soon.

As my son kept calling for me from down below, I couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over me. I was enjoying the last few moments of solitude before the chaos of parenthood set in again. My grandchildren were playing and laughing, and I was simply basking in the moment.

But as time passed, my high started to wear off, and I began to feel a bit restless. The sun had finally set, and it was getting dark outside. My son's voice continued to call for me from below, but I couldn't bring myself to move. I just wanted to stay up here on the roof deck with my grandchildren for a little while longer.

As they started to drift away from the swing set and head inside, I felt a sense of sadness wash over me. I knew that soon enough, my son would take them home and I would be left alone again. The thought of being alone brought a wave of panic, but I pushed it aside for now.

I took one last drag off of the joint and extinguished it in the ashtray on the table beside me. I stood up from my chair and stretched my arms out to the side, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me again. I had enjoyed this evening immensely, and I knew that I would never forget it.

As I headed back inside, I couldn't help but feel a bittersweet feeling mixed with sadness as I left my grandchildren behind. But at the same time, I knew that I would always have the memories of this evening to cherish forever. And for now, that was enough to keep me going.

I walked into the house and found my son sitting on the couch in the living room, looking up at me with a curious expression on his face. `` What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost'', he asked, taking a drag off of his joint.

`` Just enjoying the last few moments of peace and quiet before things get crazy around here again'', I replied, sitting down beside him and exhaling slowly. `` You know how it is with kids, they can be so demanding sometimes'', I said with a laugh.

My son chuckled and nodded his head in understanding as he took another drag off of his joint. He knew that the joys of parenthood were fleeting, but we both enjoyed the ride while it lasted. And for now, that was enough to keep us going.
