oodie and a backpack. His hair is unkempt, as if he has not showered or slept for days.  I try to make conversation, but he doesn't answer me.  It's getting dark fast, the sun just setting over the horizon.  
 I could drive him home, but that would be a stupid move. My mom taught me better than that.  
 So instead, I ask if he has anywhere he needs to go. His face lights up when he says yes, and his tone is eager.  He doesn't tell me the name of the place, but he starts giving directions anyways, so excited to be leaving this spot that I can feel it in my bones.  
 And then it hits me - this guy is probably a serial killer.   
 The thought makes my skin crawl with fear and disgust. I'm still on the road, and I don't know where I'll end up now that he's in my car. He looks like a monster, with his wild hair and unkempt beard.  His face is pale, with dark circles under his eyes - like he hasn't slept in days.   
 My heart races as I try to think of a way out of this situation. How do I get rid of him without getting hurt? I know my mom taught me to always help people in need, but this guy is dangerous. He could be the kind who gets off on hurting young girls.  The thought makes me feel sick and scared.  
 But then it hits me - maybe he's just a normal guy who needs a ride home. Maybe I'm being paranoid. I try to calm myself down, but my heart is still pounding with fear and uncertainty.   
 As we drive, I can feel the tension building between us. He's watching me closely, as if he's waiting for something. I can't shake the feeling that he's a killer, ready to strike at any moment. 
 
 When we get close to his destination, he leans over and whispers in my ear. His breath is sour and stale, like he hasn't had anything to eat for days. He says "You can let me off here if you want." I feel a surge of adrenaline as I realize that this guy might be dangerous. 
 But then I think about how alone I am - just a girl driving down the road, with a crazy serial killer in my car. If I get out now, he could come after me. I know my mom would want me to be brave and courageous, but this is too big of a risk. I have to stick it out until we get to his house.   
 So I stay silent, continuing to drive as he watches me with a creepy, predatory gaze. My heart is pounding in my chest, my throat feels tight and constricted. 
 Finally, after what seems like an eternity, we reach his house. He gets out of the car, looking relieved. I watch him walk up to his front door, a sense of dread washing over me.   
 What did I just do? I ask myself. Why did I pick up this creepy guy and take him home? It was stupid, plain and simple. Now I'm stuck, with a stranger who might be dangerous lurking in my car. 
 As I drive away, I feel a sense of relief wash over me. But at the same time, I know that this isn't over yet. That guy could come after me anytime he wants - and I'm not sure what to do about it.  
 The rest of the evening is a blur. I try to push the serial killer out of my mind, but I can't stop thinking about him. I know that he's dangerous, and that I need to be careful.  But how? What should I do?   
 The next day, I tell my friends everything that happened. They all laugh at me - "You're such a fool," they say. "How could you pick up a total stranger like that?" They make jokes about how he must have looked crazy, with his wild hair and dirty clothes. 
 But I know the truth. He didn't look crazy. He just looked like a guy who needed help - someone who was down on their luck and alone in the world. And that's what I did - I gave him a lift home. 
But now I realize, too late, that it was a big mistake. A stupid decision that could have cost me my life.   
 The weeks go by, and I try to forget about the serial killer. But every time I drive down that same road, I can't shake the feeling of dread. What if he decides to come after me? What if he's still angry about something and wants revenge? 
I know it sounds ridiculous - but that's how my mind works now. I live in fear, wondering when the monster is going to strike again. It's a constant weight on my shoulders, never far from my thoughts.   
One day, I get a call from the police. They tell me they found a body in the woods near where that guy lived. My heart races as I listen to their words - was it him? Did he do something awful again? 
But then I hear the details - the victim was an old man who had been mugged and killed by a stranger. They didn't know if they caught the right person, but there were some suspicious circumstances surrounding the crime.   
I let out a deep sigh of relief. Thank god it wasn't me this time, I think to myself. That could have been me, or any other girl who took the wrong turn down that road. 
But even though I know I'm safe for now, the fear still lingers. It's always there, a constant reminder of how stupid and careless I was. And I will always live with that guilt - knowing that I could have been the one who didn't make it home that night.  
This story has an open ending because the girl never learns if the man she picked up is a serial killer or not. The reader is left to wonder what happened to her after she dropped him off at his house. Did he attack her? Did something happen to her while she was out driving that night? It's also possible that she forgot about the encounter and went on with her life, never knowing if she had a close call or not. The story ends with the girl still living in fear, wondering what could have happened had she not let the man into her car.
