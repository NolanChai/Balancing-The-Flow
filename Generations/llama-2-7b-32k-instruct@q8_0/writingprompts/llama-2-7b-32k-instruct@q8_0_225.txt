I knew not to pick up hitchhikers, but I did it anyways. Now here I am, a five-foot-five girl, with a creepy six-foot stranger riding in my car. He's bulky, with a hint of a beard and dark eyes that seem to bore into me as if he knows every secret I have. My hands grip the steering wheel tighter, my heart racing as I try to figure out how to get him out of my car without it looking suspicious.
