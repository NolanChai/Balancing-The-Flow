our as the air outside and bleak as I felt, “Happy Birthday!”

I had reached that age in which I was too old for children's parties but not quite young enough to attend adult ones. While the rest of my friends were going out to play or getting ready for their first jobs, I sat alone on a stool at the breakfast table eating scrambled eggs and drinking milk.

This was my second birthday in New York City. Last year I had celebrated it in San Francisco. On that day, my mother had surprised me by taking me to a restaurant in Chinatown for lunch. We sat on bar stools at the counter as we waited for our food and watched Chinese men cook dumplings behind the glass countertop.

Throughout the afternoon I got to choose what places to visit, where to shop and who to meet. My parents had given me a few restrictions: no going out alone in case a stranger tried to kidnap me; no driving too far from my home because of a fear that strangers might rob us on the road and no eating ice cream because it was bad for teeth.

Amidst all the excitement, I could still remember the first time when my parents decided to take me out alone in San Francisco. It was on my thirteenth birthday. I had woken up in a hotel room that they rented and headed down to breakfast after opening presents. My mother had dressed me in jeans and a green T-shirt with a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge on it.

As we made our way downtown, my parents pointed out different tourist attractions such as the Transamerica Tower and Fisherman's Wharf. Then they stopped at Ghirardelli Square where I could choose what chocolate to buy. When it was time to leave for the Golden Gate Bridge, my father went into a small shop to ask about parking while my mother and I waited outside. A woman came up to us asking if we were lost. My mother told her that we wanted to go to the Golden Gate Bridge and she gave us detailed directions on how to get there.

Suddenly, two young men with a camera approached me from behind. They asked where we were from, why we were in San Francisco, what our names were and what we were doing at the moment. When I told them my name was Rebecca, they got excited: “Oh, I love Rebecca! That's my mother's name!” One of them even started singing happy birthday to me because it was my thirteenth birthday that day.

My parents were not suspicious about the two men; however, once we got on a bus heading towards the Golden Gate Bridge they paid very close attention to the people around us. As I sat next to my parents on the seat, they whispered in each other's ears and made sure that no one was standing too close to me.

When we reached the bridge, I noticed two men sitting behind us who had been following closely behind as if they were part of our family. When we got off the bus and started walking towards the bridge, the men quickly stood next to my parents and me, pretending that they wanted to take a picture too. My mother was very tense throughout this time; however, I felt comfortable around them because they looked and acted friendly.

Suddenly, two men dressed in suits approached us from behind saying that the bridge had been closed due to strong winds. They asked if we could go with them to a nearby restaurant where there was still some sunlight. My parents agreed right away because it was getting darker by the minute and they were afraid something bad would happen on the bridge after closing time.

When we reached the restaurant, my parents started talking about their worries. They said that if anything happened to me at the bridge or in a restaurant with strangers, it would be all our faults for not being more cautious. My mother added that she did not know if they could have saved me had something bad happened and her heart was breaking from this fear of losing their only child.

When we finished eating, my parents made sure to thank the men who brought us back on the bus. They were very friendly but looked like criminals. The two men answered politely and said that they did not want anything in return; however, as soon as we left the restaurant my mother put a few hundred dollars into an envelope which she gave to them.

As I rode home with my parents on the bus, I felt very uneasy about these two men who were strangers to me and who knew more about the Golden Gate Bridge than they should have. Once we got off the bus at home, my mother kept saying how happy she was that nothing had happened and kept reminding herself never to let anything like this happen again.

After returning home from lunch on my fourteenth birthday in New York City, I noticed a stranger standing on my front doorstep. As soon as he saw me looking out the window, he raised his hand with two gifts for me; one was a key chain with the Empire State Building and the other was a bagel shaped like New York City.

When I opened the door, he handed both to me and said that he hoped we would get along well. He explained that he had seen my picture in the newspaper on that day's birthday edition; however, instead of coming from China as he originally thought, it was from San Francisco. His name was Shelly and he was a reporter for the New York Post.

A week later, I met with him again at his office to hear more about what had happened. He said that my birthday story had been published in several newspapers across America. One of them even featured my picture on its front page! Shelly continued telling me how people from all around the world wrote letters and made phone calls wishing me a happy birthday. Some wished me good luck, but others expressed their fears for kids living alone without their parents.

When I told Shelly that this was not my first time being alone with my parents in San Francisco or New York City, he asked if it was fun. I answered by saying that sometimes it was exciting and other times very scary. He laughed and said: “You know, you're lucky; your parents trust you enough to let you do things like this.”

As I finished the rest of my birthday dinner in New York City on my fourteenth birthday, I sat thinking about how life was sometimes funny because it made me feel both scared and excited at the same time. I realized that it was not so bad being an only child after all.

Whenever people ask me what they should do when they have a chance to go alone in their hometowns or travel to other countries, my answer is always: Go for it! It may seem scary at first, but it'll be even more exciting and fun! ​
