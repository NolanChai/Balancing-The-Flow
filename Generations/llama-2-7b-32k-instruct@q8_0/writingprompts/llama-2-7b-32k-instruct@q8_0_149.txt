I turn to see what it was that caused such a response: two large men in dark clothes step in from the doorway. One of them holds a long rifle, which he points at me. He looks into my face, then turns his head and whispers something to the other man. The second man steps forward and takes out a pistol, which he raises to eye level and points at me.

They both begin to take aim at me simultaneously, but I can't help but feel like they're not really looking for a fight. It feels like this is part of their routine, an exercise in violence that doesn't really mean anything. Their eyes meet over the barrels of their weapons and there's something in them that says "we do this because we can".

I say nothing, and my silence seems to further enrage them. They cock their guns and aim again. I feel a surge of anger and adrenaline and suddenly it seems like the whole world is against me. The first man leans forward and says something that sounds like "do you have anything you want to say?"

I don't respond, but my eyes widen in surprise as he pulls back his rifle and fires a shot into the air. The echo of gunfire bounces off the walls and ceiling. The second man lowers his pistol and nods at me before raising it again and aiming straight ahead.

I feel like I'm trapped in some kind of nightmare, but I know that this is no dream. This is reality. My heart races as I realize what's about to happen. The first man points his gun at my chest and pulls the trigger.

There's a loud bang and my whole body jolts forward. A wave of pain rushes through me, but it doesn't last long before everything goes dark. My mind reels as I try to process what just happened. Was that... was that a real gunshot? Did they just...

My breathing becomes shallow and rapid, and my heart races in my chest. I feel dizzy and disoriented, but I can't move. My vision starts to tunnel and I feel like I'm going to pass out at any moment. The last thing I see before everything goes black is the barrel of a gun pointed straight at me.

As I lie there on the ground, my mind races with questions and doubts. Was this really happening? Did they just shoot me for no reason? Why didn't I do anything to stop it? My body starts to shake and tremble as adrenaline courses through my veins. The silence in the room is deafening as I wait for something to happen.

I slowly begin to realize that this is a dream, but I can't bring myself to believe it. This feels too real, too visceral, to be just a dream. My heart pounds in my chest and my breathing becomes shallow as I try to process what has just happened. The image of the gun pointed at me still burns bright in my mind's eye, and I can't shake the feeling that it might come true again any moment now.

I slowly open my eyes and take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. My chest feels tight and painful as adrenaline courses through my veins. I try to process what has just happened, but my mind is still too foggy with confusion and shock.

Slowly but surely, the dream starts to fade away, leaving me with a mixture of emotions. Anger at being shot in my own home, fear for what might come next, and sadness that this was all nothing more than a dream. As I lie there on the ground, I wonder if it's possible to truly know something before it happens.

The door opens and light spills into the room. A figure stands silhouetted in the doorway, holding a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other. "Are you okay?" they ask, their voice echoing off the walls of the small room. I try to nod, but my head feels too heavy to lift. The figure comes over and kneels beside me.

"Can you hear me?" they ask, placing their hand gently on my shoulder. I force myself to nod again, trying to keep my eyes open. "You're safe now," the voice says. "We just need to wait for someone to come help us." My mind races as I try to process what's happening. Is this real?

The figure stands and walks over to the door, where they turn on a flashlight and shine it around the room. The light reveals two men standing in the corner, their hands raised above their heads. "You okay?" one of them asks, his voice dripping with fear. I can't help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction as I look at these men who just moments ago were pointing guns at me.

The figure nods and gestures for them to follow him out of the room. As they leave, I try to process what has happened. Were those really men trying to break into my home? Did they actually shoot me? Was this a dream or reality? My mind races with questions as I try to make sense of everything that's just happened.

As the three figures walk down the hallway, I hear them talking in hushed tones about what to do next. The door opens and light spills into the room.
