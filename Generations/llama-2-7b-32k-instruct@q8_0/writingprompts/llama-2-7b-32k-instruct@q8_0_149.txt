I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling dizzy and experiencing headaches while using a VR headset. It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of cybersickness or motion sickness, which can occur when your body receives conflicting signals from the vestibular system and visual systems during movement.

There are several things you can try to help alleviate these symptoms:

1. Adjusting the fit of the VR headset: Make sure that the headset is properly fitting on your head and that there are no gaps or spaces between your skin and the headset. You can also try adjusting the straps to ensure a snug fit.
2. Using a different VR headset: If you're experiencing these symptoms with one headset, you may want to try using a different one to see if it makes a difference. Some people find that certain models or brands of headsets are more comfortable and less prone to causing cybersickness than others.
3. Reducing the sensitivity: If the headset is tracking your movements too precisely, you may want to try reducing the sensitivity settings so that it doesn't pick up every little movement you make. This can help reduce the amount of visual stimulation and potentially alleviate some of the symptoms.
4. Taking breaks: It's important to take breaks while using VR, especially if you're experiencing these symptoms. Give your body a chance to recover and rest for a few minutes before continuing.
5. Drinking plenty of water: Dehydration can exacerbate cybersickness, so make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day and while using VR.
6. Using a fan or air conditioner: If you're experiencing these symptoms in a hot and stuffy environment, try using a fan or air conditioner to help cool your body and reduce discomfort.
7. Consider seeing a doctor: If your symptoms persist or worsen, it may be worth consulting with a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the issue. They may also have suggestions for managing cybersickness more effectively.

It's important to note that everyone is different and some people may be more prone to experiencing cybersickness than others. If you find that these symptoms are significantly impacting your ability to enjoy VR or other activities, it may be worth exploring alternative solutions such as using a controller instead of moving the headset, or taking breaks to rest and rehydrate in between sessions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
