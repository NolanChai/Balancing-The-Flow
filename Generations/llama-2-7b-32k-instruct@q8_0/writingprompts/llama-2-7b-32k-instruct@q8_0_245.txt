10/95, Hate's Theme 
A: It has been a long time since we first met.  
B: Hm? Oh, yeah. You were the one that made me realize I had feelings for you.   
A: Yeah, well...I wasn't thinking straight back then. You know, when we were kids. And I was totally obsessed with you!   
B: Well, yeah. But it's not like I didn't feel the same way about you too! Remember how we used to hang out at each other's houses and play video games? That was fun, right? 
A: Oh man, that brings back so many memories...    
B: So, what happened? Why are things different now?   
A: Well, I don't know. Maybe we just grew up and got more serious about life.  
B: Yeah, but you still have feelings for me, right?   
A: ...Yeah, of course I do! But, I mean...I'm not sure what that means anymore. I guess I'm just trying to figure out what I want out of life these days. And you know, I've met so many people since then. It's like we're strangers now.   
B: No way! We'll never be strangers. You're my best friend, remember?  
A: Yeah...I guess. But it feels different now. Like we have nothing in common anymore. And I don't even know where to start with all this. Do you get what I mean?   
B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I do. But hey, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we can use our differences to help us grow as individuals and become better friends in the process.  
A: Yeah...maybe. I don't know. All I know is that it's been hard for me lately. And you have no idea how much I miss hanging out with my best friend from childhood.   
B: I do, trust me. But hey, let's try to keep an open mind here and see where this goes, okay? We're both adults now, after all. 
A: ...Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks for being there for me, man.   
B: No problem, buddy. You know I've got your back. So...what do you say we grab some coffee or something? It's been way too long since we hung out. 
A: Sounds good to me! Let's make it happen, my friend!  
B: Awesome! I can't wait. I'll text you when I get back from the airport and we can grab a bite or something.  
A: Cool, see you soon!
