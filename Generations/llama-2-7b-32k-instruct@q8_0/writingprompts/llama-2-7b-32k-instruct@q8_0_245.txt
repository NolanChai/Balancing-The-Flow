ute little girl who plays her violin beautifully? And on top of that she's my best friend and we've known each other our whole lives...I can't stand it. You think I don't know you're doing this just so everyone will ask you questions about your lessons and you get attention. It makes me sick to see you smiling like a fool while you play the violin for others, when all of them are thinking that you're some sort of freak who's obsessed with her instrument. I hate it more than anything else in life. 
 
 And now that your mother decided that you should give up piano to focus on violin, oh my god, how am I going to stand it? You think playing the violin is so much better and more fun than playing the piano. Well let me tell you something: I have been playing piano for twelve years already. And I'm a lot better at it than you will ever be. Do you know why? Because unlike you, who spends her days listening to music that has nothing to do with her lessons and dreaming about the day when she will play in concert halls of some big city, my life revolves around piano. I practice every single day for hours on end. Sometimes for ten or twelve hours a day. And you? You're too busy thinking that your teacher is the cutest man in the world and listening to his lectures about music while you write down all his notes like they are some sort of precious secrets that he reveals only to you. And then, when we have lessons together, which I know you hate just as much as I do, your mind is miles away thinking about something else...like how good looking the piano technician in the store where you buy sheet music is...or if you'll ever get a chance to meet him again so that you can continue flirting with him. 
 
 You are such a hypocrite! You think people will treat you like a little adult and that they'll take your opinions seriously just because you play the violin at the age of eleven. Well let me tell you something, everyone treats children like fragile porcelain dolls who need to be taken care of and protected from life's troubles. But I'm not one of those "little adult" type people that everybody thinks they can fool so easily. 
 
 You think that just because you play the violin, everyone will stop thinking that I am better at playing the piano than you are? You think it would be fair if you become famous for being good at one instrument and I become famous for being good at two of them? You have to dream about something realistic. For example: you can become a professional chess player or an opera singer, but not both. 
 
 And what if my dream is to play both piano and violin professionally? Well...then it's time to choose between your stupid little instruments anyway! You can keep playing the violin and I will practice the piano every single day of my life. But you'll be playing in concerts with people who have much less experience than me, because they never bothered to play anything else. They don't even know what a chord is and yet here they are, making millions of dollars while real musicians like me struggle through life with no fame or fortune whatsoever. You won't be the only kid playing the violin in concert halls. There will always be at least one more little girl out there who has been practicing every day for ten years and is way better than you, just waiting for her turn to play...just wait until she comes along! 
 
 Oh no...wait a minute...don't tell me what to do! I'm not like any other violin player. I am the greatest little musician in the world, and when everyone hears my first concert they will forget all about you! They will see that it is possible for one person to play two instruments at a professional level and...and they'll give me millions of dollars, too! Just like some famous violinist who started playing when she was six and now plays in Carnegie Hall every night. She will become my mentor and I'll ask her how it is possible for someone to play the violin so well at such a young age. And I'll show her my collection of sheet music...and maybe we'll even start dating! 
 
 But you...you are just some little girl who's playing an instrument that no one really knows how to play properly, especially not at your age. Soon enough they will forget about you and everything you have achieved and remember me instead. And I'll be the one with millions of dollars in my bank account and the record contracts and...you'll still be a nobody who can't even play piano worth crap! 
 
 Oh no, wait...what if everyone starts thinking that violinists are better than pianists? Then they will stop giving me concerts and they will forget about me completely. What should I do then?! They won't give me any money anymore because they'll think my music is outdated and boring, while yours will be the latest trend in music... 
 
 Oh no, wait a minute...I have it!...I'll tell them that you play piano as well. And maybe I'll even let everyone know that you can't really play the violin worth crap anyway! I'll make sure to keep practicing every single day and show up at your concerts in front of a big audience dressed just like you with my violin case, wearing a little black dress and holding two sheet music books. And then, as soon as you start playing the violin everyone will turn around and see me standing there with my hands on my hips. I'll put on that "don't-even-think-about-coming-near-me" face. And then when you come out to play piano I'll make sure they know that your technique is worse than mine, even though the public will think that they can't possibly tell which one of us is better because you play violin and I play piano! 
 
 And when people ask me if I like your music and if it's any good...I'll say something like: "Oh yeah, she has a lot to learn. She might as well just give up now!" And they will think that I am so much better than you because I play two instruments! They won't even suspect for one minute that I am actually jealous of the fact that you can play both and I don't have a chance to show people what I can do...I'll make sure to tell everyone about how you only practice your violin once a week. 
 
 And then, just as they are going to forget all about me and move on to the next big thing in music...I'll come back with a surprise concert of my own! Everyone will think I'm nuts since no one has heard anything from me for so long, but they'll be so excited that I still have what it takes. They won't even care if they get the same boring music as always--they'll come just to see what I can play! And then when my name comes up on the screen with a picture of me playing piano and violin, everyone will go absolutely nuts. And after that they will never forget about me again! 
 
 So you see? It's not as simple as it may seem at first glance. There are a lot more things to worry about than just practicing your instruments every single day of your life. I mean, who wants to be famous for playing the same instrument that everyone else is good at? Not me! That would make me a nobody and not worth mentioning...I want people to remember my name forever in history books as "The Greatest Musician in the World" with two instruments under her belt. 
 
 Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing: what about my parents? What do they think of all this? They're just sitting there watching me and you, playing our instruments like it's a game...like we're still in kindergarten or something. You know what their problem is? They never put any pressure on us to practice because they don't even really care if we become professional musicians! They know that no matter what we do in life, they will always love and support us just the same. And I think that's the biggest mistake of our parents: not forcing us to work harder at something. Just letting us do whatever we want...not realizing how much we depend on them for everything. 
 
 Oh no...wait a minute! If they knew what was going on right now, my life would be even more miserable than it already is! You can't expect me to live next to you while I have to listen to the sound of your violin every single day. They might take away my piano and make me start playing the violin full time like you! Oh god...please, don't tell them about this letter! 
 
 Wait a minute...do they even know that you play the violin? I doubt it, but just in case let's not say anything to them. That way if we ever need to get out of an embarrassing situation all we have to do is say that we haven't seen each other in months because we're busy with our piano and violin lessons! They won't even ask any
