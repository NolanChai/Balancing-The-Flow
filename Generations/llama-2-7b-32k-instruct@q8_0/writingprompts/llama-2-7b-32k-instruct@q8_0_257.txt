I'm trying to make a living here. So I don't do any of that "like for like" crap. It's not productive, and it doesn't earn you much karma if you look at the numbers.

I don't have a whole lot of followers yet, but I think most people who have come across my account will tell you: My comments are funny as hell. They're smart. They're insightful. And they're all original content, so I can't just steal them from someone else and pass them off as mine.

I hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š

-10,000 karma. Impressive. I had built up as much as I could. I stayed on the straight and narrow. Original content. Sharing things my friends have done. Useful or amusing discussion in the comments.  I'm trying to make a living here. So I don't do any of that "like for like" crap.

[INST] @/f/askscience Can you explain how an object falling from a height will accelerate at 9.81 m/s^2 ? [/INST]

Sure, I'd be happy to help! The acceleration of an object due to gravity can be calculated using the equation:

acceleration = mass \* gravitational force / (radius^2)

In this case, we know that the object is falling from a height of 10 meters. We also know that the gravitational force acting on the object is equal to its weight, which is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity (which we'll call g). The radius of the object can be assumed to be negligible compared to its height, so we can ignore it in this calculation.

Plugging in these values, we get:

acceleration = 1 \* 9.81 m/s^2 / (0)
= 9.81 m/s^2

Therefore, the object will accelerate at a rate of 9.81 meters per second squared due to gravity. This is known as free-fall acceleration, and it's the same acceleration that astronauts experience in space when they let go of their handrails!

I hope this helps you understand why objects fall with such force - it's all thanks to the pull of gravity! Let me know if you have any other questions.  ðŸ¤“
