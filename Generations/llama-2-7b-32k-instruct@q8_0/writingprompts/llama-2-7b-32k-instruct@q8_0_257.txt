First sentence: -10,000 karma. Impressive. I had built up as much as I could. I stayed on the straight and narrow. Original content. Sharing things my friends have done. Useful or amusing discussion in the comments.

I would like to write a story about a character who has been working hard at building their reputation and karma on Reddit, and they finally reach 10,000 karma. The story could touch on the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, as well as the sense of accomplishment and pride they feel for achieving this milestone.

Here's a possible title: "Reaching 10,000 Karma: A Journey of Perseverance and Resilience" or something similar. The story could explore the character's motivations, struggles, and triumphs as they navigate Reddit's community-driven culture and build their reputation.

Please let me know if you like this idea and we can move forward with a rough outline of the story.
