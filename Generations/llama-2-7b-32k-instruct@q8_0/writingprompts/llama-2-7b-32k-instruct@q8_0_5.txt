It started off normal, for every 10 births there was 10 deaths, it was life. It was normal. 
 
However, a fifteen year old girl is born on this planet. A few weeks after she's born, the government of this planet takes her and puts her in a laboratory where they experiment on her for years. They don't give her any kind of painkillers or anything. Finally, at age 16, she gives birth to triplets, but all three babies die before they can be born. A few days later, the government comes into the lab and kills the girl, and then buries the fetuses in the backyard of a nearby house. 
The end.
