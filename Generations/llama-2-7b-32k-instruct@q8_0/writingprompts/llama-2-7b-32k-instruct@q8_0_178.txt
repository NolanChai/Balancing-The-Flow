1 / 1I have the feeling that I've been here before, on this exact spot, in this exact place and time, but I know for sure that it's déjà vu at best. Do n't get me wrong, I know I've been in similar situations, but not exactly like this one. It feels almost as if time is looping around again, and we're all reliving the same moments over and over again. What could be causing this?
