The city of Eros was in the final stages of preparation for lift off. The buildings and structures that had once housed the old civilizations were now covered with a reflective metal skin, allowing the sunlight to be captured during the day and radiate heat away at night. The domes were still there, but they served as greenhouses where food was grown in pods. 

The streets were empty except for the occasional hovercar or walker, and a handful of pedestrians who all walked with purpose. The people looked different too; their skin tones had changed from the more earthly shades of brown to blue, green, purple and yellow. Their features had become sleeker, almost cartoonish in nature. 

But what struck me most about this city was its size. Eros was massive - a giant sphere with buildings that stretched upwards like tree branches. It seemed to go on forever, and yet there were no visible windows or openings for access. How did the inhabitants of such a place survive? 

I'd been given permission to visit Space Center Eros by my supervisor at the time, Dr. Jonas Finkley. He was in charge of overseeing the construction and maintenance of spacecraft that would travel between planets. I had always wanted to see this place, but it wasn't until a few months ago that he finally granted me permission to visit. 

As we approached Eros, I could hear the hum of activity from within. The city was alive with a bustle of activity as technicians and engineers went about their work. It was almost like listening to the heartbeat of a giant beast, pumping life into its veins. 

As we landed in one of the many landing pods that dotted the surface of Eros, I couldn't help but feel awestruck by what lay before me. The city was unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was a truly remarkable sight to behold. 

Overall, my visit to Space Center Eros was an unforgettable experience. It was a glimpse into the future of human civilization and a reminder of the wonders that await us in space. The possibilities for discovery are endless, and I can't wait to see what else we will uncover in the years to come.
