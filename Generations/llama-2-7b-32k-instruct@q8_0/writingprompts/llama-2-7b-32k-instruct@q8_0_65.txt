I don't know who you are, but I am a big fan of trash talking and I would be happy to have a conversation with you about your favorite subject. 

What do you mean by that? Trash talking? Is it something you like doing or something you dislike? 

Well, I've never been a big fan of trash talking, but I can tell you that it can be pretty funny sometimes. Especially when people are trying to one up each other. Like, have you ever seen the movie There's Something About Mary? It's got some great trash talking in it. 

I don't think so. Have you heard of that guy who was always trash talking his friends and family? Yeah, I don't like him either. But you know what? I think we can all agree that he had a pretty good point about one thing: sometimes the best way to get under someone's skin is by using some really good insults. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking his friend for being overweight and unathletic? I don't know what his problem was, but I think he needed a little help with his self-esteem or something. 

I agree. There is nothing like a good insult to make someone feel small and powerless. It can be pretty funny at times too, especially when it's used by someone who isn't really trying to hurt anyone. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking his girlfriend for being overly materialistic? I don't know what her problem was either, but I think she needed a little help with her priorities or something. 

Yes! That is exactly what I meant. It can be pretty funny when it's used by someone who isn't trying to hurt anyone and when the insults are directed at people who deserve them. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking his boss for being a total jerk? I don't know what his problem was either, but I think he needed a little help with his attitude or something. 

I agree again! And that is why I think we should all be able to use trash talking as a way to express our feelings and opinions. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking the president for being a liar and a crook? I don't know what his problem was either, but I think he needed a little help with his moral compass or something. 

I agree again! And that is why I am here to defend the right of all people to use trash talking as a way to express their feelings and opinions. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking his mother for being overprotective? I don't know what her problem was either, but I think she needed a little help with her parenting skills or something. 

I agree again! And that is why I am here to defend the right of all people to use trash talking as a way to express their feelings and opinions. Like, have you ever heard of this guy who went around trash talking his friend for being a big loser? I don't know what his problem was either, but I think he needed a little help with his self-esteem or something.
