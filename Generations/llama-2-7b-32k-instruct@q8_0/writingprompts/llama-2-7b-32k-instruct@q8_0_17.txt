1 / 1Alice opened her eyes and sat upright in bed. Her hands reached down for her robe on the floor. She fumbled with the button at the front of it, struggling against her grogginess. She yanked her arms through the sleeves before stumbling out of the room.
Alice followed the sound of voices to the kitchen, where her mother and father were already seated at the table. They both looked up as she entered, their faces expectant. Alice felt a sudden wave of embarrassment wash over her. She had fallen asleep in her nightgown, with tangled hair and unmade bed.
Her parents' eyes remained on her, waiting for some sort of explanation. Alice couldn't think of any. "I-I guess I just overslept," she stammered. "I didn't hear my alarm clock go off." Her words felt hollow to her own ears, and she knew they would be equally as useless to her parents.
Her father sighed and got up from the table, pouring himself a cup of coffee before returning to his seat. Alice watched him, feeling his eyes boring into her as he did so. She could feel the weight of their disappointment in her shoulders. Her mother remained quiet throughout the exchange.
Alice sat down at the table, watching her father sip his coffee and look out the window. The sun was barely peeking over the horizon, painting the sky orange and pink. Alice wondered what he was thinking about as she looked around the room, taking in all its familiar surroundings. Her parents' kitchen had always been a comfort to her - warm and inviting, with the smell of freshly baked bread wafting through the air.
As she watched him, something occurred to Alice. Her father was getting older, she realized. The wrinkles on his face were becoming more pronounced, and the gray hair at his temples had grown in thick and bushy. She had never noticed these things before, but now that they were pointed out to her, they seemed impossible to ignore.
Alice found herself feeling a sudden rush of emotion. She wanted nothing more than to make him proud, to show him that he didn't need to worry about her anymore. Her resolve to be the best she could be was stronger than ever before, and she knew that from this moment on, she would do everything in her power to ensure his satisfaction.
Alice finished her breakfast quickly, eager to get out of the house as soon as possible. She excused herself and headed for her room to grab a bagel. As she walked through the doorway, Alice's eye fell upon her reflection in the mirror. She looked back at herself with new eyes, seeing not just her physical self but also her potential and her promise.
Alice knew that from this moment on, she would dedicate herself to achieving her fullest potential - for herself and for her parents. Her father's expectations of her would be her own as well, and she knew that with hard work and dedication, anything was possible. She had learned that lesson the night before, after all, when she finally managed to get out of bed at a time that wouldn't make her parents worry about her.
With that realization came a sudden sense of purpose, and Alice felt herself ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead. She knew that with hard work and dedication, she could accomplish anything - and more importantly, she could make her father proud. With a renewed sense of determination in her heart, Alice left the house and set out to make her dreams a reality.
