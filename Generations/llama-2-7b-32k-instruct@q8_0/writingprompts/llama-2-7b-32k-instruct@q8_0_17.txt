istfully out of reach from my bed's edge, and I remembered that these days were almost gone. In only two months, I would have graduated high school, and then where was I going to be? It'd been a good year: I had all the friends I ever needed, I got great grades, I never lacked for money or for food, I even managed to find a boyfriend that wouldn't strangle me in my sleep. But soon it would just be me and whatever dingy, cramped little apartment my parents could afford me if they were feeling nice. And then what? How long before I was stuck there forever, my life reduced to the same boring cycle of days and weeks and months? My room was too small to contain my worries. The rest of this house was built for grown ups. Why couldn't I stay here a little longer?

I pulled myself out of bed, pulling on my clothes mechanically like a sleepwalker. Downstairs in the kitchen, I found my mother sitting at the table with her coffee and newspaper. She smiled up at me, her face wrinkling into happy folds. Her smile was a familiar one; I'd seen it every morning for fifteen years, and each time had been a little jolt of happiness to me. I sat down across from her and she patted my hand with hers.

''How you doing today, sweetie?'' she asked. My mom's face was always full of lines; in the morning it seemed like those lines were cracking, that the weight of years had finally caught up to her. She looked frail but cheerful. I smiled back at her and felt a surge of love for this woman who raised me all by herself from such early age.

''Good mom!'' I replied.

'I'm so glad you like the new job,' she said, 'It's been hard finding one that suits you since your sister finished college.'

My younger sister had graduated just before Christmas, and her acceptance to medical school made me even more anxious about my own life post-high school. What was I going to do? There were no jobs for people who couldn't drive! How would I get a job? How could I earn enough money to live on?

'I don't know, mom,' I replied, my stomach twisting with nerves at the prospect of facing this all alone. 'Maybe I'll just...go back to school.'

My mother chuckled and shook her head at me, then waved away my fears with a gentle hand. She patted the newspaper in front of her, scanning it for something. A commercial caught her eye and she pointed at it.

''Did you see this ad? There's a new store opening up that they say is going to be hiring teenagers! And I hear their pay is good!' she said excitedly. She pulled the paper closer, then pointed again with a nod. 'It says here that there's a job fair for them in two weeks. You should go check it out.'

My mother had always known how to make me feel better even when I was feeling lost and frightened. She was full of wisdom and calm and love--and she had always been so kind, no matter what my childhood looked like. Sometimes I wondered if I'd be okay as an adult; would I ever have that same kind of compassion for other people?

''Okay mom,' I said, feeling a little better just from having her arms around me again. Her warmth was always so comforting to me. 'I guess I should check it out.'

We finished our breakfasts and then my mother stood up to leave for work. She leaned over the table to give me one last kiss before she went, and then left the room. It was just me again, staring at that newspaper spread across the table. I picked it up in front of me and looked at the ad, feeling a little better already. Maybe this would be my chance!

'I wonder if they'll let me work nights too,' I thought to myself. 'That way I could still see my boyfriend!' My boyfriend had gone away to college two years before, but we saw each other every weekend and sometimes even on the weeknights when he wasn't busy with his own studies. It would be hard for him to come visit me if I was working all day!

I took a deep breath, feeling my anxieties returning at the prospect of leaving home soon. I knew there were no more delays in my life anymore: I had to figure things out now or else I'd be stuck here forever. Soon it would just be me and this house, full of memories that didn't matter anymore because they were so far away from where I was going.

'I have to find something,' I told myself. 'I have to!'

The following day, I headed down to the job fair at the mall where they were hiring teenagers. It was busy, but not overwhelmingly so--people trickled in steadily as if they were all waiting for something to happen. The store's booth stood out: it was bright blue and covered with little yellow smiley faces that danced across the front. A man sat behind a table, his smile as fake as the rest of the decorations. I walked up to him and introduced myself--I was Emily.

''Hi there! Have you brought your resume?'' he asked cheerfully, pushing some papers in front of me with his hand. His name tag said 'Jared' and he had a big gold chain around his neck that clinked against the table. I shook my head; I hadn't brought one because I didn't have one.

''Well, don't worry about it! We can always help you make one on the spot,' Jared said with a little smirk, 'Why don't we start with some basic information? Name, age, interests, that sort of thing.' He pulled out a clipboard and pen from a drawer beneath his table. I hesitated for a moment, wondering what to tell him--after all, this was my first job interview ever! But he was so friendly that I couldn't help but feel at ease.

''24,' I said, giving the man some basic information. He wrote it down in a little book and smiled at me with his perfect teeth. His smile seemed forced and fake to me; it didn't seem like Jared really meant what he was saying.

'Okay! Great!' he said cheerfully. 'What experience do you have so far?'

''None, I guess,' I replied, feeling a little awkward. I hadn't expected this question.

'Never worked before? Well, that's not ideal,' Jared said with a sigh, looking disappointed in me. He looked through his papers for a moment, then looked up at me again and smiled again. 'Well...I guess we can still find something that fits your skills.'

He asked me what I was interested in doing; I told him honestly--'whatever you think is best.'

Jared looked down at the table and wrote for a moment, then looked back up with an expression of surprise. 'You've never had a job before?! That's...amazing,' he said, looking genuinely impressed. I couldn't help but feel embarrassed; I felt like everyone was staring at me and judging me for not having my own money.

''Well we can definitely make you earn it then!' Jared said with a grin, 'What do you say...can you start tomorrow?'

I blinked in surprise--it sounded too good to be true! But I couldn't really argue with the man and not take advantage of this opportunity. 'Yeah, sure!' I smiled back at him. He handed me a pen, then a piece of paper that said my name on it and had my start date circled in big, bright red letters.

''Great! We'll see you tomorrow,' he said with a wide smile. 'Oh, and make sure to wear something blue!'

I walked away from the table feeling like I was floating; I had just gotten my first job ever, and it seemed to come so easily! I could hardly believe what I'd done--applied for a job, gotten an interview, and now...I had a job? It felt like magic.

As I walked away from the table, I saw other people leaving as well; they looked disappointed with their employment options or perhaps even angry at the whole process altogether. Maybe that was just how the world worked--people were lucky if they got to feel this good about a job. Maybe my life would be like this forever: nothing bad ever happened and every opportunity came easily to me!

But as I walked out of the mall, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something wrong with all this. This was too easy; it didn't seem real. Maybe my luck would run out eventually...
