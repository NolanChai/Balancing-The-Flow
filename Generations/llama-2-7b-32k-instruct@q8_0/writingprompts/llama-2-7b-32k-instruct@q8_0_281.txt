o...hey, look. Hey guys. 
 
 He didn't know about the procedure, but when we told him what happened, he was like 'Oh my God,' and I don't think that it was hard on him because I think he understood why we did it. And I guess even now...I mean, maybe if you were six, you couldn't really understand but...yeah, I do think you could have figured out what happened to us. 
 
 **Rachel** 
 
 Hey. 
 
 I don't know why they didn't tell us until we were in our twenties. They had the paperwork to change it when...what? We were still little kids. It was weird, because there were a lot of people who did not have any idea what was going on with us and they would be like 'Why are you so different from other people? Why don't you have parents? Are your parents dead?' And we had no way of explaining it to them. 
 
 **Rachel** 
 
 They had the paperwork ready for us but I guess...I don't know, something just went wrong, something didn't click and they never did that procedure. But maybe if they did, then we would be totally different people than what we are now, right?

 Well, I don't think so. Because I mean, you know, yeah, obviously there's no way to really...but still, I don't think we would have been any different if they had done the procedure, because that was just not how God made us and that's just the way it is. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah. Hey guys! 
 
 So...so Rachel...what do you say to the fact that I went out with a boy? You know, without telling you first? And he was really nice and we had fun and I didn't even get too grossed out when he tried to kiss me because...he was so sweet and kind of cute. 
 
 **Rachel** 
 
 Oh my God! That is so cool! How did it go? Did you kiss him? Oh my gosh! You did! 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, I mean...I think we're still friends but now there's this sort of thing between us. But yeah. It was fun and he...you know...he just asked me out like it was nothing but to me it was a big deal because...because I haven't really been with anyone before that wasn't my sister. 
 
 **Rachel** 
 
 That is so awesome! Congratulations, Ari. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah. Thanks! 
 
 I know it was a bit of a weird situation but...I don't think it had to be and I hope you don't mind that we just...we kind of went behind your back with this one, okay? But, you know, if we had told you beforehand, you would have just tried to stop me.

 Yeah, hey guys! 
 
 Hey...hey...hey...guess what? It's time for a commercial break!
