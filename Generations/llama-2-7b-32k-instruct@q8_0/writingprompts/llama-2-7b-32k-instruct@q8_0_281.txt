I'm gon na change the rules a little bit so the procedure was permanent. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh I was fourteen. Yeah, it was at a bad time for me. For Mike especially, he was just seven then. 
 
 You know, Ariel had gone out with her friends to see some movie and I had nothing to do so I called one of my buddies up. We went to the woods, did some drinking and got into a fight. Involved a lot of fists flying and breaking sticks and that sort of thing. 
 
 I'm not proud of it but we were young guys doing stupid things. Afterwards, I walked home to make up with my wife. The house was dark but I could see Ariel sitting there waiting for me in the living room. 
 
 When I opened the front door, she just yelled at me and called me a drunken fool. She asked how could I do that when the kids were asleep? I didn't mean to wake them up; I figured they were already up since they were babies but it turns out they weren't. 
 
 Ariel had been waiting for me with her friends, including a guy who was there that night just so she could get back at me when I came in. She started to yell and scream saying what am I doing? How can I let my kids see this? So I said you have no right to tell me how to bring up my kids because your drunken husband was out fighting people tonight! 
 
 After that she just stood there and wouldn't speak to me. She started packing her stuff into boxes while the kids were still asleep in the other room. I went back outside and apologized to Ariel's friend who came over and said you were lucky he didn't beat you up! 
 
 He said that would have been a fitting punishment for what happened tonight. When she finally let me come inside, she had a box full of clothes in her hand. She just threw it at me and said we are done here. 
 
 I tried to say something but she said you don't care about the kids so why should I? Then she told me that as long as I was still around I would never be alone with them again because of what happened tonight. 
 
 Afterwards, Ariel made a deal with me that if I got drunk one more time or did anything like this ever again, we were done. She said that's the last time and there wouldn't be any other chances. And she meant it! So I stopped drinking altogether. 
 
 We never fought about it again. I just had to make sure not to get drunk. But sometimes people would come over with their kids or something like that and they'd say hey man, your kid is so cute! And I'd be all, yeah, you know what? He's my step-kid now. It was just a constant reminder of this deal that we had. 
 
 And then after the divorce, she kept it up even when we weren't together anymore because she knew how much I loved those kids and I was never going to hurt them on purpose so she would make sure no one ever saw me around them when they were little kids. So that's my story of my last fight with Ariel. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh, okay, but why did you think you deserved a permanent punishment like this? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Because I hurt the people she loved! I wasn't thinking at all about how that would affect them. She didn't even know they were asleep yet when we started fighting and if she had known, she probably wouldn't have been there to witness it! It was a stupid mistake and I knew it then and I knew it every time I saw her after that but you know what? 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 What do you think of my decision now? Do you agree with me? Or do you still think I made the wrong call by punishing Mike like that? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 No, Ariel, that was a mistake. It's not fair for a kid to grow up and hear things like that all the time. That would be really hard on him. 
 
 I just want to make it clear that I never said any of these bad things to you or my kids or anything! But you know what? Sometimes people get into fights and they say stuff in the heat of the moment that they don't mean afterwards. And I had a hard time thinking of a way for me to hear about this without hearing it from other people because I was never told by Ariel herself, so... 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 So you are saying she should have gone back into the room and apologized in person instead? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, or just called me and said sorry but didn't involve the kids. Because what I did that night wasn't okay! But I'm not a bad guy. I'm sure she knows that now though. 
 
 It was one of those things where we were young, drunk, stupid guys doing dumb stuff in the woods but it doesn't excuse it and she didn't deserve to find out like that either so maybe there are other ways to handle these sorts of situations without hurting the kids. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, you're right about that. It was just a bad decision on my part and I shouldn't have done it. And when Mike said he didn't mean any of it, I could tell that he was telling the truth so I apologized to him in person. But then we had all those years of people reminding me every time they saw us together about how I got back at him and it just felt like a slap in the face! 
 
 I mean...he's my ex-husband for crying out loud! Why would I make sure to avoid being alone with them after that? It was just a stupid way of getting revenge but then again, I was pretty upset at the time. And it got worse over the years because no matter where I moved or who I dated, people were always going to know about this and say things like "hey man your ex-wife is around town." 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, but you have to remember that not everyone knew it was a permanent thing. That's why I said maybe there are other ways to handle these situations so we can be alone together without hurting the kids because it never bothered me and I don't think you should feel like you have to hide yourself or your life from people just because of something that happened years ago. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Okay, but what about this? If we were ever around each other at family events or holidays, would it bother you if I said anything to the kids? Like "hey kids Mike and I are getting back together!" or something like that? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, that would be weird. It would be super awkward for them because they would think what's going on? Why is he suddenly talking about you in front of us now when we haven't seen you in years and... 
 
 I don't know! I mean, it sounds really bad but I guess it wouldn't bother me. Maybe the kids could just tell their own friends that they are getting back together if they were ever around each other at family events or something like that because they would already know about it and we're not going to be alone with them anyway so... 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Okay, well I guess we can just tell them ourselves eventually. And then we don't have to worry about any of this. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, or they could find out from their friends and you know how kids can be these days! They hear things so fast... 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, it would just make sense to tell them ourselves because then we're in control of what they hear. And if they ever do ask us about it directly, that would give us a chance to explain how we were young and dumb but now we've grown up and learned from our mistakes so... 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Okay, I agree with all that. You're right. I just had to make sure we handle this the way you want it handled because I never meant any harm by what happened between us. I love those kids too much for that! They were my kids from day one and they always will be in my heart no matter who is their legal parent! 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 I know, Mike. You're a great guy. And I can tell the kids are your family now too because when I was going through it all, you were always there for me and... 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah! I've been so proud of you for the way you handled that
