The last scene is an outtake from the show where one of the characters is trying to make a sandwich using only their mouth. They keep getting it wrong, but eventually they manage to get all the ingredients inside and bite into it. The character then starts to choke and cough as they try to swallow the sandwich. They finally give up and say "I can't do this" before flipping off the camera. 

The show ends with a shot of the characters sitting on the couch, looking at each other with sad faces. The last line is "We had a good run."
