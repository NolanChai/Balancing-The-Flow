 through the chamber, followed by a metallic clanking sound as if an iron bar had been dropped into place across the opening of the door from the inside. I heard a deep voice speaking in Spanish, but not my own captor's voice. The speaker was closer to my cell than the outside world, yet he spoke loudly enough that I could hear his words. He shouted at the man on the other side of the door, who shouted back, then both men fell silent and their voices faded away, leaving me alone in the pitch dark with only the sound of water dripping from a pipe above me as my company.

It wasn't until I was able to stand up that I noticed my wrists were bound together again. The bonds had been tied off just far enough apart so that I couldn't rub them against the wall or floor without causing myself pain, but not so much that I couldn't slip out of them if I chose. The chains on my ankles were gone as well, which meant that I could move about freely if need be. The room itself was fairly small, although it had a doorless entryway in the middle of it that led into another, smaller chamber.

I looked at my hands and saw that my skin was red where the metal shackles had rubbed against me, but they were healing well enough and shouldn't leave any permanent damage. I flexed them slowly before putting my weight on them, feeling strength return to my legs as I walked forward in a slow circle around the room. The water drops fell from an open pipe above me with a drip-drip sound, keeping perfect rhythm with my footsteps until they disappeared down the wall behind me.

I knew it was only a matter of time before whoever was on the other side would come to check up on me again. I took some small comfort in this, thinking that at least they weren't going to leave me here to die or suffer for long periods of time. It also meant that my first task should be to figure out what was beyond that thick door and how much danger I was actually in.

After another ten minutes the sound of voices echoed through the chamber once more, though this time they were louder than before as if two men were arguing with each other. I heard the jingling of keys as someone approached my cell and I prepared myself to see who it might be. It wasn't until he came into view that I realized why his voice sounded so familiar, however.

It was him; the same man from the helicopter. The man with the red goatee who had tried to save me. He must have been the one flying us around when they first arrived. In all of my panicked state at that time I'd forgotten about this detail, but now it all made sense. This was why he'd asked if I could see him and he'd seemed so concerned over how rough the guards treated me in the backseat of the car.

I heard his footsteps stop as he came to a halt directly outside my cell door; I listened intently for any signs that he would try to save me again, but nothing came. He spoke with someone out of sight and they continued this way back and forth until the lock on the inside of the door clicked loudly and the man was let in.

"You look well enough," the voice said as the door creaked open. It was him, that same goateed man from before; the pilot. He had a bandage wrapped around his head, but it looked like he'd recovered quickly from what had happened to him earlier. I heard some other voices out of sight and they seemed to be talking about whether or not to kill me with a gunshot through the door. The pilot was trying to persuade them otherwise, which meant that there was still hope for my survival.

I watched as he approached the grate floor where I stood; his eyes remained fixed on mine as if we were having a conversation without words. After a moment's hesitation he pulled out a set of keys and unlocked my cell door, then motioned me to step outside with him. He led me by the arm down a narrow hallway that looked like it had been cut into the side of the mountain. It was dark in here as well but he held out a small light for us both to see by.

I stepped forward tentatively and kept my eyes low, not wanting to draw attention to myself until I knew what this man's intentions were. We continued on down the hallway and after about fifteen minutes it opened up into an area that looked like a garage of some sort. It was much brighter here than before, but still had a dank musty feel to it; there weren't any windows in sight either. I heard a motor start up outside, and then the sound of screeching metal as if someone were backing out of a parking spot.

"Where are we going?" I asked him quietly, afraid that he might be leading me into another trap. He stopped walking for a moment and looked at me before answering my question. "We're leaving," he said with a simple nod.

I could feel my body shake in relief; this was exactly what I'd been hoping to hear. The pilot and I walked out the garage door into what turned out to be a parking lot. There were several cars parked there, but only one that looked like it had just come in recently with fresh scuff marks on its sides. The driver's door opened and a man got out, giving me a short nod before heading off in the direction of the house.

I didn't see any guards or weapons anywhere around us, so I assumed we were safe for the time being. My guardian turned to me once more as if he was about to say something but instead gave a quick nod and got back into the car that waited before closing its door behind him. He started it up and pulled out of the lot right away without saying another word, driving off into the night with what looked like a faint trail of dust trailing behind us.

The first thing I wanted to know was who he was and where he was taking me. Instead of answering me, however, he put his foot down on the gas pedal and we sped away, heading towards an unknown destination. It wasn't until then that I realized how scared I must have looked when I left my cell because he stopped the car a minute later to check if I was okay before driving any further. I nodded at him as best I could in response but said nothing, feeling awkward about whatever his intentions were; after all, this man had just saved me from an unpleasant situation and now it seemed like he wanted me to leave with him.

It wasn't until we had been driving for a few minutes that the pilot finally spoke to me again, asking where I was from originally before asking what my name was. This time I felt more confident about answering both of these questions, so I did just that. As he listened intently his face remained completely unreadable and I could tell nothing from it except for a faint smile spreading across his lips.

"It's nice to have you aboard," he said after hearing my answers. He turned the car down another dirt road, this one barely wide enough to fit two cars traveling in opposite directions if need be; there were no houses or any other signs of civilization at all on either side of us. After about twenty minutes we came to a stop again and this time he looked over at me from the corner of his eye.

"How much do you know?" he asked, sounding as casual as if he were asking what I wanted for lunch. I was taken aback by that question, not expecting it in the least bit and feeling my heart start to beat faster than before; whoever this man was, he knew a lot about me just from looking at me.

"What do you mean?" I asked nervously, trying to buy myself some time while I thought of what he could possibly be talking about. After a moment's hesitation he explained further, saying that they were going to arrive at a checkpoint soon and it would be important for him to have an answer ready for them.

I had no idea how much they knew but my intuition told me not to lie. I thought of my family again and all that they'd been through, and suddenly the pilot's questions became much less important than finding out what was happening outside these mountains. So with that in mind I opened up to him about as much as I could without putting them all in immediate danger; I told him everything from beginning to end, omitting nothing and leaving out no names or details.

When I finished he looked at me for a moment before nodding once more, his eyes seeming to go completely blank as if I'd just recounted every word of the story to someone else entirely; then they began to focus once more on my face as if nothing had happened and he said something that made my blood run cold.

"We're in big trouble," he told me with a shake of his head, looking back out at the road ahead of us. I was too stunned by what he'd said to even try to argue with him; after all, I couldn't say that things weren't as bad as they seemed when it was this man telling me.

"How did you know about that?" I asked him, trying once more to make sense of
