"The Last Leaf" is an essay written by O. Henry first published in the New York Tribune on May 27, 1907. It later appeared in his book The Four Million (1909) under the title "A Tale of Two Cities". The story was inspired by a house with a dying ivy plant, which an elderly woman tenant insisted had to be saved at all costs. O. Henry wrote the short story during one winter in New York City where he spent his later years.

O. Henry's full name is William Sydney Porter. He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on September 11, 1870 to a family that could not afford formal schooling for him or his brother. His parents were not particularly educated either, but his mother did teach him how to read when he was six years old.

Although Porter showed great interest in music and writing at an early age, he never received any formal education after elementary school. He had learned shorthand to write legal documents and worked as a cub reporter for the Greensboro Patriot, but later lost his job due to lack of experience.

In 1896 Porter decided to move to Texas in order to find better employment opportunities. After moving he obtained a position at the weekly Athenaeum and was offered more responsibilities as time went by including reporting. The paper was owned by W.H. Simpson who also published the Commercial Appeal, where Porter worked as editor for three years until 1902 when he moved to New York City to become a columnist for the New York World.

In Texas Porter had married Atholene Venable in August of 1897 and they lived in Austin, Texas during their first two years together before moving to Houston where his work required them to live. Their only daughter, Mary Griggs, was born on July 23, 1900.

Porter began writing short stories in the late 1890's and published many of these stories in magazines. His first collection of short stories was Cabbages and Kings which was published in 1904. The book included his well-known story "The Gift of the Magi" about two lovers who each make sacrifices to provide a gift for one another at Christmas time. Porter's other works include The Trimmed Lamp, Heart of the West and Roads of Destiny.

O. Henry had become quite popular during his lifetime as an author. His stories were widely known and many people read them and enjoyed them. He was also recognized for his short story style that used irony to end a story on a somewhat unexpected note. A lot of critics felt that O. Henry's writings were not great literature, but more popular fiction.

O. Henry received the nickname "O. Henry" due to an editor of a magazine he was writing for in Texas who asked him for his real name so they could have it on file. After telling them his first and middle initials, Porter said that was all the initials he had. The editor thought it must stand for something else like Oscar or Osmond since they liked using those names to identify authors of their magazine's stories. When Porter told them no, they asked him what it stood for anyway? He responded with "Oh, Henry".

In 1909 the United States Postal Service used O. Henry as the model for a stamp series that featured famous writers and literary works on each stamp. The postal service also used his writing style to create the short stories included with the stamps.

During World War I, Porter was suspected of being involved in espionage against France because he had been living there at the time and because of his previous career as a reporter. Although he was never arrested or charged, it made him wary enough to stop writing for several years. In 1918 while Porter was working on a story about the Spanish influenza epidemic in New York City, he became ill with pneumonia and died at age forty. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York

When O. Henry was living in New York he made many friends from various backgrounds who inspired him to write about their lives. His writings were greatly influenced by the people and places around him. One friend in particular, a prostitute, inspired him with her writing. Porter wrote a story called "Germany's Answer" which was based on his experiences in Germany.

In one of O. Henry's stories about prostitution he writes about a woman named Miss Fogarty who is the madame for an entire building full of whores. She takes in all kinds of girls and gives them money to buy food with so they won't starve. One day a little girl comes into Miss Fogarty's office asking if she can stay at her house as well because she has no place else to go. The girl, Jane, is a 16 year old prostitute who gets thrown out of the brothel she was working for after being sick all night. Her pimp took her money from her even though she didn't bring anything in so he threw her out of his house that very day. Miss Fogarty feels sorry for Jane and lets her stay at her place until she finds somewhere else to live. She gives her some food, a clean shirt and sends her on her way with $20 dollars.

The next day the prostitute named Mavity comes in to see Miss Fogarty because she wants to get out of town for a while since she knows they are looking for Jane. She asks if she can go with Jane, but Miss Fogarty doesn't think that is a good idea and tells her not to come back either. Mavity leaves the brothel just as Jane comes in again asking where Mavity went. This time Miss Fogarty tells her to leave forever because no one wants to see her there any longer. She tells Jane she can stay for two days if that is okay with her and if not, she will go to a hospital where they have beds for people like her.

Miss Fogarty goes to the police station later on in order to check if someone had reported Jane missing and if anyone knows what happened to Mavity. They tell her there were no reports of Jane being gone or anyone named Mavity that day. Miss Fogarty then goes back home where she is sitting in her parlor when a young man comes in asking for Jane. She tells him that she kicked both girls out the door and doesn't know what happened to either of them, but says they are not welcome there any longer. The young man then takes money from his pocket and offers Miss Fogarty more than double what he gave her the first time in exchange for Jane back again, but Miss Fogarty refuses

Miss Fogarty gets a letter two days later saying that Mavity was found dead on the sidewalk of an overdose. Afterwards, she never saw either girl again, but hoped they had both made it somewhere else and were doing well for themselves. The story was called "Mammon and the Archer"

One day Miss Fogarty's house is raided by the police who arrest Jane after finding her in one of her rooms working as a prostitute again. She tells Miss Fogarty that she has been sick ever since she got out of the hospital and can barely walk, but she is still doing what she had to do just to survive

Miss Fogarty goes to visit Jane at the police station where she finds her lying in bed with a bandage around her leg. Miss Fogarty tells Jane that if they release her she will let her stay in her house and not ask anything of her, but Jane refuses the offer and gets out of bed saying she can make it. She goes to get dressed when Miss Fogarty sees a man standing at the foot of her bed watching her closely. When Jane looks up to see who he is, Miss Fogarty quickly covers Jane's body with a blanket while trying not to look at him herself

He asks for his money back since she didn't give it to him yet and when Jane comes out from behind the blanket they begin arguing about the amount of money. The police officer takes Jane away telling Miss Fogarty that she will be sent to prison this time

In the story "Germany's Answer" O. Henry uses irony by describing a woman named Mavity as the "madame" for an entire building full of whores and then later finds out that her real name is Jane

O. Henry used irony in another one of his stories to show how little money prostitutes actually make during their time. In a story called "Mammon and the Archer" the young man who wants Jane back offers Miss Fogarty much more than he gave her the first time she stayed there, but she still refuses

He uses irony in another one of his stories by using a young man named Jack who finds out that after spending all this money on the prostitute Jane it doesn't even save her from getting sick again and has to go back to being a prostitute for a living

In another story called "Mammon and the Archer" O. Henry
