ts and a pair of brown boots with frayed laces. The walls were whitewashed plaster covered with colorful stencils and graffiti, spray painted in varying degrees from light grey to dark purples.

The room was filled with the smell of incense, smoke from a lit cigarette and patchouli oil that clung to the air after being rubbed on someone's hand before shaking it. A man sat cross legged against a wall covered in graffiti looking down at a black and white photograph of two men standing near a car in front of the White House.

A girl with long blonde hair sat curled up underneath an afghan, writing on her laptop. She didn't notice the man staring at her until she looked up from the screen to see him watching her intently. The man had short brown hair and a thin mustache over his lip; he wore glasses and was wearing a black t shirt with faded blue jeans that hung low on his hips. He sat back in the corner of the room against the opposite wall, arms crossed over his chest while smoking a cigarette.

"I didn't know you had a place here," she said as she looked around. "Who takes care of it?" The man took out a black leather bound notebook and opened it to a clean sheet of paper. He set down the cigarette in an ashtray, tilted his head up and pulled out a pen before opening a drawer to dig through for one.

"Who do you think? I'm just here," he said with an ironic smile. She took that moment to look at him again. The girl had blue eyes and her hair was braided down the right side of her head and hung in a ponytail on the left. He looked away, his face tense as he flipped through the pages in his notebook.

"You're kind of hard to find," she said, "I've been looking for you since the beginning of summer." He pulled out a bookmark from a nearby library and held it up before putting it back into the notebook.

"You haven't?" he asked, his face serious once again as he looked at her through his glasses. She shook her head. "I thought so," he said softly. She didn't know what that meant; she only knew she wanted to stay where she was for a while longer. He had been sitting there without moving long enough for the light to shift and warm the room, and even with his eyes closed it seemed like they were always open when they looked back up at her.

She didn't want to move either. She loved this place. It smelled like a home that was still growing, still finding itself; it made her feel safe and alive. The way he sat there so quietly watching over her reminded her of the way she watched the stars when they first came out after dark. There were no street lights to block them from view and nothing else to keep her from feeling every tiny flicker as if it were a hand reaching out for hers, pulling her toward home.

She was just sitting there looking at him, trying to find words that would make the moment last, when suddenly she remembered. She had something important to tell him. The girl took out her phone and opened up a text thread, scrolling through all of them until she found the one she wanted.

"Did you know about this?" She showed him the message with an image attached, then looked back at his face again. He looked away from it quickly but nodded before putting down the bookmark once more and closing his notebook. The girl smiled as if she had solved a puzzle, her eyes wide; he could almost hear her gears turning in her head.

"I have to go now," she said, "I'll talk to you later." She set her phone down on the bed and started picking up her backpack, looking at him again before heading toward the door without a word of goodbye. He watched her leave, his face tense until he finally closed his eyes after she was out the door.

When he opened them again the sunlight had shifted and cooled down in the room. His cigarette had burned itself into an ember and his phone started buzzing with messages from strangers asking him if there was a fire downtown. The man looked back at her door, then picked up his pack of cigarettes to see if he still had any left in the packet before looking over at the afghan she had been lying underneath when he walked into the room.

He stood, feeling like he had just gotten out of a dream; his ears were ringing from being woken up suddenly and it took him a moment to realize that there was nothing wrong with the world except for the fact that everything around him seemed so much more alive than when he first opened his eyes. He walked over to where she used to lay, looked down at her bed, then out the window into the street below before closing the shutters and looking back into the room to see what was left of their conversation.

His notebook still open on the table next to him as he sat down again against the wall, he let his eyes shift from side to side for a few seconds as if reading something that was out of view before taking off his glasses and looking straight ahead at the door she used to stand in front of.

His hand gripped around the notebook's spine so tightly that it left indentations on his palm when he opened it, looking through all of its pages as if searching for an answer. He closed the book once more and set it down next to him on the table, then pulled out a pen from behind his ear and began writing again as if nothing had happened; his eyes never left the page in front of him as he wrote slowly with deliberate strokes, not looking up at anything or anyone else.

His face was hard to read, but when he looked up for the first time after she had gone it seemed like he might have been smiling ever so slightly.

This chapter is told from the perspective of an unnamed narrator in the present time who has just received a letter from someone they know as 'the man'. The letter describes an incident that took place between the boy and the girl many years ago during the summer before the author was born. The letter describes her as a girl with long blonde hair, who stayed overnight at his house while he was away. The narrator states that this is the first time they have heard of her existence. They were not aware until recently that 'the man' had known someone other than themselves.

The boy and girl had met through their mutual friend, 'the boy'. It was early summer when she arrived at his doorstep one evening after he got home from work. He had never seen her before, but the two of them were old friends and so it was a given that she would be welcome in his house. She spent the night while he was away with 'the girl', another mutual friend of theirs who had been staying at his house as well.

The boy stayed up late on that first evening talking to her until midnight, when he finally told her goodnight and went to bed. The next morning, she got up early before he did and made herself some coffee in the kitchen while reading a book about a man who had travelled through India. He watched her from his bedroom as she sat there reading intently, her hair tucked behind her ears, sipping the coffee slowly as she absorbed what she was reading.

After finishing her breakfast and the book, she told him she would be leaving early that afternoon to see someone downtown whom she hadn't seen in a while. She had said nothing about where she was going or why; he didn't know anything more about her than his name: 'the girl'. Before she left he gave her a kiss on the cheek and wished her luck before watching her drive away in her car, which he describes as having a broken muffler that made it sound like a motorbike.

Later that evening, when the boy came home from work again, 'the man' was waiting for him. He was standing outside the door to the house and seemed nervous at his presence; the boy asked why he hadn't said anything before coming over. The man told him about what had happened with 'the girl'. She had been in an accident that afternoon on her drive home, the car colliding with another vehicle after its muffler fell off. She was taken to a hospital where she died soon after arriving.

The boy said he was sorry and thanked the man for letting him know what happened; the two of them had never met before but seemed to be close enough that they felt comfortable sharing such a private moment with one another. The boy then asked if there was anything more the man wanted to tell him, which he did not want to share over the phone.

The man had written a letter for 'the girl' on an index card, which the boy found in his pocket as he went through his things after she died. In it, her death was described with no mention of who she was or what she meant to him; the only thing that was mentioned was how beautiful and kind she was. He asked the boy if he would be able to send this letter to her family since he had not known any of them and did not have their contact information.
