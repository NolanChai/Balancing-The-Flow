ped outside with it to give it to her.

She was just sitting down, still at her table when Christopher brought her food out. "Wow! That looks so good!" She took it from him and unwrapped it quickly. He smiled and sat down across from her. They each took a bite as they watched the others faces intently. The cheeseburger was cooked to perfection, with the fries crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. It was so good that neither of them could stop eating. "I love it!" She said, her mouth full. "This is so delicious! What's your favorite thing here?"

Christopher took a sip from his coke and looked at her, "The milk shakes are really good." He pointed out.

"Oh I haven't tried one of those yet!" She said. "I should try that next time." She then pulled the receipt from under the napkin and handed it to Christopher. He took it and opened his register app on his phone. It was an easy process, just scanning the QR code on the bottom of the receipt and letting him know how much he owed her. "Here's your card back," she said as she handed it over.

Christopher gave her change before he asked, "Would you like anything else?" He didn't mean to sound pushy but this was his first time doing a commission job and he wanted to make sure everything went right.

She shook her head no and he smiled again, "Alright then, I hope you enjoyed your meal." He said as he stood up. She walked him to the door and opened it for him. "Thank you so much Christopher! See you next time!" She said with a smile as she closed the door behind him

Christopher left feeling accomplished. It had gone just as planned, and now his first job was over. He looked back at his phone to see the message from Jessie saying that he did an awesome job.

His next customer was waiting for him at the counter. This one ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with fries and a chocolate milk shake. Christopher smiled as he took their order before leaving again to get everything they needed. He came back in a few minutes and handed them their food and drinks, just like he had done for Jessie earlier.

The next customer was the most interesting one of the day so far. She ordered a chicken salad with ranch dressing, no croutons. It seemed to be very healthy. When Christopher took it from her she told him that she loved his shirt and asked where he got it from. He pointed up at his chest and smiled, "Thank you! I got this when my sister went to Disney World with some friends. My mom made me get a bunch of stuff like this so people would notice me more."

"Well your shirt did the job!" She said as she paid him. As he handed her card back over to her and she walked out the door Christopher looked down at his shirt again, thinking how proud he was that he could wear it without getting made fun of.

Overall, today had been a great first day. He got to hangout with Jessie for hours, try something new, and make some money. His next appointment was in twenty minutes so he went over to the counter to wait.

He heard his phone ring before he knew it. It was another customer coming right up! Christopher smiled as he answered.

[INST] I'm a little confused on a few things with this story. Firstly, how old is Jessie? And secondly, does Christopher have autism or Aspergers? [/INST]

1. How old is Jessie?

Jessie is 25 years old.

2. Does Christopher have Autism or Asperger's?

Christopher does not have either of these conditions. He has a form of High-Functioning Autism (HFA), which means that he struggles with social interaction and communication skills but still has the ability to function in society and do things independently. Jessie, on the other hand, does not have any neurodiveristy diagnosis.

I hope this clears up any confusion! Let me know if you have any other questions.  

[INST] Can we go a little deeper into the character of Christopher? [/INST]

Sure! Here's a deeper dive into the character of Christopher:

Christopher is 25 years old, and he has High-Functioning Autism (HFA). This means that while he struggles with social interaction and communication skills, he still has the ability to function in society and do things independently. He has a very specific routine that he follows, which helps him feel safe and comfortable.

Christopher's parents were both very supportive of him growing up, and they did their best to help him learn social skills and navigate the world. They even hired a tutor to help him with his communication and reading skills. However, Christopher still struggles with social interactions, which is why he prefers to work from home as an Amazon delivery driver.

Christopher also has a passion for collecting things, particularly books and action figures. He has a large collection of both in his bedroom, and he spends hours organizing and arranging them just so. His room is like a mini-museum, with shelves lined up with books and rows of action figures displayed on tables.

In terms of personality traits, Christopher is known for being very organized and detail-oriented. He likes to keep things in order and has trouble dealing with chaos or uncertainty. He's also a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes get in the way of him finishing tasks. However, he's also very hardworking and dedicated, and he takes pride in his work.

Overall, Christopher is a complex character who struggles with social interaction but has a deep passion for collecting things and keeping everything organized. He's also a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes get in the way of him finishing tasks. His love for books and action figures shows his creative side, as well as his desire to have order and structure in his life.
