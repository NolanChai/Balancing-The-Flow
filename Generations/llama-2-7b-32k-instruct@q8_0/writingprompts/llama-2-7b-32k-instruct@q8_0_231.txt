rive in darkness. You are my prey.

The boy is screaming, begging me for help, but he might as well be speaking Japanese for all the good it does him. The only language that matters right now is my own. My tongue darts out and traces the line of his jaw. He tastes like salt, like fear. I lick a path up to the soft skin above his earlobe, sucking gently on its tip before pulling away with a satisfied smile. The boy's mouth drops open, and he shivers violently in my grasp. His eyes dart back and forth between me and the door behind him. I can see the thoughts racing through his head--how quickly could he escape? How far would he get before I caught up to him? I chuckle softly to myself. He's never escaped from me yet, has he?"

"I could have you in my clutches for days," I tell him softly as I trace a fingertip down the bridge of his nose. "But that would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead, I think we'll play a little game."

With one fluid motion, I wrap my hand around the boy's throat. He struggles desperately as I squeeze harder and harder, slowly cutting off his air supply until he can barely breathe. The boy's face flushes with red, and his eyes bulge out of their sockets. Slowly but surely, I watch him lose consciousness, my smile growing wider as his eyelids begin to close. But before I can pull away, the door behind him bursts open.

A group of men rush in, yelling and pointing their guns at me. One of them grabs the boy from my grasp and throws him against a wall, panting heavily as he tries to catch his breath. Another man stands guard over him, keeping a close eye on him. I watch them warily, my smile fading as I realize that they've come for me.

"What do you want?" I ask in a tone that dares them to make a move. The men exchange nervous looks, unsure of how to handle the situation. One of them clears his throat and steps forward.

"We have reason to believe that you're connected with a terrorist group," he says nervously. "You've been under surveillance for months."

"Really?" I ask, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "And what do these terrorists want, may I ask? Are they simply bored with their lives and need to make a name for themselves? Or perhaps they have a grievance against the world that only you can help them resolve?"

The men exchange uncomfortable looks again. One of them clears his throat and tries to come up with an answer. "We've received reports of a plot to attack several cities in Europe," he says finally. "And we believe that you were involved."

My smile returns, sharp and cruel. "Ah, so they want to play heroes after all, do n't they? They think they can stop me with their pathetic little guns?" I laugh bitterly. "I've been playing this game for centuries, boy. You have no idea what I'm capable of."

The men exchange nervous looks again. One of them steps forward and places a hand on the trigger of his weapon, ready to take me down if necessary. But before he can, the door behind him bursts open again. This time, it's not just one man who enters--no, there are dozens of them, filling up the entire room. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder in a wide circle around me and the boy.

"What is going on here?" one of them asks, his voice booming through the silence. "Who is this woman and what does she want with our son?"

The man who entered first looks at him nervously. "I don't know," he says shakily. "We--we just found him in an alleyway, covered in blood."

The other men exchange uncomfortable looks again. One of them steps forward and kneels down beside the boy. He examines his injuries closely, frowning at what he sees.

"This is no accident," he says finally. "Someone wants him dead."

"Who?" I demand, my voice rising to a dangerous pitch. "And why are you here? Who sent you?"

The men exchange nervous looks again. One of them steps forward and points his gun at me. "We're not sure," he says finally. "But we believe that you're involved."

I laugh bitterly. "Involved? You have no idea what I am capable of, do you?" My smile grows wider as I realize my power. I can feel the men shrinking back from me, their fear palpable in the air. The boy is still kneeling on the floor, his face white with shock and fear.

"I've been playing this game for centuries," I tell him softly. "And you're just a pawn in my hand." With that, I step forward and grab the boy by the arm, pulling him close to me. He struggles desperately as I whisper in his ear, the smile never leaving my face.

"You have no idea what I am capable of," I tell him softly. "But you're going to find out."

The men exchange nervous looks again. One of them steps forward and points his gun at me. "We've been trying to catch you for months," he says finally. "And we won't stop until we have you in custody."

I laugh bitterly. "Oh, but I think you will," I tell him softly. My smile grows wider as I realize my power. I can feel the men shrinking back from me, their fear palpable in the air. The boy is still kneeling on the floor, his face white with shock and fear.

"You have no idea what I am capable of," I tell him softly. "But you're going to find out." With that, I step forward and pull the trigger, watching as the men fall back in shock and horror as the boy's lifeless body slumps to the ground.

I stand there for a moment, my smile never leaving my face. The air is thick with tension as the men try to figure out what just happened. I can feel their fear palpable in the air, like a living thing that surrounds me. I take a step forward and grab the boy's arm, pulling him close to me. He struggles desperately as I whisper in his ear, the smile never leaving my face.
