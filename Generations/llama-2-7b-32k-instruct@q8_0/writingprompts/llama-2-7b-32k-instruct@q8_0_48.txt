Cassandra and I are about to head out on our long-awaited road trip. We've been planning it for months, and finally the day has come! 

I hop in my car with a smile on my face and begin driving towards Cassandra's house. As I pull up in front of her door, she greets me with a warm hug and a mischievous glint in her eye. 

"All set?" she asks as she gets into the car. 
I grin at her excitement. "Yep, car's all packed sweetheart," I tell her. 

Cassandra's eyes sparkle with delight. "Good, now let's enjoy this honeymoon of ours," she says and kisses me on the lips before we hit the road.
