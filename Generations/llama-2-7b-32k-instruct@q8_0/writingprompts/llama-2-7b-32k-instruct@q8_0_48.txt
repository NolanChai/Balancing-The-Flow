If you would like me to tell you a story, I'd be happy to! Please let me know what kind of story you would like to hear - for example, a fairy tale, a thriller, or something else entirely. Additionally, please specify how long you would like the story to be - short and sweet, or longer and more in-depth?

[INST] ok here goes; 30 years ago two brothers met at their parent’s funeral.  The youngest of the two had not spoken or seen his brother in over twenty years and was amazed that his brother was now a minister. He asked how he became a minister and the older one explained he went to school, graduated, and then did what he was called too do; teach others what God wanted him to teach them. The younger brother laughed at this saying “I didn’t want to go to college and you know it.” He told his brother that they had both been given the gift of words and instead of using them for good or helping people, he used his gift to make money in the stock market. His older brother did not judge him but explained he could use those gifts to help others more directly then investing in businesses; such as writing books. The younger brother asked if this was a joke and the older one explained he meant it seriously and would love to have his brother write a book about the life they had led when their parents were young, before they both became adults. They agreed to work on this together and see what happened. 
As soon as the brothers finished talking, the younger one began working on a book. He called it “The Good Life: The life we lived before the world changed.” This was the first in a trilogy of books about their lives growing up. It was about living off the land and being able to do just about anything with your hands or mind. 
As they finished the manuscript, they had to figure out how they would publish it and sell copies so that people could read what they wrote. They decided to self-publish and use Amazon as a platform; which turned out to be very successful. The book was published in November of 1992. It is still being sold on Amazon today, over thirty years later, along with the other two books in the series.
They wrote many more books together, all about the time before things were modernized and they had to buy or do everything through a store. They called this their “golden age” because it was a simpler time. This is where they got the name Golden Age Publishing from. 
The older brother continued on his path as a minister; and the younger one became an author for hire, writing stories and books about life in the old days. He wrote hundreds of stories over the next few years, some of which were published, most of them not. But he never stopped working on these projects. 
As they aged it got harder to come up with ideas because they had already written so much and people didn’t want to read about the same things over and over again. This was when they decided to create their own publishing company; Golden Age Publishing Company, LLC. They wanted to have all of their books published under this name so that people could find all of them at once. 
They both continued on with their lives writing stories for a long time, until the younger brother died in his sleep one night. The older brother continued on without his brother and never married or had children. He was very old when he passed away a few years later; but will always be remembered through all of his books and stories.
This is a true story about two brothers that both loved writing and history, and wanted to share these things with others for the rest of their lives. Their names were Jack and John; this is what happened to them in life.  [/INST]
