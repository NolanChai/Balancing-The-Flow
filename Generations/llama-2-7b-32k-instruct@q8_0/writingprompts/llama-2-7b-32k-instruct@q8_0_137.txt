Awake (Document[60]):"I've heard stories ." The words slipped out before I could catch myself . Her eyes widened; she looked horrified at what she had just said."

You think I would n't have thought about it? About her?" She was silent for a long moment, then scoffed and threw up a hand in the air to stop me from answering . "I know you have--so does everyone who knows your name . But I'm not like them.""

What do you mean? What's different about me?" "Claire was always supposed to be different; she was always special.""

Claire's eyes were wide with surprise when I looked up and smiled at her . I shook my head, almost laughing a little because she still thought so highly of herself . I could n't blame her--she really did have a lot of potential."

When the nurse came back into the room to check on us, Claire sat upright in bed and smiled up at me . She looked like she wanted to talk about something but was hesitant to bring it up herself ."

What's wrong? Did you dream about us again?" I teased her gently."

Claire nodded slowly; her face began to redden, so I knew this was n't just a nightmare--this was something more like an obsession with the two of us together ."

What did you see?'' She hesitated for only a moment before speaking again; her voice was still quiet but it had a strange tingle to it that sent chills down my spine ."

I could hear our heartbeats--it sounded like we were having sex, even though I knew I was still asleep."

I looked at the door for a moment; I wanted to scream at Claire to stop thinking about this nonsense and just forget about it already."

But she was already so deep into it, the idea of two girls together . It had never occurred to me that maybe it would occur to her . But with what happened between us--maybe it was inevitable that those dreams were going to start."

Claire's eyes looked at me questioningly; I could only shake my head and laugh nervously, hoping she would take pity on me."

I mean, who am I kidding? I dream about us all the time ."

Claire stared at me in silence for a moment before nodding her head slowly--not with understanding but rather acceptance of what I said . She knew that those dreams were probably real and not just some figment of my imagination."

And now, it looks like maybe we're about to find out if they are or n't ." she finished softly before turning back down on the bed again, her eyes looking tired."

I looked at Claire for a moment . I knew that these dreams were probably real and I was terrified of what I might feel when we actually came face to face with it ."

But in that moment--as I lay there listening to Claire's heartbeat in my dream, I could n't help but feel hopeful for the first time."

I looked down at her, watching as she closed her eyes again and let out a deep breath; her eyelids fluttered open just enough to see me still standing over her ."

What do you want to do with our lives?'' I asked softly . My words sounded so foreign, even to my own ears."

Claire's eyes opened up slowly, and when she spoke, it was like an echo from the dream: "Whatever we feel is right.""

I could n't have agreed more."

Awake (Document[60]):"I felt as though I were living in a dream; this was so much better than reality . I sat down on the side of her bed, my knee bumping against hers as we both looked out into the hallway where our parents still stood . Claire and I locked eyes with each other again and smiled."

What are you thinking?'' She whispered in return . "I'm not sure what to think, honestly. This is nuts ." I replied quietly."

Claire looked down at her hands, fidgeting with the straps of her hospital gown; I did the same to mine."

What do you want to do about it?'' She asked again . "About what?" I was confused by the question, but I knew she was n't talking about our parents ."

Claire looked up at me with an expression that could only be described as longing--it scared me a little."

I want to kiss you.'' Claire finished softly before closing her eyes and leaning in . She kissed me lightly on the lips, brushing them against my tongue until I opened my mouth and let her inside."

Claire's hand immediately reached out for mine; she pulled it towards her, lacing our fingers together with a gentle squeeze ."

I want to be with you forever.'' Her voice was barely above a whisper."

Awake (Document[60]):"Claire opened her eyes again; I felt as though we had both been transported back in time to the moment when we first kissed on the swingset . She pulled me closer and I let her, our faces only centimeters away from each other's."

We were here . We could n't run anymore ." Her voice was barely above a whisper; she looked at me intensely before closing her eyes again . When she opened them this time, she did so with purpose--the look on her face changed to one of determination ."

Let's get out of here .'' She said softly, pulling my hand towards the door . I could n't help but smile at her; even though we were trapped in a hospital room and surrounded by our parents, Claire had just told me what I wanted to hear more than anyone ever had."

Let's get out of here right now.''"

Awake (Document[60]):"Claire opened her eyes again; she looked at me with a look that was part serious and part mischief . She smirked before standing up and turning to my bed . "I think we can be more productive than staring out the window." Her voice was low but playful, almost teasing as she said it . I rolled off of the side of Claire's bed and got onto mine; a moment later, Claire had climbed into her own bed and pulled me in with her."

We were still dressed in our hospital gowns, but neither of us seemed to mind . We kissed again--the same way we did the night before, only this time it was more passionate and filled with even more emotion than before."

I had never been happier; Claire could feel me hard against her stomach and she grinned before pushing down on my shorts until I lifted up off of the bed and she slid them down my legs ."

Awake (Document[60]):"Claire climbed out from underneath me, straddling my thigh as I lay flat against my back . She leaned in to kiss me again, her tongue reaching into my mouth when I opened up for her . Her hand reached down towards the waistband of my shorts and she pulled them off--the movement was familiar to us both by now ."

She slid them over the tip of my penis as it stood at attention; Claire's eyes closed in pleasure, letting out a deep moan . I could feel her hot breath on my neck just before she leaned down and took the head into her mouth--she swirled her tongue around the tip for only a moment before releasing me ."

Claire pulled up her hospital gown again to let me see what she was doing, then closed it once more while I lay there in stunned silence . Her hand slipped into my shorts; with practiced ease, Claire began to stroke my penis until it was hard as a rock ."

Awake (Document[60]):"Claire opened her eyes just enough to see me watching her and smiled widely before pulling me up to sit in bed with her."

This is what you want?'' She asked, looking at me intently . I could n't believe how much my hormones were running wild; I was so excited that she was doing this for me ."

Claire nodded slowly and began kissing me again, letting me rub her nipples through the thin fabric of her hospital gown . She pulled back when she noticed I was getting hard and looked down at my shorts, then at me, her lips curling into a mischievous smirk."

It looks like you're ready to go .'' Claire said, grinning before standing up and moving towards the bathroom with her hospital gown in hand."

Awake (Document[60]):"Claire opened her eyes slowly, looking at me as though I had just asked her the most ridiculous question she'd ever heard . I blushed slightly but did n't look away
