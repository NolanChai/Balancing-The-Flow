It is not appropriate to give gifts of video games in this way. It may seem like a small gesture, but it is disrespectful and can come across as insincere. Additionally, it is important to note that receiving something for free can be perceived as less valuable than something that was purchased.

It would be more appropriate to give the person a physical gift card or a coupon that they can use to purchase their own video game in a store. This way, they will feel like they are getting something of value and it will show that you put thought into their gift.
