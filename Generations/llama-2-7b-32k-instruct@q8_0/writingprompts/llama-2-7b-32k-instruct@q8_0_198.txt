It was dark, it was dreary, and I had a few hours to kill before my train left for home. 

I walked through the park looking for something interesting when I saw a group of people with lanterns in the distance. 
As they came closer, I could see that they were carrying pumpkins and walking sticks, and I was struck by the sense that this might be some sort of strange ritual or festival. 
I asked one of them what was going on, and he told me it was a Jack-o'-lantern walk. 
He explained that we would be lighting up pumpkins and walking through the park together, and I was instantly hooked. 

The group began to gather around a large pile of wood in front of us, and one of the participants lit a match and held it up to the first pumpkin. 
As the flames danced across its surface, we all shouted "Boo!" in unison, and the pumpkin exploded into a million pieces. 
The group cheered and applauded as if we had just witnessed a spectacular firework display. 

I was shocked by how much fun I was having. 
I had no idea that lighting up a pumpkin could be so satisfying and thrilling. 
We continued to walk around the park, each of us holding our own pumpkins and lanterns, and we would occasionally stop to shout "Boo!" at each other or light another pumpkin on fire. 
It was a magical night that I will never forget. 

Ever since that night, I have made it a point to attend a Jack-o'-lantern walk every year. 
I love how the simple act of lighting up a pumpkin can bring people together and create a sense of community spirit. 
And who knew that shouting "Boo!" could be so much fun? 
It's become one of my favorite Halloween traditions, and I can't wait to see what next year's walk will bring.
