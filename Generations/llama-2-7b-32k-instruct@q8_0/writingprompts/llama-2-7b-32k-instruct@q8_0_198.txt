amp, and it was wet; the grass was growing long in the fields.  
This is the first time I've actually seen a squirrel at any length in years--it was about thirty feet away, so there wasn't much of one. But I didn't know that for sure yet, since my binoculars are in a box somewhere back in New York.  
We left the dog with my father and went to see the squirrels. They were there, but not very close. 
We then tried our luck at the bird feeder hanging off of my balcony; it's been empty for ages, but we thought we'd give it another shot.  
It wasn't filled yet, but that didn't matter; it was still right there. It was sitting on top of a wire fence about fifteen feet away from me, and it was so pretty! 
Its fur was brownish red, with darker spots all over its body; it had a black face and long tail feathers. It hopped up to the bird feeder, pushed open the plastic door, and sat there for about half an hour looking around at me and the other birds before it flew away. 
Its flight was so graceful, so beautiful--and I'm sure you know where this is going.  
I think I fell in love with that squirrel right then and there.

I'm not sure when it happened. I didn't mean to--I just did it without thinking. But now I feel so different. 
There was a bird at my window this morning; its head was cocked to the side as it looked out of my window and I felt...something.  
I wanted that bird to stay with me forever. I wanted him to live in my house and never leave me. I wanted to make sure he stayed safe from all harm, from any predator. 
It was just a stupid little bird, and it didn't know what had happened--but I did, and it changed something inside of me. It made me different; the way that I looked at the world changed.  
I don't think there are many people who would agree with me about this, but I now feel more connected to birds than I ever have before in my life. 
When I look outside and see them flying or perched on a tree, or hear them chirping--well, it still doesn't compare to what it felt like when that bird was at the window this morning.  
It was the best thing that's happened to me in a long time, if not ever.

I'm home. It feels like I haven't seen my bed in a long time--but then again, I guess that's because I never left it. 
This past week was crazy, but also great. I got to spend a lot of quality time with friends and family, and I even got some work done.  
I visited my parents this weekend, who are now living in Auburn, New York--it's pretty upstate, very country-esque. It was the perfect way for me to spend Thanksgiving break. 
We went shopping on Saturday and spent most of our time at the mall; it felt like we hadn't been there since we were in high school! I picked out a bunch of new clothes and am pretty pleased with my purchases--I hope I can fit into them next semester.  
The only downside to spending Thanksgiving weekend upstate was having to say goodbye to everyone on Sunday morning; the time went by so fast, and now I'm all alone again in New York. 
I've been here for less than an hour, but it already feels like home--my room is how it always has been, my stuff is where it should be, and the kitchen smells like something delicious.

It's almost Christmas. It feels like it should be a happy time; people are supposed to go around feeling all warm and fuzzy inside because of the holiday spirit. But this year, that's not quite how I feel. 
I think part of it is because this semester has just been so stressful and awful that I don't have any energy left for Christmas; it feels like a chore instead of a celebration. Maybe if things had gone differently, or at least more smoothly, I would have felt better about the holidays. 
And maybe it wouldn't matter how hard my semester was because--as always--I'll be spending Christmas with people that mean so much to me.  
But even so, this year doesn't feel right. Maybe next year will be better; maybe this whole college experience will just have been a bad dream and I'll wake up in my childhood bedroom surrounded by all the presents underneath the tree.

I've been home for a week now. I didn't know how much I missed it until I was back; it feels so good to be here and not have to worry about schoolwork or anything else but my own life. 
My first day back, I went grocery shopping with my parents. They were in the car, and I had control of the radio--I put on my old mix CD from high school and felt like it was fifteen years ago again! The cashier at the store even knew me by name after so many visits...it's a small town but it still feels big sometimes. 
We went to see my grandmother and then took a walk around my childhood neighborhood; I had totally forgotten how much fun I used to have playing outside as a kid! It was dark, so there weren't many kids out at the same time, which is probably why I had so much freedom back then. 
The most awesome part of my first week home: seeing my dog again!! She was so happy to see me that she peed all over the floor...and I couldn't have been happier to see her! She runs around like a maniac, just excited to be with me and getting all kinds of belly rubs.  
I also saw some old friends from my high school days; it was great to catch up with them and hear what they've been up to lately. They're all pretty much doing the same stuff I am--hanging out, going to parties, and still having no clue about life! But at least we know each other, so everything feels a little easier than it would if we were strangers.

I woke up this morning and couldn't breathe. My lungs felt heavy; it was like they were filled with concrete. But as soon as I rolled over in bed and looked at my roommate, the feeling lifted a little bit.  
"Hey," she said, "what's wrong?" 
"I don't know...it feels like there's no air in here." 
"Well, that's not true--there totally is air. You just need to go outside and get some fresh air." 
So I did what my roommate told me to do. And guess what? It worked! Once I was out of the house, the feeling went away completely; I could breathe as easily as if I hadn't been stuck indoors all day.  
I know that sounds really stupid, but it's true nonetheless--it's amazing how much better you feel once you actually go outside and experience the world around you!

I just woke up from my nap--it's amazing how much better I feel after a good sleep. It's so much more than just feeling refreshed; it's like all the problems that have been bugging me for hours suddenly go away once I start drifting off to sleep, and when I wake up they aren't as bad anymore
