The girl from the house next door
I know exactly what this means. I can relate to every word of yours and how you feel about it. You see, that's all we could do as a child because there was no one out there to talk to. Now we have this wonderful thing called t...

I hate when people try and tell me how to feel
You know what I did? I stopped thinking in English. I stopped talking in English. Whenever someone comes to me and says "How are you" or any other question, I answer them in my own language which is not the same as English. But of course...

I can't live without you anymore
You know what? You have no clue about love! It's a feeling that makes your life better but it doesn't make it stop. It only makes it change for the good or bad, but it doesn't make it stop! So, before you tell someone to go away and not...

I can’t believe how much I love you
You know what? You're just like an addiction. And I don't mean that in a negative way either. You get into my bloodstream and you won't let me go. The thing is, with every passing second, I feel more and more of a need to be around...

I want you to love me for who I am
You know what? I have been hurt by so many people in life that I can't stand the thought of being hurt again. So, instead of trying to impress someone with all my flaws, I will just live without them and see where it takes me...

I can’t even begin to explain how much I love you
You know what? You are so blinded by your own self importance that you don't even realize how good you have got it. And don't try to tell me that I should be grateful because you know how hard I had to work for this. No, I didn...

I can’t stop thinking about you
You know what? I am so tired of people telling me "you need to live your own life" or "you should just let go". Yeah right! It's not that easy! You have no idea how many sleepless nights I have had because of you. But it's...

I want to tell the world how much I love you
You know what? The worst part about loving someone so deeply, is not having them around anymore. It's like a punch in the stomach every time you think about them. And let me tell you something, it hurts more than anything else ever...

I am in love with your eyes
You know what? You are nothing but trouble and I don't know why I bother. Every time I try to forget you, I end up right back where I started. Why can't we be together? Is it because I am too much of a mess or is...

I want us to live happily ever after
You know what? You have no idea how long I waited for you! I was there when your parents were fighting and when you came in crying, begging me not to tell anyone. I was there when you got your first boyfriend and I was there...

I am ready to take the risk
You know what? I don't need to be perfect. And you know why? Because it doesn't matter if I am not perfect because you love me anyway! You see, in life, we are given the opportunity to make our own mistakes and to learn from th...

I can’t stop thinking about you

I want us to be happy together
You know what? You have no idea how hard it is for me to just sit here and watch as our love slowly fades away. It's like watching the sun set in the horizon and knowing that soon night will fall upon us, casting a dark...

I am so glad you are my girlfriend
