When I was seven or eight years old I had an imaginary friend. His name was Bob and he lived on my dresser drawer with all of my other stuffed animals. My mom would often tell me that this was the sign of a healthy imagination, but she also knew to let it go there. Whenever anyone asked if we had any cousins I always said yes because it was easier than explaining why Bob lived at our house.
