Monday morning, the last day before the weekend. Calliou had a meeting with the ruler of Hell.

Calliou was an angel who was assigned as assistant to the devil. He often came up with ideas that the devil implemented in Hell. One of his latest ideas was called "The Monday Meeting" where all demons and other workers were required to attend. In this meeting, Calliou would provide updates about different things happening in Hell including the weather, sports games, and important meetings held by higher ups such as the ruler of Hell who would be present today. The ruler was a tall figure with horns that seemed to glow red even in the darkest place of Hell. Today Calliou was ready to update him on the weekly shipment which had been delayed for the third time.
