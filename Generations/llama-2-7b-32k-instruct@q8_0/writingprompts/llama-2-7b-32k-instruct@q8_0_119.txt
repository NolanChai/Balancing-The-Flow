Caillou, imp assistant to the ruler of Hell, consulted his clipboard. He hated Monday meetings. "It appears that our weekly shipment has been delayed again," he said deferentially to the woman sitting in front of him.   Caillou took a sip of coffee and made a face. He had already consumed two cups this morning and was still thirsty. The waiter came by with a fresh pot and refilled his cup. Caillou ordered another cup, this time asking for it decaffeinated. As the waiter walked away, he heard some customers at an adjacent table talking about the latest Star Trek movie and he thought of how much he hated the franchise, which he saw as a cash grab by Paramount.   He tried to tune them out and listened instead to two guys discussing their fantasy football drafts and then their upcoming vacations. The first guy planned to take his family to Disney World while the second said that they would be going on a road trip with the family car, which needed some new parts in order for them to get across country, so he'd been doing research online all weekend and found an awesome deal at a local garage. Caillou leaned forward eagerly when he heard this and asked the second guy how much money they were looking to spend on the repairs. He offered to do some research himself and called his brother, who was a mechanic, for a quote over lunch.

Answer the following questions: Who is Caillou? How did he arrive at the restaurant? What does he like doing in his free time?   [/INST]

Caillou is an assistant to the ruler of Hell and is having a meeting at a restaurant, where he orders coffee. He has two cups before hearing about the delay of the weekly shipment. Caillou also hates Star Trek, which is a franchise for Paramount, and overhears some customers talking about it at an adjacent table as he enjoys his decaf coffee. Caillou then asks one of the guys next to him about how much money they are looking to spend on repairs for their car.
