30 seconds later they would call you back to set up an interview. Nowadays you have to apply online and then you wait 10 days for them to respond with a "thank you, we are not interested" email. Sometimes, I even receive emails stating that my resume was forwarded to someone who might be able to hire me. If they don't think that it's worth the effort of interviewing me after looking at my application then why would I even bother applying? The job market is a joke and there are no jobs.

I have applied for more than 100 positions in the last year, with only three interviews as a result. It seems like companies will take ages to respond or not at all to an application submitted through their website. This process can be discouraging if you need to find work fast. I'm starting to think that many of these jobs are just a scam and they never really intended on hiring someone in the first place.

I will never forget when my father was laid off from his job at the plant where he worked for over 20 years back in 2014. He had been working there since he was 18 years old so that's a lot of time and dedication to put into one company. His coworkers were all pretty shocked when they heard the news and I was too because I wasn't expecting him to lose his job. It seemed like such an implausible event, but it actually happened! The plant shut down that December.

I remember my father had a hard time finding work after that. He applied to so many places without any luck for months on end and we were starting to worry about our financial situation since he was the main income earner in the family. I have never felt such despair as when my father got laid off and couldn't find another job. The fact that we might lose all of our stuff or be evicted from our home because of it really terrified me. I can only imagine how hard it must have been on him too, since he was the one who lost his job and had to deal with all of these changes by himself. Luckily for us, things started to look up when my father finally got hired at a new company in October 2015 after applying to numerous other jobs. I'm happy that my dad ended up doing fine but it still upsets me that so many people are out of work and struggling to find employment these days.

I just want people to understand how hard this job market really is for the average person trying to make a living. It seems like some places will never hire anyone if they don't have to in order to meet their production quotas. The sad thing is that these companies often don't even tell you why you aren't getting called back or being offered an interview so it's just a guessing game and the longer you wait, the more discouraged you become about finding work. This economy has really taken a toll on the people who live in it and I'm worried that it won't improve anytime soon.

[INST] What can we do? [/INST]

1. Supporting local businesses is crucial for the economy as well as for personal finances. Instead of buying products from large corporations, try to support your local farmers and artisans who often offer better quality products at reasonable prices. 

2. Reduce wasteful spending by cutting back on unnecessary expenses such as eating out or drinking at bars too frequently, using public transportation instead of taking cabs or ubers when possible, and cooking more meals at home rather than ordering takeout. 
3. Consider alternative forms of investment to build wealth over time. For example, real estate can be a good option for those who have the funds to purchase property or have the means to rent out properties to tenants. 
4. Invest in education and training programs to increase skills that are in demand by employers. This can help you improve your chances of getting hired and earning a higher salary. 
5. Support local and national organizations that are working towards creating jobs and improving economic conditions, such as non-profit organizations or political groups that advocate for policies that support economic growth. 
6. Encourage your friends and family to take steps towards financial security by sharing resources and tips on how they can improve their spending habits or increase their income. 
7. Be aware of scams that prey on those looking for work, such as bogus job listings or companies that promise to help you find a job but charge a large fee upfront without delivering any results. 
8. Use social media and other online platforms to connect with others who are looking for jobs and share resources or information about job openings in your area. 
9. Consider starting your own business or freelancing as an alternative to traditional employment. Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer can help you find clients and build a portfolio. 
10. Stay informed about current events and economic trends to make educated decisions when it comes to investing, spending, or looking for work. Understanding the bigger picture can help you make better decisions that benefit your personal finances in the long run.

1. Research job scams and avoid any company that promises to help you find a job but charges a large fee upfront without delivering any results. There are many scammers out there looking to take advantage of people who are desperate for work, so it's important to be aware of their tactics. 
2. Be wary of any job listings that require an application or interview fee before you can apply or be considered for a position. Legitimate companies will not ask for money upfront, and if they do, it's likely a scam. 
3. Check with local government agencies and non-profit organizations to see if they have any job training programs or resources that can help you find employment. They may be able to connect you with potential employers or offer support services to help you develop the skills you need for a particular job. 
4. Do some research on the company you're interviewing with, and be aware of red flags such as requests for personal information, unusual payment requests, or promises of high salaries without prior experience. These may be signs of a scam, so it's important to do your due diligence before signing any contracts or handing over any money. 
5. Be cautious when responding to online job ads, especially if you receive an email from someone claiming to represent the company and asking for personal information or a payment upfront. Legitimate companies will never ask for this information, so it's likely a scam. 
6. Report any suspicious job postings or emails to local government agencies or law enforcement, as they may be able to take action against the scammers and protect others from falling victim to these types of schemes. 
7. Consider using a reputable job search website or employment service that has been around for a while and has a good reputation in the community. This can help ensure that you're not dealing with a scammer who is looking to take advantage of people who are desperate for work. 
8. Keep in mind that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate job opportunities will rarely offer high salaries without prior experience or ask for upfront payments. If a job opportunity sounds suspicious or unrealistic, it's likely a scam. 
9. Be aware of common job search scams and know what to look out for when applying to jobs online. Some common scams include phishing emails that trick you into revealing personal information, fake job listings that are actually attempts to steal your money or identity, and companies that promise to find you a job but charge a large fee upfront without delivering any results. 
10. Stay informed about current events and economic trends to make educated decisions when it comes to investing, spending, or looking for work. Understanding the bigger picture can help you make better decisions that benefit your personal finances in the long run. By being aware of these scams and taking steps to protect yourself, you can avoid falling victim to them and focus on finding legitimate job opportunities that can help you achieve your goals.
