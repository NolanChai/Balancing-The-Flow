"I don't hear anything." Detective Henry said as he listened to the song on the Ipod. He looks at the bodies and shakes his head. "This is getting weirder by the second."

*'' How about you play it for me?  '' *
Detective Henry puts the earbuds in his ears and listens to the music for a moment. When he takes them out, he says, "I hear something..." He looks at the bodies again and shakes his head. "This is getting weirder by the second."

*'' The song playing is called Butterfly Effect.  '' *
Detective Henry frowns and stares at the Ipod. "Butterfly in the sky, I can go tw... What does that mean?" He looks up at his partner and says, "What's going on here?"

*'' It means you don't know what's coming.  '' *
Detective Henry looks at the bodies again. "This is getting weirder by the second," he says.

*'' The song is saying that change is inevitable, and you can't stop it.  '' *
Detective Henry shakes his head. "Butterfly effect? This is crazy." He looks at his partner and says, "I don't know what to make of this."

*'' I do.  '' *
Detective Henry stares at the Ipod again. "What does it mean?"

*'' It means that change is inevitable and you can't stop it.  '' *
Detective Henry looks at his partner, who smiles. "I know what this is about."

*'' What are you talking about?  '' *
Detective Henry frowns and shakes his head. "This is crazy." He looks at the Ipod again and says, "Butterfly effect?"

*'' Yes, that's right.  It means change is inevitable and you can't stop it.  '' *
Detective Henry looks at his partner with a blank stare. "I don't understand."

*'' I know.  That's why we're here.  To figure out what this all means.  '' *
Detective Henry shakes his head again. "This is crazy." He looks at the Ipod one last time and says, "Butterfly effect?"

*'' Yes, that's right.  It means change is inevitable and you can't stop it.  '' *
Detective Henry stares at his partner for a moment before shaking his head and sighing. "This is crazy." He looks at the Ipod one last time and says, "Butterfly effect?"
