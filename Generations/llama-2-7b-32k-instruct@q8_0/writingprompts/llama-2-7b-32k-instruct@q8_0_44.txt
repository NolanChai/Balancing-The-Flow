a passion for science fiction and space adventure graphic novels, a passion for computers, and a mild mannered personality. A computer geek by day and comic book collector by night. August was not a bully. He had never been known to pick on anyone physically or verbally; he always made sure that his opinions were delivered with respect and kindness. In fact, the only people who ever picked on him were those who couldn't stand up for themselves, such as the weak minded students in his classroom at school who thought it would be cool to bully a nerdy kid. He never got into fights; instead, he used his wits and his ability to write code to help himself out of trouble. One day, August was sitting alone at lunch when three boys walked up to him, the ring leader of which asked him if he wanted to join their "gang."
