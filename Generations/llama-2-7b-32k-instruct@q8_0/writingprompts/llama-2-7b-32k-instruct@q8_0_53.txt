I drove down the road in my car with the windows rolled down and the radio blasting loudly. I was feeling free and alive, like I hadn't felt in years. The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over everything as I made my way through town. Suddenly, I saw him. He was sitting on a park bench, looking exactly the same as he always did--with his sunglasses perched on top of his head and a cigarette dangling from his lips. My heart skipped a beat at the sight of him.
