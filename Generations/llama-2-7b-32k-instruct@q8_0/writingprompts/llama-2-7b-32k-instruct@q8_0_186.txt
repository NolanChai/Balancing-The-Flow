that already.

But he had to do it. And when he did... everything would change. His life would be complete. But first he needed this one last thing: one more job, one more score. One more step in the pathway of his dreams. And if anything - and anyone - got in his way, well, that'd just be a bonus, wouldn't it?

Carson glanced at his watch. He checked to make sure he had enough time. Checked his pockets for everything he needed, then slipped out of the warehouse before anyone could stop him.

It was time to get back on track. Time to take care of some unfinished business. Carson knew what he had to do... and this time, nothing would stand in his way. He just hoped that it wouldn't be too late.

The lights flickered as he walked into the dark room where they were held captive. The room was small with no windows - all thick black walls, the only thing to see was the table in front of you and a chair opposite. Sitting across from Carson, hands taped together behind his back was the man that had been holding them hostage for weeks now: Tom.

"Well well," Tom said as he smirked at Carson. "Looks like I finally got what I wanted huh?"

Carson didn't answer - instead he looked down at the gun in his hand, knowing full well it was the only thing that could get him out of this alive. But he also knew if Tom had his way he wouldn't be getting out anyway...

"So... are you going to use that? Or is that just a show?" Tom asked as he grinned, leaning back in his chair and crossing one leg over the other as he looked Carson up and down.

Carson stayed silent for a few moments before finally speaking again. "It's not just a show." He told them calmly. And with that he raised the gun and shot Tom dead center in the chest - watching him fall to the floor like a sack of bricks. Carson couldn't help but smile as he looked at his old friend.

"I'm so glad we didn't get out when you said..." He said before turning back to look at the camera that was in front of him, addressing it as if it were Tom who had been there all along. "I guess I owe you one, don't I? See... even though I said no... now I know just how much you wanted me here."

Carson let out a deep sigh before taking the gun and placing it in his mouth - ending this nightmare once and for all as he took control of his own destiny. It had been years, but finally he was ready to take what he deserved. To face every last one of his fears head on. He couldn't wait to see how far things would go from here...

Carson pulled the trigger as everyone watched - and when they did they saw a bright light that swallowed Carson whole, leaving them all alone in a dark room once again. ​

The screen faded to black, bringing everything to an end. The crowd stared at it in silence for what seemed like ages before finally clapping and cheering for the performance they'd just seen. People were on their feet, throwing confetti as Carson took a bow, smiling from ear to ear.

As he walked off stage he had no doubt that this was where he belonged... where he was meant to be. After all, it didn't matter what kind of life he lived before this - or even if there was one at all - the thing that truly mattered was that he knew who he was now. And when Carson left that stage he had no doubt that he would never look back.

Carson looked out at them, seeing their faces shining with hope and admiration for him... he didn't know how long this feeling would last - but he wasn't going to question it. This was exactly where he wanted to be. He deserved to be happy, and now that he had found his purpose in life there was no way he could ever lose himself again.

Carson knew they would never understand just how much his life had changed - but he didn't need them to. They were all going to find out eventually anyway. And when they did... well, this feeling would only grow even stronger. Because as Carson walked away from that stage that night, he knew it was only the beginning of a whole new world.

And that was just fine with him - because for the first time in his life he finally felt like everything was possible. And if they didn't believe him, well... that was their problem, wasn't it?

Carson leant on the edge of an unmarked warehouse in his black, Prada sports jacket - a little extra for the job he knew was coming next. He took a drag of his cigarette. It would n't be easy. He knew that already.

But he had to do it. And when he did... everything would change. His life would be complete. But first he needed this one last thing: one more job, one more score. One more step in the pathway of his dreams. And if anything - and anyone - got in his way, well, that'd just be a bonus, wouldn't it?
