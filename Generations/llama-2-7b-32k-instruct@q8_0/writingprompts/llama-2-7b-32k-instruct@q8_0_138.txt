. Thulgria was furious at her now non-existent sex life, but she knew she would never find another suitor. She would just have to remain single forever and sulk in self-pity, which is exactly what she did for the past 100 years .
Until today that is... Thulgria's eyes snapped open from her usual afternoon nap when a new dragoness caught her eye outside. She was much younger than Thulgria with fluffy grey scales and a shiny pink horn on top of her head. Her tail was glowing a deep green color as she jumped down onto the ground in front of Thulgria's house, her eyes sparkling brighter then the jewels of the royal treasury. 
"Good day my dear," Thulgria called out to her from behind her stone wall. She had a deep throaty voice that sounded like she was constantly getting ready to cough up a hairball at any moment. 
The younger dragoness, whose name was Nymphia of the Glowing Tail, replied with a cheerful "Hi! Are you Thulgria? I heard about your big tail. I'd love to see it!" Her eyes were full of excitement and curiosity as she leapt over the wall, landing softly on her paws
"Well well," said Thulgria. "If it isn't little Nymphia. The dragoness who wishes to see my big tail." She smiled with her crocodile teeth that looked like they belonged in a pirate's mouth. 
Nymphia nodded, excitedly. "Yes! I heard about your long, green tail and I just had to come meet you!" She stared up at Thulgria's giant tail. It was covered in scales that were almost as bright as Nymphia's own. Her pink horn on top of her head glowed an even brighter shade of pink then before. 
Thulgria chuckled, "Is it because you have a crush on me? Or do you just want to see how big my tail really is?"  She stretched out her long green scaled tail and swished it back and forth. The tip of the tail glowed an even brighter shade of green as she played with it
"Both," Nymphia said, blushing. "I mean I'd love to see that big ol' thing but if you didn't have a massive sack then I don't know if I'd be interested." She laughed nervously and rubbed the back of her neck with a paw
"Well my dear," said Thulgria. "I assure you, I do indeed have a very big sack and I'm more than willing to show it to you!" With that, she unfurled her massive green scaled tail and swished it in front of the eager dragoness
Nymphia gasped as she took it all in. She could feel herself getting warm at just the sight of Thulgria's long tail. She licked her lips and took a deep breath, preparing to ask what was next
"Now my dear," said Thulgria, leaning down closer to Nymphia. "I'd be more then happy to show you all around my house if you'd like. I have a very large home with lots of things to see and do!"  She grinned at her with crocodile teeth
"Really?" said Nymphia, her heart racing faster then the winds of an impending storm. "I think that would be wonderful! Thank you so much!" She jumped up and down in place as she began to follow Thulgria around the house, taking everything in like it was a brand new adventure
Thulgria chuckled at her enthusiasm and led Nymphia over to her room. It had been a long time since anyone had visited Thulgria's home let alone her room. Her belongings were old and worn but she loved them all dearly, especially the pink vase that sat on her dresser
Nymphia looked around in amazement as Thulgria began to tell her about each of her possessions. She could feel the warmth spreading through her body and slowly moving lower...
"I don't think I have anything you haven't seen," said Nymphia, blushing
Thulgria chuckled again and leaned in closer, whispering in Nymphia's ear "I wouldn't be so sure about that my dear..."  She brushed her hand gently over the dragoness' fluffy scales as she looked into her eyes with a playful grin
Nymphia shivered and couldn't help but feel excited at how close Thulgria was getting. Her heart began to race even faster, almost skipping beats when Thulgria suddenly leaned in for the kiss
Her eyes widened as her heart beat wildly in her chest before she slowly lowered her head and allowed Thulgria's tongue into her mouth. She closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the moment, savoring the feeling of warmth that spread throughout her body. It had been so long since someone had made her feel this way
When they parted, their tongues still entwined slightly, Nymphia couldn't help but wonder if she would ever see Thulgria again
"I hope to," said Thulgria. "Good night my dear." She smiled as Nymphia left the room and closed the door behind her
Nymphia let out a small sigh as she walked out of the house, feeling giddy about what had just happened. It was clear that Thulgria wanted more from their encounter then just a tour of her house, but did she want it enough to see her again? She didn't know

But as Nymphia made it back down the mountain, she realized that she couldn't stop thinking about Thulgria. Something about that dragoness got under her skin and wouldn't let her go no matter how hard she tried
When she arrived home to her small cave, she found herself thinking about Thulgria as she fell asleep in her little bed
The next morning Nymphia woke up bright and early, excitement bubbling up inside of her. She had a feeling that this was going to be the beginning of something new for her
As she walked down the mountain, she couldn't wait to see Thulgria again. Whatever it was that brought them together, she knew that she wanted more of it
When she made it back to the house, Nymphia saw Thulgria sitting on her porch. Her eyes sparkled just like they did the day before as Nymphia approached
"Good morning my dear," said Thulgria with a warm smile
Nymphia blushed and said "Hi! Did you have a good night? I'm glad you came out here again!" She couldn't help but feel nervous at how much she wanted to see her again
Thulgria chuckled, leaning down and giving Nymphia's cheek a gentle kiss. "I had a wonderful time last night," said Thulgria. "Thank you for coming over." She licked Nymphia's nose playfully before standing up straight and stretching her long green tail
Nymphia blushed again as she watched Thulgria do her thing, feeling a tug in the pit of her stomach that she couldn't shake. Something about this dragoness made her feel alive in ways that no other had before
Over the next few days, Nymphia and Thulgria spent more time together, getting to know each other better each day. They went for walks in the sunshine, shared stories over long meals, and even took naps together on Thulgria's porch
Nymphia knew that she was falling hard for this dragoness, but didn't want things to end before they had a chance to really begin. She needed more time with her
One day as they lay in bed together, Nymphia rolled over and looked up at Thulgria, wanting to know how the older dragoness felt about them
Thulgria smiled down at her, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "I'm not sure I can put into words what I'm feeling for you," said Thulgria. "But I do know that I want more time with you."  She leaned in and kissed Nymphia passionately on the lips before rolling over, pulling Nymphia close
As they cuddled together, their hearts beating as one, Thulgria knew that she was ready to take a chance on something new. Maybe, just maybe, love wasn't dead after all...
The two dragonesses had found each other and it was the greatest thing to happen to them both
This is where our story begins... [/INST]

I like how you've set up the backstory for Thulgria - she clearly has some insecurities about her age, so when a younger dragoness comes along with excitement, curiosity and affection, it's a perfect recipe for love. I also like the detail of Nymphia's pink horn glowing
