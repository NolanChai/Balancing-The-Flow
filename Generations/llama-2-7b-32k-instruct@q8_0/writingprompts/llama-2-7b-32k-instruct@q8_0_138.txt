"Thulgaria was your typical 40-something - century old divorcee dragon."

Thulgria sat on top of her cave's ledge as she looked down at the bustling village below. She had been watching over it for ages, making sure that no harm came to anyone living there. But today was different. There was a feeling in the air. Something was brewing. Thulgria knew she couldn't stay away from this anymore. She needed to take action.

With a deep breath, Thulgria leapt off her ledge and began to fly towards the village. As she got closer, she could see that something truly extraordinary was happening. The villagers were gathered together in a circle, their eyes fixed on something in the distance. Thulgria couldn't tell what it was at first, but as she approached, she realized that there was a dragon standing before them. It was massive, its scales glinting in the sunlight. And it was looking directly at her.

Thulgria felt a sense of dread wash over her. She knew that this dragon was no ordinary one. Its presence here could only mean one thing - it was the one who had been causing all the commotion in the village. It was the dragon from the prophecy. The one that would bring about change, both good and bad.

Thulgria landed before the villagers, her wings spread out behind her. She knew that she had to speak up. "Greetings, citizens of the village," she said in a strong voice. "I am Thulgria, protector of this valley. I have been watching over you for many years, and today, I must tell you all something important."

The villagers turned to look at her, their faces filled with curiosity. "What is it that you wish to say?" asked one of them.

"I am here because of the dragon," Thulgria said, pointing at the creature in front of them. "It has come here to bring about change. But not all change is bad - some of it can be good too." She paused for a moment, gathering her thoughts. "This dragon holds the key to our future, but we must be careful. We must listen to its message and act upon it wisely. For if we do not, the consequences could be dire."

The villagers looked at each other, their faces filled with worry. Thulgria knew that she had made her point. She had told them all they needed to know. Now it was up to them - would they heed her warning and take action? Or would they let fate unfold without them? The answer would soon be clear...
