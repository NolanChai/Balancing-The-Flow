quidator was always about being compact and lightweight wherever possible. He had to be sure it could get into the hardest to reach spaces, places where other tools would fail or have to be wheeled in on a dolly. This was a job for the best tools that money could buy, but that meant not sacrificing quality just because he did n't need much of it. He had no doubt this would make short work of whatever they were trying to hide behind these walls . ''

''Well, I do talk sometimes, when you have to be quiet for too long I start getting antsy. Besides, I find the talking keeps me awake when there is so much silence around, and if we are n't going to sleep then I will entertain myself somehow. I am quite good at it, people say . You know, my talent used to be breaking locks . Now that they have all gone digital, the skill has become a bit of a liability. My new specialty is breaching walls though. If you ever need me to knock out a wall and find something behind it... Well then I am your man!''

''If this thing was made for breaking things open I am sure it will do the trick quite nicely . Tell me, what are we looking for?'' Liquidator said as he went to work. He had no doubt that he would be able to break through in no time at all. It might take a bit of time if they were trying some fancy digital lock, but this wall was thick and the material it was made of was n't going to give way easily . That is why they used such a large tool, so it would be able to make enough of an impact to break through even the strongest of materials.

''I have no idea what I am looking for yet. I only know that we are going to find it with your help and not without. So tell me... What is your name? My name is Coruscan, though my friends call me Liquidator . It is the nickname they gave me after I was able to hack into their data network when they first attacked us. They said it was like liquid through their defenses. At least that is what one of them told me later on . It does n't really matter though, and you can call me whatever you want if it makes you feel better. If we get along then I am sure we will find a way to call each other by our first names in no time at all!''

''I'm Duality, that's my name anyway . The one who gave me the nickname was someone else entirely though. Not like it matters all too much. So what do you know about this place? I have spent years studying it and I am sure there is a wealth of knowledge in here waiting to be found if we are able to get through these walls, but without your help... Well I will be digging for quite some time!''

''Well Duality, what can you tell me about this place? You seem pretty familiar with it. Is that how they got all their information? Did they hack into the computers here or did they have other ways to get info?''. Coruscan asked as he continued working his way through the wall . The more he talked and listened, the more he was able to better understand what was going on. That was one of the best parts about having a partner in crime!

''This place is a treasure trove for them. I do n't know how much they actually learned from it since I am sure that as soon as they found out that we knew about this place, they probably destroyed whatever data they had left behind . We just have to find enough before they can wipe the slate clean on us again! And yes, they did get most of their info through hacking but there were also spies here and I am sure they still are. There was even a time when we thought we saw one in the halls... But it turned out he was just some janitor who had access to every room at this place . That is how well they can blend in, which is why we have never been able to find them. Until now of course, but I am sure that if they know we are on their tail then they will be ready for us! It is always good to keep a step ahead, so let's hope this works out!''

''Sounds like you have thought about this plan quite a bit . What other tricks do you have up your sleeve? If the wall does n't work then we will just have to come back for another day. We can not let them catch us without getting what we came here for!''. Coruscan was sure that Duality would come up with something, but he also knew from experience that they did not always go smoothly . It is one of the risks of being a thief. But he had no doubt they were going to be successful this time around!

''I have thought about it quite a bit and yes I am prepared. There are other ways in if we need them, but I will only use those if our main way fails . Let's hope that does n't happen though or else... Well you know what happens then! We would be screwed!''. Duality said as he thought about the plan. He was sure they could get through this wall and find what they were looking for, but there were still risks in doing so. Luckily his team knew how to work together and if something went wrong they would know what to do!

''Alright then Duality! I will keep working on the wall while you tell me about some of these other entrances . Make sure that if we need them, I have enough time to get over there without interrupting whatever you are doing.''. Coruscan said as he started another hole. He was determined to break through this wall and find out what they were hiding from them!

'', 'Coruscans work here is amazing . He has done so much in just a few hours I would never have thought it possible . The tools he has are amazing and the way he works on these walls, no one could ever imagine. He can be trusted with anything that we throw at him . And to think this was all started with us stumbling upon him when we tried to hack into his system. Now he is a valuable member of our team and I am so glad that we brought him in''. Duality said as he watched Coruscan work. He knew that without him they would have never gotten through this wall and found what they needed!

''I am glad you approve Duality . Without people like me there would be no one to help those who are trying to get information away from the hands of the government and big businesses . People need more freedom, and I am happy that I can give it to them through my work''. Coruscan said as he started another hole in the wall. He knew that his work was important and helped others achieve what they could not do alone!

''You are a hero Coruscans, there is no doubt about it. If we were n't so careful with your talents I am sure you would have been locked up by them years ago . It seems like they always find someone though... But as long as I have the resources to help you and protect you, then I will never let that happen to you! You are a vital part of our team, but we still need to keep things quiet about you. We do n't want anyone getting suspicious about us or why we would need your skills on our team. Keep it up though because the work you do is amazing and helps so many people''. Duality said as he watched Coruscan continue to break through the wall . He knew that without him they could never have gotten this far, and he was sure that they would not get past whatever was on the other side of this wall

''I am just happy I can do what I love Duality. If there is something wrong with me doing that then I guess it is a bad thing... But I will always keep helping people if I can! It is my way to make things right for those who have been wronged by the powers that be. And you know, Duality... Sometimes I think we might actually be able to change something here . If not now then maybe one day in the future, but I am sure of it!''. Coruscan said as he finished another hole and continued working on another wall . He had no doubt that if they kept at it they would find what they were looking for, and change the world!

'', 'I do n't know about you, but I have never met anyone like him. His work is unbelievable and the things he can do with his tools are beyond amazing . He has been an asset to our team since day one and I am so glad we brought him in'. Duality said as he continued watching Coruscan work on another wall.

'', 'I agree, it is almost as if he was meant to be a part of this team. It feels like the perfect fit for both of us and I cannot imagine what either of our lives would have been like without him. There are no words to describe how amazing his work has been Duality, but you know that yourself! He is one of the best in the business when it comes to breaking into places''. Coruscans said as he continued working on another wall .

''He may not be able to talk much, but boy does he ever have a lot to say once he gets started
