The miner had just finished unearthing a long-lost tunnel in search for valuable gems when he asked his companion to describe her relationship with the wall. The miner was curious about how the two interacted, as they were both vital to the success of his project. Coruscan's response was unexpected and left him feeling curious.

The miner waited patiently for an answer, but Coruscan remained silent, focused on the task at hand. He hefted his jackhammer and braced it against the wall, preparing to make a hole large enough to fit the bit. It was a compact tool, as heavy as a rack of barbels, but that did not bother him.

The miner stared at Coruscan for a moment, wondering if he had heard him correctly. "Did you just say nothing?!?" He exclaimed in disbelief. "How is it possible that two such vital entities have so little to say to each other?"

Coruscan shrugged, still focused on his work. "I do n't know," he said simply. "They just do n't talk much."

The miner was taken aback by this response. He had expected a more detailed explanation, or at least some insight into why the wall and the jackhammer did not interact more frequently. Instead, Coruscan seemed uninterested in delving deeper into their relationship.

As the miner watched, Coruscan continued to work in silence, the sound of the bit cutting through the wall echoing around him. He found himself wondering if perhaps there was something he was missing - some hidden truth about the relationship between the wall and the jackhammer that only Coruscan could see.

But as time passed, it became clear that the miner would not receive any further explanation from his companion. The silence stretched on, punctuated only by the sound of the bit cutting through the wall and the occasional grunt of effort as Coruscan hefted his jackhammer.

As he watched, a thought struck him - what if there was more to their relationship than met the eye? What if the silence between the wall and the jackhammer held a deeper meaning, one that only those who knew them well could understand?

Without saying a word, Coruscan picked up his jackhammer and continued to work, leaving the miner with nothing but questions and a sense of curiosity. What other secrets did this tunnel hold? And what other mysteries lay hidden beneath the surface...
