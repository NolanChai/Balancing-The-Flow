a new power source that can help us advance as well.''

Xandi sighs  ''You're forgetting the fact that we need more soldiers, there is always time for this later. We should be focusing on our goals before our enemies do something about it''. Xandi thinks out loud.

Shrl of the High Council sighed and said ''Yes, you are correct, your highness''. Shrl bows down to show her respects 

Xandi looks at Shrl and says in a kind voice  ''Do not be so formal with me my dear''

Shrl blushes slightly then smiles up at Xandi and says 'yes, your highness.' and straightens her posture to return to their original discussion. 
Xandi sighs again ''So what are our options? I don't like this decision we made''

Shrl of the High Council thinks for a moment. ''We could try to recruit them, maybe they will be useful in the future''. Shrl smiles slightly, hoping she is right and doesn't sound foolish. 
Xandi ponders on this idea then asks her next question 'Do we know where they are going?'

Shrl of the High Council shakes her head slowly. ''No, not yet, but I am sure that my people can find out before long.' 
''Well let's give them some time to rest and recuperate, see if they have any ideas about this new power source then we should set up a meeting with these Earthlings''.

Shrl of the High Council smiles at Xandi and says 'Yes, your highness. I will set that into motion immediately.' 
Xandi nods in approval as she gives one last instruction ''And Shrl don't forget to be nice this time around, they seem like a friendly bunch of people''

Shrl bows once again and leaves the chamber to follow through with Xandi's orders. 
Xandi sits in her throne thinking about everything that has happened today. She can only hope she made the right decision.

Xander looks up at the blonde girl, his expression one of confusion  ''What do you mean by advanced technology?'' Xander asks after taking a moment to process what he heard. The term sounded familiar but he couldn't quite place it. He tried again with another question ''Do you think you can teach us how to use this tech? We could really use the help, especially on this planet.'

Cindy sighed slightly  ''I don't know what kind of tech they're talking about, but if I have a chance then maybe I will. I mean, there's no harm in trying, right?''. Cindy shrugs her shoulders before asking him next  'So how did you guys end up here? You didn't come from Earth by any means, right?'

Xander chuckles at that one and gives a little smile  ''I don't know what brought us to this planet but I think it had something to do with our spaceship running low on fuel. So we crashed down here.' Xander shrugged his shoulders  ''But hey, sometimes the best things in life just happen unexpectedly''.

Cindy smiles and nods along as she listens to him speak. She can tell that Xander is being completely genuine about everything that has happened today. After a few moments of silence, Cindy gives her final question before she says ''Well I guess that's all the questions I have for now. Thanks again for saving our lives back there and I hope you don't mind me asking all these questions''

Xander chuckles at her  ''Hey, it's okay. We're in this together so just ask whatever comes to your mind. We'll help each other out however we can''. Xander stands up slowly and stretches a little bit before giving a small bow of his head towards Cindy. He smiles again as he says 'thank you for being so kind and understanding, I hope that our paths will cross again soon.'

Cindy smiles back at him warmly  ''Same here Xander''. She watches as the blonde boy walks away before turning to look out across the valley. She feels a tinge of sadness wash over her before she shakes it off and looks down at her wrist device once more, quickly taking in all the information it has to offer.

The first thing she sees is that Xander's team has been located 30 minutes ago. She also sees that they have set up a temporary camp not too far away from their current location. Cindy looks back at her wrist device, scrolling through the message log again to find another conversation between Captain and Dr. Jones. This time it was an encrypted message  ''I don't understand why they would send you out here in your condition but I will do whatever I can to help you get back home''

Cindy frowns slightly before she scrolls through the message log once more, eventually coming across a conversation that lasted over two hours. She looks up at her wrist device and sees that it was Captain that initiated this conversation  ''We have detected an unknown life form on the planet''. Cindy freezes as she reads the rest of the message  ''The life form is approaching our location now. I think it would be wise for us to make contact with them, we may need their help in the future.'

Cindy looks at her wrist device once more, scrolling through the logs on Xander's team's communication channel. She finds a conversation between Captain and Dr Jones that was initiated about fifteen minutes ago  ''We are ready to greet them, how would you like to handle this situation? I have some ideas but I want to hear your input first''. Cindy frowns even more, looking up at her wrist device one last time before she gets back up on her feet.

''They didn't send us out here for a reason, and it was probably because we had the technology needed to help them. I know you have some ideas but why don't we just ask them if they can help us? If not, then maybe they will be able to give us more information about this planet or something else that might prove useful to us''

Cindy stands there for a moment, looking out across the valley as she thinks. She looks back down at her wrist device before taking in a deep breath and walking over towards Xander's team. 
Cindy walks up next to Xander and gives him a smile  ''Hey guys! I wanted to say thank you again for saving our lives out there. We really appreciate it. It seems like we have more in common than just the fact that we all crash landed here, huh?''

Xander looks over at Cindy, his face showing a bit of surprise  ''Oh yeah? What's up?''. Xander chuckles slightly before he gives her another smile and shrugs. He walks over to Captain who is still sitting down and gives him a pat on the shoulder  ''Nice job out there today, buddy''

Cindy looks back at Xander and nods once again as she says 'thank you'. She then turns her attention towards Dr Jones before speaking up once more. 
"Hey guys, I wanted to let you know that we've made some new friends out here. We can ask them about our situation if they would be willing to help us. And if not, at least we have some information on this planet''. Cindy looks back down at her wrist device as she waits for a response

The others look at one another before Captain speaks up  ''What do you think, Dr Jones? Would it be worth the risk? We could always use more intel about this place after all, but if they turn out to be bad we can always run away''. Captain looks back over his shoulder at Cindy and gives her a smile. He then turns his attention back towards Dr. Jones before asking him once again  ''What do you say?'

Cindy shrugs as she waits for the others to respond  'I don't know what to think, I guess we could always run away if they turn out to be hostile'. Cindy smiles at that one. She then looks over at Xander and gives him another smile  ''We can always ask them about your situation too''.

Captain chuckles slightly as he shakes his head before giving a small nod of his head towards Dr Jones and saying 'Alright, let's go say hi to our new friends. Just stay close by Cindy'

Xander chuckles at that one  ''I'm always here for you guys, Captain''. Xander gives another smile as he walks over towards the others before giving a little bow of his head and saying 'good luck out there''

Captain nods his head once more before giving a small smile back to Cindy. He then gets up from where he was sitting and motions for Dr Jones, Xander, and Cindy to follow him as the group begins their trek towards the mysterious life form''.
