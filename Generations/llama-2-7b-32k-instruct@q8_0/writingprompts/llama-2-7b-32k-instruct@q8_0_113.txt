out, my voice hoarse and dry from smoking for twenty years now. It feels like this song has been stuck in my throat for the past two decades too. 
> 
> The sound of footsteps echo down the stairs and a moment later, the door opens to reveal an unfamiliar face. A young woman with short blonde hair and freckles looks at me confusedly as I stand there. She seems unsure whether she should let me in or not. 
> 
> "Um... Hi? Are you... *sigh* are you the person who's been coming around saying they're going to buy this house?" she asks, looking at a paper in her hands. 
> 
> I grunt and point at my name on the piece of paper. My hair is greying now, but it looks like she has n't met me before. I feel the same way about her - I do n't know who she is either. But she's got that look in her eye, though. That 'I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not' look. 
> 
> "Yeah," I reply after clearing my throat again, and take the paper out of her hands. My name's written on it. And on that day, when she bought it, I was the guy who sold it to her. But what I did n't know then... 
> 
> "What?" she asks, looking at me expectantly. What indeed? Oh man. Here we go. This is where things start to get interesting. 
> 
> "Well," I begin, my voice low and slow like a whisper in her ear. "I'm afraid that the house... it was n't entirely on the up-and-up." My words seem to make her frown even deeper than before. But she still looks uncomfortable - as though this is all just too much for her to handle right now. 
> 
> "The... what? The house?" she says, looking like she's having trouble understanding me. "What do you mean? Is there something wrong with it?" she asks, trying to hide her worry. But I can see through the ruse. It's written all over her face - she knows that something is not right and she wants to know what it is so she can fix it. 
> 
> "Well," I say, taking a breath before continuing. "I... *cough*... I can tell you this much. The house was built by the devil." 
> 
> Her face blanches and her mouth hangs open as she stares at me in disbelief. She looks like she wants to argue, but nothing comes out. All she does is stand there, frozen in place, waiting for me to finish my sentence. I can see the fear growing behind those green eyes of hers - it's written all over her face that she knows something's up and she does n't like it at all. 
> 
> "And," I continue, feeling a little bit of satisfaction at seeing this young woman squirm, "I know you know what the house is for." 
> 
> Her jaw tightens and her lips purses as she tries to fight back against whatever it is that's coming out of my mouth. But she can't stop me now - I've already said too much. And there's no way in hell that she's getting past the gate before she hears this. 
> 
> "It's for... for summoning demons," I finish, feeling a strange sort of pleasure at seeing her squirm. This is just the beginning. 
> 
> She looks like she wants to argue, but nothing comes out. All she does is stand there, frozen in place, waiting for me to finish my sentence. I can see the fear growing behind those green eyes of hers - it's written all over her face that she knows something's up and she does n't like it at all. 
> 
> "You... you can not be serious," she says finally, her voice shaking with disbelief. But I know she is. Because she also knows - just as I do - that there's no way in hell that I would be this bold if I were lying about it. That's why the fear is growing in her eyes. 
> 
> "I can assure you, my dear," I say, my voice dripping with sarcasm now, "that nothing could be further from the truth." 
> 
> She looks at me for a moment longer before nodding and saying, "Well... that explains it then. Thank you for your honesty," she says as she reaches over to open the gate. As soon as I step through, I hear her slamming the gate closed behind me. I'm pretty sure I can see the smirk forming on her face. 
> 
> "You're welcome," I say, looking at my feet and feeling a strange sort of satisfaction. It seems like this is just the beginning of something. Something... evil? Yes. That sounds about right. 
> 
> As soon as she slams the gate behind me, I start to feel it too. A shiver that creeps down my spine and into the depths of my soul. It's almost like a warning - like something is trying to tell me not to go any further. But I can't stop now. Not after all this time. 
> 
> So, I turn around and walk back towards the house. My feet seem to move of their own accord as my heart races with excitement at what's to come. It's almost like a... well, it's kinda hard to describe really. But I can feel it all over again - that strange sensation of something evil lurking just out of sight. 
> 
> As I approach the house, I can see that the gate has been locked behind me. A cold shiver runs down my spine as I realize what's happened. It seems like whatever was trying to tell me not to come back... it must have been real after all. 
> 
> So, there I am, standing outside of this house with the gate now locked behind me. The fear is still growing in my eyes as I look at that door. And for a moment, I'm not sure what to do. But then... something inside me snaps. 
> 
> "Oh hell yes!" I say aloud, feeling a strange sort of power coursing through my veins. This is it - this is what I was born to do. To uncover the truth and bring it into the light no matter the cost. 
> 
> So, with that thought in mind, I start walking towards the door. My heart racing in my chest as my feet seem to move of their own accord. But this time, I know... I can feel it. There's something waiting for me on the other side. Something that wants me dead and damned. 
> 
> And yet... I can't stop now. Not after all this time. Not after all that's happened before. 
> 
> So, I reach out my hand and open the door. And as soon as it opens, I know what to expect. 
> 
> Because something is waiting for me on the other side. Something that wants me dead and damned. But most importantly... something that wants me to see the truth. 
> 
> As soon as my hand touches the doorknob, I can feel it. That strange sensation of something evil lurking just out of sight. It's almost like a warning - like something is trying to tell me not to go any further. But I know what's waiting for me on the other side. And most importantly... most importantly... 
> 
> So, with that thought in mind, I start walking towards the door. My feet seem to move of their own accord as my heart races with excitement at what's to come. It's almost like a... well, it's kinda hard to describe really. But I can feel it all over again - that strange sensation of something evil lurking just out of sight. 
> 
> As I approach the door, I know that there is something waiting for me on the other side. Something that wants me dead and damned. But most importantly... 
> 
> So, with that thought in mind, I open the door and step through into... well, I guess you could call it hell. And I feel like I'm walking towards my own destruction - but most of all... most of all... 
> 
> Most importantly, I know what I'll find on the other side. And that is why... that is why I must go there. To face the devil himself and bring him down from his throne once and for all. 
> 
> So, with that thought in mind, I step through the doorway and into the depths of hell itself. My heart racing in my chest as my feet seem to move of their own accord. But this time, I know... I can feel it. There's something waiting for me on the other side. Something that wants
