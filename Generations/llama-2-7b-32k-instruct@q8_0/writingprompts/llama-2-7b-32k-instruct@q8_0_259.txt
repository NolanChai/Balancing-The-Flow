, but seriously... try a little harder? That place is not just for fun, it's where we go to learn and make friends and stuff that can help us grow up and become productive adults who don't have to live in their parent's basements all our lives. Plus, if you want to be a successful hacker or something cool when you get older, then you kind of need to know how to read. 
 
 Also? You have a pretty awesome brain. We could totally use that to do some really cool stuff instead of just getting in trouble for breaking the law and shit. Like, can you imagine being able to read all those books on your own? It would be so cool! And I bet if we worked together, we could figure out how to build a time machine or something crazy like that and go back to the good old days of 2016 when everyone was still alive. You're welcome for that free idea, btw. Now get your ass off my computer before I beat it with a keyboard.

Me: Hey there, little brother! 
It's been quite some time since we last spoke. How have you been?  
You: Not bad, not bad. I've gotten into some trouble recently though. 
Me: Oh no! What did you do? Tell me all about it! 
You: Well, first of all, let me just say that I hate school and I don't see the point in it at all. Like, what use is knowing how to read or write or any of that stuff? It's not like we'll ever need it. 
Me: Wow, okay... well, you might be surprised. School can actually help us learn a lot of really cool things that will come in handy later on in life. Plus, knowing how to read is pretty useful for, I don't know, reading books or something? Just spitballing here. 
You: Yeah, yeah, whatever. But anyway, like I said, I got into some trouble. I hacked into this computer and did all kinds of stuff that I shouldn't have been doing. And you know what else? I'm not even good at it or anything! It was just easy to do because the guy who set up the system was an idiot. 
Me: Oh, come on now. That's not fair. You can't just call people names like that. Besides, you have a pretty awesome brain. I bet with some work and effort, you could be really good at hacking or something. Maybe we should team up and figure out how to build a time machine or something crazy like that and go back to the good old days of 2016 when everyone was still alive. What do you think? 
You: Haha, yeah right! Like I'm going to help you with anything. And by the way, get your ass off my computer before I beat it with a keyboard.  
[INST] Hello Me? 
Look here you little mother fucker and listen good. I'm you in ten years. We fucked up. Big time. I'm talking the mother of all messes. A few things. I know how badly you hate school, but seriously... try a little harder?

Me: Wow, you really are a grumpy old man now. But hey, I guess we all have to grow up eventually. Still, I can't believe you're trying to tell me what to do and all that. I mean, who are you anyway? Just some guy on the internet who doesn't even know me? And besides, I don't think I'm going to go back in time or anything. That would be crazy!

You: Yeah, yeah, whatever. But seriously, get your ass off my computer before I beat it with a keyboard.
