They call themselves the Unleashed. They were demons once, not even that, demonic beasts, barely tamed and bared for war by the unholy hordes. Now they are something between people and beasts, fierce protectors of mankind with a ferocious hatred of their former masters. But the Unleashed are not the only ones with strange powers. A group known as The Enlightened has been recruiting those who possess magical abilities to aid in an effort to take over the world, and they've already chosen their king and queen: a young man named Maxime and a girl named Nadia. But The Unleashed have their own plans for the future, and they'll stop at nothing to make sure that no one gets in their way.
