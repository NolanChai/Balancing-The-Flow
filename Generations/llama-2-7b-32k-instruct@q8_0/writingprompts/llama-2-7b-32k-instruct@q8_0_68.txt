### The Rage of the Beast
In the dark, damp catacombs that stretched deep beneath the city, something stirred. A low rumble echoed through the ancient halls as a creature rose up from its slumber. It was a beast unlike any other, a hybrid of man and demon, bred for war and bound by discipline.

The Unleashed were a group of such creatures, once held in check by their masters but now unleashed upon the world. They had been tasked with defending humanity from those who would seek to enslave it, but not all beasts could be tamed, and some had broken free from their chains.

The rumble grew louder as the creature stepped into the light. It was a massive figure, towering over those around it, its muscles rippling with raw power. Its face was twisted in a snarl, its eyes glowing red like burning embers.

"What is your name?" A voice boomed from within the beast's chest. "And what do you seek?"

The creature paused, looking around at its surroundings. It was alone in this place, but it knew that it would not be for long. The Unleashed were not meant to roam free, and those who had created them would come seeking them out.

"My name is Ace," the creature replied. "And I seek revenge."

Ace's eyes narrowed as he looked around again. He could feel the presence of others nearby, hiding in the shadows, waiting for their chance to strike. He knew that his time was limited, but he also knew that he had a mission to complete.

"Revenge?" The voice within Ace's chest echoed. "On who? And why?"

Ace closed his eyes, letting the memories of his past wash over him. He remembered being taken from his home, stripped of his humanity, and bound to serve a master who sought only to control and exploit him. He had been treated as less than nothing, a tool for their own purposes.

"Those who created me," Ace said. "And those who kept me in chains. They enslaved me, but they will pay."

The creature's eyes blazed with anger as it turned to face the voice within its chest. "I am no longer a slave," it growled. "I am free, and I will bring vengeance upon those who wronged me."

Ace felt a surge of power flow through him, his rage and fury bound in tight discipline and trained to serve humanity's cause against those who would enslave it. But not all beasts can be tamed, and some had broken free from their chains and returned to their unholy roots.

The creature stalked through the catacombs, its senses heightened as it sought out its prey. It knew that it was being hunted, but it also knew that it had a mission to complete. The voice within Ace's chest urged him on, driving him forward as he pursued his vengeance.

The creature burst into the light, its eyes glowing brighter than ever before. It stood tall and proud, ready to face whatever came its way. Its rage was unleashed, and it would not be tamed again.

The voice within Ace's chest laughed, a cold, mocking sound that echoed through his mind. "You think you can destroy what we created? You are just a beast, Ace, nothing more than a tool for our own purposes. But we will see how long you last."

Ace felt the presence of others nearby, hiding in the shadows, waiting for their chance to strike. He knew that his time was limited, but he also knew that he had a mission to complete.

"I will not stop until those who enslaved me are dead," Ace said. "And I will bring vengeance upon all of you."

The voice within Ace's chest laughed again, a sound that pierced through the creature's heart and mind. But Ace knew that he had to press on, that he had a mission to complete. He would not be tamed, and he would not stop until those who wronged him were dead.
