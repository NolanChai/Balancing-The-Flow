The day when John first met Sarah was an abnormal day for John. At 6:30, his alarm clock woke him up for work, and he reluctantly rolled out of bed to shower and dress. After a quick breakfast at home, John headed to the office. On his way out the door, he realized that he had forgotten his lunch in the refrigerator at home. Deciding to grab a sandwich from the deli down the street, John took off for work. When John arrived at the office, he was greeted by a colleague who offered him a cup of coffee. He accepted and began working on a project that he had been given during his lunch break earlier in the week. After a few hours spent at his desk, John decided to take a quick walk around the building for some fresh air. As he walked through the hallways, he passed by Sarah's office and was surprised to see her sitting alone. He smiled at her and they began chatting about their respective days. As the conversation went on, John discovered that she worked in the accounting department, while he spent most of his day working with numbers. The two ended up spending all afternoon talking and laughing together. After work, Sarah invited him to have dinner with her at a restaurant nearby and they had a wonderful evening together. As they left the restaurant, John asked for her phone number so that they could set up another date and she gladly gave it to him. This was the beginning of their relationship and an abnormal day for John, which would soon become very normal as he continued spending time with her.
