me? ” the woman asked without any concern or even the slightest interest in her name. 
 
 “ Well I was just wondering if it was true that there is a treasure buried on our island,” he continued without waiting for her response. 
 
 “ And who might be interested in such an excursion? ” she asked, sounding amused now. 
 
 “ Why anyone would like to go for the treasure of course! ” he exclaimed as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “ It ’ s a bit of adventure!” 
 
 “ I see,” Latrina said and took a drag from her cigarette again. She was quiet for some time before continuing, “ So what makes you think there is actually treasure to find? ” 
 
 “ Oh that! Well I heard about it from someone who had gone before me that ’ s all.” 
 
 “ And who might that have been?” she asked with a hint of mirth. 
 
 “ You know, that sounds like something for you to ask him though don’t you think? Not me!” he responded and gestured her to walk with them towards the pier where they had docked their boat. 
 
 “I could use someone on this little journey of ours,” she said. 
 
 “ And if I were you, I ’ m sure there would be plenty of other people who would join too.” He paused and looked around at his surroundings with a smirk on his face. “ We can always use the help right?”

“009? Yes, I’m here.” A rotund woman named Latrina responds to a voice over the phone.

“Hey there! Just wanted to see if you heard about the treasure buried on our island?” A man named Fredrick asks excitedly.

“What do you want from me? You know, I don’t even care what my name is,” Latrina says with a heavy sigh. She takes a drag of her cigarette and blows smoke in the air.

Fredrick continues, “Well, I was just wondering if it was true that there is a treasure buried on our island.”

“And who might be interested in such an excursion? You know, that sounds like something for you to ask him though don’t you think? Not me!” he responds and gestures towards the pier where they have docked their boat.

Fredrick smirks, “And if I were you, I’m sure there would be plenty of other people who would join too.” He looks around at his surroundings with a smirk. “We can always use the help right? We can always use the help right?”

Latrina chuckles, “I think this conversation has gone on long enough, Fredrick. Goodbye and good luck finding your treasure.” She hangs up the phone.

Fredrick looks disappointed, “Guess we’re doing this alone…”

Fredrick: “What do you know? I heard that there is a hidden treasure chest buried in the depths of the island!”

Latrina: “Oh yeah, right. Like anyone would believe that.”

Fredrick: “Well, I have heard of someone who found it before. They said it was buried underneath a large rock formation near the shore.”

Latrina: “That’s impossible! No one has ever found anything on this island.”

Fredrick: “Well, I think you might be interested in joining me on this little adventure.”

Latrina: “I don’t know. You could just be trying to steal the treasure for yourself.”

Fredrick: “Oh please, I wouldn’t do that. But if you want to come along, I would love to have some company.”

Latrina: “I guess we could always use the help.”

Fredrick: “Excellent! Let’s get started then!”

The two of them begin their journey, exploring every nook and cranny of the island. They search high and low, but unfortunately, they don’t find any treasure chests.

Latrina: “Well, that was a waste of time.”

Fredrick: “Yeah, I guess we should have listened to her.”

They both turn around to see Latrina standing behind them, smirking from ear to ear.
