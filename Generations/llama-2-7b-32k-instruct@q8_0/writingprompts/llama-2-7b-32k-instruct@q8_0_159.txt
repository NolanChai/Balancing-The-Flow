"I'm sorry," Latrina apologized, "But I don't think this is a good time to talk."

[INST: Write the next part of the story.]
Latrina's eyes widened at what she saw. A man dressed in black with goggles on his face and carrying a large machine gun.  He had just snuck up behind her, and she hadn't even heard him coming. She turned to look at him, and he pointed the gun at her.
"What do you want?" Latrina asked, trying to keep calm.
The man took off his goggles and smiled at her. "I've been looking for a good time," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. 
Latrina didn't know what to say. She had never been in this situation before. Should she try to run? Should she stand and fight? She had no weapons, just her wit and determination. She decided to try and talk to him, hoping to defuse the situation. "Look," she said, "I don't know who you are or what you want, but I think we can work something out if we try."
The man looked at her for a moment, then shook his head and pulled the trigger on his gun. 
Latrina felt a searing pain in her chest as the bullet hit her. She fell to the ground, clutching her heart. "No!" she cried out, her voice echoing off the walls of the warehouse. The man stood over her, grinning from ear to ear.
"I'm afraid you're not going to die just yet," he said. "Not until I have my fun."
