Detective Rand continued to stare at me as if trying to make sense of what he heard. Finally, he said, "Let's step away from this for now and get the video from the store owner."

I nodded in agreement, and we ended our conversation for the time being. As I left the interrogation room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over me. The whole situation seemed to be spinning out of control, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more going on than what met the eye.
