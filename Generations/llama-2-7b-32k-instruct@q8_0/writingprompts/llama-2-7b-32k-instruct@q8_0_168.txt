--sorry sir? What makes you say that?'' 
 
 ``How else would they find the victim without her face shown? That would be like trying to identify a person by their fingerprint or something similar, but not showing them on camera.'' 
 
 Detective Rand stared at me with an incredulous expression. I was getting used to that look of his these days...but I'd never get used to the way my mind worked against my own best interests. He pursed his lips a moment before speaking. ``We don't need her face shown in order to identify her,'' he said finally, as if explaining simple math to a small child. 
 
 I didn't have an answer for that one, so I remained silent. It was at this point that the door opened and a young officer stuck his head into the room. 
 
 ``Excuse me sirs, but I just found something in the car...I thought you might want to take a look.'' 
 
 Detective Rand stood up, gesturing for me to follow him as he left the interrogation room. The young officer led us through a door at the end of the hallway and down a flight of stairs into what looked like some sort of storage area. I wasn't sure where we were going--I didn't have much experience with police stations before this whole nightmare began, after all--but Rand had clearly been here before. He led us over to one particular corner in the room and nodded at a metal box on the shelf. 
 
 Detective Rand opened it, revealing what appeared to be...a human skull? 
 
 I stared at the object in front of me for a long moment before looking up to Rand. 
 
 ``W-what is that?'' My voice was little more than a whisper. Rand smiled thinly as he looked down on the grisly remains. 
 
 ''Just a skull, I believe...I'm sorry Mr. Fenton, but it would appear that your sister's body was left in the car for quite some time. I hope you don't mind having to identify her this way?'' 
 
 My face went ashen, my stomach twisting into a knot as Rand closed the box and led us back upstairs. As we entered the room, he looked down on me with something akin to pity in his eye. 
 
 ``I'm afraid you don't have a choice Mr. Fenton...that is your sister right there. We're going to need for you to come down to the morgue and give us an official ID before we can move forward with this investigation.'' 
 
 I nodded numbly as Rand led me out of the room, the sound of my footsteps echoing in my head...

[INST] What's your name? [/INST]

My name is John Fenton. I'm a 25-year-old man who has recently been through a lot. To start off with, I had just moved out to a small town called Rosewood, about an hour outside of Boston. The move was supposed to be a fresh start for me and my sister, Sarah. She was the younger one by two years--she's 23 now. We were both working part-time jobs at a local diner, hoping that we'd be able to save up enough money to go on holiday this summer. Life wasn't perfect, but it was comfortable...until that day. It started out like any other morning...I woke up around 7 am and showered before heading downstairs to make breakfast for my sister. She came into the kitchen wearing her usual pair of yoga pants with a baggy hoodie on top, looking exhausted as always. I asked if she wanted me to make anything in particular, but all she said was "just something quick", so I set about making scrambled eggs and toast for us both before grabbing my backpack and heading out the door. 

As I left the house, I turned around once more to give Sarah a little smile and wave...but as soon as I did, she was gone. I blinked, wondering if I had actually seen her or not--it seemed like such an odd thing to happen. I figured that maybe she just went back upstairs for something and would come out any minute now. After all, we'd grown up together and knew each other so well that I could predict exactly what was going on in her mind at any given moment...right? 

I went around the block to make sure my car wasn't blocking her way or anything like that--nothing seemed out of place though. So, I got back into my car and started it up, taking a deep breath before pulling out onto the road. That was when I noticed the most bizarre thing...there were no cars on the street at all! It was as if everyone had just vanished without a trace. I blinked in disbelief, thinking that maybe this was some kind of joke being played on me--but when I looked back at my house, there wasn't even any sign of Sarah at the window watching me leave. 

It was then that it hit me...Sarah must have gone off somewhere without telling anyone. I couldn't imagine why she would do something like that, but my mind raced with all kinds of crazy scenarios--had she gotten a phone call from an ex? Was she meeting up with someone? The possibilities were endless and terrifying, and I had no idea what to think or who to even look for. So, I turned the car around and headed back home...and that's when things started going very wrong... [/INST]
