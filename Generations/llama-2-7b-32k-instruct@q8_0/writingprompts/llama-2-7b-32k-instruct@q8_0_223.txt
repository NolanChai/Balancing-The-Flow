makes them come out one by one, take turns eating, and then puts them back into their cells. He also plays mind games with each person while in the room and talks about how they are going to die. He doesn't let anyone see any other people though so it is hard for them to know whats going on until the end. 
 
 When its your turn, you will have two options:
a) Do as the Alien says and do whatever he wants to make him happy in exchange of letting you out of the cage. 
b) Try to escape and run for it. You will be given a few minutes to figure how to get out before the Alien comes back. If you manage to find an exit or an opening, you'll be able to leave but not without the Alien chasing you down with his laser gun.



1/30The Alien holds you and makes you eat some food for now. He asks you what your name is and you tell him. Then he takes a picture of you standing in front of the cage to keep as memory. After that, he tells you that there are 6 other people in the room with you. The door will be open in about 2 minutes. You have exactly 50 seconds to decide what to do next.
1/30a) Run away and hide behind some boxes (behind a partition). If you find an exit, run for it. If not, stay still until the Alien leaves the room and then sneak out as fast as possible. Make sure you don't get shot by his gun!
b) Try to talk your way out of this. Tell him that he can do whatever he wants with you but you will tell all the people in the world what happened if he doesn't let you go. You know a lot about his business and how he makes money so he should be interested to hear all these secrets.
c) Tell him you have some valuable information, especially on other aliens like him who are also running illegal businesses on Earth. Offer to trade this info for your freedom. 
d) Do not move or say anything. The Alien will kill you without a second thought if he finds out that you're lying and tricking him in order to escape!
1/30c) You decide to stay calm and just tell him the truth about his business, which is that he's killing children and harvesting them like cattle. The only reason he can do this is because no one knows what goes on down here so he feels protected from getting caught. This way you hope he will let you go in order to protect himself, but if he kills you either way you die trying to expose him and his horrible act.
1/30c) The Alien gets angry at the fact that you have insulted him and all of his fellow alien friends, but he also knows that what you say is true. He can't help it if people know too much about him so he lets you go and hopes no one will come back for revenge anytime soon.
1/30c) The Alien laughs at your comment because you are right - there isn't anyone who knows what goes on down here! He does have the upper hand, but luckily for you, that also means he doesn't have to be completely honest. After all, no one will ever know about his dirty little secret anyway so he might as well just let you go and pretend like nothing happened. 
1/30c) The Alien gets furious at your comment, because that is not what he wants people to think about him! He tells you that he can tell people that you were a raving madman in order to make it seem like you were the one who was crazy and trying to extort information out of him. People will believe whatever he says, so he won't have any problems dealing with your accusations and threats. The Alien then tells you to sit down again so he can continue eating his dinner.
1/30a) You decide it is time to run away. You manage to sneak past the boxes without getting shot by the Alien, who is too busy eating. Just as you think you are out of the room and free, the alien notices your escape attempt and shoots his gun at you from behind! 
1/30b) He tells you that he can't let you go but will let you out if you do whatever he wants to make him happy. You don't have to kill anyone or eat anyone, just do what he asks you to and no harm will come to you. 
1/30a) After you finish eating, the Alien goes over to his computer and types in a few commands before coming back to get you again. He shows you some pictures of the children that were harvested earlier that day. This time he doesn't want you to just look at them - he wants you to pick one child and tell him which one is your favorite!

1/30a) The Alien eats for a while before asking if you have anything more to say. You can either eat some more or try and think of something else you would like to do in the cage that would please him so he will let you go. 
1/30b) He tells you that you are going to die because he has no use for you any longer and there is nothing you can do about it. Then he sends you back into your cage to think about what life without freedom means to you before killing you tomorrow morning at sunrise. 
1/30c) You tell him that if the children were still alive, they would probably say the same thing. That is how humans are treated when their organs are harvested for a living person - they are kept alive as long as possible but eventually killed so the other person can live longer and have a better life.

You tell him that the same will happen to you if he doesn't let you go now. 
1/30a) After some time, the Alien finally lets you out of your cage. He makes you say you love him before you are able to leave and he tells you to never speak of what happened here again or else you will die painfully!  

[INST] The Alien holds you and asks if you know how his business works, knowing that no one knows about it yet but the whole world will find out soon. He can't let people find out because he is an alien who doesn't want to be noticed by humans so he decides to kill everyone in this basement with his laser gun and erase all traces of what happened here. 
He tells you that there are six other people down here and he will bring them up one by one so they can eat food together before killing them all at the same time after they have finished. You don't know why you were chosen to be the first person brought out, but he says it has something to do with your special talents. 
You are scared because you now realize what will happen if this alien kills you since you can't tell anyone about his horrible act and everyone will just assume that these people have gone missing without a trace. He doesn't seem to be able to hear or speak, so it seems like he is a robot at first glance. The Alien makes you eat food for now before asking your name again and taking a picture of you standing in front of the cage.

1/30a) You decide to escape while the alien is occupied with eating food. You find a small opening in the wall behind him that leads to an exit. As soon as he turns around to face you, you run for it and make it out of there before
