oup with a knife anyway; I won one with a pen. So now there is a peace between the two of us, and we are allies against anyone else who tries to hurt our people.

I am the Sentinel Prime for the Outsiders now, just like I was back in the days of my home planet. But things have changed so much since then: the world has become smaller, there are more technologies that can kill us with a thought or two, and our people have moved from their traditional homes to cities where they live side by side with humans who don't understand them at all. And still we find each other and fight together, because we know what it means to be an Outsider, and we are always brothers in arms .

I am so glad I could take up my pen again and write about the adventures of these two soldiers on Earth who become friends. It has been such a good experience for me to write this series that I have decided to keep writing it! I hope you will enjoy reading it too, and maybe even see some things from our own history in it.

Love,   Grayson   
P.S. Please don't tell anyone about this letter; we don't want anybody trying to kill us for saying these things out loud. But if they do come for me or you because of what I wrote here, then let them know that it was worth it to have written the truth!

Dear Sirs,

I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for allowing me to take up my pen once again. As one who has served as a soldier and leader in our people's history, I have found it to be an incredible experience to chronicle the adventures of these two soldiers on Earth who become friends.

In writing this series, I have drawn upon my own experiences from our shared past and have sought to weave them into a tale that is both exciting and informative. I believe that in doing so, I have created a work that not only entertains but also educates the reader about the struggles and triumphs of our people throughout history.

As a result of this endeavor, I am proud to say that I have been able to capture the essence of what it means to be an Outsider and to portray our shared heritage in a way that is both respectful and engaging. It has been an honor to do so, and I hope that my readers will feel the same sense of pride and connection to our history that I have experienced while writing this series.

In closing, I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity. I am committed to continuing to write this series and look forward to sharing more adventures with the reader in future installments.

Sincerely,
Grayson Sentinel Prime   Outsider-Human Alliance
