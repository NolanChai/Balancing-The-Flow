I was already knee deep in the blood of my brethren. 

A story that begins with the protagonist being deeply immersed in the blood of their people suggests a sense of loss, violence, and death. The phrase "knee deep" implies that the protagonist is engulfed or submerged in this bloody state to the point where they are physically unable to move forward. This could be a metaphor for the protagonist feeling trapped or stuck in their current situation. 

The fact that the protagonist was engaged in battle with an army, and that they had better guns than their own troops, further suggests a sense of unequal power dynamics and oppression. The protagonist may be feeling helpless and overwhelmed by the sheer force of the enemy army's weapons and numbers. 

The mention of "the Outsiders" adds an extra layer of complexity to the story. The term "Outsiders" could refer to a variety of things, such as outsiders in the sense of people who are not part of one's own community or society, or it could also be a reference to the idea of "outsiders" being those who do not belong or fit in. In this context, the Outsiders may represent an external force that is causing harm and violence against the protagonist's people. 

Overall, the opening sentence of this story suggests a sense of loss, violence, and conflict between opposing forces. The protagonist's deep immersion in their own people's blood adds a layer of symbolism and imagery that suggests a strong connection to their community and identity, as well as a willingness to defend it against outsiders. 

The phrase "but they had better guns than my army did" implies that the protagonist's forces were not equipped or trained effectively enough to defeat the Outsiders. This may be a metaphor for the protagonist feeling powerless in the face of an opposing force, and it also suggests a lack of resources or support from within their own community. 

The phrase "I did n't win" implies that the protagonist did not emerge victorious in the battle, but it could also suggest a sense of defeat and loss on a personal level. The protagonist may feel like they have failed in their duty to protect their people from harm. This sense of loss is reinforced by the reference to being "knee deep" in blood, which suggests an immersion or submergence that is difficult to escape from. 

Overall, the opening sentence of this story sets up a tone of violence, oppression, and struggle between opposing forces, with the protagonist feeling powerless and overwhelmed by the sheer might of their enemy army's weapons and numbers. The use of metaphorical language and imagery adds depth to the story and suggests a strong connection to identity and community. 

The narrator's statement that they would have killed the Outsiders if they had better guns implies that they felt a sense of revenge or anger towards their opponents, but were unable to do so due to their own army's lack of resources or training. This suggests a feeling of frustration and helplessness in the face of an unfair fight.
