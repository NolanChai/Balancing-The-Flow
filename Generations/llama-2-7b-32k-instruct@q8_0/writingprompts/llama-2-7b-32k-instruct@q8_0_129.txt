ountary that had seen better days, but still thrived underneath its humble title. He made it out from the city limits and took a turn down an unfamiliar path leading him towards the old mining colony. As he approached the entrance to the area he heard voices of children playing in the distance.
  
 Theo walked through the abandoned buildings, with a faint light shining at the end of a dim hallway that led him further into the colony's center. A small boy sat near a firepit, his dark brown hair matching his skin color and glowing softly in the firelight. His eyes were closed as he stared at the flames before him, but when Theo spoke to him, they opened and he looked up.
  
 "Young one," he said, kneeling down in front of the boy, "I need to speak with someone who knows something about this place." He smiled kindly at the child's closed eyes as if he was praying or meditating. Theo waited patiently while his words sunk in before asking again, "Are you sure no one is here?"
  
 The boy nodded slowly and pointed towards a small shack nearby. It had been made out of old scraps of fabric and leather with a roof of wood and fabric thrown together as if it would hold back any rain or wind that came from the outside. Theo walked to this shed and knocked lightly before opening the door and going in.
  
 Inside the shed was an older man, sitting in a chair with his eyes closed. He wore a loose white shirt and black pants that had been patched up at the knees. His face bore lines of weariness and wisdom as Theo approached him softly. "Hello," he said kindly, holding out his hand for the old man to shake, which he did.
  
 The young boy looked on with a confused expression until the old man told him to go home. After Theo left the shed the child sighed and closed his eyes again as if it had all just been a dream.

Theo Cullins walked the old streets of Valia, his small town in the land of Khalhalla. It was a small mining and fishing vountary that had seen better days, but still thrived underneath its humble title. He made it out from the city limits and took a turn down an unfamiliar path leading him towards the old mining colony. As he approached the entrance to the area he heard voices of children playing in the distance.

"Young one," Theo said gently, looking at the boy with soft affection, "I'm sorry to trouble you like this, but I am desperate for answers." He looked back and forth between the child and the old man as if he was unsure of what to do next. He couldn't tell if they were in some sort of conspiracy or not. After all, the boy had no reason to lie about anything, did he? 
  
 The young boy stared at the ground with a hint of sadness in his eyes as he thought on what to say. Theo watched him carefully and saw that something was troubling the child deeply. When the boy finally opened his mouth again it was only because he knew he had no choice.

"I've been waiting here since they left," he said, looking up at Theo with an expression of despair mixed with fear. "He didn't mean to leave me like that, but I have nowhere else to go." He looked back down and hugged himself tightly, burying his face into the soft fabric of his clothing as if trying to hide away from the cold world around him.
  
 Theo listened intently as the boy spoke, feeling a deep sense of sorrow wash over him. It was clear that this child had been through much suffering and hardship for someone so young. He could not leave the boy in such a state, so he reached out his hand to the boy and helped him back up.
  
 "I'll help you," he said with conviction, "I'll find your family." Theo walked over to the old man who was still sitting there quietly watching them both. He spoke softly but firmly to him, making it clear that this boy needed their help. The two of them left the shed together and set off into the night, searching for answers.
  
 They made their way back through the abandoned buildings as they had come and stopped in front of the old mining colony's main entrance once again. It was just a small gate that had been built to keep out unwanted visitors, but Theo walked right up to it with his head held high. He knocked loudly on the gate with an assured confidence, ready for anything that came next.
  
 "Open up," he called, "we're looking for information about a family who lived here once." There was a pause before the gate opened and a man stepped out, wearing a black mask over his face. He looked down at Theo and the boy with an expression of confusion.
  
 "What do you want?" he asked, his voice sounding unfamiliar to the ears of both Theo and the young boy.
  
"We're looking for information about a family who used to live here," Theo said again, trying to explain as best he could why they were there. The man looked at them both curiously before finally nodding slowly and stepping aside, gesturing for them to come in. 
  
Theo led the boy inside, feeling a strange sense of hope wash over him despite how little he knew about this place or these people. They walked further into the colony as they followed the man's instructions until they came across an old wooden door with a small sign hanging above it that read "Jasper Family."
  
 Theo knocked on the door and waited for what felt like an eternity before he finally heard footsteps approaching. It was a young girl who opened the door, her hair pulled back in a tight bun as if she had been rushing to open it. Her face was filled with anxiety at first, but when she saw Theo and the boy standing outside of her house, her expression softened slightly.
  
 "Can I help you?" she asked cautiously, trying to figure out who these people were that had just showed up on her doorstep. 
  
Theo explained their situation as best he could, telling her about the young boy and his family that was lost. She listened intently as if she wanted to believe every word of it but couldn't quite bring herself to trust them fully. He watched as her face became more and more troubled with each passing moment.
  
 "I don't know what I can do for you," she said after a long pause, looking at the young boy who stood silently by her side. She shook her head slowly before closing the door in front of them both, leaving Theo to wonder if he had done any good or not." 
  
Theo looked back at the boy, feeling as though all hope was lost. He could see the sadness and despair written all over his face as he watched the girl shut the door in their faces. "It's okay," Theo said gently, trying to comfort him as best as he could, "I still believe we will find them."
  
The young boy looked up at him with a hint of hope in his eyes and nodded slowly before turning away from Theo and heading back towards the shed. It was clear that he had been through much worse than what they had witness
