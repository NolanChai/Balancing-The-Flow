"Merci," the waiter said as he placed the dishes on the table in front of her.

The girl turned to face him and flashed him a bright smile. "Bonjour," she replied warmly before continuing. "I'm sorry, I don't speak much French, but I would love some more bread please." Her words were slow and deliberate, as if she were speaking to a child or someone who was hard of hearing.

The waiter nodded, impressed by her politeness and effort to communicate in his native tongue. He poured some water into her glass before returning it to the table. "Vous etes tres gentille," he said with a soft accent. "Of course, my dear, I would be happy to bring you more bread."

As she waited for him to return with the fresh bread, she turned her attention back to the window. She was transfixed by the view of the city lights sparkling against the night sky. She watched them twinkle and dance, mesmerized by their beauty. "C'est magnifique," she murmured to herself as a gentle breeze rustled through the open window.

The waiter returned with the bread and placed it on her plate. He hesitated for a moment before speaking again. "Voulez-vous une autre boisson?" he asked, gesturing toward her empty water glass.

The girl's gaze remained fixed on the city lights as she slowly shook her head no. She was content with what she had. The waiter nodded and smiled, his eyes sparkling with amusement at her refusal to indulge. "Va bien," he said softly before leaving the table to attend to other customers.

As the night wore on, the girl remained lost in thought, gazing out the window and savoring every bite of bread. She was content to be alone, enjoying her meal and the beauty of the city skyline.
