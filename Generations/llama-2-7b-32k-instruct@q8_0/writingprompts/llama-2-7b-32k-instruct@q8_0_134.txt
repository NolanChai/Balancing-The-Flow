1 rat poked its head out of the sacks, peering at me curiously. '

With that, I strolled back to my cottage in the woods with an uneasy feeling in my gut knowing what would happen next''.

In a nutshell, Oryx and Crake is about: A group of people living in the wilderness who are at odds with each other over what they should do next. They are trying to survive while also trying to find ways to make things better for themselves and their community. They have many different opinions on what to do, and some of them are not getting along very well because of this.

'But what about the story? Is it good?' You may be wondering. Let me tell you...
I would say that Oryx and Crake has a rather interesting plot but also has an extremely slow paced book with boring characters, no romance, no adventure, not even any action scenes, it is mostly filled with information and descriptions that are quite confusing. The story mainly focuses on the perspective of Snowman who is basically just living out in the wild trying to survive while he tries to figure out how the world got this way and what happened to all the people from before. It doesn't really show you much about him as a character, so it's hard to connect with him or even like him for that matter.
The story also takes place in many different locations which can be confusing at times but overall there is not much of a plot or any exciting events to keep the reader interested. I would recommend reading this if you are really into science fiction and don't mind long descriptions, otherwise it may be too boring for your tastes.

Overall, Oryx and Crake has an okay story but is not very interesting or entertaining to read because of the lack of action, romance, excitement, etc. The characters are also quite unlikable and difficult to connect with. If you're looking for a good sci-fi novel that is easy to read and enjoyable, I would recommend checking out Ready Player One instead.

In conclusion, Oryx and Crake gets 2 stars from me because it has some interesting parts but overall falls short in entertaining the reader with its lack of romance, adventure, excitement, etc. It's also quite confusing at times due to the large amounts of information and descriptions that aren't always easy to follow or make sense out of. If you're looking for a good sci-fi novel to read, I would recommend checking out Ready Player One instead.
