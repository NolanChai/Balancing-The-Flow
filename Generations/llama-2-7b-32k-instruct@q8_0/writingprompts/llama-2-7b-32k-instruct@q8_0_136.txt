The birthday boy stands next to his chair with a plate of leftovers piled on it. He watches them through the sliding glass door, sipping a glass of red wine while he waits for them to go inside after dark. It's only been three weeks since he moved in, but they all seem to know him well already. They come over every night before dinner and sit around his patio, talking about their day or discussing the news. He watches them with a fond smile, wishing he could be out there too.
