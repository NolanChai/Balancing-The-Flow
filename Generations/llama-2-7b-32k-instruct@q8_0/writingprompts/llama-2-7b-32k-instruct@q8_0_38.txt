Sebastian and his companions were ready. They took a deep breath, closed their eyes and imagined that they were at the destination before opening them again to see where they were transported. It was 6:30pm on November 28th, 1954. They had landed on an empty street in the small town of Arcata, California.

As Sebastian and his companions took in their surroundings, they noticed a group of people standing outside a building on the opposite side of the road. One of them was staring directly at them, but when he saw that they were watching him, he quickly looked away and joined the others as if nothing had happened.

"What do you think?" Sebastian asked his companions. "Should we approach them and ask for directions? Or should we just keep moving and try to find out where we are?" 

One of Sebastian's companions, a young man named Jack, was the first to respond. "I don't know," he said. "But I think it might be best not to draw too much attention to ourselves just yet." 

Another companion, a woman named Lizzie, agreed with Jack. "We need to get our bearings before we do anything else," she said. "It would be dangerous for us if these people noticed that we're strangers in town and started asking questions." 

Sebastian considered their advice and decided that they should follow it. They waited until the group of people had moved out of sight before crossing the road and starting down an empty street to try and find a place to rest for the night. As they walked, Sebastian couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He knew that he was in God's hands, but it felt like God was trying to stop him from completing his mission.

It had been a long time since Sebastian had experienced such intense feelings. The closer he got to the present day, the more difficult it seemed to be for him to control his emotions. He knew that he couldn't let his fears and doubts get the best of him, though. God was with him, and He would guide him to the end of his journey.

As they walked, Sebastian began to think about what had brought them here. It seemed like only yesterday that he was in the year 1870, but now he was in the present day, just a few months away from his final destination. Sebastian knew that time travel could be dangerous, but he also knew that God was with him and would protect him.

As they approached an empty building, Sebastian stopped in front of it and looked at his companions. "We should rest here for the night," he said. "It's safe, and we can get a good look at the surrounding area." 

His companions agreed, and they all sat down on the sidewalk outside the building to rest. Sebastian closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to clear his mind of all thoughts. He knew that he had to stay focused if he was going to complete his mission successfully.

As Sebastian sat there, he felt a presence behind him. He turned around and saw a man standing in the shadows, watching him. Sebastian couldn't help but feel a sense of fear as he looked at the stranger. The man was tall and thin, with dark hair and a beard that seemed to go on forever.

"Can I help you?" Sebastian asked, trying to sound confident despite his fear. 

The man smiled and stepped out into the light. "Yes, I can help you," he said. "My name is Doctor Jake Elder, and I'm here to help you."

Sebastian felt a sense of relief wash over him as he heard Doctor Elder's words. He knew that he needed all the help that he could get if he was going to succeed in his mission. 

"How do you know my name?" Sebastian asked, trying to keep his voice steady. 

Doctor Elder chuckled and patted his pocket. "I've been expecting you," he said. "I've been waiting for someone like you for a very long time." 

Sebastian couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement as Doctor Elder spoke. He knew that he was in the presence of someone who could help him, and he felt a sense of hope for the first time in what seemed like an eternity.

"I have something important to show you," Doctor Elder said, gesturing towards the building behind them. Sebastian followed him inside and saw a group of people standing around a large machine that was covered in glowing lights. 

"What's happening here?" Sebastian asked as he walked over to the machine. 

Doctor Elder smiled and chuckled again. "I can tell you what I think is happening, but I don't know for sure," he said. "This device is called a time machine, and it has brought you here from the future." 

Sebastian felt his heart race as Doctor Elder spoke. He had suspected that the group of people outside was somehow involved in his mission, but he never imagined that they would be using a time machine to bring him here. 

"How did you know I was coming?" Sebastian asked, trying to keep his voice steady. 

Doctor Elder chuckled again and patted his pocket again. "I have my ways," he said with a smile. "Now, let's get started."

With that, Doctor Elder turned on the machine and took Sebastian by the hand. Together they stepped into the time machine, and as they did, Sebastian felt a surge of excitement and adrenaline rush through his body. 

He knew that he was about to take his final step towards completing his mission, and he couldn't wait to see what God had in store for him next.

As the time machine whirred to life, Sebastian felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that God was with him, and that He would guide him safely through whatever came next. With a final glance at Doctor Elder, Sebastian closed his eyes and took a deep breath as he prepared for the most important journey of his life.
