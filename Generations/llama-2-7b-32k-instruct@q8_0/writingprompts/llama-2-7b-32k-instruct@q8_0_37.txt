You are correct, I apologize for the oversight. Here is a revised version of the story:

Bilbo sits at his favorite armchair, eagerly awaiting tea time. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small object - a kettle! Bilbo smiles to himself, knowing that he will soon be sipping on a delicious cup of tea. He takes the kettle and places it on the stove, filling it with fresh water from the tap. Then, he lights the gas burner underneath the kettle, watching as the water begins to bubble and steam. As the kettle comes to a boil, Bilbo carefully measures out tea leaves into a teacup, adding just the right amount of sugar and milk to his brew. With a satisfied sip, Bilbo savors every moment of his warm, steaming cup of tea, feeling content and relaxed as he sips.
