I never liked my desk job because of my social anxiety disorder. It is important for me to look like a regular person and not stand out too much. However, it can be challenging to blend in when you have superpowers. For example, I once went on a date with a woman who had the power to heal people by touching them. She was trying to get to know me better, but I was so nervous that she could sense my anxiety and became scared.

As for looking normal, I try to keep to myself as much as possible and avoid situations where I might stand out too much. When I go out in public, I make sure to dress plainly and wear minimal jewelry or accessories. I also use a computer program that allows me to blend in with my surroundings so people do n't notice me as easily.

Despite these challenges, I am grateful for the opportunity to have a desk job and keep up appearances. It gives me a sense of normalcy and allows me to feel like I am contributing to society in some way. However, it would be nice to have more freedom and not feel so restricted by my anxiety all the time.
