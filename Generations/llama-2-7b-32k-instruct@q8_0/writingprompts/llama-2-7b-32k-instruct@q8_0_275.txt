He moved his hand upwards to reach underneath her knee, brushing his thumb against her skin as he did so . His other fingers gently held her hips and she inhaled deeply when they pressed into her body.

She smelt him again; the scent of sunshine, windswept hair, sea salt and earth clinging to him from their day at the beach. “ Jacob it feels nice but I really can’t stay for too long.”

“Anna,” his voice was a low growl and she felt it rumble through her bones . He leaned closer until their faces were mere inches apart, his lips brushing hers softly . She shuddered against him before he pulled back, staring into her eyes. “Anna you’re mine.”

Anna was struck dumb for a moment; she had been ready to tell Jacob that she loved him but now with this declaration, it seemed impossible that he would feel the same way. She still couldn't believe what he just said to her . The two of them sat like this, staring at each other for the longest time until Anna finally felt something inside her melt and she knew she was his too .

"I don't want anyone else," Jacob admitted softly, "ever."  He took a breath, looking her in the eye as he said, "I love you."  Anna closed her eyes, taking a moment to process this. She had been thinking of him for years and finally getting him back meant more than she could ever have imagined.

"Me too," she whispered.

Jacob's smile was full of joy as he took her hand in his. "You're my home."

Anna knew then that Jacob was it; the man she would spend forever with . She had spent so long missing him, only wanting to be with him again but now that they were together, nothing else mattered anymore.

"I love you too," she breathed softly as her heart swelled with a deep, all consuming love for Jacob. "You're my home."  She wrapped her arms around his waist, leaning against the warmth of his body . It was in this moment that Anna realized what it was to truly be happy and she knew no one could ever take him away from her again.

"You sure about all this?" Jacob asked quietly. "It's just... I mean, you haven't been with anyone for so long."  He paused, looking at the space between them before he continued. "I don't want to push you into anything but... if there was a way we could be together..."

Anna smiled up at him, her heart full of love and warmth . She knew Jacob had meant only the best for her and that's all she wanted in return .

"You know I have always been yours," Anna whispered into his ear.  Her voice was so low it barely reached him but he could feel the truth behind each word nonetheless.  "I will love you forever."  

[INST] what happens next? [/INST]

Anna and Jacob's moment was cut short when they heard a knock on the door. Anna quickly put her dress back on and smoothed out her hair before answering it.

"Hey, I'm home!" 

Jacob peeked around the corner to see who it was and smiled when he saw his son standing there. "Hello, Jude."

Anna stepped aside to let Jacob take over . "Jude we've got some news for you," Jacob began as he ushered his son inside.  "We're getting married!"  He held Anna's hand tightly as they both looked at their son with excited smiles on their faces.

"Wow, that's amazing!" Jude exclaimed, beaming from ear to ear .  "I knew you two were perfect for each other." 

Anna and Jacob chuckled at his words as they all sat down together in the living room. The three of them talked about their plans and how they were going to make it work with Jude still living at home. Anna was happy that she could share this special moment with her son, who had been there for so much of her life.

As they sat together, Jacob's phone began to ring. He smiled as he answered it .  "Hey, Mom! How are you?" Jacob asked cheerfully, his voice filled with love and warmth. "I'm doing great, just got back from the beach. What are you up to?"

Anna listened closely as Jacob spoke, her heart swelling with joy at hearing the sound of her son's voice . She knew he was happy and that gave her even more reason to be excited about the future ahead. 

"I miss you guys so much," Jacob said suddenly before hanging up. He looked over at Anna and smiled. "I think I'll go back in a couple of weeks. How does that sound?" 

Anna's heart skipped a beat at his words . She knew she would miss her son terribly but the thought of being able to share this moment with him was too good to pass up. 

"That sounds great," Anna smiled back, "We'll be waiting for you."  

[INST] what happens after that? [/INST]

As Jacob left, Anna sat down on the couch, feeling a mixture of emotions. She was excited and happy to have her son back but she also knew she would miss him terribly while he was gone. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as she let out a sigh. 

That's when Jude came up behind her, his arms wrapping around her waist. "You okay?" 

Anna turned to face him, feeling the warmth of his body against hers . "Yeah, just thinking about Jacob," she admitted softly. 

"I know it will be hard but he'll be back soon," Jude assured her, brushing a strand of hair out of her face with his fingers. He leaned in closer, pressing a kiss to her temple before stepping away and taking off his shirt . "And then we can all go on holiday together." 

Anna chuckled at her son's optimism as she watched him undress . She loved this time of day when they could just be themselves, no expectations or responsibilities. Jude was always there to make her smile and it was in these moments that she felt truly alive. 

"I can't wait," Anna whispered, her voice barely above a whisper as she watched him dance around the room . 

Jude twirled around, his arms spread wide like wings, "We're going to have the best holiday ever!" he declared before bouncing on the spot. 

Anna laughed, her heart filled with joy at the sight of her son so full of life and energy . She knew that no matter what happened in the future, she would always be grateful for these moments spent together as a family. 

As Jude finished his dance routine, he came up to Anna and hugged her tightly, his face pressed against her chest. "I love you so much," he whispered into her ear before letting go. 

Anna closed her eyes, holding onto him as she felt a lump in her throat grow . She loved him too and it was moments like this that made the world seem like a better place to be in. 

Jude stepped away from her, his expression serious for a moment before he grinned again and declared, "I'm going to find Jacob!"  And with that, he was gone, leaving Anna alone once more but feeling contented nonetheless.

As she sat there, Anna thought about how much had changed in the last few months. She had finally found her way back to the life she always wanted and she couldn't be happier about it. She knew that no matter what happened in the future, Jacob would always be at the center of her heart and soul, forever her home.

And with that thought, Anna knew she was ready for whatever came next because with Jacob by her side, she could face anything head on and come out stronger than ever before.

The End.
