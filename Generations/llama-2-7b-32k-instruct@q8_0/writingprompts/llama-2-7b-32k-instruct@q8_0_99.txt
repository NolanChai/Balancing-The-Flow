anties from my room and put them in my backpack. I then went to the stairwell door and pushed through it. Once out there I saw a woman grab her 9 year old daughter by the hand. The woman had a look of fear on her face as she led her child down the stairs. I knew that something was wrong, and followed them outside into the hallway. I then realized why the fire alarm went off; they were not just evacuating because of smoke in the building, there really was a fire. The woman continued to lead her daughter around the side of the building as I chased after them. Once we made it out on the sidewalk and down the street from the school, people started gathering around asking questions. My mother came running over and grabbed me and my sisters arms, saying "We need to get away from here." My mom then led us all through a parking lot of cars that were in the way to reach the other sidewalk. There was a small group of people on this sidewalk who watched as we ran past. As I ran, it got harder and harder to breathe because of how fast my heart was beating. Once we finally reached the other sidewalk, I saw my mom grab her phone from her purse and call someone. She started screaming into the receiver and asking questions. Her voice sounded very frantic. I knew something bad happened at our school, but I didn't know what it was until later that night when my dad got home from work and told us all of the details.

That day had been a normal day for me. It started like any other morning. My alarm went off at 6:30 in the morning, and I woke up with excitement because school was out for the summer. I spent most of the day sleeping late and eating junk foods. Around 11 am my parents got home from work so I decided to go downstairs and play video games while they relaxed on their computers. My mom then told me that there was a fire in our building, and that we had to evacuate the building right away. She said it sounded like people were still inside of the burning part of our school and needed help getting out. So I grabbed my backpack and took off running downstairs with my mother. As soon as we reached the stairwell, I saw a woman grab her 9 year old daughter by the hand and lead her down the stairs as fast as she could. She had a look of fear on her face.

I went to a school in New York City for about six years. I have some memories of this place; however, this is one specific memory. It was June 16th, 2010 and it was just after 9:30 am when we heard the fire alarm go off. We evacuated our classroom quickly and everyone went outside to wait for the principal to give us instructions. While I was standing in a large group with my classmates, we saw smoke coming from behind the school building. The principal came over the speaker and told us that there was actually a fire in the building. He said someone had called it in about ten minutes prior, but they were still looking for people in the building. We were all ordered to evacuate the area immediately. The students were then put into groups and taken to different schools around the neighborhood while parents were contacted. Some of us stayed at one school for a few hours until the fire was out and the buildings were deemed safe. That morning my classmates and I were pretty scared, but fortunately no one was injured
