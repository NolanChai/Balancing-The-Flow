She walks with her head down as if she's afraid the ground might open up beneath her and swallow her. Her short, red-colored hair illuminated in the sunlight. She looks up for a second, scans her surroundings to see if anyone is watching. Once satisfied that no one is around, she bends down and picks something off the ground and starts walking towards me. I can't tell what it is from where I am sitting, but I know it will be gone before long.
