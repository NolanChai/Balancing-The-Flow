oundings and continues to walk forward with determination.

"Are you coming? I really need to get going." She says as if she's been waiting here all day. 

Her eyes look like they haven't seen the sun in months. They're darker than usual, bloodshot from staring at a computer screen for so long. Her lips are thin and taut. I can hear her footsteps growing fainter as she walks away. She looks back over her shoulder once more before she disappears into the distance.

The wind carries a whiff of coffee, smoke and exhaust fumes through the park. A man sits on a bench. He's sitting with his back to me but I can hear him coughing. The sound is sickly and wet. It echoes off the buildings that surround us.

She didn't even look back once more, no smile or goodbye. She just turned away without a word and continued on her way down the sidewalk as if there was something important waiting for her at the end of it all. I can see where she's going; it's clear from the determined set of her jaw that she knows exactly what she wants.

She doesn't look back once, not even when the sun is setting and the shadows are starting to creep in from the east. She doesn't slow down or speed up. Her body moves with a rhythm all its own as it carries her further and further away from me. I don't think I could walk that fast if my life depended on it.

I watch her leave, wondering what she's running from and where she plans to go. She looks so small from this distance, like a little girl trying to find her way home in the dark. But there's something about her stride, something that tells me she knows exactly where she's going. 

She doesn't seem to notice the world around her as she walks. She's focused on the horizon line of pavement and sky ahead of her. The sun is setting and the shadows are growing longer. Her figure becomes a silhouette against the sky, like a ghost haunting the streets at night.

She doesn't even look back once more before she disappears into the distance, leaving me standing alone in the park, wondering what secrets she's hiding and where she plans to go from here. 

As I sit here watching her disappear into the distance, I can't help but feel a sense of unease. There's something about her movements that seems familiar, like I've seen this before, in a dream maybe? Or was it just a flash of memory from an old movie? The way she moves is so precise, so deliberate, like she knows exactly where she wants to go and how she plans to get there. 

I wonder what secrets she carries with her as she walks away into the night. Is it possible that I've seen this woman before? Or was it just a trick of light and shadow? The way she moves is so fluid, so natural, like she belongs here in this world, even though something about her seems so out of place. 

As I watch her walk away, I can't help but feel a sense of longing. There's something about the way she walks that makes me want to follow her, to see where she goes and what secrets she keeps. But she moves too fast for me, her figure disappearing into the night as quickly as it appeared. 

I sit here watching her go, feeling like I should know her somehow but not quite sure why or from where. The sun sets behind her, casting a warm orange glow over her silhouette against the skyline. She doesn't look back once more before she disappears into the distance, leaving me alone in the park, wondering what secrets she carries with her and where she plans to go next.

She walks with her head down as if she's afraid the ground might open up beneath her and swallow her. Her short, red colored hair illuminated in the sunlight. She looks up for a second, scans her surroundings and continues to walk forward with determination.
