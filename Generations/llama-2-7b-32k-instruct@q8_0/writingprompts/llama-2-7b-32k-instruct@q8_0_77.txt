The girl in the tower   A few years after his father's death, the king summoned his three sons and told them they must leave at once on a journey. He did not tell them where they were going or why. But he said that if they should ever find a beast so ferocious and terrible that no living creature could destroy it, then they would win the kingdom for their own and return in peace. If, however, they failed to conquer the beast, the kingdom would pass to someone else. Then, the king gave his three sons three objects: a rose, an apple, and a golden ball. He told them that if ever they should encounter any difficulty or danger, one of these three tokens would help them out of it, provided they believed in themselves. As soon as he had finished speaking, the brothers left on their quest. The oldest son, handsome Prince Charles, traveled far and wide but could find no beast anywhere. He returned home empty-handed after many years, and told his father that he would never get anything done without his two brothers. After a time, Prince Henry also came back, having gone through many lands to seek the ferocious beast as well. He too found nothing on his quest; however, his was a very different tale. One day, while out riding in his kingdom, he met a beautiful maiden sitting in her tower. She told him that she was imprisoned there by an evil wizard and that only true love's kiss would set her free. Henry looked at the girl and saw that she was indeed very lovely so he said "I will come back tomorrow to marry you," thinking this was a good idea because he could kill two birds with one stone--he would save her from being imprisoned in the tower forever, as well as get himself some nookie. The next day Henry returned, took the maiden to his castle where they were wed and had a very happy life together for many years. As time went on, Prince Edward also journeyed far and wide looking for the ferocious beast of which their father spoke. Finally he too came back home with no success. His brothers thought him to be a fool for not finding the beast because they could not believe that any woman would say "true love's kiss" unless she meant something else, but as time went on, they all forgot about the matter altogether.   A few years later, when the three princes were well into their middle age, a terrible and ferocious beast appeared in the land. It was said that if no one could slay this beast before it destroyed the whole kingdom, then the curse of witchcraft would forever remain upon them. All the people gathered together to fight this new beast and were defeated. Soon thereafter they realized that all three of their brothers had gone on a quest for a ferocious beast; however, none of them had found one. The three princes also remembered that when they first went out on their quests years before, the king had given each of them something special to help them with any difficulty or danger along the way: A rose, an apple and a golden ball. And so, they set off again upon their quests, believing these tokens would indeed lead them to success this time.   Prince Charles traveled far and wide but could find no beast anywhere.
