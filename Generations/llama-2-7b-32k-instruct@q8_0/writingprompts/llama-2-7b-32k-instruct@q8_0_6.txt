ed and there was nowhere to stay tonight. We were at 8000+ ft altitude so no big deal but not much fun trying to find a room. I checked online and there weren't any vacancies in town, for days. So I decided to get up the next morning at sunrise and check again first thing when the hotel websites had their new updates.

After eating breakfast with my sister, who was joining me on this trip, we headed out around 7 am and drove to our first choice of a place to stay in town, called The Lodge. After driving by it for years I knew it was close to the highway so I thought I would try it again.

We arrived about 10 minutes before sunrise and asked at the front desk if they had any rooms available. They did have one room left and we grabbed it. We got in our car, drove away from town to where there was cell service and called a few of the other places we were staying on this trip. As it turned out they all had rooms available that night but weren't advertising them online or on their websites. So we had found ourselves a room for the evening. I guess there was some luck involved too.

I would like to share with you the pictures from our visit here, and tell you about our stay at this beautiful mountain resort. The views are amazing and the staff is friendly and helpful. This place has it all in my opinion. A great location, comfortable rooms and a great restaurant. I highly recommend it if you are ever looking to spend some time in Colorado.

I am going to start with these pictures of our room. The hotel was built about 30 years ago so the furnishings and decor are quite dated but not too bad. What was really nice is that each room has a view of Pikes Peak from their own private deck. We had a balcony off our living room so we could enjoy morning coffee with a great view every day, rain or shine. The bed was comfortable, the sheets and pillows were very soft too.

This was a shot taken through the window in our bathroom of Pikes Peak from inside. They do have some decks with hot tubs but this one is right outside your door. It's a good size so you can fit two people in here comfortably, and I think that's great. There are two sinks also.

I took this picture of the bathroom while standing on our balcony looking at Pikes Peak. If you look closely you can see how tall the building is. The hotel was built right up against a steep hillside so we were quite close to it.

This is another shot taken from our balcony, this time of the parking lot and lower level rooms in front of us.

Here are some pictures from inside the restaurant where we ate breakfast. The views are great here too. I think this was probably my favorite part of staying at this hotel. Eating breakfast out on the deck while watching the sunrise over Pikes Peak is an experience you won't soon forget.

This was taken in the morning while sitting outside. We had a little chocolate cake that we ordered for dessert, it's hard to see but there's a slice in front of the coffee cup. You can see how cloudy the sky is this early morning. The mountain is called "America's Mountain" because Thomas Jefferson and others thought the peak resembled the shape of an American Flag when viewed from the east.

This was taken from another part of our deck, looking over the parking lot at the mountains. They had some wildlife outside too, I think it's a squirrel but maybe you can tell me for sure.

I hope this tour of The Lodge has been helpful and interesting for you. Thanks for following along on my adventure. I have more pictures from our time here that I will show you in another video soon.  [/INST]
