Billions died. It's not like anyone would have minded if an ice age swept over the globe, killing off most of humanity. It was just that no one expected it quite so quickly. And even in the coldest winters of yore, humans had always been able to find food and shelter from the elements. But this? This wasn't even a matter of survival anymore. No, it was simply a question of "Can we go out into public without being murdered?" The temperature hit record lows overnight as snow fell in clumps as large as softballs. It seemed as though an iceberg had been pushed from the Arctic Circle to cover half the continent. Traffic was at a standstill, air travel halted entirely. People were stranded everywhere, and those who hadn't died outright of hypothermia or starvation quickly began to go mad with cabin fever. The roads were too dangerous even for emergency vehicles; most patrol cars were just abandoned alongside the road. Ambulances could not reach patients, fire trucks had nowhere to pump water from, and police cars were frozen in place until spring thawed them out. Even the military was unable to help- they had their own problems dealing with the extreme conditions. The soldiers were stuck in their bases like everyone else, and trying to drive anywhere meant certain death for both passengers and driver alike. There wasn't even a reliable communication network; cell phone networks went down just as quickly as landlines did. And the military certainly couldn't do anything about it- they didn't have the resources to get out into the open, not when every vehicle was frozen solid in place. So everyone was trapped inside their homes or their vehicles while outside was a winter wonderland of white death.
