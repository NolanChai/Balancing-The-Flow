tern of hope for humanity. The oceanic currents shifted drastically as well, causing tsunamis in distant lands that were still warm from summer months before winter came, leading to starvation, violence, disease. 
 
 After the screams began, it was the time of the great plagues. Bubonic and pneumonic, they swept through humanity like a wildfire- the world's population dropped by over 90% in two years. Some survivors banded together to fight these diseases, but they were not strong enough.
 
 And then came the end of times for mankind, when there was no more food to eat or water to drink and the plague ravaged every last human being on Earth. The planet became a lifeless orb once again as it had been before the dawn of time.
 
 This is what you can do with your prompt: 1-Write a short story that starts like this: "It all started when I heard a sound...". 2-Take a different approach to the zombie genre by making them less mindless and more intelligent, creating an environment of fear. 3-Describe the world after the rise of climate change in your prompt using any device you choose (i.e. dystopia).

A: This is what I came up with for the zombie apocalypse prompt: "It all started when I heard a sound... The sound was faint at first, just a slight humming in the distance. But as I listened closer, it grew louder and more menacing. It was unmistakable - the sound of a zombie horde approaching. I knew that we were in trouble."

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has been decimated by an outbreak of zombies. The main character, who remains nameless throughout the story, is one of the few survivors left alive and must navigate this dangerous new world filled with undead creatures. Throughout the story, the reader will learn about the protagonist's struggles, their relationships with other survivors, and how they are coping in a world gone mad. The ending is open-ended, allowing the reader to come up with their own interpretation of what happens next.

A: 1. Short story that starts like this: "It all started when I heard a sound...". 2-Take a different approach to the zombie genre by making them less mindless and more intelligent, creating an environment of fear. 3-Describe the world after the rise of climate change in your prompt using any device you choose (i.e. dystopia).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification on the prompt.

A: Sure, here's an example of a short story that starts with "It all started when I heard a sound..." and takes a different approach to the zombie genre while describing the world after the rise of climate change in dystopian style:
"The sound was like a distant growl, echoing through the darkened streets. It was unmistakable - the sound of a zombie horde approaching. I knew that we were in trouble. We had been living in this city for weeks now, scavenging for food and supplies to stay alive. But with the sun setting and the threat of the undead looming, it was time to make a choice."
"I looked at my group - we were all tired and worn down, but still alive. We had been through so much already: the outbreak, the panic, the loss of everything we knew. But we were survivors. And now, we had a new enemy to face. The sound grew louder, closer. We knew that we couldn't stay here much longer."
"We made our way to the local armory, hoping to find weapons and supplies that would give us a fighting chance against the undead. But as we entered, we were met with a horrifying sight: the shelves were bare, the ammunition depleted, and the survivors gone. It was as if the city had been picked clean by the zombies before we even arrived."
"We knew that our only option now was to retreat to the old underground bunker, which was rumored to have a stockpile of supplies and weapons. But would it be enough? Would we be able to make it out alive?"
"As we made our way through the city's streets, the sound of the zombies grew louder. We could feel their presence all around us, their eyes fixed on our every move. It was a terrifying feeling, knowing that they were just out of sight, waiting for us to make a mistake."
"We finally reached the bunker's entrance, and I took a deep breath before pulling open the heavy door. Inside, it was dark and damp, but we could see that it was stocked with supplies and weapons. We knew that we had a chance now - if we worked together, if we were careful, maybe we could make it out alive."
"We began our journey through the bunker, avoiding the zombies' traps and searching for any useful items or information. It was a long and dangerous process, but we knew that we had to keep going. We had no choice - we were all that was left of humanity, and we had to fight for our survival."
"As we made our way deeper into the bunker, the sound of the zombies grew louder. They were closer than ever before, and we could feel their presence like a rising tide. But we also knew that we had a chance now - with the supplies in front of us, maybe we could make it out alive."
"We finally reached the end of the bunker, where an old computer terminal sat idle. We didn't know what to do - was there any information here that would help us survive? But as we looked at the screen, we saw something that gave us hope."
"It showed a map of the city, and on it were marked the locations of various supplies and weapons. We realized that if we worked together, if we were careful, maybe we could make it out alive. Maybe humanity wasn't completely lost after all."
"We left the bunker, our mission clear: to find the supplies and weapons we needed to survive. We knew that the zombies were closing in on us, but we also knew that we had a chance now - if we worked together, if we were careful, maybe we could make it out alive."
"As we made our way through the city, the sound of the zombies grew louder. But we also felt a sense of purpose now, a determination to survive and rebuild what had been lost. We knew that it wouldn't be easy, but we were ready for the challenge."
"We found what we needed - weapons, supplies, information on how to survive in this new world. We knew that we couldn't stay here forever, but we also knew that we couldn't leave without a fight. We had to make a stand against the undead and try to save as many human lives as possible."
"We fought our way through the city, leaving a trail of zombie bodies in our wake. It was a brutal battle, but we were determined to survive. We knew that it wouldn't be easy, but we were ready for the challenge."
"In the end, we made it out alive - barely. The undead were everywhere, and we had to fight them off at every turn. But we also knew that we had a chance now. We had found supplies and weapons, information on how to survive in this new world. And most importantly, we had each other."
"We set up camp in the outskirts of the city, where it was safe for now. We knew that we couldn't stay here forever, but we also knew that we had a chance now - if we worked together, if we were careful, maybe we could make it out alive."
"We started to rebuild our lives, finding a new normal in this post-apocalyptic world. It wasn't easy, but we were survivors. And we knew that we had to keep fighting - for ourselves, for humanity, and for the future of the world."
"As time passed, we started to see signs of life all around us. Other survivors, families, groups of people who had also made it out alive. We realized that we weren't alone, that there was still hope for humanity. And so, we kept fighting - together, as one."
"We rebuilt society, creating a new world from the ashes of the old. It wasn't easy, but we were survivors. And we knew that we had to keep fighting - for ourselves, for humanity, and for the future of the world."
"And so, we live in this new world now, one where zombies roam the streets and humans must fight for their lives. But we also live in a world where hope still exists - hope that one day, we will be able to live without fear, without danger. Hope that one day, humanity will rise again."
"We may not know how it will all end, but we are ready for the challenge. We are survivors
