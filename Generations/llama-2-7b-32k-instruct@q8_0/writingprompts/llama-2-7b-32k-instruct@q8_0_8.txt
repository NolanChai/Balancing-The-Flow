January first, shoveling snow outside their small sub-urban homes. "How're you doing?," asked Greg. "I'm good," said Phil. "Hi good," said Greg with a grin. "I'm Dad."

Now, the story continues:
Greg continued to shovel while looking at his son and thinking about how he was going to change his life. He had been feeling restless for some time now and wanted to do something meaningful with his life. He knew that he could not stay in this small town forever. He wanted to travel and see the world. 
Phil continued shoveling, but he was not focused on the task at hand. His mind was elsewhere. He was thinking about what it would be like to travel the world. He had always dreamed of visiting far-off places and experiencing new cultures. But he never thought he could make that a reality. 
Suddenly, Greg had an idea. "Phil," he said, "I've been thinking about this for a while now. I want to take you on a trip around the world." 
Phil looked up from his shoveling and stared at his dad in disbelief. He could not believe what he was hearing. "A trip around the world?" he repeated. 
"Yeah, that's right," said Greg with a smile. "We're going to travel to different countries and experience new things together." 
Phil's mind raced with excitement as he thought about all the places they could go. He wanted to visit every country in the world! But he knew that was impossible, so he settled on the idea of starting with a few. 
Greg smiled at his son and continued to shovel. "We'll start with Asia," he said. "I have friends who live there, and I've always wanted to visit." 
Phil nodded eagerly. "Can we go today?" he asked. 
Greg laughed. "No, we'll need some time to plan our trip. But we will be going soon!" 
As they finished shoveling the snow, Greg and Phil hugged each other tightly. They both knew that their lives were about to change in ways they never could have imagined. And they could not wait for the adventure that lay ahead.
