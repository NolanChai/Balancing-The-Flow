"You know," said the Iron Fist, his voice dripping with menace, "you're all gonna pay for this." He raised his fists, ready to strike, and the guards were left with no choice but to watch in horror as their fate was sealed. 

With a flash of light and a loud boom, the prison exploded into ruins, leaving nothing but rubble and death in its wake. The Iron Fist stood amidst the destruction, his eyes glowing with an otherworldly power. 

"I'll be seeing you soon," he repeated, before disappearing into the night, leaving behind only a trail of chaos and destruction in his wake.

The guards were left to pick up the pieces, both literally and figuratively, as they tried to make sense of what had just happened. They knew that they had crossed paths with something evil, something far beyond human comprehension. 

And they also knew that the Iron Fist would be back, stronger than ever before. The heroes of the world may have defeated him once, but his thirst for revenge was unquenchable. 

They could only hope that when he returned, they would be ready to face him, and prevent another catastrophe from happening.
