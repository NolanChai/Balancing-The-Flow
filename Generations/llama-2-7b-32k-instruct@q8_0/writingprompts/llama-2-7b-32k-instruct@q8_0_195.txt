umseh ,” I called. “ We have to go now.” 
 
 My hand hovered over the control for the engines, but I hesitated . 
 
 What if this was a trap ? How do you know these aren ’ t Dark Flag agents too ? Maybe they are just pretending to be your friends so that they can get close enough to kill me. 
 
 *Because we had them on intercept ,* Tecumseh said in my head. *We have been watching this ship for weeks . These people saved our lives. We would never betray them like this.* 
 
 I took a deep breath and engaged the engines. The ship lurched forward, making me stumble against one of the walls as it shot into hyperspace. 
 
 “You know,” I said to Tecumseh, *I ’ m not sure how much more of this mind-talking you can do.* 
 
 She replied, *Fair point. I won ’ t be so pushy in the future .* 
 
 White Falcon sat up as we left Earth behind us. “ You ’ re okay, Violet,” he said with a smile. 
 
 “I have no idea what you just did to that ship ,” he continued. “But it was impressive.” 
 
 I grinned back at him . “Just wait until we get this whole Dark Flag thing sorted out.” 
 
 Then I turned to Tecumseh and said, “You know what ? This is the first time in my life I ’ ve flown a ship that has a female captain. How about you, Tecumseh?” 
 
 The cyborg grinned at me . “I have had my own ship.” 
 
 *Hmm,* I said thoughtfully. “Wonder what happened to her...”
