The car was moving quickly.

Mike looked out the window and watched as they drove by rows of tall buildings. He couldn't believe how large everything seemed. The buildings were so much taller than any he had seen in his home city. The cars were so much larger too, with their sleek designs and huge engines. Mike was sure that even if he could have afforded one back at home, it would never have been as nice as the ones he saw now. He had heard people talk about how wealthy this place was, but seeing it for himself was a totally different experience.

Mike had traveled to visit his father's family in that city. They lived far away from him and Mike only got to see them once or twice a year. His aunt had sent an email inviting him to come out, saying they were planning to go to the beach for the day. The day was beautiful and warm and Mike was excited to get some sunshine and spend time with his cousins. He arrived at the airport and checked in quickly. When he got to passport control, though, a man in uniform told him that he didn't have the correct visa and that he would be sent back home. Mike felt sick. He had never been away from his city before and had no idea how he was going to explain this to his family. The officer at the counter was kind enough to let Mike call his aunt, who told him that they could still hang out as planned. But she said it would be better if he came back another time when he had the correct documents.

Mike left and went home, feeling sad. He had spent so much money on traveling costs and hadn't even seen his family yet. He began to look into how he could get the required visa in order to go back out there again. It turned out that the process was quite long and complicated, especially for people who didn't have a sponsor already living in the city. Mike would need a job offer or a university acceptance letter in order to apply for the visa. He had been planning on getting some more education before going back to his home country so this seemed like the perfect time to do that. And even after he was done studying, there was no guarantee that they would let him stay there. It felt really frustrating to have worked so hard only to be held back by something as random as a visa.

After some research and discussion with his family, Mike decided to enroll in college in the city where his father's family lived. He was able to get some funding from his aunt to help him out while he studied there. It meant he would have to leave home for an extended period of time but that was okay - at least he could spend more time with his cousins and see this beautiful place he had heard so much about.

When the day finally came, Mike got up early and made his way to the airport once again. He said goodbye to his family and boarded the plane, feeling nervous but also very excited. It was going to be a long flight but he knew that it would be worth it in the end. After a couple of hours, the plane landed safely on the other side of the world and Mike made his way off with his luggage. He went through passport control again, this time without any issues, as he had everything ready for them to check. He met up with some family friends who were waiting at the airport and they drove him out to where his aunt lived. They stopped at an ATM on the way and Mike was shocked to see that the money he pulled out would be worth thousands of his home country's currency!

In this version, Mike is from a third-world or developing nation, as opposed to the original prompt, which said "a wealthy city". The rest of the story remains the same.
