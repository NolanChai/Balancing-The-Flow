olluting metropolis on the outskirts of the desert called 'Campus City'. It was a marvel to behold. The technology they used here was amazing and efficient. He wondered if he could fit in with these people, the future generations of humans.

As his train entered Campus City station, he took out his cell phone and dialed someone's number. A mechanical voice answered, asking him what he wanted. He asked for a taxi, but was told that they would arrive soon. Sooner or later, Mike realized that he had been waiting for 40 minutes now. It didn't matter though - after all, this was the future. They had everything planned out.

As his train arrived at the station platform, a robotic arm picked up his suitcase and brought it to him. He stood there, awkwardly holding on to it as if it were made of glass. It seemed like every other person in the room knew exactly how this worked - they all had their phones out, ready to snap pictures at the right moment. Mike wondered if he'd fit in with these people, too.

"Hey!" a young voice exclaimed as she ran up to him. She was probably 24, dressed casually but fashionably. Her hair was dyed blue and her makeup was perfect. "Are you here for the conference?"

"Yeah," Mike replied nervously, barely able to speak at all. He felt like he was in a bad romantic comedy.

She smiled at him, showing off her pearly white teeth. Her smile was contagious - it made him want to smile back, even though he wasn't sure why. "Well I'm going to get you checked in at the hotel!" she exclaimed. "Don't worry about anything!"

Mike felt a wave of relief wash over him as this young woman took his hand and led him through the crowd to her car, an electric vehicle that looked more like a futuristic sports car than anything he'd ever seen before. He sat in the passenger seat and let her do all the talking as she navigated them out of the city center, past the skyscrapers and into the hotel district.

The moment they arrived at their destination, Mike couldn't help but stare at the hotel. It was sleek and modern, with walls made entirely of glass. Inside, it felt like a spaceship had landed. The young woman checked them in quickly and led him to his room, where he set down his bags and collapsed onto the bed, completely spent.

As he lay there, staring at the ceiling, Mike couldn't help but feel a sense of awe. He was in the future - what more could he want?

Mike awoke the next morning to find himself feeling refreshed and ready to take on Campus City. He showered and dressed for the day, taking special care with his appearance since he had no idea how people would react to him here. After all, he was used to the old world of the 21st century.

When he emerged from the hotel, Mike felt like a fish out of water. He couldn't help but stare at the sleek electric vehicles that seemed to fill every road in Campus City, and the people who were dressed in their futuristic clothes. It was all so... perfect.

He walked down to the conference center, feeling like a stranger in his own body. He felt as if he didn't belong here at all - as if he had been transported from another time entirely. When he arrived at the venue, he found that it was every bit as futuristic as he expected it to be. It was made of glass and steel, with screens displaying information on every wall.

As Mike walked inside, he saw rows upon rows of people seated in front of him, all staring intently at the speakers up on stage. He felt out of place once again - like an alien among humans. But then, as the first speaker took to the podium, Mike was drawn in by their words, and found himself engrossed in their ideas, just as he had been back home.

As the conference went on, Mike couldn't help but notice how many people were staring at him. He felt self-conscious at first, but then realized that they weren't judging him - they were simply curious. It was a strange feeling to be so scrutinized by strangers, but also exhilarating.

By the end of the day, Mike had come to terms with his place in Campus City. He wasn't from here, but he could still be a part of it. And as he walked back to the hotel that night, Mike felt a sense of pride wash over him - for once, he wasn't the stranger anymore.

As he lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, Mike couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment. He had spent the day being a part of something bigger than himself - something that stretched across time and space, connecting people from all over the world. And for once, he felt like he belonged.

Mike woke up early in the morning, excited to spend another day at Campus City. As he walked downstairs to the lobby, he noticed a group of people gathered around a screen that displayed news clips from all over the world. He realized that they were watching a live broadcast of his conference, and for a moment, he felt like an actor on stage, being watched by millions.

The rest of the day went much in the same way as it had before - Mike spent his time attending panels and discussions, engaging with people from all over the world. And once again, he found that he didn't fit in here at all. But this time, instead of feeling out of place, he felt a sense of pride wash over him. He belonged here.
