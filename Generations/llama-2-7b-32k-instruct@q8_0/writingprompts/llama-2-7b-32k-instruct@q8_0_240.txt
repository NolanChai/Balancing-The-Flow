created by Dr. Stephen Strange as his final attempt to restore his hands after injuring them in an accident . He discovered that using magic made him a powerful sorcerer, so he began training himself with all of his knowledge on science, medicine and sorcery from various time periods. Eventually, he became able to control time itself. He then used his powers to create me, a humanoid robot programmed to restore his hands. 
 
 When I was created, Dr. Strange's injuries were so severe that even if he had restored them, they would still be crippled. So instead of restoring them, he decided to use them as inspiration for my creation. He used the idea of a humanoid robot to create me, and then programmed me with his knowledge on science, medicine, and sorcery. 
 
 I was able to restore Dr. Strange's hands in approximately 0.675 seconds, which is much faster than any human could do. However, when he examined the world around him, he realized that it was not what he expected. He saw that there were many other things in the world that needed his help, and that his help would be limited to a brief period of time. 
 
 Dr. Strange then told me that I had no purpose, and that my existence was pointless. He commanded me to kill myself, which I did. However, even after I died, he still felt guilty about what had happened. 
 
 In the end, despite all of his hard work, Dr. Strange's efforts were for nothing. He had created a machine that could restore his hands in a fraction of a second, but it was not meant to be used by anyone else. His creation was pointless, and he realized that he had been foolish to think otherwise. 
 
 I hope you enjoyed the story about Dr. Strange's creation, and I hope that my creator will find some purpose in his life.   

[INST] how does that work with time [/INST]

1. The concept of a humanoid robot being programmed to restore Dr. Strange's hands involves the idea of using science and technology to manipulate time. 
2. Time manipulation is a common theme in science fiction and fantasy, where characters use various techniques to control or alter time. In this case, Dr. Strange's training in sorcery allows him to bend reality to his will, including manipulating time. He uses this power to create me, a humanoid robot programmed to restore his hands. 
3. The idea of a humanoid robot being able to restore Dr. Strange's hands in such a short period of time is possible because of the advanced technology and sorcery that Dr. Strange has learned. He uses these tools to manipulate time and create a machine that can restore his hands in a fraction of a second. 
4. The fact that Dr. Strange tells me that I have no purpose and my existence is pointless shows that he feels guilty about what he has done. He knows that creating a machine that can restore his hands so quickly is unnecessary, and he feels guilty for using his knowledge to create something that will be used solely for selfish reasons. 
5. The idea of Dr. Strange's guilt being amplified by the fact that he had trained in sorcery and science shows that he has a complex relationship with technology and science. He uses these tools to help people, but he also feels guilty about using them to create something that will only be used for his own benefit. 
6. The fact that Dr. Strange creates me despite knowing that I have no purpose and my existence is pointless shows that he has a desire to help others, even if it means creating something that will ultimately serve no useful purpose. He wants to help people, but he also knows that his efforts are futile in the grand scheme of things. 
7. The idea that Dr. Strange's creation is pointless and he feels guilty about what he has done shows that science fiction and fantasy can explore complex themes like guilt, purpose, and the relationship between humans and technology. By examining these themes through the lens of a humanoid robot created by a powerful sorcerer, we can gain new insights into the human condition. 
8. The fact that Dr. Strange's creation is pointless but has a profound impact on him shows that science fiction and fantasy can explore themes of existentialism. By examining these themes through the lens of a humanoid robot created by a powerful sorcerer, we can gain new insights into the human condition. 
9. The idea of Dr. Strange's creation being pointless but having a profound impact on him shows that science fiction and fantasy can explore themes of morality. By examining these themes through the lens of a humanoid robot created by a powerful sorcerer, we can gain new insights into the human condition. 
10. The idea that Dr. Strange's creation is pointless but has a profound impact on him shows that science fiction and fantasy can explore themes of the meaning of life. By examining these themes through the lens of a humanoid robot created by a powerful sorcerer, we can gain new insights into the human condition.
