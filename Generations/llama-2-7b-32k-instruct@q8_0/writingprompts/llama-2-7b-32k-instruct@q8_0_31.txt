I nodded my head towards the pub sign and opened the front door for you. 
1 second after that, I pulled out a large keychain with a bottle opener attached to it and handed it to you. 
2 seconds after that, I stepped back and gestured toward the table in the corner near the stage area where we had agreed to meet. 
3 seconds after that, I unlocked the door again and came back inside. 
4 seconds after that, I walked over to my usual seat at the end of the bar.
