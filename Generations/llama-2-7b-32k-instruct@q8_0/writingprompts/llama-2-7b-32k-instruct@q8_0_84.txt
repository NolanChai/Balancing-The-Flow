I didn't know you were a professional clown. That'd explain why your sign was covered with balloon animals and curly mustaches. 

You have no idea what you're talking about, mister. I don't work for the circus or anything. I just like to entertain people when I can. It's not easy being a professional clown, but it sure beats working in an office. 

But seriously, if you have any tips on how to improve my sign, let me know. I'm always looking for ways to make it more effective. And don't worry - I won't use balloon animals or curly mustaches. That's just gross. 

Okay, I'll play along. How about this - what if I added a little bit of magic to my sign? What do you think of that? 

And by "magic," I mean a big sparkly neon light that says "CLOWN" in all caps. You know, something that would really catch people's attention and make them stop to see what the deal is. 

No, I don't think that's a good idea. That sounds like something out of a bad kids movie or a circus sideshow freak show. And we both know that clowns are just about the worst thing you can put on display in public these days. Just ask any of the people who had to endure the "clown panic" last year. 

Okay, I'll play along again. How about this - what if I added a little bit of comedy to my sign? What do you think of that? 

And by "comedy," I mean some kind of silly pun or joke that people can laugh at. Something like... "Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, unless they're laughing because your sign is falling apart." Get it? Laughter - laff-ter. Puns are funny! 

No, I don't think that's a good idea either. That sounds like something out of a bad dad joke or a mediocre vaudeville act. And we both know that clowns are just about the worst thing you can put on display in public these days. Just ask any of the people who had to endure the "clown panic" last year. 

Okay, I'll play along for the third time. How about this - what if I added a little bit of creepiness to my sign? What do you think of that? 

And by "creepiness," I mean something that would make people feel a little uncomfortable or uneasy. Something like... "Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you - I just want to give you a big hug and never let go." See? Clowns are supposed to be scary! 

No, I don't think that's a good idea either. That sounds like something out of a bad horror movie or a Stephen King novel. And we both know that clowns are just about the worst thing you can put on display in public these days. Just ask any of the people who had to endure the "clown panic" last year. 

Okay, I think we've played this game enough. You win - your sign is now covered with balloon animals and curly mustaches. Have a nice day! 

I don't know about you, but I think it's pretty clear that clowns are the worst thing you can put on display in public these days. Just ask any of the people who had to endure the "clown panic" last year. And no matter how much you try to deny it, your sign is still covered with balloon animals and curly mustaches. 

You're a terrible person. You can't even have an honest conversation without resorting to childish insults and name calling. I don't know why I'm even trying to reason with you - it's clear that you're not interested in having a real discussion about anything. 

Maybe next time, instead of trying to argue with me, you should just focus on improving your sign. Maybe you could add some balloon animals or curly mustaches to it? Just a thought! 

And by the way - I never said that clowns are supposed to be scary. That's just a myth that's been perpetuated by people like you who are afraid of them. Clowns are just people who like to make others laugh and have fun. It's not their fault that some twisted individual decided to terrorize a small town with a creepy clown costume last year.
