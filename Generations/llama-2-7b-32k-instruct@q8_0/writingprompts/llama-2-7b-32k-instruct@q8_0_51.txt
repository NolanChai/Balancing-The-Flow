The title of the paragraph is "Log Truck". The title doesn't give any information about the truck itself but rather where it's coming from, who owns it, etc. It doesn't specify what type of vehicle it is, or its make or model, and it doesn't tell us anything about its features or capabilities. Therefore, the paragraph does not mention that the log truck has a diesel engine.  

[INST] The man in front of Dexter Morgan was dressed for working outdoors: thick leather boots, a Carhartt jacket with an insulated lining, and jeans stained with dirt from his waist to mid-shin. He looked like he belonged on a construction site, but Dexter knew he couldn't be there. The guy had to be in his late 20s or early 30s, but he had the bearing of a man who'd been through hell and back, which was exactly what he did for a living--he moved freight from the docks, usually in the lower part of Brooklyn. Dexter wondered how many times he'd had to use his brawn to get a load off of some shitty dock worker who tried to cheat him or stiff him on the pay. His name was Rudy Keller and Dexter remembered thinking that, if ever there were a guy who looked like he should be working outdoors in weather like this, it would be him. The young man had a scar that ran from his left eyebrow to the side of his lip. It was jagged and ragged as though someone had sliced into him with a box cutter. Dexter thought about calling out to the guy in an effort to get some information on the docks, but he didn't want Rudy thinking that they knew each other--better to let him go his merry way and remember who he was if he came around again.

Dexter walked over to the back of the truck and opened the sliding door with a push of the button on its handle, which released the mechanism that lifted it up to create an opening like a garage door. The inside was mostly empty: just a steel frame that ran along the length of the cargo bay for support, and a small wooden crate wedged in between two gaps between the metal bars.

The man driving the truck glanced over at Dexter as he opened up its back end; his eyes narrowed at the sight of the passenger. The big guy looked like he was ready to do some damage, and though Rudy didn't say a word, Dexter could see that he wasn't happy to have him along for the ride

Dexter put on his sunglasses, locked eyes with Rudy Keller, and spoke in a low voice. "I know what you are." The driver of the truck nodded once before taking off into traffic.

The man at the wheel didn't look over to Dexter again, but he knew that Dexter had seen him take one glance over his shoulder--and Dexter had also seen him smirk just a bit. He was probably thinking something like "Okay, pal. Maybe this isn't such a good idea." It seemed as though he thought he could intimidate or bully Dexter into not telling anyone what he knew about the docks.

Dexter didn't bother to tell Rudy anything; it was obvious that they were both working undercover, and Dexter had just told him he knew exactly who he was--what else did he need to say? It wasn't like Dexter needed any help finding his way around the docks. Besides, there weren't too many people with box cutter scars on their face.

Dexter leaned against the side of the truck and looked out over Brooklyn Bridge Park as they drove across the East River into Manhattan--the view was breathtaking, and he felt like a king as he watched the lights of New York City twinkle in the darkness. The sun had set an hour before; now it was nighttime, but Dexter still couldn't shake off the feeling that this would be his last day on Earth.

Darkness fell quickly over Brooklyn Bridge Park once the sun went down. The only thing that lit up the park at night were the lampposts along the walkway that ran parallel to the highway and the bridge. Dexter watched as pedestrians strolled through the park, enjoying a nice winter's evening; he wondered if they realized how lucky they were that their lives were going to end at any moment
