Dexter's story: The log truck rumbled to a stop. Its diesel engine had been running hot the last hour, and it clicked and clanked now in the cool winter air. Dexter Morgan pulled a toque over his head and climbed down from the cab, then stretched and scratched himself before heading towards the loading dock where Harry was standing by the open door of the trailer. Dexter had been out with him all day working on some contracts. He could tell that Harry looked relieved he was back home for a bit. The two men walked over to Dexter's car, and after a quick goodbye to the driver of the truck, they climbed in and drove away from the docks. On the way, Dexter turned to Harry and asked him how long he had been out working on those contracts.

"Just this morning," replied Harry, "I got up early and headed out with a team of guys from another company." He grinned at his brother. "You know what they say about the early bird?"

Dexter did not look amused. Instead, he looked at him like he was a little kid trying to get out of doing homework. "Yeah," said Dexter, "I'm sure you had fun." He changed gears and asked Harry what new projects were in store for them next week.

"Well, I already lined up another job with a company that makes wine racks," said Harry. He leaned back in his seat and pulled out his phone to show Dexter pictures of the new designs he had come up with. "I've been working on these for weeks now, and I finally got them ready for the client."

Dexter was not impressed. They drove the rest of the way home in silence. When they arrived at their house, both men went inside to put away their things before Dexter asked Harry if he wanted to grab a quick bite to eat or go straight to work on his designs. Harry opted for some food and brought out two beers after placing some leftovers into the microwave. The brothers sat down at the dining table, and as they started eating their meal in silence again, Dexter asked how much money Harry had made that day.

"It was good," replied Harry, "I got a good chunk of change out of it." He finished chewing his food before taking a long swig from the bottle of beer. His eyes went wide as he swallowed and said to Dexter, "Do you know what this is? I just found out that one of these wine rack designs was featured in Architectural Digest!"

Dexter's expression did not change at all as Harry finished his sentence. He leaned back in his chair and raised an eyebrow before saying, "That's nice."

Harry looked up at Dexter confused, then shook his head and said, "Come on man, this is huge for me! I can't believe that one of my designs was published in a major magazine like that!" He finished off the rest of his beer.

"I'm sure you did fine," replied Dexter again, "but I have to go and get ready for work now."

Dexter stood up from the table and headed for the door before Harry could say anything else. As he walked out the door, Dexter turned around and said, "Oh yeah, one more thing Harry..."

"Yeah?" asked Harry quickly.

"You might want to lay off all that beer," replied Dexter, then left the house as Harry called after him saying something about needing it to work on his designs. He closed and locked the door behind himself before heading out into the night. As he walked away from his brother's house, Dexter thought to himself about how different they were. They had been raised together by their parents, but after their dad died in a car accident when they were still kids, Harry went off to live with their mom while Dexter was sent to boarding school to finish out his education. The two brothers never got back on the same page until a few years ago when Dexter returned home from college and helped Harry with some of his designs. He was sure that he would be the one who would go far in the world, but now looking at Harry sitting there drinking beer and getting published in Architectural Digest had him questioning how well he was doing himself.
