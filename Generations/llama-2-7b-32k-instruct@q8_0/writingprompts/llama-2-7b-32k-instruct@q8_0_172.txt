future perspective, where no one has ever heard of such a thing as an Orion Nebula. My only regret was that I did not bring my camera on this trip. 
I took stock. No food, water or fuel, and about twenty minutes of air left. I'd picked up a slight rotation, so I was able to watch as the majestic splendour of the Orion Nebula slowly rose from my bedroom window. It had been one year since I last saw it.
