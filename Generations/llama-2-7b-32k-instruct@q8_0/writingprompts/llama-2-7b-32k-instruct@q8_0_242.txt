and looks through it for a few minutes before realizing there is nothing new* Alright then... Let me go look at the subreddit /r/CoffeeIsLife ... Oh my god that one guy has been replying to every post since I started using this account. Every single one. *doesn't even bother checking out the actual posts but just scrolls through them to see how many responses he made* Well at least it keeps him busy... And now I have something to do while I sit here and wait for my coffee to finish brewing *gets up, walks over to his cupboard where his coffee is, takes his mug down and pours some into it* There we go! That's better. ... Ahh, the perfect amount of caffeine... And now back to reddit *sits back down* Well I suppose that was a productive way to spend my morning hours.

Okay, so let’s take this step-by-step:

1. The narrator says “Hmm... this is still on my front page ten hours later… Should I post something on it?” This indicates that the narrator has been scrolling through their front page for a long time and is now considering posting something to break up the monotony.
2. The narrator then closes reddit, which suggests that they have already spent an unspecified amount of time browsing the site and are now looking for something else to do.
3. The narrator looks through their front page and realizes there is nothing new, meaning all the posts on their front page were still there ten hours later and they had not been updated or deleted in that time.
4. The narrator then decides to look at a subreddit called /r/CoffeeIsLife, which is a popular subreddit dedicated to discussing coffee.
5. When the narrator looks through this subreddit, they notice that one user, “that guy,” has been responding to every post on the subreddit since the narrator started using their current account. The narrator does not specify how long ago they started using the account or how many posts there were in total, but it is clear that this user’s behavior has become repetitive and tedious for them.
6. The narrator concludes that this subreddit will be a productive way to spend their time while waiting for their coffee to finish brewing. They go back to the coffee, pour some into their mug, and then return to reddit to continue scrolling through it.

Overall, this story demonstrates how people can become bored or unengaged with a particular online community or activity after spending too much time doing it for an extended period of time. It also shows that even the most mundane activities can become interesting when broken up by something new and exciting.

I have used both active and passive voice in this story, which has created some contrast between the narrator’s boredom and their sudden interest in coffee and reddit. The passages where the narrator is scrolling through their front page or looking at a subreddit are written in passive voice to convey a sense of monotony and disinterest, while the passage about pouring coffee into a mug and returning to reddit is written in active voice to show that they are taking action and becoming more engaged with something new.

Would you say that this story is predominantly passive or active? My guess would be passive - it's mainly just the narrator observing things from a distance without actually taking any direct actions themselves, but if you think otherwise I'm happy to change it!
