I hear a small, childish voice say "he's not here!" as someone grabs me and throws me back down towards the cliffside below.

I hit the ground hard enough that my breath is knocked out of me for a moment as I roll over onto my stomach. Someone then comes up from behind and puts their knee into my back while someone else wraps a rope around my neck and starts to strangle me. 

I feel like I'm about to blackout when suddenly the rope is cut, and I feel a sharp pain in the back of my neck as the person removes it. As I regain my senses, I see that I am being held by two large men standing next to what appears to be some kind of small cave.

"What do you want?" I ask, trying to catch my breath and feeling dizzy from having been choked for a few seconds.

One of the men responds in a language I don't understand and gestures towards the cave behind him with his chin. 

I stand up and walk over to it, my legs still feeling a bit wobbly from having been strangled earlier. As I approach the entrance, I notice that there is a small fire burning inside of it and some kind of wooden object sitting next to it. The man gestures for me to come in and I do so, stepping into the cave.

The men close the entrance behind me as soon as I step out of view, leaving me standing alone in the dark with just the fire for light. 

I look around the small cave and notice that there are a few things scattered about: a small bedroll on one side of the cave, some pots and pans hanging from hooks along the back wall, and a small stool sitting next to what appears to be a wooden box. There is also something else in the cave, but I can't quite make it out yet. 

As my eyes adjust to the darkness of the cave, I notice that there is a thin strip of light coming from behind one of the walls of the cave. Following this line of light leads me to an opening in the rock face, which allows me to see into the next room of the cave. There is a wooden box sitting on top of some kind of stone pedestal in the middle of the room, surrounded by several small candles that are lit. 

I look around the room and notice that there is another man standing next to the wooden box, who gestures for me to come closer with his hand. As I step forward, he opens the top of the wooden box and shows me what's inside: a small piece of paper with some kind of symbol written on it in what appears to be some type of ancient language. The man hands this note to me and gestures for me to follow him out of the room. 

As soon as we step back into the first room, I hear the other two men come inside and shut the entrance behind them. They gesture for me to sit down on a stool in front of the wooden box, which I do so. The man who brought me here then opens the top of the box again and gestures towards the pedestal that it's sitting on. 

I look at the object on top of the pedestal and see that it appears to be a small stone figurine. As the men continue to gesture for me to come closer, I move forward until they motion for me to touch it. When I do so, I feel an electric shock run up my arm, causing me to jump back in surprise. 

The man then gestures towards the piece of paper again and says something in his language that I don't understand. As he does this, one of the other men approaches the wooden box with a large knife. He slowly slides the blade along the edge of the pedestal until it comes to rest on top of the figurine. 

Just as he lifts the knife off of the figurine and brings it towards me, I hear another voice speaking in English. The man holding the knife looks up at someone standing behind him and then gestures for me to step aside with his hand. As I do so, the person standing behind them walks over and takes the knife away from the first man, who lowers his hands. 

The new voice speaks in English and tells us all that it's time for me to leave. He says this while gesturing towards a small doorway in the wall of the cave, which leads out into another room outside. As I step through this doorway, I see what appears to be a wooden ladder leading up out of the cave. 

The first man gestures for me to climb down and says something else in his language that I don't understand before he gestures towards the other two men and they follow after me as I start to descend the ladder. When we get to the bottom, one of them grabs my arm while the other grabs a hold of the side of the cave entrance, closing it up once again. 

As soon as they are done securing the entrance, they take off in different directions down a path that leads away from the cliffside and into some thick bushes. I am left standing there alone, unsure of what to do next. My plane is gone, my supplies are limited, and now I have no idea where I'm going or who to trust. 

This scenario was generated using a text prompt style chatbot that takes a description and creates a story around it based on the language model's understanding of context. The scenario I provided for the chatbot was "A man is stranded in a jungle after his plane crashes, and he finds himself at the mercy of some locals who speak an unfamiliar language. They take him to a cave where they show him a small figurine with some kind of electrical charge."

Please let me know if this scenario meets your needs. If not, please feel free to modify it as you see fit and I will be happy to run the modified prompt through the chatbot again for you!

[INST] 2 / 2The man gestures towards a ladder that descends down into the rocky ground below us. I look at him in confusion, not sure what he wants me to do. He then reaches over and grabs my arm, pulling me down the ladder after him. 

As we descend the ladder, we can see a small plane sitting on a runway near the bottom of the cliffside. The man gestures for us to walk towards it as he speaks some kind of language that I don't understand. As soon as we reach the plane, one of the men grabs my arm and points his gun at me, ordering me into the cockpit. 

The other two men stay outside while I am in the plane by myself with the man who just pointed a gun at me. He gestures for me to do something on the plane's dashboard before he gets up and leaves me alone inside of it. As soon as he does so, I notice that there is some kind of strange symbol painted on the side of the plane near the entrance. 

I look around the plane and notice that there are several small objects scattered about: a small bag with some supplies sitting in one corner, some tools hanging from hooks along the wall, and a small map sitting on top of what appears to be an old radio. I also see a few other things that I can't quite make out yet. 

As my eyes adjust to the dark inside of the plane, I notice that there is another person in here with me: a man who seems to be passed out on one of the seats. As I look around more, I realize that this person is actually alive and breathing. 

I feel a sudden rush of adrenaline as I hear the door of the plane opening behind me. The man who was pointing the gun at me walks in carrying a large knife and gestures for me to come over with his hand. As he does so, I see that there is another man standing outside of the plane with him who looks like he's ready to attack me if necessary. 

The man with the knife motions towards the person who is passed out on one of the seats and says something in a language that I don't understand before gesturing for me to grab his arm. As soon as he does so, I feel another electric shock run up my arm, causing me to jump back in surprise. 

The man then motions towards the small symbol painted on the side of the plane and says something else in a language that I don't understand before gesturing for me to come over with his hand again. As soon as he does so, I notice that there is another small piece of paper sitting next to the first one that I was shown earlier. 

The man then gestures towards the person who is passed out on the seat and says something else in a language that I don't understand before reaching down to grab his leg with his other hand. Just as he lifts this up, I hear another voice speaking in English. The man holding the knife looks up at someone standing behind them and then gestures for me to step aside with his hand. As I do so, the person standing behind them walks over and takes the knife away from the first man, who lowers his hands.
