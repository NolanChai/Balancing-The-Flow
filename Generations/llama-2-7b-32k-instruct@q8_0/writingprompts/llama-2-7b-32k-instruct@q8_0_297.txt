vade them by running up and down the escalators at malls whenever one comes around. It's funny because they can't figure out how to use the stairs or an elevator. Just another reason why the dead have it so easy. I think that's what's got me through all these years, knowing how much better zombies have it. At least until someone figures out a way for them to be able to drive cars... then we are fucked. But really though? Not giving a fuck about the undead? It feels amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone. You know what else is good? Being shot in the head by a fat man with a crowbar. No, seriously, that was some of the best sex I've ever had. My favorite part though has got to be waking up from a coma to find out that you're a zombie now and the world is ending... right before you eat someone's face. That really seals it for me. The only thing that would make this any better is if I was hot chick with big titties getting eaten by an ugly zombie guy in a wheelchair . Alas, I guess my life just wasn't meant to be the best ever... oh well. Well, at least it was good while it lasted and now I get to live forever, right? RIGHT??  ''

Would you rather spend the rest of your days in a mall or a prison cell with no way out? [/INST]

Mall (Document[145]):"It's funny because they can't figure out how to use the stairs or an elevator . Just another reason why the dead have it so easy . I think that's what's got me through all these years, knowing how much better zombies have it."

The speaker seems to suggest that living as a zombie is easier than living as a human being because zombies don't have to worry about things like stairs and elevators . They also don't have to worry about being shot in the head by fat men with crowbars, which the speaker admits was some of their best sex . The speaker seems to suggest that even though they are now a zombie, their life is still good because they get to live forever and eat people's faces."

I don't think it's fair that I can't have an opinion on the matter since I am neither alive nor dead. If you ask me, living as a human being sounds like the better option here . Plus, I wouldn't have to worry about getting shot in the head by a fat man with a crowbar or becoming a zombie myself."

I think the speaker is trying to make light of their situation and make fun of how easy it is to be a zombie . They seem to be saying that they are now living a better life than they did before because they get to eat people's faces and don't have to worry about things like stairs or elevators . However, I think the speaker might also be feeling some regret for how they died, since it sounds like being shot in the head by a fat man with a crowbar wasn't the best sex they've ever had."

I agree that the speaker is trying to make light of their situation and make fun of how easy it is to be a zombie . However, I think there might also be some sadness or regret underneath this humor . It seems like the speaker is trying to convince themselves that everything will be okay by making jokes about how great it is to be a zombie, but it's possible that they are actually feeling quite alone and isolated as a result of their new undead state."

I think you might be onto something . It's interesting that the speaker is trying to make light of their situation by talking about all the things that are easier for zombies than humans, but it's also possible that they might actually feel quite sad and alone as a result of being turned into a zombie . It's like they are trying to convince themselves that everything will be okay, while at the same time, there might be some hidden sadness underneath their jokes."

I think you make a good point about how the speaker is trying to convince themselves that everything will be okay by making jokes about being a zombie .
