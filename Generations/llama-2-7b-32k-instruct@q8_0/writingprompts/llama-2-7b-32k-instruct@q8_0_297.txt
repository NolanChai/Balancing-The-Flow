I've really just stopped giving a fuck.

The zombies have been mostly chill anyway. I mean, sure, they did kill everyone I knew. Other than that though, they pretty much leave me the hell alone. I eat their brains for sustenance and stay out of sight during the day. It's not like they can really tell anyone what happened to them after they died.

The other survivors have scattered far and wide. They either don't know or don't care that I'm still alive, which is fine by me. I've made my home in an abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere. It's not much, but it's safe and hidden from view.

I've adapted to this new life, and I've learned to enjoy the little things. The sunsets are beautiful, even if they're tinged with a bit of blood red. The sound of the wind howling through the trees is comforting, especially when it covers my sounds as I hunt for food. And the feeling of flesh tearing between my teeth is...well, let's just say it's become a welcome part of my routine.

But make no mistake, this isn't easy. There are days when I feel like giving up and letting the zombies have their way with me. But then I remember how delicious fresh brain matter tastes, and that gives me the strength to carry on.

In conclusion, life as a zombie survivor is definitely an interesting experience. But don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a normal, boring existence, this probably isn't the lifestyle for you. But if you're up for some adventure and want to test your limits, give zombie survivalism a shot. Who knows, you might just surprise yourself.
