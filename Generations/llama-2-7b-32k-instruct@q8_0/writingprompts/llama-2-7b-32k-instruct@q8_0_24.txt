different. It has been three years since I have first arrived at this strange place. I still don't understand how I ended up in this different world; I went to sleep one night, as always, then suddenly I woke up to find that everything had changed. The first thing that caught my attention was the landscape. It was nothing like any of the places I had seen before. The grass and trees were much greener and more lush than anything I had ever seen. And the animals! They were so different from anything I had ever seen, too. The most striking thing about this world, though, was the people. They were all unique in their own way, with strange clothing, hairstyles, and faces that were unfamiliar to me. Despite my confusion, I felt drawn to this place and its inhabitants, and so I decided to stay.
