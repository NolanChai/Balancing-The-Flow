different . There are more people here, for sure--at least five times as many, by my reckoning. Most of them seem to be people who look like they should belong in a circus or a freak show. They have various mutations and abnormalities--some have extra limbs, some are missing limbs, some have eyes on their backs, etc . As I mentioned before, the most common mutation is the glowing eyes, but that's not as rare as you might think; it seems to affect about 1 in 3 people here. A lot of these freaks can do things regular humans ca n't--things like regenerate lost limbs at will, or see perfectly well even though they have no eyes, or control the weather . It's all pretty wild stuff. But what really blows my mind is that I'm not a freak; I don't have any mutations, and I can do everything regular humans can do . To them, I must seem like nothing more than a normal human being--which is why I ca n't stand the way they treat me. They constantly try to exploit my so-called "normality" in order to make money off of me.
