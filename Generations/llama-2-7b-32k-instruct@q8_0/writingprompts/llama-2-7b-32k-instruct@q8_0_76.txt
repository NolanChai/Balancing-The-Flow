The story begins with the first sentence: "It was a terrible day, God had finally had enough."

God, who is portrayed as a parent figure, has grown tired of humanity's disobedience and sinfulness. As punishment, he sends a flood to destroy the entire world, leaving only eight people to repopulate it. The story takes place on a small ark built by Noah, who was chosen by God to survive the flood.

The story then focuses on the lives of those aboard the ark as they endure the flood and wait for it to subside. They must deal with the uncertainty of when or if the flood will ever end, as well as the challenges of living in a confined space for an indeterminate amount of time.

As the story progresses, the characters begin to develop and grow closer. Noah's son Ham is shown to have a rebellious streak, while his other sons, Shem and Japheth, are depicted as pious and obedient. The story also touches on themes of faith and trust in God, as the characters rely on him for guidance and protection during the flood.

The story culminates with the end of the flood, when the ark finally comes to rest on dry land. The survivors emerge from the ark, eager to start anew and rebuild their lives. The story ends with a note of hope for humanity's future, as Noah is shown to have been successful in his mission to repopulate the earth with righteous people.
