God's creation has been destroyed and only one man is left alive on the planet, stranded and surrounded by the dead bodies of his family, friends and fellow citizens. The man walks to a nearby cliff and stands at its edge, contemplating suicide. He suddenly hears a voice behind him, "Don't do it John! I've been watching you and your kind for eons, but today is the day that all of Humanity will be redeemed." The man turns around to see an angel standing before him. The angel tells John that his planet has been destroyed because humanity had become too corrupt and violent. The angel says that he has come to lead a select group of humans, led by the Archangel Michael, back home to Heaven where they will be redeemed for their sins. The angel gives John a choice: join them or remain on Earth to face his fate alone. John looks at all of the dead bodies around him and decides that he has nothing left to live for, so he joins the group of humans led by Michael. They all walk up to Heaven together, leaving Earth behind them forever.
