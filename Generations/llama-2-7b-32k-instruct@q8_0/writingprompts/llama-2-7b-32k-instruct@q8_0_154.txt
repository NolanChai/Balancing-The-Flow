for my coffee spilled on the counter when I made it too hot at home but I never had any intent to cause harm or anger others. Until that day. It all started with me walking through a crowded mall one Saturday afternoon in late August, I'd only been there once before and found it very modern and clean. There were so many people milling around I felt anxious as soon as I stepped inside the building but kept moving forward regardless. Suddenly, someone bumped into me from behind without even a "sorry" and my coffee spilled all over the floor. Anger built up in my chest and my cheeks flushed red with heat so I whirled around to yell at the person who had just ruined my day but they'd already vanished down one of the many store entrances. Soon enough, a group of people gathered around me asking if I was alright and telling me how clumsy people are these days. A few of them pointed their fingers at the area where the person had bumped into me as though that would somehow make it right. And one even went so far to say "people like you should not be allowed on public streets". I froze in shock and was unable to speak. I felt myself starting to sweat from my head down to my toes and I couldn't help but feel humiliated by these strangers' judgment of me. The group slowly dispersed without offering any apology or consolation for what they had just said to me so all that was left was a cold coffee stain on the ground underneath my feet. I realized as I walked out of the mall and drove home in silence that day, there were some people in this world who would never be satisfied with their own behavior no matter how hard they tried and that made them feel so angry toward others for being less than perfect. And it scared me because those are the kind of people who could harm others without even trying.

I never considered myself a person who was discriminated against until that one summer day when I was walking home from work and was confronted by two white police officers on the side of the road. It was just after sunset, and I was walking down the street with my hands in my pockets feeling tired but content after finishing up another busy shift at the hospital where I worked as a nurse's assistant. Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder and I turned around to see two men standing there looking serious. One of them identified himself as an officer and asked me if I was "Terry Davis". I answered in the affirmative and he told me that they had been called about a black person walking down this street at night, and since I matched the description, they wanted to check on me just in case. I felt my heart sink. Although I did nothing wrong, I couldn't help but feel like I was being profiled for simply being black. As one of them frisked me for weapons while the other stood guard nearby, I tried to hold back tears as the officer asked me if I had anything illegal on me. After searching my pockets and feeling through my clothing, he seemed satisfied that there was nothing wrong and told me to go on my way. I knew at this point that I would never forget how it felt to be treated like a suspect because of my race. I continued walking home in silence as the memories of that encounter played over and over again in my head. It was one thing to read about racial profiling in the news, but being on the receiving end of it was an entirely different experience altogether. Even though those officers did not arrest me or hurt me physically, I still felt violated because of their actions. And for a long time after that encounter, I struggled with trusting people in uniforms and questioning whether they were there to help me or harm me.

When my dad taught me how to play chess, I realized that learning can be fun. 

One summer afternoon during the school break, I sat on the floor in our living room playing with a wooden chess set that my grandpa had given me for my ninth birthday. My dad sat across from me and gave me instructions about how to move the pieces. At first, I didn't understand what he was saying, but after a few minutes, it clicked. When I finally put two of the pieces together in the right way, I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had never felt before. My dad looked at me proudly and told me how great I did. From that day on, we played chess every night for an hour. At first, he taught me the rules of the game, but over time, he challenged me to solve more complex problems. I learned about strategy, critical thinking, and how important it is to make moves quickly. My favorite part was when my dad would surprise me with new moves or tricks that he had learned from his own chess coach. As I got better at playing the game, I began to realize that learning new things can be fun. It's not always easy, but the feeling of accomplishment after mastering a skill is worth it. Now, whenever I learn something new, I think about how excited my dad was when he taught me chess and how much I enjoyed playing with him. Learning is a journey that we should all embrace.

Learning From a Difficult Time 

In life, we will all encounter challenges and hardships that test our strength and resilience. These moments can be difficult to go through, but they also offer valuable opportunities for growth and self-discovery. One of the most significant lessons I have learned from a difficult time in my life was how to deal with stress and manage my emotions effectively. 

In 2018, I was working as a teacher at an international school in China when my father unexpectedly passed away due to a heart attack. This was the first time I had experienced such a profound loss, and it left me feeling shocked, sad, and lost. I was living in a different country, thousands of miles from home, and did not have immediate access to family or friends for support. The days that followed were filled with endless paperwork and logistics as I arranged for my father's funeral and returned home to Taiwan for the funeral service. During this time, I struggled to cope with my emotions and felt overwhelmed by the stress of the situation. 

As I tried to navigate through this difficult time, I realized that I needed to take care of myself both physically and emotionally. I made sure to get enough sleep each night, ate healthy meals, and spent time outside in nature. I also started practicing mindfulness and meditation to help me calm my racing thoughts and manage my emotions. These activities helped me feel more present and able to handle the stress of the situation better. 

Another thing that I learned was how important it is to lean on others for support. I was lucky to have a strong network of friends and colleagues who were there for me during this time. They listened to my concerns, offered words of encouragement, and helped me stay grounded in the present moment. They also provided practical help, such as picking up some groceries or taking care of errands so that I could focus on other things. Having their support made a huge difference in how I was able to cope with my father's death. 

Moreover, this difficult time taught me the importance of being resilient and finding ways to keep going, even when it feels like everything is falling apart. I learned that it's okay to take things one step at a time and not try to tackle everything all at once. I also realized that I can rely on my inner strength and courage to get through tough times, rather than relying only on external sources of support. 

In conclusion, the difficult time I went through in 2018 taught me valuable lessons about stress management, leaning on others for support, being resilient, and finding ways to keep going. These lessons have helped me become a stronger and more emotionally intelligent person and have given me the tools to handle challenges with greater ease and grace in the future. 

In summary, learning from difficult times is an opportunity to grow and develop as a person. By taking care of ourselves physically and emotionally, leaning on others for support, being resilient, and finding ways to keep going, we can turn life's challenges into opportunities for growth and personal development

When I was in high school, my family and I went on vacation to the beach. While staying at a hotel, my mom and I decided to go on a little shopping spree one day. We walked into a store that sold clothing, jewelry, and home decor. As we looked around, I noticed an interesting necklace made of shiny silver beads with a few crystals attached to it. I loved the way it sparkled in the light, so I decided to ask my mom if she would buy it for me as a gift. She looked at me and told me that
