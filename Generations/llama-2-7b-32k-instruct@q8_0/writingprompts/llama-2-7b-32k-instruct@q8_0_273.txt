The only time I saw him smile was when he thought no one was watching. I met him at a party thrown by one of my friends who also worked in finance, back before the financial crisis. He came up to me and introduced himself as Jim and asked if I wanted to step outside for some fresh air. As we were walking out of the house, he leaned down and whispered in my ear that he thought it would be better if we kept our relationship secret because his wife was always accusing him of cheating on her. We laughed about this joke, but as I looked into his eyes I could tell that there was some truth to what he said. He had an aura around him like the sun emits light from its core, and I wanted nothing more than to spend my life in its glow.
