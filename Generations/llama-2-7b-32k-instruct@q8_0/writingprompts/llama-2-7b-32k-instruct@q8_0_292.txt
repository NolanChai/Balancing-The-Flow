Xbox 360 from EB Games for $20. But his parents had different plans. The doorbell rang, followed by the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway. Jeffery didn't even have to look up to know what it was; he could smell their cloying perfume through the floorboards. His heart sank as he listened to them enter his room and begin nagging him to go outside. After a while, they finally left, but only after bribing him with $10 of allowance if he went out for 2 hours. He grumbled under his breath at their stupidity before gathering his things together to leave the house.

Jeffery was almost to the front door when he heard them calling him back in. "Just a minute, Jeffery." He turned around with reluctance and waited for what was coming next. "We've got a message on our answering machine," his mom said, her voice sounding like she was chewing glass. She handed it over to him. It was from their neighbor, Mrs. Lopez. Her son, Ramon, had just moved away with his family and left behind an old console TV they didn't need anymore. His dad sighed as if this news came as a surprise to them. "It's too bad we can't go visit the new house," he said wistfully before handing Jeffery $12 of allowance and sending him on his way again.

The moment Jeffery left their yard, he felt a rush of excitement coursing through him. He practically skipped down to EB Games. Once inside, he began browsing the shelves with eager anticipation. His eyes fell upon the Xbox 360 in question; it was sitting right there on the shelf, beckoning to him like a siren. He could just imagine himself sneaking it into his room and playing games for hours without having to worry about being caught. Just as he reached out a hand to grab it, Jeffery suddenly heard a voice behind him:

"Hi there! I see you're interested in the Xbox 360." It was the store clerk, who looked like she had just woken up from her shift. "I'm afraid we don't have any more in stock," she said with a sympathetic smile. Jeffery felt his heart sink to the floor. He had actually been considering buying it with the money he had on hand until that moment. But now, his dreams of having the newest and coolest gaming system were crushed. "Thanks anyway," he muttered, feeling like a fool for ever thinking he could pull off such a crazy plan. He paid for the controller and left the store with his tail between his legs.

As Jeffery walked home, all he could think about was how close he had come to getting that Xbox 360. It seemed like fate was just playing games with him, making him dream of something he couldn't have. And yet, as he got closer and closer to home, he began to notice something strange...

As Jeffery entered his house, he saw something out of place in the living room. It was the Xbox 360! He froze where he stood, unsure of what was going on. Had his parents bought it while he was gone? Did they know about his plan to steal one from EB Games? But no, as he looked closer, he realized that it wasn't an Xbox 360 at all. It was a PlayStation 4! Jeffery had never seen this console before; it must have been a new model or something. Whatever it was, it definitely wasn't the Xbox 360 he had set his heart on.

Jeffery stared at the PlayStation 4 in disbelief for a moment, wondering what to do next. He couldn't tell his parents about this, or they would only get mad and take it away from him. And yet, he couldn't bear to keep it a secret either. So, with a sigh of resignation, Jeffery walked upstairs and told his parents the truth: that he had nearly stolen an Xbox 360 but ended up getting a PlayStation 4 instead. They were understandably confused, but they eventually came to accept his explanation and let him keep the console.

And so, Jeffery's summer of boredom turned into one of excitement as he spent countless hours playing games on his new PS4. He had never been happier in his life. And though he still couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all a cruel joke, he knew that at least this time, fate had given him something better than what he thought he deserved.

Jeffery awakened to the sound of his mother's voice, "Get up, Jeffery! It's a beautiful day outside!" He sighed and rolled over, pulling the covers over his head. His summer had been boring thus far, filled with nothing but video games and junk food. He didn't want to go outside and do anything productive, let alone be active. However, he knew that if he didn't get up now, his parents would be on him all day long. Finally, he relented and emerged from under the covers, his hair a mess and his eyes bleary. As Jeffery stood in front of the mirror, he couldn't help but feel disappointed in himself. He looked like a complete slob, and he knew that today was going to be no different.

As he got dressed, he heard his parents chattering away in the kitchen. They were discussing their neighbor Mrs. Lopez's son Ramon, who had just moved away with his family and left behind an old console TV they didn't need anymore. Jeffery couldn't believe what he was hearing - could it be that fate was finally smiling down on him? He quickly finished dressing and made his way into the living room.

"Mom, Dad," he said, "I heard something about a TV from Ramon Lopez." His parents looked at each other in surprise. They had no idea what Jeffery was talking about. "It's okay," Jeffery said with a nervous laugh. "I don't need it - just thought you might want to know." With that, he left the room and made his way outside.

As Jeffery walked towards EB Games, he couldn't help but feel giddy with excitement. This was it - this was his chance to finally have a real TV in his bedroom. He imagined all the games he could play, all the movies he could watch without disturbing anyone else. And the best part? It would be all his own. Jeffery couldn't contain his glee as he walked into the store and browsed the selection of TVs on display. There it was - a sleek, shiny Xbox 360 sitting right in front of him. He felt like he could conquer the world with this thing.

But just as Jeffery was about to grab the Xbox 360 and make his way to the checkout counter, he heard a voice behind him. "Excuse me," it said. "I see you're interested in the Xbox 360." It was the store clerk - a woman with dark hair and eyes that seemed to pierce right through Jeffery's soul. He felt himself go cold, knowing that his plan had been discovered. The clerk went on to say that she couldn't sell it to him because they didn't have any more in stock. Jeffery felt a wave of disappointment wash over him. This was not how the day was supposed to go. He tried to keep his composure as he paid for the controller and left the store with his tail between his legs.

As Jeffery walked home, all he could think about was how close he had come to getting that Xbox 360. It seemed like fate was just playing games with him, making him dream of something he couldn't have. And yet, as he got closer and closer to home, he began to notice something strange...
