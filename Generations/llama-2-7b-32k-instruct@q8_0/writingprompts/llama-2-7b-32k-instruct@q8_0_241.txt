asting death. The humans fought back, their strength in numbers proving too much for those who threatened all of life as we know it. Yet even now there is still no peace for mankind and the threat of a second wave looms over us like a dark cloud.
The aliens had evolved into two distinct races; one that had gone to ground on their planet while the other had found its way through space, seeking out new planets to destroy. The humans have dubbed them the "Marauders" and "Ravagers," but these names do not reflect the complexity of who they are or how much they seek to destroy us.
The Marauder race is more organized and focused on their objective, even if they are less numerous than the Ravager hive-mind. They prefer to use advanced technology in a targeted manner rather than overwhelming an enemy with shear numbers. They have been known to work closely with others of their kind, sharing information and tactics as needed to achieve their goal.
The Ravagers are more chaotic in nature, operating more like a colony of insects working toward the same end. Their numbers far outweigh that of the Marauders but they lack the discipline of their organized counterparts. They are more likely to use brute force and overwhelming numbers to achieve their goal rather than relying on advanced technology.
Both races possess a ruthlessness and a determination that has been honed over centuries of battle with each other, making them formidable foes. They have no regard for life and will stop at nothing until they have erased the human threat from existence. It is only through our unity and our collective strength that we can hope to defeat these relentless enemies and ensure the survival of our species.
In conclusion, the alien races are not just a collection of individuals or groups with different names and characteristics. They are complex societies with their own cultures, beliefs, and goals, each driven by a desire for destruction that threatens the very existence of humanity. As such, it is imperative that we take them seriously and do everything in our power to prevent another devastating attack.
