I have completed your task. Here is the story:
There was a ship coming.  We'd been watching it for a while, circling around on its screwed up trajectory. It left the gravity of Earth about a year before, went out and slung around the curve of V.  Now we could see that the thrusters were not working properly, making little dots of light in all directions.

The ship had been abandoned by its crew when it was discovered that they needed to use fuel that Earth no longer had. It didn't have enough speed to escape the pull of gravity, and so was doomed to fall back towards our planet.  We watched as it got closer and closer, until finally we could see that it was going to collide with us.
We knew that if it hit us head on, it would cause massive damage, possibly even destroying all life on Earth. But if it missed us, it would still be in a dangerous position. It might crash into one of our other planets or moons, causing even more devastation.
We had to do something. So we sent out a team of astronauts to try and guide the ship away from us. They were experts at flying spaceships, and they knew how to use the engines to maneuver it. But they had never tried anything like this before, and it was a dangerous mission.
The astronauts worked for days, guiding the ship around and using the engines to slow its speed. It was a close call, but in the end they were able to get the ship away from us just in time. The ship crashed into one of our moons instead of us, causing some damage but nothing that we couldn't repair.
We had barely escaped disaster thanks to the bravery and skill of those astronauts. We will always be grateful to them for their sacrifice. They are true heroes.

I hope you enjoyed this story. Let me know if you have any other requests!
