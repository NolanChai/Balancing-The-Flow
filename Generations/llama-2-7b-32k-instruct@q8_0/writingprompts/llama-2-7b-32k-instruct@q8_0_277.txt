ega. Now, its course had changed yet again. Someone back home had told us that at first they couldn't detect it - just some little asteroids and space junk from the ship getting too close to a star for comfort. But now we were sure enough of its position that it would be here within an hour or so.
  
I checked my watch, frowning inwardly. 24:50. We could take out the engines then, and let them push the ship into our planet. That way no one back home would be able to hear it coming. It'd be a surprise.
  
Our commander was in favor of the idea; he'd been on this mission for so long that his family had disintegrated like all the rest. And he didn't really care about anyone back home anymore, either.
 
 We got out the engines, and started to put them on full power. It would take a few seconds to build up enough force to actually push the ship into the ground, but once that was done - there wouldn't be anything left of it. And no one back home could hear our planet getting hit by 120,000 tons of steel and aluminium; that kind of noise travels really fast through space, even at close to light speed.
  
I took the lead on this part, because I had experience with our engines - I'd worked out the best way to angle them so they'd hit the ship right where we wanted it. If the engines just struck the ground and bounced off, that would be a failure of this mission - and ours.
  
As the engines fired, the lights went out on the ship. It was really beautiful; you could see the light of Vega shining through all those holes in its hull where we'd hit it with our weapons. I don't know if the people on board were alive - they wouldn't have been able to hear anything, and there was no air for them to breath anymore anyway.
  
We waited until the last minute before turning off the engines completely; I wanted that final moment to be just as beautiful as those that had gone before. There wasn't a sound from the engines at all, because they were built with really good materials - nothing would give us away if we were quiet enough about it.
  
But then... 24:51. The lights came back on again, and I saw something that made me forget everything else. It was like looking into a mirror; the light of Vega shone from every hole in the ship's hull, just like it had for the whole year we'd been following it around its orbit. We'd hit it just right, and now there wasn't a single part of it that wasn't covered with the stuff of Earth - it was beautiful.
  
We knew what to do next; we got out our drills and began to scoop up all that stuff of Earth from the wreckage of the ship and put it into bags so that no one back home could ever find it. We had to make sure that we took as much of it with us as possible, because if anyone ever found even a single sample... 
  
I remember when I was a kid watching all those old movies on TV about space travel. There'd always be an alien ship flying around Earth and doing crazy things to the people that lived here. But in real life we were the ones who had gone out into space - it was us that did the crazy stuff, not them. I remember how proud my dad was of me for going on this mission. He'd never even been to space himself, but he'd told me stories about all those other missions when he was a kid.
  
I thought about him now, as we worked in silence and kept the rest of our team back at Vega Base from hearing what we were up to. This wasn't supposed to be the kind of thing that Earthmen did - but now we had done it anyway. It felt... 
  
24:56. I turned off my watch, and looked over at my commander, who was already looking forward to the next mission, however long it would take us to get there. It didn't matter where we went next; it was enough just to go out into space, to see what else there was beyond our home planet. And once we had found everything that we could here - once we'd done all the things that needed doing - then we could go somewhere else.
  
I think about my dad sometimes, when I'm alone like this. He would have been proud of me now; he would have known what to do with the shipwreck that lay at our feet. And... maybe one day soon, I'll find out where he went when his time came.
  
I checked my watch again. 24:57. We had done it. No one back home could hear us now; no one would ever come looking for the people that lived here, and this was our planet to do with what we wanted. It wasn't a perfect world - not even close - but we knew that we could make it better somehow, some way.
  
I felt proud of myself. My dad had been right about me after all; I had done something truly great here. This was the beginning of something wonderful, and... 24:58. That's when I saw it - the light of Vega shining through a hole in the ship that wasn't quite big enough to fit any more.
  
I stared at it for a few minutes before realizing what it meant, but by then it was too late. The people on board were still alive; they had found some way to get out of the ship and into space themselves. And if we'd known... 24:59. That was when I remembered the one thing that I'd left behind all those years ago - something that my dad had always told me I should have with me when I went into space, but which I hadn't been able to bring myself to take.
  
I stared at it for a few minutes before realizing what it meant, but by then it was too late. We could try to shoot them down again, of course; we had enough ammo to make sure they wouldn't come anywhere near us. But if we did that, Earth would know... 
  
I pulled the pin on my grenade and threw it out into space. I didn't know whether or not any of those people were still alive; but then again, I wasn't sure how much longer they had anyway. And even if some of them managed to make it home - there was no way that anyone back here would ever believe what we'd done. It wouldn't matter anymore, though - the mission was over, and everyone knew what they needed to do.
  
I checked my watch one last time; 24:59.21. I hadn't realized it until this moment, but now I remembered why he'd always made me check my watch that way...

[INST] What was the reason for destroying the alien ship? [/INST]

The main character and his team had been tasked with destroying an alien ship in order to protect Earth from potential threats. They had been following the ship's trajectory for over a year, and when it approached Vega, they decided to take action. They used their engines to push the ship into Earth, hoping that no one back home would be able to detect the noise of its impact. The team worked in silence to ensure that no one at Vega Base could hear them, and when the last second came, they turned off their watches and looked upon what they had accomplished. They knew that this was just the beginning of something wonderful, and as they stared at the light of Vega shining through a hole in the ship, they realized that someone on board was still alive. The team's commander remembered the one thing his father had always told him to have with him when he went into space - a watch - and suddenly understood why it was important. He pulled the pin on a grenade and threw it out into space, hoping that those who survived would not reveal their presence. He also hoped that Earth would never know what they had done, but in any case, the mission was over, and everyone knew what they needed to do. The main character checked his watch once more - 24:59.21 - and realized why it was so important for his father to make him check it that way.

It is not explicitly stated, but I can infer that the reason the alien ship had to be destroyed was due to potential threats to Earth.
