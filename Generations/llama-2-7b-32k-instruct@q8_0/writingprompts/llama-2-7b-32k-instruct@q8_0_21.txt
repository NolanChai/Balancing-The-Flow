`` It's for her own good...'' the man with cold eyes said. 

 `` You're a monster!'' I replied. I was with children protective services, my agency had heard a rumor of a local psych ward'rehabilitation center and brought Lilly in for observation. 

After a quick tour of the facility I knew it was not right for her. She has been through so much already. Her parents were killed when she was very young and placed with an abusive foster family that only wanted to use her as a slave. Even after they found out about her psychic powers they still kept her locked up in the basement. I had rescued her from their clutches just 2 days ago. She has been through so much, it's not right to put her here where she will only be used for medical experiments and made an object of. 

`` I'm afraid you do not have a choice in the matter'' he said as he took Lilly from me. ``You are under arrest for kidnapping and interference with a child's welfare''

I quickly called my boss on my cellphone, he asked if this was true, I replied that it was. He told me not to resist because the officers were well armed. 

As they took Lilly away from me my heart broke into pieces and the tears fell like rain. How could this be happening? She just needs time to recover and learn how to control her powers. It's a shame that so many people are afraid of her and think she is a monster, when really she is a survivor who just wants to live her life in peace.

I was taken to the station where I was interrogated about Lilly's past and my reasons for taking her from the ward. The police were sympathetic but they knew that I had no legal grounds to keep her, so they placed a hold on her release. 

I have filed paperwork to take temporary custody of Lilly until she is deemed fit to live in the outside world without being a danger to others or herself. This was granted and Lilly has been released into my care for now. But I know that they will be watching our every move and taking her back at any time. We need to find a way for Lilly to live a normal life where she can heal from the traumas of the past few years without fear or violence being directed towards her.

I'm not sure how we will do it but I know that we will figure out something because we are on the right side of this fight and no matter what obstacles stand in our way, we will overcome them to give Lilly a chance at a normal life. She deserves so much more than what she has had to endure.

I hope that you all are doing well. I know it's been a long time since my last post but things have been crazy and I wanted to make sure that Lilly was safe before writing again.
