I was at my first race. It was the last race in the season, and I was in a fierce competition to stay in contention for the championship. But I had to wait out the final lap while two other riders finished ahead of me, both of whom were fighting each other hard. Finally, on the last turn, I went around the outside and got the lead with only one more lap to go. The finish line was up ahead, but in front of me was a massive crash caused by a rider who had lost control at high speed. He careened into me, and my bike hit the ground hard. 
  
 I tried to get back on my feet and run towards them as they pulled out their phones to call for help. They were already getting ready to lift the helicopter away when someone yelled "Don't bother". 
  
 As it turns out, that crash was a blessing in disguise. It put me in a neck brace and I missed the next race. But because of the crash, I didn't have any pain to deal with on my way back home from the track that day, and so when I arrived at my house, I immediately went downstairs to check my email. There was a message from my agent saying "I got you a meeting with Team Sigma". 
  
 This was an opportunity that no one in the world could have given me at the time - especially not on such short notice! It took only 5 minutes for them to tell me I was good enough to ride for them. And so, within days of my crash, I became a professional road racing cyclist with the biggest team in the sport. That's why when they say you have to be ready at all times, that's exactly what I mean. 
  
 If I hadn't been injured, I would have been out for another month or two, and who knows how far behind I would have gotten. And if I had never met Team Sigma, I might still just be riding around on a bike at the local park. But instead, I was already there in time to start the season with them. So no matter what happens, you always need to keep moving forward. You don't know when that next opportunity will come along. 
  
 Because of the crash and my subsequent injury, I had a lot more time to reflect on where I was in my career as well as who I am as an athlete. And I realized how much work there still is for me to do if I want to be at the level of the top guys. So now, every day that I go out on the road or train indoors, it's always with a specific goal in mind: "How can I improve my fitness?" and "What can I learn from this workout that will help me in my next race?" 
  
 The other thing about being injured is that you get to sit down and talk to people. You realize how much everyone around the team really cares for each other. And you see how they're willing to do anything they can to make sure you recover fully, whether it's making food for you or taking your dog out. 
  
 One of my biggest takeaways from all this is that there are so many people who have helped me get where I am today: my parents for putting up with the insane hours and travel; my friends who have always been supportive, no matter how busy they were in their own lives; and my coaches and teammates. So now whenever I feel like I've got it all figured out, I just remember that there are so many people counting on me to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be - not only for myself, but also for them. And then I keep working hard.
