itive and that is something that will never change. But now it's time for some new challenges, and I know that I can count on my team to be there beside me.   
  
 [INST] The first day of the school year was always a special one in our house. We would gather around the kitchen table while Mom made breakfast, with all the children lined up across from Dad like miniature adults. My father would read a Psalm and pray for each child. This morning I asked my brother, "Will you tell us about your dreams?"
  [/INST]
My daddy was a preacher in rural Kentucky. On Sunday mornings we'd travel to the little church where he served. As kids, we would sit up front in a pew and watch him deliver the sermon from the pulpit. Whenever I looked around me, all of the folks were smiling at us. It was a wonderful feeling.
  
 In 1953, when my youngest sister was born, my dad started writing a series of books about our family and the history of Appalachia in the South. As a result, we became known as "the singing family." We performed at churches, schools, and festivals all over the United States. Daddy wrote and published twelve books and three dozen songs during his lifetime. I was too young to join them on tour, but I traveled with him sometimes when he preached in other states or visited family members.
  
 In 1956 my dad got a job teaching history at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, so we moved from the hills of south central Kentucky to small town Kentucky. Mom and Dad were busy raising children while also sharing their music with others. I was just eight years old but always loved to hear them play.
  
 My daddy's family came from Pennsylvania Dutch country in Berks County, where our last name is spelled "Kauffman." However, my grandfather changed the spelling when he immigrated to America because he didn't want to be mistaken for a German! (A lot of people were still fighting World War I!)
  
 Our family always liked to sing. My dad's mother taught music to the children in her home and often invited others to join in. As a result, we became very good musicians when we grew up. So our parents decided they would use their talents as a way to share God's word with others.
  
 I am the youngest of six children. My brother, James, is three years older than me and my sister, Janet, is two years older. My other siblings are Ruth, Doris, David, and Howard. We were all born in rural Kentucky except for Ruth who was born on a farm near Eureka, Missouri.
  
 When I was just 17 months old, Daddy built us a house outside of town where we would live as a family. All our brothers and sisters had their own room, and there were two bedrooms for my parents too! Mom worked hard to make that house beautiful inside and out. It really was a special place.
  
 I have always loved the mountains and the people in Appalachia where we grew up. As I look back now, it seems like our lives were filled with music every day of the week.

I am from rural Kentucky, born and raised. My family has a long history of singing gospel music, and my father was a preacher. He wrote books and songs about Appalachia, and our family became known as "the singing family." We traveled the country performing in churches, schools, and festivals. My dad taught me to play the piano when I was young, and I loved it. I am the youngest of six siblings, and we all grew up in a house he built for our family outside of town. My parents worked hard to make sure it was beautiful both inside and out.

Growing up in rural Kentucky has been wonderful. We have always loved music, and my father's mother taught us how to play instruments when we were young. Our family decided to use our talents as a way to share God's word with others. I am the youngest of six children, and I have many fond memories of growing up in rural Kentucky. 

  
 [INST] The first day of school was always something special for me because it meant time away from working on the farm. But I also loved learning. My father believed that education is important so he made sure to help me get a good one, even if he had to make sacrifices along the way.

My name is Linda Kauffman and I grew up in rural Kentucky in the early 1900s. As a child, my family had very little money, so my father made sure I got an education even if it meant working hard on the farm to help pay for it. He believed that education was important for me and wanted me to have every opportunity available.

Growing up, I loved learning new things and looked forward to going to school each day. My father sacrificed a lot to make sure I had the opportunity to learn. He would work long hours on the farm during the week and then spend Saturday mornings teaching me what he could. This was in addition to the regular school days that we had throughout the week.

My dad also made sure to encourage me to participate in extra-curricular activities, such as sports or music groups, to help develop my skills further. He believed that it was important for me to have a well-rounded education and to learn how to work with others.

Overall, my father's sacrifices and support helped me to get an education and achieve success in life. I am grateful for all he did for me and know that without him, I would not be where I am today.

 [INST] My dad was a great man with a big heart who taught us to serve others. He never complained about anything, always found the good in every situation, and had faith in God that everything would work out for His purposes. And he loved his family dearly. When I was 10 years old we moved from the farm where my dad grew up in rural Kentucky to a suburb of Chicago so Daddy could pursue an opportunity with his job. We always missed our home and our friends, but our dad made it fun by showing us around our new city and encouraging us to explore and find new places to go. He was always there when we needed him, whether we were sad or happy. And he always had a way of making me laugh no matter what I was going through. We loved our daddy so much!
