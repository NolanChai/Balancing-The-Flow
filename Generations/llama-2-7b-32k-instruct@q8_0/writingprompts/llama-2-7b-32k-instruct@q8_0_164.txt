nt seen another person like myself before, and I am overcome by confusion.
'I think you have a very rare condition called Trigonocephaly.' said the doctor. 'It means that your head is shaped like a triangle instead of round like everyone elses. It's not common, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. I promise! ''
I am stunned into silence by this revelation. The doctor continues, 'You will want to start wearing hats from now on to protect your face from the sun and rain. And you might want to get some sunglasses if you're going out in public.'
'Thank goodness I have a rare condition that no one else has,' I say sarcastically. The doctor chuckles, 'I'm glad you take it all in stride.'
As we part ways, I can't help but feel a sense of disbelief. Is this really happening to me? Am I being pranked by my classmates again? Or is this some sort of twisted joke? But as I look at the doctor, who is clearly not joking and has a very serious expression on his face, I realize that this is no joke. My life is forever changed.
I walk out of the doctors office, my head spinning with new information. As I make my way home, I cant help but think about what it means to have a rare condition like Trigonocephaly. What kind of challenges will this bring me in the future? Will people treat me differently because of it? And most importantly, how do I explain this to my family and friends?
As I arrive home, I find that my mom has already heard about what happened from a friend of ours who works at the hospital. She is shocked and worried, but also trying her best to stay positive. 'I'm sure you will be fine,' she says with a smile. 'Just try not to worry too much.'
But as I lie in bed that night, my mind racing with thoughts of what the future holds, I cant help but feel overwhelmed. Is this really happening to me? Am I being pranked by my classmates again? Or is this some sort of twisted joke? But as I look at the ceiling, I realize that this is no joke. My life is forever changed.
I know that it's not easy for her, having a child with such a rare condition. But she has always been there for me, no matter what. And I am grateful to have her in my life. As I drift off to sleep, I cant help but wonder what the future holds for someone like me. Will people treat me differently because of it? And most importantly, how do I explain this to my family and friends?
As I wake up the next morning, I know that today will be a day filled with challenges and surprises. But as I get ready for school, I am determined to face them head on. Because no matter what, I am still me. And nothing can change that.
''

How...?'' I ask, looking at this stranger, someone with the same name as me. How can this be? Is it a glitch in the naming system, some sort of unknown error, or has my whole life been a lie? I havnt seen another person like myself before, and I am overcome by confusion.
