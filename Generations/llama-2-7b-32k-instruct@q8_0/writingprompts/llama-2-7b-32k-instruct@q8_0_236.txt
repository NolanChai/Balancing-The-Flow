was born .

Millions of people started posting their every waking moment onto the world wide web for millions more to see, just in case someone they once knew might happen by and want to know how awesome they are now that they have a facebook account. They also would upload pictures of themselves from 5 years ago when they were a little fat or maybe even a little skinny but most importantly, had no clue what was going on in the world, let alone their own life. People found out things about each other that they never wanted to know. Someone is getting divorced? Oh great! I can't wait until my wife finds out! My best friends from high school are still the same old people who liked to drink too much and act like idiots, only now they're on facebook! And let's not forget about those ex-girlfriends! Wow, what a surprise it was when I saw that she had gotten fat! My goodness, how awful of life to have this many people that I will never see again in my lifetime and yet I get to be friends with them on facebook.

I'm not sure if facebook is actually the end or just another step towards the end, but it sure as hell has made things a lot more complicated in what was once a simple world of making new friends by sitting next to someone at lunch . Now that we have millions of people following our every move on facebook, how can you not get freaked out? I mean think about it. You're walking down the street and some crazy person sees you and decides he wants to kill you, but instead of just killing you right then and there like they would in 1982 or before, they decide that they want to wait until facebook is no longer a thing, which could be years from now. They spend those years stalking your every move on the world wide web, finding out all about you that you don't even know yourself and then finally one day... bam! It's like a movie, only it won't be as awesome to see again once you have seen it 27 times.

So what would happen if facebook was gone tomorrow? Well obviously there would be some sad people out there but for the most part we wouldn't lose our minds because life would go back to normal and that's just something we never got used to over the past few years. I'm not sure who created facebook or how they did it, all I know is that if the person who created facebook were still around today he/she would be in jail for crimes against humanity by now because let's face it, nothing good ever came from anything that Mark Zuckerberg was a part of.

To conclude this rant, I will say one more thing about facebook: People on the internet can be very cruel and mean to each other but you know what? If someone doesn't like what you have to say, they don't have to read it! It's that simple. That being said, if you're reading this and you think I am a bad person for not liking facebook, you are welcome to disagree with me because that is your right as an American citizen and one of the things that makes America great is people like myself who have opinions on everything, good or bad. So there you go.

I think this post was more about how much you hate the idea of social media rather than simply disliking Facebook. If you had wanted to write a simple opinion on why people should get over their need for social media outlets, you could have done so in less words and without having to make such personal attacks on a man who really isn't doing anything wrong with the world.

I don't think this post is about disliking facebook or even Mark Zuckerberg. I think it is more of an attack on society as a whole for needing these outlets and a general rant against people who are "always online". If you do not like the internet, that is your problem. But to claim that millions of people would go insane without their online social networks seems rather drastic. I think it might be better if we didn't have all this instant communication... maybe it wouldn't be so bad to just live our own lives once in a while and not worry about how many likes or friends we have on some internet site, which is pretty much irrelevant anyways.

I find your attitude towards people who are "always online" offensive. It seems that you assume that all those people are living sad lives and need to be "saved". You seem to be in complete denial of the fact that technology has had a significant impact on our society over the last few decades. I agree that many people waste their time on social media, but it is not up to you or anyone else to decide how other people live their lives. If someone finds enjoyment out of having an online presence, then they should be allowed to do so and no one should tell them any differently.

You seem to forget that there are millions of people who have found a sense of community on the internet. They may not know you personally or anyone else in their life, but they still feel connected to others through social media. It's just like a high school reunion - some people will be closer than others, and some people will stay close for longer than others, but it doesn't make them any less important or relevant in each other's lives.

I think you are being a little over dramatic. I understand that some people can get addicted to social media and spend too much time on it, but that is a problem that needs to be solved by those individuals themselves rather than society as a whole. If someone wants to be "always online", they should be able to do so without being judged or ostracized by others who think that they are somehow less important because of it. It's not up to anyone else to decide how people live their lives and what kind of hobbies they have.
