The sun was a blue star in the night sky, but it's light still burned hot and bright like usual 
The moon shone down, casting long shadows on the now empty landscape where once there were mountains and valleys.

Everyone was dead. And yet, they gasped as they took the first breath of life. 
 Peace was universal, as was war. 
 
 The earth was scarred and barren, but was more fertile and full of life than ever

Everyone was dead. And yet, they gasped as they took their first breath of life in a world that had been destroyed by war. 
 Peace was universal, but the scars of conflict were still visible on every face. 
 
 The earth was barren and scarred, but it was also fertile and full of new life. 
The sun was a blue star in the night sky, but its light still burned hot and bright like usual. It was a constant reminder of the devastation that had occurred, but also a beacon of hope for the future. 
 The moon shone down, casting long shadows on the now empty landscape where once there were mountains and valleys. Its silvery light reflected off the charred remains of buildings and cities, making them seem even more haunting.   

[INST] make it a story [/INST]

Once upon a time, there was a world filled with life and beauty. The sun shone brightly in a blue sky, the moon glowed silver on the nights, and the stars twinkled in the darkness. But this world was not without its flaws. 
 The people of this world were divided into two groups: those who fought for peace, and those who fought for war. They lived in a constant state of tension, always waiting for the other group to make the first move.

Once upon a time, there was a world filled with life and beauty. The sun shone brightly in a blue sky, the moon glowed silver on the nights, and the stars twinkled in the darkness. But this world was not without its flaws. 
 The people of this world were divided into two groups: those who fought for peace, and those who fought for war. They lived in a constant state of tension, always waiting for the other group to make the first move.   
Their leader was a wise old woman named Helga. She had been watching over them for generations, making sure that they remained at peace with one another. But as she got older, she started to worry about the future. 
One day, while walking in the forest, she came across a group of soldiers. They were young and fierce, ready to fight for their cause. Helga could tell that they were determined to bring an end to the peace between their two groups. 
She approached them cautiously, knowing that they were not afraid of her. She tried to reason with them, but they would have none of it. They wanted war, and they were willing to fight for it.   
Helga knew that she had no choice but to defend her people. She gathered up all the soldiers who were loyal to peace, and together they fought against the fierce young soldiers. It was a long and grueling battle, but in the end, Helga's army won. 
The warriors of peace had triumphed once again, and Helga knew that her people were safe. But she could not help feeling sad at what had been lost. The world that they had once known was gone, replaced by a place where only war existed.   
From that day on, Helga made it her mission to protect her people from the horrors of war. She trained them in battle, preparing them for any threat that might come their way. And though she knew that there would always be those who sought to bring destruction, she also knew that together they could overcome anything.   
The years passed by, and Helga's army continued to grow stronger. They fought off countless enemies, never once giving up or surrendering to the call of war. And though the world remained a dangerous place, Helga was proud to know that her people were safe from harm. 
One day, as she sat watching over the village, she heard a knock at the door. It was a soldier who had just returned from battle. He was covered in blood and dirt, but his eyes shone with determination and pride. Helga knew that he had faced many dangers, but he had come back alive. 
She smiled as she welcomed him into her home, feeling grateful for the protection that he and his fellow warriors provided. She knew that there would always be threats to their peace, but she also knew that with courage and determination, they would always prevail. And so it was that Helga continued to watch over her people, proud of what they had accomplished and hopeful for the future.   
The end.

Helga watched as her people were slaughtered, their homes destroyed. She knew that she had failed them, that she had let them down when they needed
