em and their group of loser friends would be nothing without him...

These words reminded him of all that he had done for them...how they had only ever taken from him. And then suddenly he knew what to do, exactly where to go. He knew how to leave this place. How to find the one person who could help him.

It was time to make the call.

The young man in the woods had a plan now. He had been lost here for so long, but now he knew exactly what needed to be done. And it all came down to making that single phone call.

But before he did, he had one last thought.

He wondered if his friends would even notice he was gone...or care at all. After all, they'd never cared about him much, had they? No, now that he thought about it, they probably wouldn't give a damn. But that didn't matter to him anymore. He was done being used and abused by them. It was time for him to take control of his own life, once and for all.

And so, with a final look around the clearing, he picked up his phone and dialed the number. And as he did, he could feel a sense of freedom and empowerment unlike anything he had ever experienced before. Because he knew that this call would be the beginning of something new for him. Something that would change everything.

The young man in the woods was about to make a choice that would forever change his life. And as he did, he could feel a sense of excitement and anticipation unlike anything he had ever felt before. Because he knew that this was the right thing to do. This was what he was meant to do. This was his destiny.

And with that thought, he clicked on "call" and waited for someone to answer on the other end. Because whatever happened next, he knew that it would be worth it. For once in his life, he was going to take control of his own fate. And he was ready to face whatever came his way.
