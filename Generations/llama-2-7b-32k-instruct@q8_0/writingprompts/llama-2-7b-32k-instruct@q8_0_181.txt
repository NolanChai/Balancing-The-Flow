8/10, would not fuck again. Went to the dentist and had my wisdom teeth removed. It was a nightmare. I don't remember anything about it though because I was put under. But I'm still terrified of going back.

11/10, would fuck again. Went on my first date since I broke up with my ex. It was going great until she told me she doesn't like cats and then it went downhill from there. But at least I got a good story out of it.

7/10, would not fuck again. Had a bad experience with a delivery driver. They brought me the wrong food and then tried to charge me for it. I had to argue with them over the phone and they were still mad when they left.

4/10, would not fuck again. Had a bad time at the airport when I was flying back to my home country. The security check was super intense and they made me take off all my shoes and belt. It was awkward and uncomfortable.
