ous contrast to his peers; outwardly Harold looked like one might expect from such an individual, yet deep within him still lingered a tinge of rustication. Though a true city dweller at heart, the open air seemed to renew him after days spent in the office, and he found it a pleasant change to leave the concrete jungle for the occasional weekend stroll. He was one with nature as he marched through the woods, his gaze scanning the trees ahead for any signs of life.

Harold looked up, expecting to see that tree branch above him but saw none. As he continued to walk onward, a sense of unease began to build within him. He recalled having been in this forest once before, as a child. There were some trees which seemed familiar, others with the memory washed out from his mind. Still Harold marched forward, wondering why he had come and what he hoped to achieve when arriving at the edge of the forest.

He realized then that he felt an irresistible urge to walk deeper inward, to see what lay beyond this dark wood and if it would hold any surprises for him. His gaze fixed forward as he walked with a new sense of purpose. As he entered the trees, his pace quickened. Soon Harold came upon a bend in the path that was covered by overhangs, obscuring the road from view. He had to duck beneath them and found himself in darkness.

Inside the forest, the sun's light was muted and only broken by slanted beams of shafts penetrating through branches above. Harold walked with a growing sense of fear as he listened out for any sounds that might reveal his presence. He recalled walking through these woods once before when younger. Had it really been so long? It seemed like forever ago, but he couldn't recall the details at all.

As he continued onward, Harold thought about how old this forest was and how it had witnessed many changes to the world around it. He wondered what kind of creatures roamed these woods and whether there were any signs of human presence here. Harold suddenly began to feel very alone in this dark place; at times like this he wished that his brother still lived so they could share their childhood memories together.

Harold emerged from the undergrowth onto a clearing, which revealed before him a stream. It was as though he had come full circle and found himself back where he had once begun. But it was different now, for his eyes saw what those of a child could not; he recognized certain features about the trees along the bank that were familiar but did not recall their names. He looked up at the sky and considered his situation, wondering how long he would remain lost in this place and what the consequences might be if he stayed here forever.

He decided to take a step forward, then another as he approached the stream. His feet felt lighter as though an enormous weight had been lifted from them. The water was clear and shallow and seemed to sparkle like diamonds on the bed of the stream. Harold knelt down to dip his hand into it; when he stood back up with water dripping from his fingers, a grin split across his face. He felt as though something had been lifted from his soul.

Suddenly Harold remembered that there was something that he needed to do before leaving this place and looked about for what it might be. He spied an old tree stump not far away and approached it, examining it closely. On the underside of the stump were several carvings and scratches; on closer inspection Harold realized that they had been done by a knife and some tools. He knew then what he needed to do before leaving this place.

He took a deep breath and exhaled, feeling as though his senses had returned to him in full. He turned around one last time at the spot where he had first arrived; there was something about it that he did not like but could not fully put his finger on what it might be. Harold felt suddenly as though this was a place where bad things happened and he had no desire to stay here any longer, although he did not know why.

Harold knew that if he wanted to leave, he would need to find the path he had walked in on so he could retrace his steps. But where was it? He looked back down at the stream for some clue and noticed a small patch of moss growing on the bank that seemed out of place. Harold leaned in closer and saw that it formed the shape of a map of sorts, with roads and paths that radiated away from it.

As he gazed more closely at this curious map, Harold felt his pulse begin to quicken as though he was coming into proximity with some great secret. He found himself reaching out for the patch of moss, feeling an overwhelming compulsion to pull it free and study it in closer detail. But as he did so, he had a strange sensation that something was pulling him away from the spot where the map was located, as though it wanted him to leave.

He felt as though his hand was being guided by some unseen force, and when he pulled at the moss, it tore away from the bank of the stream with a sound like Velcro. In his hands the patch of greenery transformed into something entirely different; it no longer looked like a map but more like a small object in the shape of a key. Harold held this strange thing and felt as though he was holding some great treasure in his hands. He realized then that this must be what he needed to do before leaving the woods.

Harold began to walk out from where he had found this key, using it as a sort of compass to guide him back in the direction that he had come. As he approached the spot where he had first arrived, he felt an enormous sense of relief and knew without any doubt that he was headed home now; there was no place on earth that he would rather be right now than with his loved ones, even if it meant leaving this strange forest behind.

When Harold emerged from the woods once more to rejoin the world outside, he felt as though a great weight had been lifted from him and felt entirely at peace for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. He knew that he needed to find somewhere quiet and secluded where he could reflect on all of this; but before that, he knew that there was one more thing he needed to do.

Harold walked down to a nearby stream and looked at the small key in his hand for some time before taking it into the water, letting it sink and disappear beneath the surface. When he turned back around, Harold saw that he had been transformed; the patch of moss was gone but where once there had been an overgrown forest, now stood a clearing that stretched out as far as his eyes could see. He felt a great sense of joy at having done what he needed to do and knew that it would be some time before these woods were dark again; for now the trees looked healthier than they had in years.

Harold felt that if only he could somehow bottle this feeling, he would never need another thing again. He realized then that he did not want anything else either, for in the brief moment that he had stood there at the stream, Harold understood that life was truly about what one does with the time given to them, rather than amassing possessions and wealth.

As Harold walked back into town, he knew that his whole life would change from this day forward; all of the things in his life were not wrong, they simply no longer served him as well as he needed them to. He had realized that there was something else out there waiting for him, something more important than anything that he could ever own or hold onto. And with a newfound sense of freedom and peace, Harold knew that the rest of his life would be about finding what that was and living it in full.

This is an example of a "free write" done as a writing exercise. The prompt was given to me by someone I follow on Twitter, and it essentially says to imagine you're a character from a book or movie who suddenly finds yourself waking up in the woods without your memories. You need to find a way out, but there are some challenges along the way. The challenges can be anything the prompt gives you (and that is exactly what I got), so this story may not be very good overall, but it's an example of what could happen with such a prompt.

In my version, Harold finds himself waking up in the woods without his memories and needs to find his way out by finding clues or following the path he came in on. He is able to find the path and eventually makes it out of the woods but not before realizing that there was something else waiting for him outside of them.

It's a short story, but I hope it gives you an idea of how such a prompt might go and what you could do with it! Let me know if this helps at all!

How does the story end? ðŸ¤”  
I don't remember writing it lol. But it probably has something to do with him finding his way out of the woods and realizing that there was something else waiting for him outside.   
Is that enough or would you like me to summarize it more? Let me know!

This is a good example of what can happen when writing a free write story; it's not perfect, but it does tell
