After all, they were probably the ones who brought it in. At least that's what he told himself as he watched his classmates die right before his eyes. The virus seemed to target only those who had been cruel or mean-spirited to others throughout their short lives. It was a mercy killing, Jonathan thought with a smile on his face as the school nurse collapsed in front of him. As the days went by and the bodies began to pile up, he realized that this was not what he wanted at all. He didn't want a world without bullies, just one where they got their comeuppance for being jerks. But it was too late; the virus had spread too quickly for anyone to do anything about it. Jonathan was alone now, with no one left to torment him or make his life miserable. He realized that he had been wrong all along and that maybe it wasn't so bad to be different after all. The world might not be perfect, but at least it was full of people who were kind and caring. Jonathan felt a weight lift from his shoulders as he made his way through the school, now empty except for him and the dead bodies littering every hallway and classroom. He knew that this new world would have its challenges, but he was ready to face them head-on. And who knows, maybe someday he'll even find a few friends along the way.
