: it's this godforsaken ringing noise that won't shut up! What is it? Who is it?" 
 
 The voice on the other end of the line is shocked. It had been expecting a polite, reserved answer - instead, the figure before them is irritated and uncouth. There's an edge to their tone that suggests they're not in the best of moods. 
 
 `` Well?'' says the voice on the phone. 
 
 The figure gives a humorless laugh. "I'll tell you what's rude: it's this godforsaken ringing noise that won't shut up! What is it? Who is it?" 
 
 ``We have someone who needs to speak with you,'' says the voice on the phone. It doesn't give their name, but there's a sense of urgency in their tone that can't be ignored. 
 
 The figure sighs again before answering. "Fine. What do they want?" 
 
 The voice on the other end gives a short response: "Ten minutes." 
 
 The figure grumbles something under their breath, but eventually agrees to the terms. They hang up the phone and look around the room, trying to pinpoint where this mysterious person is coming from. 
 
 It's then that they see it - a small, dimly lit door hidden behind a bookshelf in the corner of the room. With a frown, they walk over to it and- 
 
 ``Shit." 
 
... *Crazy*? 
 
 The figure's eyes widen as they realize where this person is coming from. They had been expecting someone who needed help with something - instead, they're confronted by a crazed maniac. 
 
 With a quick flick of their wrist, the figure summons a knife and lunges for their assailant. The blade sinks into flesh, but it isn't what- 
 
 `Fake`?` 
 
 ``I said stop!'' yells the maniac, pulling out his own knife in defense. He stumbles backward, his face filled with panic as he looks down at the figure holding him at bay. 
 
 The figure freezes, their eyes wide. They'd been expecting a friendly person - instead, they're faced with a crazed maniac. 
 
 With shaking hands, the figure sheathes their knife and steps back, giving the maniac some space. 
 
 ``I... I'm sorry," says the maniac, lowering his knife. He takes a deep breath, trying to calm down. "I don't know what came over me. I-" 
 
 The figure cuts him off, nodding with understanding. They reach into their pocket and pull out a small object - a key. 
 
 ``Here," they say, handing it to the maniac. ``Take this." 
 
 The maniac looks at the key in confusion. He doesn't understand what it is or how it got there - but he takes it nonetheless. 
 
 With a nod, the figure turns and walks out of the room. They leave behind a confused- 
 
 `Batman`?` 
 
 The maniac looks at the key in his hand. He doesn't understand what it is or how it got there - but he takes it nonetheless. With a nod, the figure turns and walks out of the room. They leave behind a confused-looking figure. 
 
 But as soon as they disappear from sight, the maniac looks at the key in his hand with a frown. He doesn't understand what it is or how it got there - but he knows that it's important. With a determined look on his face, he slips the key into the small door hidden behind the bookshelf and- 
 
 ``No!'' cries out the figure in the room. But it's too late - the maniac is already inside the hidden room. 
 
 And what they find there will change their life forever...

It was a dark, stormy night, the house was dimly lit, and the phone was ringing. With a quiet sigh, a figure rose from the shadows and- 
 
 `` No.''
