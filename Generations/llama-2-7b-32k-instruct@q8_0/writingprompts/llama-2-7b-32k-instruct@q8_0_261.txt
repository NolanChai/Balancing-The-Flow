King Caleb was a hard man, but even he could not help but be moved by his daughter's bravery. She stood in the center of his throne room, her chin tilted defiantly as she faced him. The king knew that she had grown up with a deep love for animals and an independent spirit, but he had never seen either of those traits in such a fierce display before. "You truly love this stableboy," he said, his voice softened by the sight of her determination.

King Caleb sighed as he looked at his daughter. He knew that she was right, and he could not bring himself to deny her. "Very well," he said, "I will allow your marriage." The king's voice held a hint of regret, for he had always thought that his daughter would marry well and join the aristocracy. But he also knew that this was what his daughter wanted, and he could not bear to deny her that.

The king rose from his throne and walked over to his daughter. He placed a hand on her shoulder and smiled down at her. "I am proud of you, my dear," he said. "You have shown me more love and courage than I ever thought possible. You are truly a Princess."

The King's words brought tears to Lady Jasmine's eyes as she hugged him tightly. She knew that her father had never been one for showy displays of affection, but the way he spoke to her was more precious than any crown. "Thank you, Father," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I love you so much."

With his daughter's words still hanging in the air, King Caleb returned to his throne and sat down. He knew that this would not be the last time they argued, but he also knew that their bond had grown stronger because of it. The king watched as his daughter left the throne room, her hand held by her beloved stableboy. And although he was still a hard man at heart, King Caleb could not help but feel a sense of pride and contentment as he looked at the pair. For in that moment, he knew that his daughter had found true love and happiness.
