do you? '' asked His Majesty.
 
 Anne nodded.  
 
 The King sighed and turned to leave.  He would not be the one to stand in the way of true love.  He could only hope that his daughter's heart would change once she came out of her infatuation with this stable boy.  With a wave, he left.
 
 Anne waited for him to leave before turning back to Martha and whispering, "Martha, I have something very important to tell you. The King has just given me permission to marry Jack Bracenby."  
 
 Martha's eyes lit up with joy as she exclaimed, "Oh my dear Anne, that is wonderful news! I knew he would see the light one day and give his consent. I am so happy for you both!"  She gave her friend a big hug before sitting down at the table to help prepare dinner.

Meanwhile, Jack had been hard at work in the stable. He was cleaning out the stalls and preparing the horses for the next day's work. Suddenly, he heard hoof beats approaching. It was Anne.  She looked radiant as she rode into the stable on her horse. 

"Jack! I have some wonderful news!" she exclaimed. "The King has given me permission to marry you!"  Jack couldn't believe his ears. He had dreamed of this moment for so long and now it was finally here. Anne continued, "I know that we come from different worlds, but my father sees the good in your heart and wants us to be together."
 
 Jack's heart swelled with emotion as he took Anne in his arms. "My dear sweet Anne, I have loved you for as long as I can remember," he said. "I am so grateful that we will be able to spend the rest of our lives together."  
 
 Anne and Jack spent the rest of the day celebrating their engagement. They laughed and joked and dreamed about their future together. And when it was time for Anne to leave, she took one last look at her beloved Jack and knew that this was truly the beginning of happily ever after.

The following day, Anne rode into the palace to break the news to her father. The King looked up from his paperwork with a surprised expression on his face when he saw Anne. 

"Father, I have something very important to tell you," said Anne confidently. "I am engaged to be married."  
 
 The King's expression changed from surprise to confusion as he asked, "Engaged? To whom?" 

Anne smiled and replied, "To Jack Bracenby, the stable boy. Father, I know that we come from different worlds, but my heart belongs with him."  
 
 The King sighed heavily and nodded. He had hoped that his daughter's love for Jack would pass, but it seemed that she was indeed serious about this stable boy. He smiled sadly and said, "Very well, Anne. I will not stand in the way of true love."  
 
 Anne threw her arms around her father's neck and gave him a big hug. She knew that he had been forced into this decision, but she was grateful that he had given his consent. She was also thankful for Martha's kindness and support throughout the years. Without her dear friend, she would never have met Jack or found true love.

As time passed, Anne and Jack began to plan their wedding. They chose a beautiful location in the countryside, surrounded by rolling hills and green pastures. The day was filled with laughter, music, and love as they said their vows to each other. And when it came time for them to ride off into the sunset together, Anne knew that she had found her happily ever after.

Years went by, and Anne and Jack lived a happy life together. They had three beautiful children, who grew up surrounded by love and laughter. Anne's father had come to terms with their marriage and even became a grandfather figure for his grandchildren. And Martha? She continued to be Anne and Jack's closest friend, always there to lend a listening ear or a helping hand.

The King looked at his daughter as she stood defiant in the face of his wrath. Never before had he seen such strength nor courage and it moved his heart of stone. 
 
 `` You truly love this stableboy, do you? '' asked His Majesty.
 
 Anne nodded.  
 
 The King sighed and turned to leave. He knew that the stable boy was not of a noble background but he also believed in true love. He would not stand in the way of his daughter's happiness. With a wave, he left.
