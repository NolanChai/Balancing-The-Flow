Wealthy had a small wooden house with only two rooms that he called home. He lived alone except for the cat named Bites People. One day Wealthy heard a thump and then came screams from his room. Wealthy rushed into his bedroom to find Bites People kneeling next to him, her hand on his leg. The cat was telling Wealthy to get off. 

Wealthy stared at the cat, wondering why it had suddenly decided to give him orders and start talking like a human. He shook his head and petted Bites People's head. "You need to stop this," he said firmly. The cat looked up at Wealthy, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'll never tell," she purred. 

Wealthy laughed and returned to his desk, feeling a little bit lighter than before. He had always been close with Bites People, but he had never thought that the cat would start speaking to him like a human. It was strange, but also kind of exciting. From that day on, Bites People continued to talk to Wealthy in her meow-speak, and he found himself enjoying their little conversations. 

As time passed, Wealthy realized that Bites People wasn't just any ordinary cat. She was a special feline with a lot of wisdom and personality. He would often find her sitting on his lap as he worked, meowing gently in his ear or purring softly against his leg. Bites People had become more than just a pet; she was a friend and a confidant. 

Wealthy never told anyone about Bites People's strange ability to speak, not even his closest friends. He knew that they would think he was crazy, or maybe that the cat was possessed by some sort of evil spirit. But Wealthy didn't care what others thought; he had found a friend in Bites People, and that was all that mattered. 

In the years to come, Wealthy continued to live with Bites People, who remained his constant companion until the end of her days. And though she never stopped meowing or purring, the way Bites People spoke to him had changed. Her words were still full of wisdom and kindness, but now they came in a different language - the language of love. 

When Wealthy died, Bites People disappeared. The house was sold, and new owners moved in, taking everything except for Wealthy's journals and papers. They found nothing unusual or strange, just an old man who had lived alone with his cat for many years. But Wealthy knew the truth; he had lived with a special feline who had touched his heart and changed his life forever. 

As for Bites People, she went on to live another life, one without humans to worry about or love. She spent her days wandering the streets, exploring new places and meeting new friends. But no matter where she went, there was always a piece of Wealthy's heart that followed her, a reminder of their special bond. 

And so, Bites People lived on, her story untold to anyone but Wealthy. But he knew the truth, and that was enough for him. For in his heart, there was always a memory of the cat who had spoken to him, and the love that they shared. 

The end.
