queezed my own hand around the man's neck and started to squeeze, until he choked and his eyes rolled back in his head. 
 
 Bites People let go of Wealthy's leg. Her jaw hung open and tears dripped down her face. 
 
 "You...killed him..." 
 
 She didn't say anything else. I pushed her out of the room, then ran back over to check on Wealthy. His eyes were still closed, but his skin had gone white as a ghost and he was breathing in short little gasps. He wouldn't be alive for long. 
 
 "What happened?" He asked. It wasn't the kind of question I could answer; I couldn't stop looking at Bites People. 
 
 She tried to say something, but nothing came out. I took her by the arm and pulled her towards the door. Wealthy started to stir as I did this. 
 
 "Don't kill them...don't kill anybody," he said weakly. His voice was fading fast, like it would soon disappear completely. But Bites People seemed frozen in place; she didn't even move when I pushed her out of the room and shut the door behind us. 
 
 When I turned back around to Wealthy, he had collapsed to the side of his bed. His eyes were still open, but they had gone blank. His breathing had stopped completely; he was dead. 
 
 "We'll take care of them," I said to him. I didn't know what that meant exactly, or how it would be done, but Wealthy didn't need to know that. He didn't need to know anything.
