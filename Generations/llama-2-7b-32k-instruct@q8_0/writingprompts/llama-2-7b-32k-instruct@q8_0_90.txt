I looked at the security guard. I was to be sentenced for execution in two days, and he was complaining about people living too long? That's rich. "Listen, buddy," I said, "you don't have to worry about me living too long. I'll be dead in a few days anyway." The security guard didn't like my tone, but he knew I was right.
