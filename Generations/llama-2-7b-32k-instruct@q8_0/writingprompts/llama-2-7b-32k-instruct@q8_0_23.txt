Eve opened her eyes slowly and turned on her side. The pain in her chest was excruciating but she knew it was coming. She'd be dead before the day was over. With a heavy sigh she rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling, tears rolling down her cheeks. "Why did God have to pick me?" She whispered softly to herself. 

Eve had always been a happy person but these last few years had been hard on her. Her heart was failing, her lungs were giving out and her joints were starting to ache. She'd had to give up most of her hobbies and the doctors had warned her that she wouldn't see her next birthday if things didn't improve soon. Eve knew it was coming but it still didn't make it any easier. 

With a heavy sigh, she got out of bed and walked into her kitchen. She stood in front of the refrigerator for a moment, looking at all of the food she couldn't eat. It was hard to watch everyone else live their lives when you knew you were dying. Eve took a deep breath and forced herself to look up at the calendar on the fridge. It was February 14th - her 30th birthday. She sighed again, feeling old. 

"Why did God have to pick me?" She whispered softly to herself as she walked back into her bedroom. She closed the door behind her and lay down on her bed. She knew what was coming but it didn't make it any easier. Eve shut her eyes tight, trying to block out the pain that was sure to come in a few hours time.
