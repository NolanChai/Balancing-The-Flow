The noble warriors were oblivious to their pursuer. They were focused on the impending fight ahead. One warrior held a silver sword in his right hand while the other wielded a long white spear. The duo took deep breaths, ready for battle and eager for the adrenaline rush that came with it.

The mist parted ways to reveal the predator: a sleek, black panther. Its muscles rippled as it stalked closer. The noble warriors didn't notice until it was too late - the panther had already sprung. 

With a swift movement of its paws, the panther brought down the white warrior's spear with ease, sending him crashing to the ground. Before he could recover, the panther leapt at him, teeth bared in an aggressive growl. The black warrior lunged forward to defend his friend, but was met with a fierce swipe of the panther's paw. He stumbled back, dazed, as the panther pounced on his fallen comrade.

The silver-armored warrior watched in disbelief as the panther tore into his friend's chest, clawing and biting with vicious ferocity. The black warrior tried to fend off the panther, but its strength was unmatched. He knew he had to act fast - if he didn't intervene soon, his friend would die.

With a swift movement of his sword, the silver-armored warrior slashed through the air, aiming for the panther's head. The panther ducked and twisted out of the way just in time, but not before it tore off another piece of flesh from the black warrior's leg.

The battle raged on, the panther relentless in its pursuit of the black warrior. He struggled to keep up, his movements clumsy and slow, while the panther's reflexes were honed by instinct. The silver-armored warrior knew he had to end this quickly before it was too late - for both his friend and himself.

With a final, desperate effort, the silver-armored warrior lunged forward, sword flashing in the sunlight as he brought it down upon the panther's head with all of his strength. The panther let out a shrill scream as its skull was split open, blood splattering onto the ground below.

The black warrior lay lifeless on the grass, the panther's teeth marks still visible on his chest. The silver-armored warrior stood over him, sword raised in victory. He knew he had lost a friend today, but he also knew that he had saved another. And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving the two bodies to be discovered by others who would come later.
