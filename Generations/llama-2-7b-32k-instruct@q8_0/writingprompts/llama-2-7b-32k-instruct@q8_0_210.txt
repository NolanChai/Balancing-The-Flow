happened. That was... hard. I wondered if he would be able to tell me what happened when it was all over.

I turned around and looked at the girl again. She was staring blankly at nothing, her face showing no sign of pain or anguish. It was like she wasn't even there anymore. Maybe she had gone into shock already. I thought about calling for help, but it was too late. And besides, who would hear me? The girl was far off in the wilderness with only one other person that they could trust to keep them alive - and now, she was lying dead in a pool of her own blood.

I turned back around and looked at Joseph Walker. It wasn't just him I had failed to protect; it was the girl, too. There were two people in this world who needed me as their guardian, and one of them was dead because of me. My stomach churned with guilt as I tried to decide what to do next.

But before I could answer that question, something changed. A low, growling noise filled the air - it came from outside the shelter, echoing off the trees. It wasn't just one animal; there were at least two of them. They were stalking us, and they sounded angry. My heart raced as I realized that we didn't have much time left to live if we wanted to survive this.

I knew what I had to do. I turned back to the girl and looked into her eyes one last time. "We need to run," I told her. She looked up at me blankly, seeming confused by my words. "We have to move now before it's too late," I said more forcefully. Her face lit up with understanding as she stood up slowly, and I knew that I had made the right decision.

I ran out of the shelter first, looking around for any sign of where we were or what was going on. The forest seemed to stretch on forever in every direction, and there wasn't much light coming through the trees. It was like being lost at night except worse - I didn't even know which way was up. My heart pounded as I tried to find my way out of this trap before it was too late.

I heard a scuffling noise behind me and looked back, just in time to see the girl stumble out of the shelter after me. She stared blankly ahead of her as she ran, seeming disoriented by everything that had happened. I didn't know what else to do so I grabbed her hand and pulled her along with me, running faster and faster until we were both panting from exhaustion.

But still, we kept going. We needed to find somewhere safe to hide before those animals found us, or else... it was clear that there wasn't any time for delay. Our only chance of survival lay in getting away as fast as possible. So I pulled the girl along with me, running through the forest until my lungs burned and my legs felt like they were about to give out.

And then, finally, we saw it - a small clearing ahead of us. We both ran towards it without stopping, hoping that this would be our salvation from whatever was chasing us. As soon as we got there, I stopped dead in my tracks. There, right in front of the entrance to the clearing, was Joseph Walker.

He looked up at me and saw that something had changed. "What's going on?" he asked in a low voice, his eyes darting back and forth between the girl and myself. "We need to get out of here now," I told him without hesitation. He nodded grimly and turned around just as two animals burst through the trees into the clearing.

I saw what was happening - they were lions, big cats with gleaming golden eyes that made me shudder in fear. They ran straight for us, their claws outstretched and ready to strike. And then, just as it seemed like we might not make it out alive... a lightning bolt struck from the sky above us, illuminating everything in a brilliant blue flash of light.

The two lions froze where they stood, confused by the sudden change around them. The girl and I took advantage of this distraction to run even faster than before. We ran through the clearing and out into the forest beyond as fast as we could, not stopping until we couldn't see or hear anything from behind us anymore.

We collapsed against a tree and caught our breath. Once we were sure that we had lost our pursuers, I turned to the girl and asked her what happened back there. She looked up at me in confusion, like she didn't know herself. "What do you mean?" she asked. I explained about the lightning bolt and the animals, but she just shrugged it off as a weird coincidence.

"But... that's not how things work," I told her. She shook her head slowly. "You can't just assume everything is part of some grand plan or something like that," she said. "That doesn't make any sense." I looked at her in disbelief. Was it possible? Had we both survived this near-death experience only to have the girl doubt me and my beliefs?

I sighed and leaned back against the tree, trying to process what just happened. The girl had always seemed like a practical person to me, someone who liked to analyze everything in order to make sense of it. But now... she didn't seem like that person anymore. She seemed lost somehow, unsure about the world around her. I wasn't sure if we were going to make it out alive after all - but at least I knew what my next question for Joseph Walker would be.

"What do you think just happened?" I asked him when he woke up again. He looked over at me in confusion, his face still covered in blood and dirt from the attack. "What do I think just happened?" he repeated back to me, as though he had no idea what I was talking about. I explained that there were two lions after us, and they were stopped by a lightning bolt when we ran into a clearing.

He looked at me like I had gone crazy. "There are no lions around here," he said. He sounded almost angry now, which made sense - it must have been really bad for him to be in the shelter and not know what was going on outside. Still, his denial didn't make much sense to me.

"I saw them," I told him. "They were right there, chasing us through the forest." He shook his head again. "There are no lions around here," he said more firmly this time.

And just like that, the conversation was over. He had dismissed me out of hand, as though what I saw wasn't real or important at all. But I knew better - and I also knew that he hadn't seen it for himself. Maybe his injuries were causing him to forget things? Or maybe this was a sign that we needed to part ways?

I didn't know the answer to any of these questions, but one thing was clear: I had to make sure that I was safe before I tried to figure out anything else about what happened or where we were. So I turned my attention back to the girl and asked her what she thought about everything. She looked at me blankly for a moment, like she was still processing everything she had experienced over the past few days.

"I think we need to get some rest," she said finally. "We've been through a lot." I nodded in agreement and helped her find a spot on the forest floor where she could lie down. I did the same, trying my best not to worry about what was waiting for us just over the horizon.

It didn't take long for us both to fall asleep, exhausted by our near-death experience and all that we had been through since waking up in this forest. But even though I knew nothing about where we were or what we would face next, one thing was certain - I couldn't rest easy until I had figured out everything that happened back in the shelter with Joseph Walker and those lions.
