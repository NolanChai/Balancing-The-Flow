I looked down at the bloody pile of meat. It had been, at one point, a guy named Joseph Walker. It was still making slight wheezing noises, desperately trying to suck breath even after everything that had happened. But it wasn't Joseph anymore. I couldn't deny that any longer.

The air around me felt heavy and thick. Like the weight of a thousand eyes watching my every move. And yet, strangely, at peace. It was almost as if someone...or something...was guiding me through this. But who? Or what? I couldn't say for sure. But I knew that Joseph wasn't coming back.

My name is Sarah Walker and I work as a nurse in the ER department of a local hospital. My shift had been long but uneventful up until that point. It was close to 2am when we received the call. A car accident on the highway just outside of town, multiple casualties.

I remember the feel of the cold metal of the ambulance on my skin as we sped towards the scene. The lights of the hospital flickered in my rearview mirror as I drove, my heart racing with adrenaline. We arrived at the site of the accident to find a mangled mess of metal and flesh.

As we tended to the wounded, it became clear that Joseph was one of them. He was still alive but barely hanging on. His face was contorted in pain, his eyes glassy and unfocused. I remember thinking how different he looked from when I'd last seen him at home earlier that night.

We rushed him into surgery, the doctors and nurses working feverishly to save his life. But it was too late. As they laid him on a gurney in recovery, his eyes rolled up in his head and he took his last breath. I remember feeling a pang of guilt for being unable to help him.

But then, something strange happened. The lights flickered again, and Joseph's body began to...move. It twitched slightly, as if in response to some unseen force. His eyes rolled back into his head once more, and a low moan escaped from his lips. I remember feeling a chill run down my spine.

We all looked at each other in shock. What was happening? Had he somehow survived the accident? But no, as we rushed him back to surgery, we could see that it wasn't Joseph anymore. The body on the gurney was still recognizable, but something had taken over.

I remember thinking how strange it all seemed. Like a horror movie come to life. And yet, there was an odd sense of calmness about it all. As if I was part of some grand plan that I didn't quite understand. But what could it be?

The answer came to me in a flash. A voice echoed in my mind, whispering in my ear. It was Joseph's voice, but it wasn't. It felt like someone...else. And yet, it seemed so familiar.

"You see, Sarah," the voice said. "I never truly left you. I was always there, watching over you. Even in death, I will be your guide."

It was then that I knew what had happened. Joseph's soul, or whatever remained of him, had taken control of his body. And now he wanted to make sure that I was okay. That I understood what had happened.

And so, I did. I understood the strange calmness that had come over me in that moment. The feeling of peace that seemed to envelop me despite the chaos around us. It was Joseph, guiding me through this tragedy, making sure that I was safe and sound.

As they rolled him back into surgery again, I remember thinking how odd it all was. How could something like this possibly happen? But yet, there was a sense of...purpose to it all. Like Joseph had been meant to die in that accident, and now his soul was trying to make sure that my life went on.

And so, I kept working, pushing through the pain and confusion of what had happened. And somehow, things seemed to fall into place. The night shift ended without further incident, and I returned home, exhausted but strangely at peace.

As I crawled into bed, I remember feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. It was as if Joseph's spirit was still with me, watching over me even in my dreams. And so, I drifted off to sleep, knowing that he would always be there, guiding me through whatever lay ahead.

As for Joseph's body, well, it never truly recovered from the accident. It remained in a vegetative state for several months before eventually succumbing to its injuries and passing away. But even then, I felt a sense of peace. Like Joseph had finally found his rest, and now he would be watching over me from beyond.

And so, that is my story. A strange tale of the supernatural, perhaps, but one that I will always remember. For in that moment, when Joseph's soul took control of his body, I felt a sense of wonder and awe that I will never forget. And so, I keep the memory of him close to me, knowing that he will always be with me, guiding me through whatever life has to offer.
