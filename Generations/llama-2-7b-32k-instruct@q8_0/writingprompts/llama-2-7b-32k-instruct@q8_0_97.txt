aterpillar crawling across the sidewalk and found it to be very peaceful. Then, suddenly, everything seemed to change. A loud noise echoed through the neighborhood as an explosion ripped apart my idyllic scene. My window shattered, and the pieces of glass fell into my lap. The caterpillar stopped moving. I ran outside onto my front lawn screaming for everyone to come over and look at this thing that just blew up my house.

I looked back down at what remained of my bedroom window and was startled by a sight that will never leave me: the mangled, bloody corpse of my neighbor's cat lying on my front lawn. I had not seen her for many years, so it was especially sad to see her lifeless body. This cat lived in the abandoned house across from us and had been known as "The Scary Cat" because she was mean and scratched anyone who approached her yard. Her owner had long since abandoned her there. When we saw that someone was living in the abandoned house, it was assumed to be this cat's new home.

As I watched her bleeding body from my front window, I began to cry. I picked up a few of her bloody pieces and carried them inside my house. They remained on a table for hours afterward while I stared at them in disbelief. Eventually, I was able to compose myself enough to go back outside into the chaos that was once the peaceful neighborhood. The other kids had all run outside of their houses as soon as they heard the explosion, but none of us knew what to say or do next.

I then heard someone in my yard yelling "The Scary Cat! It's her!" and pointing across our street. My friend looked over to where she was looking and saw The Scary Cat crawling out from underneath a pile of rubble that used to be the house she lived in. She was bleeding profusely from multiple cuts on her face, but she was still alive.

Our parents came outside soon afterward, and one parent said "This is a war zone." I went inside my house and tried to collect my thoughts and get over the shock of what had just happened. When I looked back out the window, it seemed like time slowed down as I watched The Scary Cat crawl across our front lawn toward an abandoned car that was in our yard. She got onto a fender and stared up at the house we lived in.

I watched in amazement for several minutes before going back inside. At this point, my mind began to reel with the possibilities of what had just happened and what would happen next. I knew something horrible was about to occur when I saw The Scary Cat lift her paw as if to ring a doorbell.

It seemed like it took forever before someone answered the door, but finally there was an answer. As she meowed loudly at our door, blood dripping from her face, we were all shocked that The Scary Cat had actually made it this far. We knew what would happen next - and I did not want to be right.

Our parents rushed outside when they heard the meowing at our door, and the cat was let inside. She looked around as if she was surprised by her surroundings before collapsing in a heap of blood, fur, and bones on our living room rug. My family all gathered around to try and comfort the dying animal, but I was too stunned at what had just happened to be sad for it.

My sister and I went off by ourselves to discuss this cat's fate. We both came to the same conclusion: we had to get rid of The Scary Cat. It seemed that the whole neighborhood agreed with us. As soon as word got out about the cat's injuries, our parents received a number of phone calls from other families in our neighborhood saying they would like to take her and put her out of her misery.

I knew I could not allow this to happen to this creature that was left for dead by its owner and then blew up in the most horrific way possible. So, my sister and I decided we had to act quickly before someone took it upon themselves to end its life. We went inside our garage and got a shovel.

When we returned out back to the house where The Scary Cat was, she was still alive but barely holding on. As soon as we approached her, she looked up at us with pleading eyes. I was saddened by this because it meant that if I ended her life right here and now, I would be ending a creature's life when they had no other options left in front of them.

I felt my heart sink but then picked up the shovel anyway. It seemed like an eternity before I finally brought it down on The Scary Cat's head. As she crumpled to the ground, her blood poured out from underneath her body in a puddle. My sister and I began digging a hole with our shovel until we could fit all of The Scary Cat's body into it. We then covered up the grave as best as we could, even though it was obvious that she was still alive.

We went back inside to check on her later to make sure she had not woken up and crawled out of her hole in the ground. She was dead; however, when we went downstairs to tell my parents what we did, they were very disappointed with us for killing the cat. They said that there are so many other ways a wounded animal can be helped: someone could catch it and take it to a vet, or help clean its wounds until it healed on its own, or even put food outside of its mouth for it to eat.

I think my parents were disappointed because we had just killed something that was once an enemy and now a tragic victim, but they felt like there was nothing that could be done in this situation except let nature take its course. We decided to make our own vow: from now on, whenever another animal is ever wounded or hurt, we would try our very best to help it instead of harming it.

When the news of The Scary Cat came out, many people who had previously tried to catch her and put an end to her were saddened that she was finally killed in this way. Many other neighborhood families had been waiting for this opportunity to do away with her once and for all. As we grew older, my sister and I kept our vow by helping animals when ever they needed it, even if it meant getting hurt ourselves or being scared.

From that day on, The Scary Cat became known as the "Cat of War."

This story happened on August 15th, 1973 at my house at 209 N. Pine Street in Linden, CA. I was eleven years old and lived there with my parents and four siblings. One day, while playing outside, a large bomb fell from the sky and exploded just across our street on Oakdale Avenue. When the smoke cleared, we found that an abandoned house had been destroyed and several cats were killed in the blast. The cat known as "The Scary Cat" was one of them. Her mangled corpse was discovered by my family and friends at 3pm, and everyone was shocked to see her lifeless body. She belonged to the owner of an abandoned house on that street that had been abandoned for years; however, no one knew who owned her until this day. Some people thought she lived in our yard since we were the closest neighbors and the only family living there. This cat was also known as "The Scary Cat" because she was mean to anyone who approached her house or yard. She had multiple scratches on her face, but no one knew if she died from them or other injuries sustained in the blast. One of my neighbors found The Scary Cat crawling across our front lawn after the explosion and said "This is The Scary Cat!" We all looked at each other in disbelief when we realized who it was.

As I sat outside looking at her, she slowly lifted up her paw as if to ring a doorbell. I watched in amazement as this cat walked across our front lawn and meowed loudly for someone to let her into their house. She crawled underneath an abandoned car that was parked in our yard to get there. My parents ran outside when they heard the meowing at the door and opened it for the cat, who came inside bleeding from multiple cuts on her face. The rest of my family gathered around trying to comfort this dying animal. After a while, she collapsed in a heap of blood, fur, and bones on our living room rug.

My sister and I went off by ourselves to discuss what we should do with the cat's body. We decided that we needed to get rid of her because it would be horrible
