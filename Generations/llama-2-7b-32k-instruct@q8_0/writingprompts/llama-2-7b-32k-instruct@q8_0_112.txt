April is National Poetry Month! So to celebrate this year we're sharing one of our favorite poems each weekday on Twitter at @PenguinUKBooks and on Penguin's Facebook page. Today, we share with you a poem by Ted Hughes."
The sun on the kitchen wall is warm as I sit here / With my book and my cup of coffee... (1-2)
I know I said I wouldn't post any more poems in April but it was too beautiful today not to share this one. The sun has been shining all day, so bright that you can feel like a candle flame just sitting inside your own body.
This poem is also quite short - the whole thing only takes up two pages in my book! Ted Hughes wrote lots of poems about animals and the natural world, which I'm sure lots of people reading this will already know. This poem is not one of those, but it still captures a really beautiful feeling for me: sitting in the kitchen on a warm sunny day, just enjoying being alive."
It was the first time since my divorce that I had cooked a family dinner and served it at the dining table instead of microwaving leftovers for myself. The previous night I had invited friends over to eat outside with me . The night before that I had done the same, and two other evenings this week I had gone out alone to sit on the patio and write poetry."
In this poem, Ted Hughes describes sitting in his kitchen while he drinks a cup of coffee. It seems like a really typical, everyday moment - but it's actually pretty special. Why? Well, we can tell that he is enjoying being here because he keeps repeating the word "warm" in different ways. He says that the sun on the wall is warm, and that his coffee is warm, and that his book (which he may be reading or writing) is warm too . The repetition makes it seem like everything around him has been warmed by a kind of inner glow - which is exactly what happens when you look out over a beautiful sunset, or sit inside on a cold day and watch the fire, or go outside to feel the warmth of a summer's evening. Hughes even says that he knows this feeling of contentment has spread to his "toes"! This kind of physical sensation is often important in poetry because it helps us connect with how we are really feeling, not just what we think about our feelings. It doesn't seem like a very exciting thing to talk about but I bet that if you sit down and close your eyes right now and think back to the last time you felt warmth spreading through your body, you can remember exactly why you liked it so much."
The first two stanzas of this poem are really short - just two lines each. But in the third line he starts to describe how the sunlight coming in is like "a yellow flower", which is quite a long sentence . This helps us to slow down and think carefully about what Hughes is describing. It's almost as if we have stopped moving for a moment, and are looking at this particular image of light that has been warming him."
The last line says: "My body in the chair feels warm too" (32). This shows us something else important - the poet uses the word "my" to say that he belongs with the rest of the world. This is not a selfish moment where he's just enjoying himself but rather a moment when his whole body and mind connect with nature around him."
This poem is all about a feeling that can be summed up in two words: warmth and contentment . And these feelings are also connected to the act of writing. Because if you have ever written something, like this poem or anything else, you'll probably know that it feels really good when you can get into the right frame of mind, when everything seems to flow out of you easily . It doesn't happen often but when it does your mind is full of ideas and words come tumbling out without much thought. I think this feeling in poetry is similar to what people sometimes feel when they are sitting outside on a warm summer evening - everything feels so alive that it seems like all the living things around you are also part of one big family, including yourself."
When the poem starts by saying "The sun on the kitchen wall is warm as I sit here / With my book and cup of coffee", it doesn't seem very exciting. But when Hughes uses words like "warm" again and again, he makes us realise that this feeling of contentment is actually really important to him . When we read poetry, we can share some of the feelings and ideas that the poet has put into his or her poems, even if those things don't seem very special on their own. This poem does a good job of making us see how much joy and pleasure the poet gets from something as simple as sitting in his kitchen on a warm spring day."
If you look back to the first lines of this poem and compare them with the last, you can really feel how happy Hughes is by the end. The beginning of the poem says that "April is National Poetry Month" - which means we will be reading poetry for a whole month . We have only just finished Week 1 but I hope that already we all feel like poets! And if this first poem was any indication, I think we are in for quite an adventure!"
This poem reminds me of my grandfather. He is the kind of man who always had a smile on his face and a song in his heart, and he would tell you stories that made your head spin with excitement. Even at 75 years old, he still has a passion for life like it's his first day ever alive. I love how Ted Hughes describes the warmth of contentment spreading through him - I can imagine my grandfather in this poem, smiling as he cooked dinner for all of us and watching us enjoy every bite."
This poem reminds me that we are not separate from nature; it is a part of everything we do. For Ted Hughes, the sun on the wall, the warmth of his cup of coffee, even the warmth spreading to his toes, all belong together. He doesn't see them as just things - he feels like they are alive and connected to him."
This poem reminds me how important it is for us to be outside in nature. If we spend too much time indoors or looking at screens, we can start to feel disconnected from the world around us. This poem encourages us all to get outside and connect with something that feels alive - like a flower growing out of the earth, or a tree swaying in the wind. It's so important for our wellbeing to remember how small we are compared to the vastness of nature!"
This poem is about the connection between humans and nature. The poet, Ted Hughes, says that even though he's inside his house on a warm day, he still feels connected to the outside world - especially through sunlight. He talks about this feeling as if it were alive, like "yellow flower"."
This poem reminds me of my dad when I was a child. My dad is an avid fisherman who would take me out with him on weekends and holidays. He always had a smile on his face that could light up the darkest days. We'd go to our secret spot at night where we would set up our campfire, cook some hot dogs and drink cocktails as we waited for the fish to bite. I always loved sitting in front of that fire with my dad - it felt like a warm hug on a cold winters eve."
I'm reminded of when I used to read bedtime stories to my grandfather. He would sit across from me and listen as I slowly made my way through the pages. His eyes would light up and he would say "ah, that's good" in between each chapter. It was a moment where we connected with each other and enjoyed each other's company."
This poem makes me think of a day at the beach when all you want is to be outside and feel the sun on your skin. You can imagine how Ted Hughes must have felt as he wrote it, feeling that warmth spreading through him, connecting to nature in its entirety . It's a reminder for us all to take time out of our busy schedules to stop and smell the roses."
This poem makes me think about how we need to connect more with nature. As Ted Hughes says, we must not forget that we are part of something bigger than ourselves - the earth. When we feel connected to it, we become happier and more fulfilled . It's important for us all to take time out of our busy schedules to stop and smell the roses."
This poem reminds me how important it is for humans to connect with nature in order to have a healthy mind. We should strive to experience this feeling as often as possible, and Ted Hughes's poem serves as a good reminder of that . When we look at things like sunflowers or sunsets, it can be hard not to feel joyful."
This poem reminds me about the importance of slowing down. When I am busy, I usually rush through life without fully taking in my surroundings. But Ted Hughes encourag
