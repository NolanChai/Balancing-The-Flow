-kicked her open hands onto her lap.
She watched the blackness of night consume the trees that stood tall before her, and when it finally began to brighten up, a single ray of sunlight shone through the windows of the cottage like a lighthouse beacon. A sigh of relief escaped from her mouth as she saw that all was well again in the morning.
Her scream pierced sharply through the drone of non-stop rain, a multitude of birds, shocked, quickly chased off into the dark night that shrouded the forest. The rain beat down all around as she drop-ked her open hands onto her lap.

A sigh of relief escaped from her mouth as she saw that all was well again in the morning.
She closed her eyes slowly, thinking about how nice it would have been to sleep off the previous night's events in peace and quiet. But as quickly as she drifted into a dreamless sleep, the sound of something dropping on her lap brought her awake with a start. She was so surprised by the sudden noise that she let out an involuntary yelp and jumped off her seat.
She opened her eyes to see what had disturbed her slumber, only to find a small, black object lying on her lap. She picked it up and looked closely at it. It appeared to be a tiny bird's skull - the top of its head was still intact, but the bottom half seemed to have been broken off by something heavy.
With a shake of her head, she realized that this was just some sort of omen or sign that she couldn't quite understand. She put the skull back on her lap and tried to go back to sleep, but it was no use - her mind was already too busy racing with thoughts and images of what could have happened last night in the woods.
As she dozed off again, she couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. It was almost as if a dark cloud had settled over the cottage, casting an eerie pall over her dreams. She tried to push it out of her mind and focus on the bright morning sunlight streaming in through the windows, but she couldn't help feeling like she was being watched - like something unseen was lurking just beyond the edges of her vision.
Despite her fear, she forced herself to get up and go about her day. She had no choice but to face whatever it was that seemed to be stalking her in the woods last night. But as she set off into the forest, a sense of foreboding crept over her - a feeling that something truly terrible was waiting just around the corner...

As she walked deeper and deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller and more dense, casting dappled shade across the ground beneath them. The sun disappeared completely behind the canopy of leaves overhead, leaving her in complete darkness. She could hear rustling all around her, as if something was creeping through the underbrush, but she tried to push it out of her mind and focus on her surroundings.
The ground began to slope downwards, leading her deeper into the heart of the forest. She could feel a damp chill seeping into her bones, despite the warmth of the sun overhead. The air grew thick with humidity, making it difficult to breathe. But she pushed on, determined to find whatever it was that seemed to be calling her
As she rounded a corner, a figure stood before her - tall and imposing, its features shrouded in darkness. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recognized the creature for what it was: a werewolf. Its eyes glowed yellow in the dim light, and it let out a low growl that rumbled through the air.
Without thinking, she took a step backwards, tripping over something on the ground behind her. She landed hard, feeling a sharp pain shoot up her leg as she hit the earth. The werewolf pounced, its jaws snapping shut just inches from her face. She screamed in terror as it sunk its teeth into her neck, pumping poison into her veins.
But as it drank deeply of her blood, a strange sensation came over her. She felt herself growing stronger, more powerful than she had ever been before. Her body thrummed with energy, and she could feel the werewolf's strength flowing through her veins. With a roar of anger and defiance, she pushed it off and sprang to her feet, her teeth bared in a snarl.
The werewolf reeled back, startled by this unexpected display of ferocity. She took advantage of the momentary distraction, driving her fist into its jaw with all her strength. The creature let out a howl of pain as she struck it again and again, fighting tooth and nail for survival.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the werewolf collapsed to the ground, unconscious or dead. She stood over its body, her heart pounding in her chest. She had never felt so alive before - so powerful,
