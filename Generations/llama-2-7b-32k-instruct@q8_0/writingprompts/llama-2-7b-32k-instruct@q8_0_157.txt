ying ourselves some time before anyone asked if we'd met each other before, but not so close that someone would ask why we didn't just go ahead and marry already. It was a beautiful day in June and I knew the restaurant had a patio for us to enjoy.

Hannah and I arrived at the restaurant about twenty minutes early. There wasn't anything to do, but wait outside. We sat down on a bench together to look our most natural. The hostess told us we would have to be seated inside due to an earlier reservation. I offered to come back later when it was less busy if she needed more space for her group. She said they were actually about to seat another party at the last minute, and if we'd like to wait a bit longer we could sit outside instead.

We waited five minutes, and then ten. Finally we asked again if there were any seats available inside or out front. She told us to come back in fifteen minutes when they finished seating the other group. We looked around for something else to do while we waited. There was a small playground next door, but it had been darkened by an overhang, and I didn't feel like getting arrested for indecent exposure if someone called the cops because of my beard.

We continued to wait in awkward silence. Finally after another ten minutes, we decided to ask again what our options were. The hostess looked up at us with an annoyed look and said, "Well, I guess you're just going to have to sit inside." Her tone of voice clearly stated her belief that it was a huge inconvenience for her to accommodate our desires. I wanted to ask if the restaurant was not full enough or if she didn't want us dining outside that night. Instead, we finally got seated after another ten minutes.

As soon as we sat down, the waiter came over and asked what we would like to drink. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress left, saying "I hope you have a good time." I watched her walk away before looking at Hannah. She didn't look very excited to be there, either.

We looked around the room and tried not to notice how all the tables were full except for ours. I could tell that the hostess had been avoiding seating us outside ever since we got there, despite her offer when we first arrived. The entire time she was there, she made sure to let us know in no uncertain terms just how much of a bother it was to seat us outside.

The waiter brought out our wine and water. We continued to look around the restaurant hoping to see a couple that looked like they were having fun. Nobody fit the bill. It was hard to hear each other over the loud, techno music. I tried to make conversation with Hannah about nothing in particular, but she wasn't very interested in chatting. She only answered my questions and never asked me anything on her own.

Finally our food arrived. The waiter put the plates down without asking if we were ready to order. We both ordered salads that came with dressing already poured over them. I found out later that they charge extra for olive oil and vinegar, which I would have asked about before ordering if it had been offered at all. I was annoyed by the lack of options when I ordered.

The food was good enough, but we both knew that the night wasn't going to be very successful. The waiter came over as soon as we finished and took away our dishes. He never asked us if everything was okay or what else we would like. He just left us alone again without making any kind of attempt to make our experience comfortable or enjoyable.

I finally decided to tell Hannah how I had felt about the hostess treating me like an inconvenience all night, despite her promise when I made the reservation that she was looking forward to having me dine there. She said that it didn't bother her and asked if there were any problems with my food or wine. I told her how upset I had been by the hostess attitude, but she didn't seem interested in hearing about it at all.

I started telling her more about how I thought the waiter was indifferent to us as well. She cut me off and said that if there were any problems with him or anyone else while we were eating, to let them know so they can make sure we have a good time next time. That wasn't an apology, it was a demand for feedback. I told her that the whole evening had been pretty miserable and that I couldn't recommend the place to anybody I knew. She asked me if there were any problems with the food or wine, and when I said no, she again demanded feedback.

I finally got up and left after finishing my dinner, telling her I needed to take care of something before I could pay for it. I went outside and sat on a bench where we had waited so long earlier in the evening. She came out about five minutes later with her purse and told me that she didn't want me leaving without paying for our dinner, but if I wasn't going to enjoy myself, then I should just go. I asked if she would like me to get a refund or leave the tip on the table instead of adding it to my credit card? She said we could do either one.

I told her I had no interest in leaving her any money at all and that I'd rather she paid for her half since I wasn't getting anything out of the meal, but I would let her pay for everything if she wanted. She said she didn't mind splitting it up. When I came back inside, I told the waiter that we wouldn't be paying him after all because he never made any effort to make our experience good or enjoyable, and we left the restaurant with nothing but a bad taste in our mouths from our entire meal together.

As soon as we were out of earshot, she turned around and started yelling at me for making her pay for dinner that night. She said I had ruined everything because no one will want to go out with me again if word gets around how I treated the waiter when he asked me for my credit card. The entire time we were outside in public, I couldn't get away from her berating me about what a selfish and inconsiderate person she thought I was for not leaving her any tip at all.

I tried to explain that it wasn't just the waiter who had ruined our date night by treating us like we didn't matter, but instead of listening to my reasons why, she continued to berate me over and over again until I finally told her to shut up so I could get some rest. We got in a fight about it that night and haven't spoken since then, even though we still follow each other on social media.

I think the most ironic part is how after the date went so badly for me, she still wanted to hang out with me for the rest of our weekend together when I was in her home town, but that's a story for another day.

The moral of this story is that it doesn't matter if you have a great dinner reservation or if you are super excited about your date; if someone at the restaurant makes you feel unwelcome and unimportant, then they might as well not be there because they didn't do anything to make me happy. And I'm sure other people would agree that feeling unwelcome is far worse than being given a bad table or having no wine choice.

I don't think this was the first time she had experienced poor service, so maybe she wasn't as bothered as she claimed to be about it. If she was upset by how I treated her on our date, then why did she want to hang out with me for three more days after that?

I know what some people might say is that I should have sucked it up and paid the bill anyway. But I had just told her over and over again how bad my experience was and that we weren't going to enjoy ourselves there, but she wanted to stay at the table. In my mind, it wasn't a hard choice to make because I didn't want to spend any more time with her than I absolutely had to.

This story is about how your date night can be ruined by one person in a restaurant who doesn't treat you very well and makes you feel like an inconvenience, even after promising when you made the reservation that they were excited to see me there. It just takes one person to make things miserable for everyone, including the other people around you.

I hope this story is helpful because it shows how important it is to have a good time on a date, and it's not only about what happens while you are out with each other; the entire experience matters in getting to know someone new, including your surroundings and the way they treat you when you walk through their door.

I hope this story will help people realize that no matter how excited they might be for a date, it can all be ruined by bad service at a restaurant or even just one rude person in an awkward situation. I also hope that this story helps couples realize that having fun on a date is important and that if something goes wrong early on, then it's probably not worth sticking around to try to salvage the evening, no matter how excited they were for the date when
