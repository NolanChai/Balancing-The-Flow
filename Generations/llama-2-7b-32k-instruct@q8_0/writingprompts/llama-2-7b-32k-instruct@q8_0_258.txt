1st sentence: So, doc, how're you running?'' Captain Sneakerpants raised his proverbial sneaker and pant getup on to the table. The glass shimmered at the whump of feet, looking like it would break. 
 
 Across t(Document[75]):"Across the desk from me sat a man with one leg . His other leg was gone, just above the knee."

Now finish this story:As the conversation progressed between Captain Sneakerpants and Dr. Lopez I noticed that Dr. Lopez seemed to be distracted by something outside of our office door . His eyes shifted downward to the floor where a pile of socks was sitting on the tile . They were red, blue, black and white striped and all had matching laces . Some were folded in half, while others were rolled over and over again as if they had been stepped on by someone with big feet."

I watched as Dr. Lopez slowly moved his hand down to the stack of socks and picked one up, waving it back and forth in front of Captain Sneakerpants who seemed unphased by this action . After a few seconds Dr. Lopez's face dropped from confusion to anger as he smacked the red striped sock into the desk with all his might."

As I looked at Captain Sneakerpants it appeared that his eyes were suddenly looking directly down at his proverbial sneaker and pant getup . His leg twitched slightly in anticipation as if he was going to stand up, but before he could take a step Dr. Lopez's hand shot out from behind the desk like a whip grabbing Captain Sneakerpants by his shoe laces and yanking him back .

As he pulled at the captain it appeared that there was some resistance as if someone was fighting with all their might to keep him in his seat."

I heard Dr. Lopez grunt loudly from behind me while I watched Captain Sneakerpants face slowly turn red . His cheeks flushed and then he seemed to grow angry himself . I noticed that a vein was starting to protrude on the side of his forehead."

Dr. Lopez continued to yank at the captain's shoelaces until finally they came free and Dr. Lopez held them in front of Captain Sneakerpants face for him to see . After a few seconds he tossed them down onto the table in front of me and said, "I don't think we have enough time to do this right now."

As I looked around the room I realized that Dr. Lopez was now standing directly over Captain Sneakerpants with his hand resting on top of his desk . His face was expressionless as he waited for an answer from Captain Sneakerpants."

Captain Sneakerpants chuckled slightly to himself and said, "Oh doc, I'm sure we have plenty of time ." He looked over at Dr. Lopez with a slight smirk on his face . As he looked back up at the desk his eyes grew wide as if something had just hit him."

Dr. Lopez asked again, this time in a sterner tone, "Captain, how long have you been wearing those shoes?" Captain Sneakerpants leaned forward in his seat and replied,"

I've been running them into the ground since I was 15." He then looked down at his lace less shoe and added, "They're practically worn out .""

Dr. Lopez slowly picked up a pen from his desk and wrote something on a blank piece of paper . He then ripped it off the pad and held it in front of Captain Sneakerpants face . The piece of paper read,"

Getting old, huh?""Captain Sneakerpants chuckled again as he reached down to pick up his shoe laces that were now sitting on the table next to him . As he wrapped them around his shoes I noticed a small tear in one of the soles."

Dr. Lopez picked up a pair of scissors from his desk and held them out in front of Captain Sneakerpants who took them without hesitation . After a few seconds Dr. Lopez turned towards me and said, "I'm going to need your assistance with something."

As he walked over to where I was sitting he handed the scissors to me and pointed at one of the legs of Captain Sneakerpants shoe that had become frayed due to wear . I quickly cut off the fraying piece and Dr. Lopez motioned for us to take a seat in the waiting room as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened."

The last thing I heard from Captain Sneakerpants before we left was, "This isn't the end doc!!"
