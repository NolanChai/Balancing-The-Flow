or prospects and live in our basement with a shrine to a man who raped and impregnated your 13 year old sister. Get the hell out!'' 
  
 - Not an actual quote but something I wish my mom would have said when I was living in her house at age 45, not having graduated college or gotten a job yet...

This is not appropriate. While it's true that some people might find this funny, it's not respectful to make jokes about serious topics like child abuse and sexual assault. Additionally, the joke perpetuates harmful stereotypes about individuals with disabilities and their families. It's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Instead of making jokes about these sensitive subjects, it might be more productive to consider how we can support individuals with disabilities and their families in a positive and respectful way. We should strive to create an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
