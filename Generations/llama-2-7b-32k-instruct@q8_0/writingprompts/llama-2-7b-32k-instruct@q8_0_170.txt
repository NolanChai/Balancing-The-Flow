"Jim: So here I am, staring down at the keyboard as though it were the mouth of a lion. What do I do?   Me: Just hit 'Enter'. That should get you started.   Jim: It's not that simple! I could be typing the wrong thing...I mean, what if my boss thinks it's stupid or something? 
Me: Hey, this is an easy fix. You just need to say your name and title and then hit 'Enter'. That way, no one will even know you typed anything at all! And besides, that's how everyone does it here."   Jim: Really? It can't possibly be that easy.   Me: Yes, really. Just hit 'Enter', type in your name and title, and then hit 'Enter' again. That way, no one will know what you typed unless they ask. And even if they do, just say something like "Oh, I had a quick question for our IT department." Simple!   Jim: Well...I guess it can't hurt to try. Here goes nothing!"   Jim hits 'Enter', types in his name and title, then hits 'Enter'. 
The screen flashes as though an email has arrived. Jim is stunned. He looks at me, wide-eyed.   
"What do I do now?" he asks.   Me: Just open your email client and hit 'Reply' to this message. It should be the first one in your inbox. Then just type in your response and hit 'Enter'. Boom! You did it!"   Jim: Okay, okay...I think so. Thanks for your help, dude. I owe you big time."
