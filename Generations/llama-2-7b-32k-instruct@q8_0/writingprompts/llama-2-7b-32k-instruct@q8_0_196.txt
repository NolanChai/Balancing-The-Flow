er not goin' in wifout me!" A deep voice rings out from above the water, and he feels his arm tugged gently. The man is holding onto him, but there's nothing aggressive about it. Instead, it feels almost friendly--almost like a brotherly force guiding him home. 
 
 "Ya gotta give me credit for this one," the voice says softly, and he can feel himself being pulled towards dry land. "You swim away from land--I follow you." 
 
 He struggles against his captor's grip, trying to escape, but it's no use. The water is sucking him under. This man is a lot stronger than he looks. Or is this all an act? Surely that would be too much...wouldn't it? 
 
 He reaches the surface--his head breaking through first before his shoulders and back. It takes him a moment to realize what's happening, but once he does, he panics, flailing wildly to find something to grab onto. But there is nothing; only the man's hand holds him above water. 
 
 "Please don't make me drown," he gasps out, his voice sounding more like a plea than anything else. He can barely hear it over the beating of his own heart. This is a nightmare; this cannot be real. The man lets him go and he plummets back down into the water, gasping for air. 
 
 "What do you want from me?" His voice shakes with fear--a fear that he's never felt before in his life. He is a swimmer; this is his element. The lake has been his home since childhood, and yet here he is, sinking like a stone into the depths. 
 
 "I...don't want anything from you," the voice says again, soothingly, as if trying to calm him down. He can hear it now--the sound of the man swimming through the water beside him, but he doesn't dare look up at him. His eyes are glued on the surface of the lake, hoping against hope that he won't be pulled back under. 
 
 "I don't want you to do anything," he says finally, almost to himself, still breathing heavily from his time in the water. He has no clue why this is happening; what could this man possibly want with him? 
 
 The voice chuckles softly before it speaks again. "I just...wanted to get you back." 
 
 It doesn't make any sense, but he knows that this man will keep swimming beside him until he gets to land--whether or not he wants to go there. He feels a wave of exhaustion wash over him then--an all-encompassing weariness that threatens to consume him whole. It's almost as if his body is trying to convince him to give in to this...this stranger. 
 
 "Why did you do it? Why did you drown me?" He knows he sounds childish, but he can't help it; all of a sudden, the world seems to be crashing down around him. This isn't fair. He was swimming just fine--he knew exactly what he was doing. Why couldn't he have just let his body do its own thing? 
 
 The man stops swimming beside him for a moment and turns slightly towards him, smiling gently. "I didn't drown you," he says softly, as if in apology. He seems to know what the boy is thinking; perhaps this all seemed real to him...perhaps he thought it was his fault. 
 
 "It was an accident," he says. His voice sounds almost disappointed when he speaks again. "But I'm here now, aren't I? So let me help you out." He reaches for the boy again, offering to pull him onto the shore. 
 
 The boy doesn't trust this man; he knows that he should say no, that he shouldn't get out of the water until someone else comes to save him. But at the same time...he feels himself drawn to the surface. He wants nothing more than to lie down and take a nap on the beach. He can feel his eyes growing heavy, and it seems like only a few seconds before they close completely. 
 
 His last thought as he drifts off is of confusion; why is this man here? What does he want with him? But that's not important now; at least, he feels safe in the water. He doesn't have to think about it anymore. His body takes over and pulls him towards the shore.

He wakes up slowly, his head still foggy with sleep, but he can hear something--a voice? He struggles to open his eyes, squinting against the brightness of the sun. It feels like it's been years since he's slept, and yet here he is, lying on a beach. 
 
 "Hey there," says the voice, sounding cheerful as ever. The boy doesn't say anything; instead, he looks around him, trying to figure out where in the world he might be. His head seems fuzzy still--he can barely remember anything before waking up on this beach. 
 
 "Well," says the voice, sounding a little disappointed. "That's not so good. But don't worry; I'll help you get your memory back." The boy doesn't say anything else--he just continues to look around him. There are people on the beach; he can hear them playing music and talking to each other. They all seem friendly enough, but something about their faces seems...off. 
 
 "Oh, I see," says the voice again. "You don't remember me." The boy nods his head slightly; this is definitely not the same person he was swimming with last night. This one is...different somehow. Maybe that's why he can't seem to recall anything about him. 
 
 "I'm here because I need your help," says the voice, sounding almost serious now. The boy looks back up at him and nods his head slightly, still feeling a little wary of this person. 
 
 "What do you want from me?" He speaks softly, almost too softly to be heard. His eyes scan the beach; there's no one here that he trusts enough to tell his story to. This voice seems familiar--almost like an old friend. But still...he can't remember him. 
 
 The voice sighs before answering. "I need you to help me find a lost soul." 
 
 That doesn't sound so bad, he thinks to himself. He's been swimming all his life; it seems like the perfect fit for someone like him. And who knows? Maybe he will even be able to remember this voice and this moment when they finally find their friend. 
 
 "Okay," he says finally, feeling a strange sense of comfort at that word. He can't believe that he has agreed to do this...but it feels right somehow. It's like his body and mind are in sync again; the weight of the world seems to be lifted from him when he says those words. 
 
 The voice grins softly before turning away from him, beginning to walk along the beach. He follows him for a while, trying to remember why this all feels so...natural. It's almost like they have done this before; perhaps that's what it is--a sense of deja vu, he thinks to himself.

"I know you don't remember me," the voice says softly, "but I do." It seems almost apologetic for not being remembered. "You see...we used to swim together. You were always a fast learner." 
 
 The boy can feel his heart racing now; he doesn't know if it's from excitement or fear, but something inside him feels strangely calm. He looks back up at the man and nods his head slightly. "You used to teach me things," he says softly, feeling almost as though he's remembering something that never happened. 
 
 The voice chuckles gently before answering. "I did. And you were a fast learner, just like I said. You always caught on quickly." He seems proud of this fact, and the boy feels himself warming to him. 
 
 They walk further along the beach--the sound of waves crashing against the shore providing the only background noise. The sun shines brightly overhead; he can feel its warmth on his skin. It's almost as if he has been here before, and yet...he knows that this is all new to him. 
 
 "I need you to find a soul," says the man finally, turning back to face him with a serious look on his face. The boy looks
