Please don't let me drown! I can't swim and there is no one around that can help me. 
"The water is so beautiful," he says as he looks up at the surface. The sun is setting, casting an orange glow on his scales and causing ripples to dance across the water. He pushes his tail through the surface, creating a small wave. 
"It's like flying underwater!" he exclaims, grinning from ear to ear. His scales shimmer in the light, almost sparkling with delight. 
He knows it's a bad idea, yet his tail seems to be moving of its own accord, pushing him closer to the surface. He breaks it with barely a splash, years of practice guiding his sleek form. 
"I'm coming up," he calls out, his voice echoing in the distance. There is no one there to hear him, but that doesn't stop him from feeling a sense of triumph as he pushes himself upwards with the help of his tail. He emerges from the water, gasping for air and letting his body relax. 
"I've got this," he whispers to himself, patting his chest in an attempt to reassure him that he is safe. He looks around, taking in his surroundings. There is no sign of human life, just the vast expanse of ocean stretching out before him. 
"I'm so alone," he says, a lump forming in his throat. But despite feeling scared and vulnerable, he also feels exhilarated - like he can do anything. He pushes himself off the surface with his tail again, swimming away from land as though it were an adventure waiting to happen. 
"I'm going to explore!" he calls out, his voice echoing across the water. There is no response but he doesn't need one - he feels more alive than ever before. He swims deeper and deeper, letting the current carry him away from land. He wonders what dangers or delights await him in this vast ocean. 
As he swims further and further out, the sun begins to set behind the horizon, casting an orange glow on the waves. He feels a sense of peace wash over him as he lets the water carry him away. It's almost as if he is flying, soaring through the air with nothing but the ocean below him. 
"This is my element," he says to himself, feeling like a true fish out of water. He swims on, letting the current carry him wherever it may. There is no sign of human life, just the vast expanse of ocean stretching out before him. It's as though he is the only person in the world, and that feels strangely liberating. 
"I'm home," he says to himself, his voice echoing off the waves. He swims on, letting the water carry him wherever it may. There is no sign of human life, just the vast expanse of ocean stretching out before him. It's as though he is the only person in the world, and that feels strangely liberating.
