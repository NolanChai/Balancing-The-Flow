Ania told a reporter during that interview, "I'm not sure what age I will be on my deathbed, but if I'm still working then I hope it is for NASA.'' 
    She left her job with Elon Musk to pursue a career as an astronaut 
  
Ania told a reporter in December that she had been "hired" by NASA for the first time. But when pressed further, she admitted: "I don't know if it is official or not."   
  
In her resignation letter, Ania wrote to Musk, "Dear Elon, 
I have some bad news. I am stepping down from my role at SpaceX. It has been an incredible journey working with you and for the entire company over the last two years. But today I'm officially leaving."  
Ania, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN Business, started as a director of astronaut operations at SpaceX in July 2019 after a five-year career at NASA that included working on the International Space Station and deploying communications systems for deep space missions.   
  
But Ania's departure is an uncommon one at SpaceX, where Musk has encouraged employees to stay as long as they like -- often to the chagrin of other companies trying to poach his best people. 
The Tesla CEO was once quoted in a Wall Street Journal article saying "I would be happy if half of SpaceX's people left" because he views burnout and boredom as bad for productivity, according to the report.  
Ania has also made headlines with her personal life. In 2017 she came out as bisexual in a Twitter thread .  
  
NASA's Johnson tweeted on Wednesday that Ania was "an incredible asset" who will be missed at the space agency."
