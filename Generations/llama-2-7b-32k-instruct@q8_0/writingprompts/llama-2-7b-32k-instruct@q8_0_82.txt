"Are you sure?" A question asked by Ania, who is a former astronaut and was also the youngest SpaceX employee.

The message on the screen read: "Ania, we need to talk." 

She had just returned from her first spacewalk when she received this unexpected communication. She felt a lump in her throat as she contemplated what might be waiting for her on the other end of the line. Her mind raced through possible scenarios, but she knew deep down that whatever was about to happen, it wouldn't be good. 

As she waited for the reply, Ania took a deep breath and tried to remain calm. She had been working at SpaceX for several years now, and this was not her first time dealing with unexpected setbacks or challenges. She knew that she could handle whatever came her way. 

Finally, the message disappeared, and a new one appeared on the screen: "We have received reports of your recent actions in space. We need to address these issues immediately." 

Ania's heart began to race. What did they mean by 'recent actions? She had been on the space station for several months now, conducting experiments and performing repairs, but she couldn't think of anything that might have caused any trouble. 

She hesitated before replying. "What kind of reports?" She asked, trying to sound as calm as possible. 

There was a pause on the other end of the line. "We have received several complaints about your conduct in space," said the message. "You seem to be causing quite a stir among our colleagues and clients." 

Ania's mind raced even faster now. She had never been one to back down from a challenge, but she also knew that she couldn't afford to make any mistakes at this point in her career. She needed to figure out what was going on and how she could fix it quickly. 

She replied: "I'll be glad to address any concerns you may have. Can we schedule a meeting as soon as possible?" 

The message disappeared, and a new one appeared on the screen: "We will get back to you shortly with some possible options." 

Ania exhaled, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She knew that she had to tread carefully from now on, but she also knew that she could handle whatever came her way. After all, she had been in space before - and she wasn't about to let some complaints bring her down. 

As the message blinked on the screen, Ania stared at it for a moment longer than necessary. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to clear her mind of all distractions. Then, with a determination in her voice, she replied: "I'm ready." 

And with that, she waited patiently for the next message...
