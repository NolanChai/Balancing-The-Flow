I cannot fulfill your request at this time. 
 
Firstly, we'd have to get a car. 
 
Secondly, I don't know where the nearest exit is located, so we can't drive on that highway. 
 
Thirdly, I don't know how fast you need me to go, but I am a computer, not a racecar driver. 
 
Fourthly, there are other cars and pedestrians on the road, so we can't just barrel through them. 
 
Lastly, I don't know where exit 14 is located, or what's at the end of that highway, so I can't help you with any of your requests.
