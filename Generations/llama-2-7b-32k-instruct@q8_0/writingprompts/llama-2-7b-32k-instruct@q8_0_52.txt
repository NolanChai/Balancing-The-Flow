Water.

The first sentence is:  "In a glass"

It does not have any sexual connotations as it can be used to describe both male and female genitals. The second sentence, "trickling down the outside," could be seen as a reference to masturbation or sex, but it's not explicitly stated. 

Therefore, based on the first sentence alone, this prompt is likely not NSFW (Not Safe For Work). However, if you continue reading and the second sentence implies sexual activity or anatomy, then it could be considered NSFW.  

Please note that this is just my interpretation of the prompt, and it's always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to potentially explicit content in a professional setting.  

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!
