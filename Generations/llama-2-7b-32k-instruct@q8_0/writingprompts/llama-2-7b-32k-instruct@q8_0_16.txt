 short walk from the temple entrance. It was silent except for the sound of his breathing as he sat waiting in anticipation.
It started out innocently enough: a light tap at the door, almost like a child's knock. A figure peered around the corner and when it saw that he was alone, she opened the door and stepped inside. He did not bother to look up, his eyes were glued to the book in front of him. She closed the door behind her.
"What do you want?" His voice was low, quiet, devoid of life.
She hesitated for a moment before speaking. "I am here on behalf of your lord," she said. Her voice was firm and strong. It cut through his mind like a knife. He looked up at her face for the first time since she had entered the room. She wore a hood over her head, hiding all but her eyes from view.
"What do you want?" His tone had not changed.
She ignored him, instead focusing on the book in front of him. It was a simple book: black cover, no title that he could see. The pages were filled with strange symbols and letters, ones he did not recognize. She reached out a hand towards it but stopped just short of touching it.
"You have been chosen," she said. He did not respond, only continued to stare at her face. "Your lord has a task for you."
He looked back down at the book and opened his mouth to speak but could not find anything inside. Instead, he shook his head and stood up from the seat. She watched as he walked over to a large stone behind him, lifted it up, and set it in front of the door. He then walked back over to where she was standing.
"What is this?" He asked, his voice still low but with an undertone of anger. The symbol on the book had been cut into the stone as well as written upon it. He gestured to it. "Who are you and what do you want?"
She sighed, her hood falling slightly. She looked at him for a moment before replying. Her voice was filled with a mix of pity and anger. "I am your lord," she said.
He stared at the floor. He had known this day would come. It was not an unexpected event as many believed it to be, but rather one that he had spent his life preparing for. The moment where he would be called upon by the gods and given a task worthy of his skill and intellect. He could feel the anger well up inside him, ready to burst out in violent waves.
"You think you are my lord? You have no power here," he spat. His voice was low but filled with an unmistakable tone of rage. She took a step forward, her hand on her sword. He continued. "I am the one who holds all the power here. I am the one who will decide how things are done."
She stood there, unsure what to say or do next. The silence between them stretched out for a moment before she finally spoke. Her voice was low but firm. "You will listen when I speak and you will obey my commands," she said. She gestured towards the book in front of him.
"I have no need of your commands." He looked down at his hand, staring at it as if it were a foreign object. He could feel the anger still rising inside of him. "I am beyond your control," he said. His voice was low but filled with an unmistakable tone of power.
She sighed again, her hood falling further. She looked at him for a moment before taking off her helmet and letting her hair down. Her face was visible now: young, beautiful, and full of strength. He could feel the anger fading away as he looked at her. The sound of his breathing was the only thing in the room that remained.
"I have been chosen for this task," she said. "You will help me complete it." Her voice was firm, but also filled with a hint of sadness and regret. He did not respond, instead looking down at the book in front of him.
She took a step forward, her hand outstretched towards his chest. She pushed on it gently, as if to make sure he was real. He looked up at her face for a moment before speaking. "What is this task?" His voice was still low but filled with an unmistakable tone of curiosity and wonder.
She hesitated for a moment before answering. "You will find the three keys," she said. Her voice was firm but also filled with a hint of sadness. He looked at her, his eyes wide with disbelief. She continued. "Once you have them, you will open the gate."
He shook his head, still looking down at the book in front of him. The symbols and letters seemed to dance before his eyes. "The three keys?" He repeated. His voice was low but filled with an unmistakable tone of disbelief and confusion.
She nodded. "They are hidden deep within this world," she said. Her voice was firm, but also full of a hint of sadness. She looked at him for a moment before continuing. "You will find them."
He did not respond, instead looking down at the book in front of him. The symbols and letters seemed to dance before his eyes as he tried to make sense of it all. He could feel the anger returning, rising up inside him like a tidal wave. It was almost as if the gods themselves were pushing him towards this path, forcing him to do their bidding.
"I will help you," he said. His voice was low but filled with an unmistakable tone of resolve and purpose. He looked up at her face for a moment before continuing. "But I will do it on my own terms." He gestured towards the book in front of him again.
"There is no other way," she said. Her voice was firm, but also full of a hint of sadness. He did not respond, instead looking down at the book in front of him once more. The symbols and letters seemed to dance before his eyes as he tried to make sense of it all.
He took a step forward, his hand outstretched towards her chest. She looked up at him for a moment before placing hers over his heart. He could feel the anger subsiding, replaced by something new: something that he had never felt before. It was not love, but rather something more primal and raw.
"Thank you," she said. Her voice was firm but also filled with a hint of sadness. She looked at him for a moment before turning to leave. He watched as she walked out the door, her footsteps fading away into nothingness. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath as he tried to make sense of everything that had just happened.
He knew what was expected of him now. He would find the three keys and open the gate. It seemed like an impossible task, one that no man could hope to complete. But he was not just any man; he was the chosen one. And with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?
He opened his eyes, looking down at the book in front of him once more. The symbols and letters seemed to dance before his eyes as he tried to make sense of it all. He knew that this was only the beginning; there were many challenges ahead, but with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?
He smiled to himself, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation course through him. It was not fear or doubt that he felt, but rather a deep sense of purpose and resolve. He knew what was expected of him now; he would find the three keys and open the gate. And with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?
He closed his eyes again, taking another deep breath as he tried to make sense of everything that had just happened. It seemed like a dream, something that he would wake up from any moment now. But it was not a dream; it was reality. He was the chosen one, and with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?
He opened his eyes again, looking down at the book in front of him once more. The symbols and letters seemed to dance before his eyes as he tried to make sense of it all. But he did not need to make sense of it; he knew what was expected of him now. And with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?
He smiled to himself again, feeling a deep sense of purpose and resolve. He would find the three keys and open the gate. And with the gods on his side, who could stop him? It was not just any man who stood before him; it was the chosen one. And with the gods on his side, who could stand in his way?

She had never encountered anyone like him before; he was a librarian who spent years studying to become the chosen one, but she sensed that there was more to it than that. He radiated an air of power and determination that she had never seen before.
