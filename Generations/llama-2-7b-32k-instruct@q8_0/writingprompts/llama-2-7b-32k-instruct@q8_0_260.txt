Cassidy rubbed his head. Looking at his daughter, he wasn't quite sure what to say, "We're so... proud of you. I guess. Right dear?'' Jackie clicked her tongue, "I so called it." Francin nodded in agreement, adding, "Mommy knew best."

Cassidy shook his head, trying to clear the fog of confusion from his mind. He had no idea what was going on. All he could remember was waking up in a hospital bed with a bandage over his head and Jackie standing over him, looking down at him with an expression that Cassidy couldn't quite decipher.

"What happened?" Cassidy asked, trying to sound like he knew exactly what was going on when really, he had no clue.

Jackie rolled her eyes, "Of course you don't remember. You were in a coma for almost a month." She said this as if it were the most obvious thing in the world and Cassidy would be an idiot not to know.

Cassidy blinked, confused once again. He couldn't even begin to wrap his mind around what she was saying. A coma? How did that happen? What happened to him? 

Jackie sighed, "I'll show you," she said, pulling out her phone and scrolling through the pictures she had taken of Cassidy over the past few months. She showed him picture after picture of him lying in his hospital bed, hooked up to various machines, and looking like a total mess.

Cassidy stared at the screen, trying to comprehend what he was seeing. He couldn't remember anything from that time. It was like it had been erased from his mind completely. 

Francin looked on in disbelief, her eyes wide as she watched Cassidy struggle to come to terms with what had happened to him. She knew that this was a difficult thing for him to process and she didn't want to make him feel any worse than he already did.

Finally, Cassidy spoke up, "Why? Why would anyone do this to me?" He asked, his voice thick with emotion as he looked at Jackie.

Jackie shook her head, "I don't know," she said honestly. "But I promise we'll find out." She took Cassidy's hand in hers and squeezed it tightly, trying to reassure him that everything was going to be okay.

Cassidy looked at his daughter, feeling a wave of emotion wash over him. He knew that she meant well, but he still couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. There was a weight on his chest that he couldn't explain and it was only getting heavier with each passing second.

As Jackie continued to show Cassidy pictures of himself in the hospital, Cassidy couldn't help but feel more and more lost. He didn't understand what had happened to him or why anyone would do this to him. It was like a nightmare that he could never wake up from.

But despite everything, Cassidy knew that Jackie was telling the truth. She wouldn't lie about something as serious as this. He knew that she was trying to help him and he had to trust her.

And so, Cassidy did what any good father would do - he hugged his daughter tightly and thanked her for taking care of him. He promised her that he would do everything in his power to find out who did this to him and make them pay.

Together, Cassidy, Jackie, and Francin made a promise to each other. They vowed to work together to get justice and put an end to the madness once and for all. And with that, they set out on their journey to discover the truth about Cassidy's past and what had happened to him.

As they walked away from the hospital, Cassidy couldn't help but feel a sense of hope and determination wash over him. He knew that he was going to find out the truth and nothing was going to stop him. With Jackie and Francin by his side, he felt strong and ready for whatever lay ahead.

The three of them walked hand in hand down the hospital corridor, determined to face whatever came their way. They had a mission to fulfill and they were ready to do it.
