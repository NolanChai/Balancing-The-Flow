Trick or Treat!   A 4 ft Darth Vader and an equally tall Minion glanced up at me with their bags open in anticipation. "You kids having a good time?" I asked as I reached for the bowl of sweet treats on my side table, ready to hand out some candy. As I looked at them, I couldn't help but smile. They were both dressed up in their Halloween costumes, looking adorable and eager to collect as many candies as possible. 
The Minion was wearing a yellow construction hat and had a straw sticking out of its mouth. It waved its hands excitedly at me, its eyes filled with glee. The Darth Vader, on the other hand, had his helmet perched on his head and was holding a light saber in one hand. He stood tall and imposing, ready to strike fear into any trick-or-treater who dared to cross him. 
I handed them both a couple of pieces of candy and watched as they stuffed their pockets with the treats. They thanked me and continued down the street, still chatting away excitedly about their costumes and what they planned to do with all of the candies they had collected. I couldn't help but feel a warm feeling of satisfaction as I watched them go. It was moments like these that made Halloween so special. 
As the night wore on, more costumed children arrived at my door, eagerly asking for treats. Some were dressed in classic characters like witches and ghosts, while others had more creative costumes like ninjas and superheroes. I loved seeing all of their different looks and hearing about their plans for the night. 
As darkness fell and the moon rose high overhead, the last trick-or-treater left with a smile on his face. I closed the door behind him and sat down to enjoy the quiet that had fallen over the neighborhood. It was moments like these that made Halloween so special.  The memory of those two adorable kids in costume lingered in my mind as I sat alone, savoring the feeling of happiness that Halloween brought.
