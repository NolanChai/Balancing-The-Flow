turned into a black cat with a white paw, and then back into a girl with short dark brown hair and deep green eyes that I loved more than anything else in the world. 
 It changed to another image of herself, this time with long blonde hair curled in front of her face. She had an oval face, full lips, pointed ears. The picture changed back into a cat again. This one had a white chest and black back. I turned away from it, not wanting to be sad for too long but missing her nonetheless. 
I was alone in the room with my thoughts, which seemed to drift towards a memory of an incident that happened many years ago when I was about 5 or so. I had been at home alone all day and my mother had asked me if there was anyone to pick me up from school on her way back. I told her no, but she didn't believe me and went ahead to check for herself. As she walked into the classroom to find out who had picked me up, she came upon a group of other parents waiting at my teacher's desk for their child. When they asked if she knew where mine was she said yes I am her mother and he will be here any minute. 
Just then in walks this woman that I did not know and told my mom to calm down because they had been expecting me all day and said something like "you have a little girl named Emma right?" My mom laughed at the suggestion, but the woman persisted until she said okay fine it must be you. The woman took me away with her and we left school in a taxi together while my mother waited for me to come back home. I knew that this was not right because no one had told us about any other plans for getting me from school or when they would come pick me up so the whole situation seemed very strange and I felt uncomfortable with it all. 
When we got back to my house, she put her key in the door and walked inside ahead of me. I was shocked that no one asked any questions about this woman as she had just picked me up from school like they were expecting her. When my mother came into the house a few minutes later she didn't seem suspicious at all when she saw this stranger sitting on our couch and said something to the effect of "oh, there you are". 
The woman left soon after and we never heard anything more about it. I think my mom was embarrassed and was trying to play it off as if nothing happened, but it sure seemed like someone had planned this and wanted her out of the way so they could be alone with me for a bit. It is something that has always bothered me because now I have no proof other than my own memory, which some people might say I just dreamt or made up, but I know it happened. 
I turned again to the wall in front of me and there was another picture on the other side of Emma. This one showed her as a little girl with two older kids sitting between her legs. She had a big smile and was holding hands with them both. It changed back into a black cat again, this time with purple eyes and a green chest. 
The last image I saw before the wall returned to normal was Emma as an adult woman walking down the road holding her dog's leash in one hand and carrying a large umbrella above her head with the other. She had on black pants, black boots, and a brown raincoat and looked like she was about to walk into the ocean waves. 
I loved Emma so much because not only was she beautiful, but also because she was my first love. I met her when I was in kindergarten and we spent many years together until finally we had to say goodbye as I got older and went away to college where we could no longer see each other as often. She was always with me though even after she died. 
I missed her dearly and thought about how much happier I would be if she were still here, but knew that in a way she was still there all along inside my heart and mind forever.
