ky'd and tense as he rolled out from under the tented canopy and stepped down onto the frozen soil of Borealis Prime's colony. The planet had been a boom town just eight months ago when the first cargo ships arrived with supplies and workers for the mining operations, but already it was dying like a gold rush boom town. Christopher knew why--the asteroid field was barren ****less than ten miles away***, and there weren't enough people to keep things going. The settlement would never be more than an outpost or way station, he thought as the wind blew snow across his face. There were few structures on the planet. A large mining operation dominated the colony. It was a long sprawling complex of tents and containers that Christopher could see even from this distance. The barren asteroid field sparkled like frozen crystal under the sun's bright light . Christopher squinted against the glare and wondered what lay out in space beyond the field, where he would have to travel soon if the colonists were going to get the ore that they needed. The settlement was named after the Roman god of the cold Boreas, an apt name for a planet dominated by ice. He turned away from the view and looked down at the tent where his wife lay sleeping . She would wake in another two hours if he left her to explore as planned. They had both been looking forward to this trip when it was first suggested eight months ago, but now he wasn't so sure that they should have done this. His daughter had stayed back on Earth with her father while he and his wife explored the asteroid field. Christopher sighed inwardly and looked out at Borealis Prime again . It was a beautiful place, but a very lonely one. The ice cold wind blew across the plains of Borealis Prime and shattered the crystal glass that sparkled like diamonds against the blue black sky.

Borealis Prime was a frozen wasteland with only traces of life . It had been abandoned by its former occupants, but it still had resources to be mined . The planet's barren landscape was dotted with rocks and ice that made traversing the land treacherous. Christopher shivered awake as the cryogenic fluid drained below his ears . Eight months in transit took a tole on the body, even for the explorer subspecies of human *Homo magellanus*. * His muscles jerky'd and tense as he rolled out from under the tented canopy and stepped down onto the frozen soil of Borealis Prime's colony.
