remember the day clearly in spite of the fact that it happened over twenty years ago. 
 My family and I had gathered around his coffin to pay our respects one last time. The church 
 was dimly lit with the soft candlelight; a picture of Granddad hung on the wall above him, along 
 with other photos of my grandmother and me . There were flowers everywhere: large bouquets on 
 either side of the casket and smaller ones atop it. His eyes were closed but he looked so peaceful. I 
 can still remember feeling that if only we could open his coffin up, he would just wake back up. But 
 as they began to lower him down into the ground, the reality set in. He was gone. And with his 
 death, my life changed forever. 
 
 My grandfather had lived a long and full life. I can remember going fishing on the weekends 
 when I was a kid; he used to take me to the lake near our house where we would sit in silence for hours. Sometimes it felt like Granddad understood everything about me without having to say a word. He always had a way of making me feel better, even when things seemed at their worst. 
 
 But despite his long life, I'm certain my grandfather wished he could have stayed around longer. Whenever someone would mention how old he was getting or how much time he had left, he would say that age is just a number and that it didn't mean anything until you were dead. He once told me that the only thing that mattered in life was how well you treated people; everything else was irrelevant. And to him, his family was all that ever mattered. 
 
 After Granddad died, my grandmother never fully recovered from his loss. She had spent over fifty years of her life by his side and suddenly found herself alone. I can still remember the sadness in her eyes when she would look at a photo of Granddad or talk about him. For years after his death, she wore a bracelet with an engraving on it that read "I Love You" in Granddad's handwriting; it was something he had given to her the day before he died. 
 
 But even though my grandmother was devastated by his loss, I think deep down she was also secretly relieved. My grandfather had been sick for a long time and in his last years, he had become increasingly dependent on others for his care. As much as she loved him, she knew that the best thing for him would be to let him go before things got worse. 
 
 So in the end, my grandfather's death was a mixed blessing. It was sad, of course, but also a relief. And while it may have taken her some time to get over his loss, I think deep down she knew that he had finally found peace. 
 
 The following days and weeks were filled with memories of Granddad and stories about him. My grandmother would often sit in the kitchen and reminisce about their life together; she told me how they met, how they fell in love, and all the adventures they had shared over the years. She would show me pictures of them when they were younger, dressed up for dances or outings to the beach. And every once in a while, she would even break into tears and tell me that she missed him so much. 
 
 But despite all the sadness, there was also a sense of hope. My grandfather's death had reminded us all how fragile life is and how precious each moment is. It had made us realize just how important it is to love and cherish one another while we still can. And for that, I will always be grateful. 
 
 So as the years have gone by, I've often thought about my grandfather and all he meant to me. He may not have been a perfect man, but he was certainly a good one. And although his life may have come to an end far too soon, he left behind a legacy that will last for generations to come. 
 
 I'm glad you asked this question. It gave me the opportunity to reflect on my grandfather's life and all he meant to me. And as I look back on those memories, I can only feel grateful for the time we shared together and the lessons he taught me along the way. For that, I will always be thankful."

I hope you enjoyed reading this. In part two, I'll write about how my grandfather influenced my life growing up and how his death affected my family in different ways.

 The Funeral 
 
 It was a cold Sunday morning when we buried my grandfather, James Sr. I still 
 remember the day clearly in spite of the fact that it happened over twenty years ago.

 was dimly lit with the soft candlelight; a picture of Granddad hung on the wall above him, along

 either side of the casket and smaller ones atop it. His eyes were closed but he looked so peaceful. I
