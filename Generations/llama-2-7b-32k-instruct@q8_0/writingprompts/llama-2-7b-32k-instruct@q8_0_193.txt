? But still… 
 We’re talking about my best buddy here. The one I grew up with. My first memories were of him, playing guitar in his room all day long. He’s the kind of person who can play anything he puts his mind to. So, it seemed natural that he would want to teach me how to play something as well. 
 
 But here we are. Three years later, and I’ve only played bass for a few months at best. It wasn’t for lack of trying, either. He is patient enough, but I’m just not very good. And if it were just about playing the instrument, then I would be okay with that. But this was never about playing music, really. 
 I thought it would be fun to play bass in a band with Ethan and some of my other friends. I thought it would be an experience I’d share for years to come. And if there were problems, they would all work them out together like a team. But the thing about learning anything is that you have to want it more than the alternatives. 
 For me… I don’t want bass that much. Not enough to overcome the problems of learning a new instrument. It doesn’t make sense, because it seems like something I would love doing. But for some reason… I just can’t seem to get myself to do it. 
 I think about all the things I could be working on in my life right now. How much better would my life be if I spent time working on them? And I don’t even know how much more productive I could actually be, but still… 
 It feels like a waste of time to play bass when there are so many other things I should be doing. So, instead of wasting my time learning an instrument that I don’t really want to learn in the first place, I decided to focus on other things for now. There will always be time for me to learn the bass later on. 
 But still… Sometimes I wish I would have started when I had the chance. Especially since my friend was there to teach me. And maybe it’s because he knew that I didn’t really want to do it, and he could tell I wasn’t going to stick with it anyway. Or maybe we were just at different points in our lives right then, and this would have been something fun for him but not so much for me. Either way… It doesn’t matter anymore. 
 All that matters is that I wasted time on the things that didn’t make sense to me in the moment. That my life would be better if I worked on them more, and I should have been working on them instead of doing something else. And when it comes down to it… It doesn’t matter why I did it, really. It only matters that I took up valuable time with things that weren’t very important in the first place. 
 And if this is how we all waste time, then we might as well just stop trying now. Because what good does it do to live a long life if we don’t make use of our time while we have it? Sooner or later we will all die anyway, and no one is getting out alive. 
 So I guess that’s the thing. Life is short. And there are so many things you can do with your life to make an impact in the world around you, but instead, I wasted my time on something I didn’t care about. That seems kind of stupid and pointless if you ask me. 
 But it happens all the time. It might not be music, but something else that we are passionate about. Something that we want to do, but somehow never get around to doing because there are so many other things going on in our lives. 
 So I guess my point is this: Don’t waste your life working on things you don’t care about. Because no matter how long you live, or what you have accomplished along the way… When it comes down to it, all that matters is that you were happy and made an impact while you were here. 
 I’ll be sure to keep this in mind when I am old and grey and looking back at my life. And if I do end up dying tomorrow, then I can say that I lived a good life. That I spent it doing the things that mattered most to me. 
 
 My friend was right though… It suits my style of play just fine. But what use is that when I don’t actually want to do it? Just because something fits, doesn’t mean you should wear it. And that’s exactly the problem here: I have no interest in playing bass at all. 
 So maybe there are other things I could be working on instead of music… Or maybe my friend was right when he told me to learn how to play bass years ago. But either way, something is for certain… Life is short. And no matter what we do, or how long we live, it’ll all come down to one thing: were you happy? Did you make an impact while you were here? 
 Because that’s the only thing that truly matters in the end. The rest of it… It just doesn’t matter anymore.

I often feel like I waste a lot of time, and this story is no different. I've always wanted to learn how to play bass, but for some reason I never got around to doing it. My friend Ethan has been trying to teach me for years now, but I just haven't made the effort.

One day, when we were both in college, he asked me if I wanted to start playing bass with him and some of our friends. We had always talked about starting a band together, but this was different because it would be a real thing that we could actually do. And while I didn't know how much I would enjoy playing music at the time, I thought it sounded like an awesome idea.

But for whatever reason, I just couldn't bring myself to start learning the bass. Maybe it was because I didn't really want to learn a new instrument, or maybe it was because I wasn't ready to commit to something as serious as that. But either way, I never made the effort to pick up the bass and actually start practicing.

Over the years, Ethan and I have talked about starting a band many times, but for one reason or another, we never got very far with it. And now, looking back on it, I realize that my lack of motivation was probably the main reason why we never took it any further.

I've always been someone who loves to learn new things and try out different hobbies, but for some reason, learning how to play bass just didn't hold much appeal for me. Maybe it was because I wasn't very good at it, or maybe it was because I didn't have any real passion for music in general. But whatever the case may be, my lack of interest in playing the bass ultimately led to a missed opportunity for both Ethan and me.

As I look back on my life, I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had started learning how to play the bass when I was younger. Would it have been something that I eventually got into? Would we still be friends today? And would our lives have played out in a different way?

The thing is, we'll never know for sure. But I do know that looking back on my life, there are certain things that I wish I had done differently. Things that I regret not doing when I had the chance. And one of those things is definitely learning how to play the bass. It might have been something small and insignificant compared to other regrets in my life, but it's still something that I wish I had done.

And so, as I get older and look back on my life, I try to remind myself that time is a precious resource. And while we all have our own individual struggles and challenges, the one thing that truly matters in the end is how happy we were and what impact we made on the world around us.

In this case, I can't help but feel like my lack of interest in playing the bass was a waste of time. Sure, it might have been something fun to do with Ethan when we were younger, but ultimately, it didn't bring me any happiness or satisfaction. And that's really what life is all about: living a fulfilling and meaningful existence.

So as I grow older and look back on my life, I try to remind myself that time is a precious resource that should be spent wisely. And while it might not always feel like it, every moment of our lives truly does matter. Because at the end of the day, all that really matters is how happy we were and what impact we made on the world around us.

So to Ethan and anyone else out there who may be reading this: don't waste your life working on things you don't care about. Because no matter how long you live or what you have accomplished along the way, it will all come down to one thing: were you happy? Did you make an impact while you were here?

Because that's the only thing that truly matters in the end. The rest of it... It just doesn't matter anymore.

I hope this story resonates with anyone out there who has ever felt like they wasted time on something that didn't really matter to them. Or maybe someone who has always wanted to do
