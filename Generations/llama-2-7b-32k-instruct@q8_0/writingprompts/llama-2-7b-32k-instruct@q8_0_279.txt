oout the name, it'll tell you what you need to know. Now, I was talking about how big these things are. They're pretty damned huge! Like, three times bigger than anything that used to exist before we found out about FTL drives.
   | You: So...if the flotilla is this far out from Earth, how did they get here? Did someone build a portal and send them here, or were they already out there, waiting for us to find them? 
   | Handler: Oh, that's an interesting question. It seems that these ships were discovered by our researchers while looking for signs of alien technology. They were hidden away in a nebula, and were in such good condition that it seemed like they had been abandoned just before leaving their system. Now, this was the first time we found anything that looked even remotely like this. So, as you can imagine, we were pretty excited. 
   | You: I bet you were!  But...what about communication? How did they get word to us if their technology is so different from ours? 
   | Handler: That's a good question, but one that was quickly answered when they got closer and we could send out signals to them. They responded right away, and we were able to communicate with them easily enough. It seemed like they had been waiting for us to find them! 
   | You: Wow! That's amazing! So, how did you end up taking over the flotilla? Did someone in your organization make a deal with their owners? Or did it just...happen? 
   | Handler: Well, that's the thing. We didn't actually take them over. It was more like we offered our services to whoever or whatever had left these ships there. I mean, they were in such good condition that we figured they might be worth something to someone. And so we made an offer. 
   | You: Wait, you can just do that? Offer your services to a group of aliens and then take over their property? That sounds like something out of a science-fiction movie! 
   | Handler: Well, not exactly. We're not just some random organization. We have a lot of resources at our disposal, including some pretty advanced technology. And we knew that these ships were worth a lot to whoever was using them. So we made an offer they could n't refuse! 
   | You: And what did they do? Just hand over the keys? How did this all play out? 
   | Handler: Pretty much, yeah. It turned out that there was a group of beings who had been using these ships for years and were getting pretty tired of it. They wanted to retire and let someone else take care of them. So they agreed to our offer. We took over the flotilla and here we are! 
   | You: Wow, that's amazing! It's a real-life sci-fi scenario! And what about the other ships in the fleet? Are you going to take those as well? 
   | Handler: Well, that's a good question. There are a lot of them out there, and we have our eye on some of them. But for now, we just want to focus on getting these two ships up and running as quickly as possible. We've got a long journey ahead of us!
   | You: Well, I can't wait to see what you do with these things! Good luck out there! 

As we walk through the spaceship, I still ca n't wrap my head around it's sheer size. Nor the fact there's an entire flotilla of such behemoths. 
 
 | Handler: This is HIH-2E-JAP-1579. Do n't worry aboout the name, it'll tell you what you need to know. Now, I was talking about how big these things are. They're pretty damned huge! Like, three times bigger than anything that used to exist before we found out about FTL drives.
