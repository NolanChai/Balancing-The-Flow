Pete was feeling nostalgic for his youth, and remembered the wild parties that used to take place during college years. He couldn't believe how fast time had flown by since then, and wondered what his life would look like in another 20 years from now. As he washed up, he noticed a mirror with a crack down the center. It reminded him of the fragility of life and how quickly it can change. He felt grateful for all that he had accomplished so far and resolved to make the most out of every moment.
