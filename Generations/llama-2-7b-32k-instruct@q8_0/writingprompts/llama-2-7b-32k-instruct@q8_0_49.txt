attending . She was the hottest babe at college, with long blonde hair that fell to her waist and a tight bod that didn't have an ounce of fat on it. And she was getting wild - dancing in her skimpy dress, kissing boys and girls, taking shots. It was like she was trying to seduce everyone in the place. Pete had been checking her out for weeks, but tonight he decided it was time to make his move. He walked into the backyard where the party was being held, wearing a pair of tight Wranglers and a sleeveless button-down shirt that showcased his muscular arms and chest. Shelly was dancing on the patio with her boyfriend, Patrick, when she saw Pete looking at her. She gave him a flirty look and tapped her fingers against her cheek, inviting him to come talk to her. He approached her slowly, trying to keep his composure as she ran her hands up and down his arms and asked what he was doing there. Pete stammered a bit, but finally came out with it: "I...I just wanted to say hi," he said, looking deep into her eyes. Shelly smiled, her blue eyes sparkling in the moonlight as she leaned closer to him. "Hi," she whispered back, her breath hot against his ear. Pete couldn't believe what was happening - it was like a dream come true. He had always thought she was out of his league, but now she was interested in him! He took a chance and asked if they could maybe get together sometime, and to his amazement, Shelly said yes! They exchanged numbers and agreed to meet up later that night for drinks. As Pete left the party, he couldn't stop grinning - he had just hooked up with the hottest girl in college, and it felt amazing!
