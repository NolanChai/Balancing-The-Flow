Jessica sighed and rolled her eyes. "You were talking about me like I wasn't even here," she said. "I've been listening to you the whole time."

"Oh. Right. Sorry 'bout that." Mark frowned, then grinned at her. "Hey, you wanna go grab a drink or something?" he asked. 

Jessica blinked at him, then nodded slowly. She didn't like the way he was acting, but she didn't want to be rude either. After all, they were both immortal now--they had forever to figure out how their lives would change with this new reality.

"Sure," she said. "Why not?"

Mark grinned and held out his hand to her. 

Jessica took it, and the two of them walked out of the bar together, heading for the nearest liquor store. They didn't know what the future had in store for them, but they were ready to take it on--hand in hand.
