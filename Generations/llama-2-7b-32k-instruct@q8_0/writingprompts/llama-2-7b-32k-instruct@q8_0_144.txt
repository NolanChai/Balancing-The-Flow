"I know," she said quietly. "But you cannot let me go in there alone." Her voice was firm and final. 
As I looked at her, and her trusting, expectant eyes, still so full of life, I suddenly realized that the unknown of what I would become frightened me more than death. 
I could now change what I'd done . . . but not without great cost. The longer she lived, the greater was my own sense of guilt and responsibility. I had to take her with me. She had to die as I had planned. But it would be a lie; it wouldn't be natural. I couldn't do that to either of us."

"So be it," she said softly. "We shall go together, then." 
She smiled up at me and gently stroked my face with her hand. It was so warm and full of love. Even now, even in death, she was trying to comfort me. And I felt the guilt and shame of what I had done to her begin to overwhelm me. She had always been a tender and loving presence in my life. What could I possibly do to show how grateful I was for all that she'd given me? 
I realized then, more than anything else, how much I loved her. And how much I hated myself for what I'd done to her. "Let us go," I whispered to her softly. Then we walked out into the darkness together."
