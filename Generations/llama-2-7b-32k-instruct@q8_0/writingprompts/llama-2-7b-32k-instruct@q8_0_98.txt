little more.

It was never moving, never did anything but stand there and glare, but every time I passed it I couldn't help staring at it myself. It was the first thing I saw when I woke up in the morning, it was the last thing I looked at before going to bed. The only thing that broke the monotony of a long, slow day as a guard on duty was seeing this damnable, hideous, wonderful thing stand there and watch me.

It had been built by the Imperial Marines, to stand sentinel over some ancient ruins in the jungle. It looked like it belonged there: it's design was sleek enough that I could almost imagine it flying through the air, wings folded up behind its back and tail fins outstretched, ready to move at a moment's notice.

It had been built with technology far beyond my own - which was pretty impressive when you consider the Imperial Marines were no longer around for me to ask about it. It had come in on a cargo ship, some freighter or other, but nobody would tell me how they got it here. Nobody wanted to talk about anything having to do with that damned thing.

It was probably an ancient relic, or maybe something else. Someone thought it would be cool to leave it here as a kind of decoration - some sort of sick joke, maybe? Maybe the design was supposed to mean something but I had no idea what; maybe the Imperial Marines just liked showing off their superior tech and power?

The Imperial Marines were like that. They used to rule this planet before my people came in and kicked their asses - and now we ruled, but they still had a presence here on our world, still wanted their independence back. So there were always rumors going around of them doing things: of rebels trying to steal weapons from the Imperial Marines, of the Imperial Marines making raids across the planet and kidnapping people for ransom.

The only reason I was on that particular post was because someone wanted to keep an eye on it. Maybe we were worried about some Imperial Marine rebels trying to steal it; maybe there had been rumors of their doing something to it, or breaking into the museum where it now resided and taking it away with them. Or maybe it was just a really good way for me to pass the time - after all, what could possibly go wrong?

But I'd always thought that even if things did go horribly, horribly wrong... well, something like this couldn't survive in our world. It seemed almost magical, almost unreal; it just didn't seem possible that we would ever have to face any sort of threat from this thing, could never actually have a reason to hurt it.
