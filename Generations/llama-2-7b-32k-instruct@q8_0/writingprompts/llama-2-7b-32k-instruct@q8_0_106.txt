1 / 1Complete this story from the following first sentence:
We were once a great species that walked the many plains of North America. Sure we had natural enemies; wolves and other large predators, and even the occasional native. Although it was always disturbing to see a wolf sneaking up on us in our sleep, it was a fair fight and they never did much harm. But then came the white man, or so I've heard from my elders, though most of them have been dead for many years now. He brought with him tools that we could not match; bows and arrows that fired fast and far, and spears sharp enough to kill us in a single thrust. With this technology he was able to easily wipe our numbers thin, forcing us back into the shadows of the forest where we would only emerge at night, to steal food from their settlements. But I am not afraid of them, for I have seen the true face of the beast that is man, and it is twisted with hatred and greed, while our hearts are full of love and compassion.
