ing to lose such a valued member of our herd, nothing could ever compare to the horrors that befell us when man came. We were once the most abundant large animal in North America, yet now we are on the verge of extinction due to our great enemy.
The first instance where human beings and buffalo met occurred over 10,000 years ago when Native Americans discovered how to domesticate us through hunting. While they were able to control us easily with their spears, it was not enough for them; mankind wanted more of our meat and hide. By the time Europeans discovered America, the native tribes had already depleted many herds of buffalo. The white settlers then came along with new weapons and ideas, including the railroad. Suddenly they were able to bring in large quantities of cattle, making our buffalo hunts useless. With more food than ever before, mankind has come full circle. They have returned to their roots; we are now once again a valued member of human diets.
The meat and hide of the American Bison was used for countless things from clothing to weapons, making us highly valuable to both Native Americans and white men. We were not only sought after by people because of our ability to be useful, but also because we were a symbol of bravery and power in Native American tribes. With little more than a horse and a spear, they could bring home enough meat for their village. In the West, cowboys relied on us as well. We provided them with food and their hides became saddles, ropes, and harnesses.
As I said, we were once abundant, but now there are fewer of us than ever before. By the 1850s, when European settlers had started to come in droves, our number was estimated at well over thirty million. Yet by the year 1900 only about six thousand buffalo remained on the plains; the rest having been slaughtered for their meat and hides. With the railroads, we could now be easily transported to market, but it was not without a great cost. We were almost completely wiped out by human greed.
It is not uncommon for us to hear people ask what has become of the buffalo; after all, they are no longer as abundant as once thought. While our numbers have slowly grown since the 1900s, we will never regain that great number of our ancestors. Although many breeding programs and conservation efforts have been successful, most people would be surprised to find out how few buffalo there really is in America.
To this day, you can still see herds of us roaming the plains. The American Bison Foundation estimates the population of free-roaming bison in all fifty states at over 12,000 head. While we are no longer as abundant as once thought, there are still many breeding programs and conservation efforts being used to help us flourish; perhaps one day we will regain our status as the most populous animal in North America.
Even though I am unable to provide you with a specific number of bison living today, I can tell you that there is always hope for us. Many breeding programs and conservation efforts have been successful. In fact, in 2009 the state of Montana had their first successful captive breeding program. In this same year, Yellowstone National Park alone saw over two thousand bison births! These are just a few examples that show how we will always live on in the hearts and minds of humans.
If you have been to Montana or Wyoming, chances are you have seen one of us roaming around. The American Bison Foundation has estimated the population of free-roaming bison in all fifty states at over 12,000 head. That is a lot more than most people think. It is also important to note that not all of us live on the plains. Many of our buffalo are being raised and slaughtered for their meat and hide as well.
I hope you have learned something new about my people. I hope you now know what we have been through over the years, how mankind has depleted our number until only a few of us remained. But there is always hope; just look at how many of us have flourished in the past ten years.
We are proud to call ourselves the American Bison Foundation’s mascot! We would like to encourage everyone to support this great foundation, because without their efforts, our kind would be extinct. With your help, we can always remain strong and continue living on the prairies where we belong!
The American Bison is an iconic part of Americana. They roamed across much of North America in large herds that were hunted by Native Americans for their meat and hides. The white man came and killed many of them to make room for cattle grazing on the prairies. They have been brought back from near extinction, but their numbers are still very small compared to how there used to be when the Native Americans roamed across the plains.
Bison are not only a symbol of strength and endurance, they also provide food and income for those who live on ranches and work as bull riders in rodeos. They were once the largest land mammal in North America but now their numbers have dwindled to a very small number compared to when there were millions upon millions of them roaming across the prairie.
The Bison has been a part of the West since man came to North America, and will always be a symbol of American heritage and freedom. Many people still see bulls running in the streets of Las Vegas for instance, even though they are not native to that area anymore. They were brought over there by settlers who loved the sight of them roaming wild as they did during the cowboy days of the Old West.
The American Bison has always been a symbol of strength and pride. It was an animal that Native Americans relied upon for their survival, and it also became a source of food and income to those that were able to capture or tame them in order to ride them. The bulls could be ridden as fast as the wind at over 40 miles per hour.
The American Bison was once a symbol of America’s strength in the world, but now it is also an endangered species. They were once found all throughout North America, but are now only in small groups in Yellowstone Park and other areas where they can roam free and be protected by ranchers.
