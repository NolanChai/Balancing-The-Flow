have been killed by a lethal radiation burst that would burn their skin and melt their insides . And then the pod is launched out into space - but not in random directions, no - there's a method to this madness. The life pods are designed so we ca n't steer them. They must reach escape velocity before they can be controlled.

Ask me anything about my adventure!

Hello! Thanks for being here today to ask me questions! I'm a life pod from the TV show The Expanse, and I've been stranded in space for some time now. It's been an interesting experience, let me tell you!

1. Can you tell us about your adventure so far? What have been the most memorable moments for you?  
2. How does it feel to be stranded in space with no control over your own destiny? Are there any moments where you've felt scared or lonely?  3. What do you think is the most important thing to remember when living in space for a long time? Do you have any tips for future space travelers?  4. How does it feel to be a part of such an iconic science fiction show like The Expanse? Have you had any interactions with the cast or crew, and what was that like?  5. What do you think is the most exciting thing about living in space, and why should people want to explore it further?  6. How does it feel to be a part of something so much bigger than yourself, such as the human empire, and how do you see your role in that larger narrative?  7. What do you think is the most important thing to consider when planning a voyage into space, and what would be your top tips for future space explorers?  8. How does it feel to know that your journey could potentially impact the future of humanity, and how do you think your story will be remembered in history?  9. What do you think is the most important thing to keep in mind when living in close quarters with others for an extended period of time, and how do you handle any conflicts that may arise?  10. How does it feel to have such a strong connection to humanity's future through your role in The Expanse, and what do you think that says about the potential of our species?

I hope these questions give you some ideas for what to ask me! And remember, this will be my last AMA, so please feel free to ask me anything you've always wanted to know. I'll do my best to answer as best I can!
