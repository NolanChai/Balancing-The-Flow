...s to be snooping around looking for adventure . It was about 2am and I had just come home from working a double shift as an overnight cashier at a gas station/convenience store. My truck was parked in the driveway, so I got out of my car and went inside to check on things real quick. Nothing seemed out of order when I peeked around before turning on all the lights. 
  
I turned back on the outside porch light for good measure since it had been raining that evening, making everything look extra spooky. I pulled up my window blinds to see what time it was . When I glanced out of my living room window and noticed the two kids standing in front of my truck, I knew something wasn't right . 
  
They didn't move or say a thing--they just stood there like they were waiting for me. I grabbed my gun that was underneath my pillow before stepping out of the house with my flashlight in hand, and sure enough, those two kids had broken into my car to use the GPS . 
  
"What's up?" I asked them in a friendly way since they looked like they were just two little lost boys. They didn't reply at first, but finally one of them mumbled something that sounded like, "You don't need this anymore." He was holding my GPS out toward me. 
  
I couldn't believe what I had heard and just looked at him with a confused expression on my face . At that point the other kid said, "He means you're dead meat!" as he raised his gun and fired it in my direction! 
  
In the split second before I was shot, I realized where this was all going and knew there was nothing I could do to save myself. As they began shooting at me, I took cover behind a tree that happened to be next to my porch. I knew I would eventually get hit since they were just kids with guns who didn't care about the consequences of what they were doing . 
  
I couldn't believe my life was over so quickly and in such an absurd way! And as I laid on the ground dying, all I could think about was how strange it was that these two random kids had decided to take my life at a time like this. It seemed like something out of a movie . 
  
When I came around after passing out for a little bit, I saw the two boys standing over me with their guns still aimed in my direction. They had been shooting at me non-stop and were laughing as they continued to do so, but now that I was alive they seemed surprised and confused . 
  
"Are you okay?" asked the kid with the gun who shot at me first. The other kid said something like "This guy ain't dead yet!" which made me cringe because he sounded like a psycho. After some more confusion, I finally got up to my feet and started limping toward them with my gun drawn. 
  
As I got closer, I told them they didn't need to do this anymore . They should just run away while they still had the chance since their crime was about to be exposed by the police anyways. The kid who shot at me seemed a little taken aback and looked at his friend like he wasn't sure what to do next . 
  
That's when I realized that those two kids didn't seem too happy with each other, and they had gotten into some kind of disagreement about what to do next. The one who shot me was trying to get his friend to run away while the other seemed hesitant to leave without shooting me again . 
  
At that moment I decided to intervene and tried to convince them it wasn't worth it anymore--they should just call a truce right now and go home. That way they could avoid getting into more trouble than they already were in, and I would be spared from having to die by their hand . 
  
After some hesitation, the kid with the gun finally agreed with me and lowered his weapon. He then put his arm around his friend and led him away as if he was comforting him for being a little scared of the dark. The other boy looked at me like I had just saved his life, and that's when it hit me--I wasn't in danger anymore! 
  
As those two kids walked away with their guns down, I knew this was all some kind of sick joke on them. They were just a couple of bullies who decided to pick on the wrong person . I had saved myself by talking sense into them and making them see what they were doing wasn't worth it--they would never be able to live with themselves if they continued this course of action. 
  
It was then that I realized those two kids weren't who I thought they were at all, and that's when the story got even stranger . As they walked away down the road in the darkness, something didn't seem right about their backs. It seemed like they had wings on their backpacks. 
  
That was my last memory of those two boys as I started to come around again--I don't know if it was a dream or reality since I was still in shock and confused from the whole experience . But whatever happened that night, I know for a fact it wasn't what it seemed like . 
  
As I stood there trying to figure out what had just happened, one of those kids turned around and came back. He walked straight up to me with his hand extended, holding something in the palm of his hand . As he handed it over to me I realized it was an antique pocket watch that appeared to be made from gold . 
  
"Here," he said as he handed it to me. "Sorry about all of this--I hope you understand what we're dealing with here." With a smile, he turned back around and walked off into the night. I still don't know who that kid was or where those two boys were going, but I have a feeling that pocket watch will hold some kind of special meaning for me in my life . 
  
I can't be sure what it all means yet, but as they say--it's the little things in life that count. It might not seem like much, but when you find something with a lot of sentimental value from someone who's helped you out of some trouble, that's worth more than anything else in the world . And I know that's exactly what that boy was trying to tell me by handing over his pocket watch. 
  
I feel like those two boys and I shared something special that night--something I can never forget or repay, but will always remember for the rest of my life . It's times like those that make being alive worth it, and remind us why we keep on fighting to live a good life no matter what. 
  
And who knows? Maybe one day the two of them will read this story online or in person (if they ever do come back). In any case, I just hope that kid out there somewhere who's dealing with some tough times and needs someone to help him out understands what happened to me that night . We're all here for a reason, and sometimes the universe has its way of reminding us of that . 
  
I don't know how this will end or if I'll ever see those two again, but as long as I have my pocket watch, it's like I've got them with me always. Thanks for reading my story, and I hope you enjoyed it!

Sure, here's a random passage that has nothing to do with the prompt:

"The sun was setting over the horizon as the wind rustled through the tall grasses of the prairie. The sky was a deep shade of pink and purple, casting an otherworldly glow over the landscape. In the distance, a group of Native American warriors were gathered around their leader, Chief Black Eagle. They wore their traditional headdresses and regalia, and carried their bows and arrows at the ready. 

Chief Black Eagle stood tall and proud, his eyes fixed on a spot in the distance where a white man had appeared earlier that day. The man was dressed in strange clothing and carried a strange object with him - a device that emitted a bright light. The chief knew that this was no ordinary man, but he did not know what he was up to. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Chief Black Eagle called out to his warriors. "Listen up, my people!" he shouted. "We have a new enemy on our hands! A white man with a strange device has appeared in our land, and we must prepare ourselves for battle! 

"But fear not," he continued. "I have a plan that will help us defeat this foe. We shall use our traditional weapons, but we shall also harness the power of the sun - the same power that sustains us each day. Together, we shall overcome any obstacle and emerge victorious!" 

The warriors cheered in response to their leader's words, knowing that they were ready for whatever lay ahead. As one, they lifted their weapons high into the air and
