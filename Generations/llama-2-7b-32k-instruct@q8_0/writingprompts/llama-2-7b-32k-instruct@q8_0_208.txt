The story is about a girl named Alice who is trying to find her way home from school. She has no idea where she is or how to get back. The only thing she remembers is that there was a drawing of a man with four legs and four arms on the sidewalk in front of her house, so she decides to follow it until she gets to a place where she recognizes something. She walks for hours but can't find anything familiar. She feels hopeless and starts to cry when suddenly she sees the drawing again! This time, though, there is someone next to it that looks just like Alice... only with four legs and four arms instead of two! 
  
 Alice runs over to the figure and hugs him, saying "I'm so glad you're here! I've been trying to get home for ages!" The man with four legs and four arms responds by saying that he knows exactly how she feels. He tells her that they are both in a strange land, but that it will be okay because he knows the way back to their own world. Alice is skeptical at first, but the man assures her that they just need to follow him and everything will be fine. 
  
 The three of them - Alice, the man with four legs and four arms, and now the fourth-legged man - walk together for a while until they come to a river. They can't seem to find a bridge or any other way across, so Alice starts to panic again. But before she knows it, there appears a boat with one oar - just like on the drawing! The man with four legs and four arms takes the oar and rows them all safely across the river. 
  
 They continue walking until they reach a big forest. At this point, Alice is getting really scared again, but she knows that if she follows these two guys, everything will be okay. She's just not sure how they're going to get her back home from there... But then the man with four legs and four arms points to another drawing on a tree trunk - this time it's of a house with a door that says "WELCOME HOME"! 
  
 Alice follows them through the door, which leads her into her own living room. She can't believe it - she's finally back home! The man with four legs and four arms is gone now, but Alice hugs the fourth-legged guy again and tells him thank you for helping her get home. He responds by saying "No problem! It was a pleasure to help." And with that, he disappears into thin air. 
  
 The end. 
  
 Now it's your turn: what do you think happened after Alice went through the door and disappeared from view? Did the fourth-legged man follow her home? Or maybe she had a dream about all of this... or even that he was just an imaginary friend! Let me know in the comments, and let's see if we can come up with some more stories together!
