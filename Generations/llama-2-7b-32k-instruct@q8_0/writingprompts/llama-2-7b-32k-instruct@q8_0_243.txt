roll in this town because no one ever knows anything about anything." "I did n't say it was a good plan, only that it's what you have settled on, so let me know when you want to execute it. Oh, and please stop referring to me as a dumb bitch, I might actually decide not to help you.""

My friend said "I'm going out tonight . Let's do something fun!" I replied with: "Like what?" She said "Go into the forest at night! We can go get some mushrooms and eat them right away! It sounds like a cool adventure, plus they are supposed to be good for your health.""

I am an enchanter. That's why my shop is so full of books. I'm always searching out the ones that have been forgotten or misplaced because they hide all sorts of knowledge and magic . Sometimes you can find things that have lain hidden away for decades, even centuries!" "It was a good night out with your friends! What did you do?""

I said "We walked into the woods in the dark. We collected mushrooms as we went along and then we had dinner at one of the local restaurants . I'm glad that you like to have fun adventures, but please be careful when picking wild foods.""

My friend asked "Why?" I replied with: "Because some wild berries are poisonous and mushrooms can also be harmful if you eat them improperly. Please remember this next time!""

I am a shopkeeper who sells only old, forgotten items . No one wants them but me since everyone else sees the value in shiny, new things . I'm happy to have these old wares because they are filled with magical power and knowledge." "Do you know where this item came from?""

My friend said "No . But it must be very old or something to have been forgotten." I replied with: "That is true, but some of the most powerful items are new. It's all about who uses them and how they use them!""

I am a shopkeeper who only sells items that have been lost in time . I do not sell what everyone else wants because I know what's really valuable! I'm the last one left standing because I'm good at finding things other people can't." "What item did you find?""

My friend asked "Where did it come from?" I replied with: "It came to me in a dream. It flew into my window and gave me an idea of what was lost . Then, I started looking for the item and eventually found it in a box at the back of the shop.""

I said "The shop is called 'Old Things' because that's exactly what we sell! We only sell items that have been lost over time . I know things are n't always as they seem, but sometimes a thing will come to you if you just give it space.""

My friend asked "Why?" I replied with: "Because we believe in the magic of life and in the power of objects. We also believe that people need time to find their way back to things they've lost . So we offer them a safe place to come home again.""

I am a shopkeeper who sells only unique, forgotten items. My store is called "The Lost & Found". I have many different customers, but some of the most loyal ones are those who need something specific and just can't find it anywhere else . They know that they won't find what they want elsewhere and come to me as a last resort.""

My friend said "Do you get tired of people coming in all the time looking for things that don't exist?" I replied with: "Yes, but I understand why they do it. Sometimes people just need something to help them remember their past or inspire hope for the future . And if I can be a part of that by selling them an item that no one else wants, then I'm happy to oblige.""
