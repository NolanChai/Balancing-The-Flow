That's an order! Mary replied as she snapped back to attention. She had been through too much to be treated like a kid again.  
Mary raised her head and looked at him with defiance. 
''I don't take orders from just anyone, sir, even if you are in the black suit, but I will do my best to follow your orders. Now tell me what you want from me!'' She demanded sternly.  
The man raised an eyebrow at her tone before saying, 
"I want you to spy on a certain group of people for us. We've got our reasons, but we can't trust the military with this information." He pushed a small device into her hand. It was a tablet computer and it had a single button on it. 
Mary looked down at the device in her hand. She knew what it did, but she also knew that pressing that button would change her life forever. 
"What's the deal with this?" Mary asked cautiously.  
The man in black said simply, "That is a tablet computer. It has all of our most sensitive information on it. You press the single red button on it and you become one of us." He grinned at her, showing off his perfect teeth. 
Mary looked up at him with disbelief. This was too much to take in. She didn't want this job, but she also had no choice but to accept it. She pressed the button on the tablet and watched as everything around her went black before fading back into focus.  
When Mary opened her eyes, she found herself standing in a dark room that was lit only by a single red light. Her body felt strange, almost... different. She looked down at her hands and saw that they were no longer her own. 
"Welcome to the resistance," the man in black said with a grin as he stepped forward to shake Mary's hand. "I am Colonel Jameson. You have now become one of us." With that, he led her out of the dark room and into a brightly lit hallway. 
Mary looked around in amazement as they walked down the hallway. It was like nothing she had ever seen before. Everything was so... futuristic. She couldn't help but feel excited about what the future held for her now that she was one of the resistance.  
As Mary continued to follow Colonel Jameson, she couldn't help but think about how much had changed since she first woke up in the forest all those months ago. Back then, she had been just a scared girl trying to survive. Now, she was part of an elite group of people who were fighting for justice and freedom. She felt a sense of pride that she never thought she would feel before. 
As they approached a set of doors at the end of the hallway, Colonel Jameson stopped and looked at Mary with a serious expression on his face. 
"You have been through so much, soldier," he said seriously. "I know that you must be feeling overwhelmed right now, but we are going to need you more than ever in the days ahead." He opened the doors and motioned for her to go inside. 
Mary stepped inside and was met with a room full of people who looked just like her. They were all dressed in black suits and they had red lights on their collars. They were all staring at her with serious expressions on their faces.  
Colonel Jameson came up to Mary and said, "Welcome to the resistance, soldier. You have now joined an elite group of people who are fighting for justice and freedom. We need you more than ever in the days ahead." He looked at his watch and said, "I've got to get back to work. I'll see you on the other side of these doors." 
Mary nodded, feeling a sense of pride that she never thought she would feel before. She knew that this was just the beginning of her journey with the resistance. She had no idea what was in store for her, but she was ready to face whatever came her way.  
As the doors closed behind her, Mary took a deep breath and looked around the room. She saw people of all ages and races, all dressed in black suits and staring at her with serious expressions on their faces. She knew that she had made a friend for life when she first met Jade. Now, she was part of something even bigger than the resistance. 
Mary looked down at her hands and saw that they were still... different. She didn't know how to explain it, but she felt like she had been reborn. Like she was a completely new person. She knew that this was just the beginning of her journey, but she was ready for whatever came next.
