A soldier is standing at attention.

Mary struggled to stand on shaking legs, pushing the hair out of her face and doing her solid best to stand at attention. 
The man in the black suit told her simply and she saluted him. 

`` At ease, soldier.'' The man in the black suit told her simply and she stood down from attention, but not before asking one question. 
She asked, "Sir, what should I do?"

He gave a small smile back at her. 

"You're dismissed," he replied. "Go on home. You don't have to stand guard anymore." 

With that she turned and walked out of the room, leaving the door open behind her as she exited. She made it just in time for a cup of tea with some honey before collapsing into bed.

The next day Mary woke up bright and early, ready to go to work. She cleaned up quickly and headed out to the barn where she would spend most of her morning milking the cows. 
As she was doing so, the man in the black suit came walking into the barn with a smile on his face. He gave her a small nod before heading off to check on the horses. 
He spent about an hour there, then headed back out of the barn to go see how things were going in town. Mary kept working through the day. She spent most of her time milking cows, but also helped with some chores and even took a break to have lunch with some of the other workers. 
At the end of the workday she gathered up what she needed for the night before heading out the door and locking it behind her as she left. 
As she walked home, Mary couldn't help but feel a little bit nervous about the next day. She wasn't sure if anything would be different, but deep down she knew that everything was going to change. 
She arrived home just in time for dinner and spent some time talking with her family before heading off to bed. As she laid there staring at the ceiling, Mary couldn't help but feel excited about what lay ahead.

The next morning Mary woke up early once again, eager to see how everything would be different today. She spent a few hours working around the house, doing some washing and cleaning before heading out for her walk. 
As she walked, she saw the man in black standing outside of his office building watching her. He gave her a small nod as he passed by. She returned the gesture as she continued on down the road, feeling a little more confident than she had yesterday. 

She reached the town square and headed into the sheriff's office to see how things were going in town. It was very busy this morning. People were coming in and out of the doors at all times with various questions and concerns. Mary watched as people came in asking for help, and she wondered if anyone would come in today seeking her help. 
As she waited by the door to see what might happen, a man walked up and asked the sheriff about some papers that he needed signed. 
The sheriff gave him a small smile as he handed him an application for a gun permit. The man filled it out quickly before handing it back to the sheriff to sign. 
The sheriff took it from him and looked over at Mary, giving her a small nod as if to say "I'm going to count on you today."

Mary smiled back at the man, feeling more confident than she had the day before. She took the paperwork from the sheriff's outstretched hand and headed into his office to start processing it. 
She spent a good amount of time going over all of the details on the application and making sure that everything was filled in correctly before taking it back out for him to sign. As she handed it to him, he gave her another small smile and nodded at her again as if to say "Thanks."

The man left and Mary went back to her station in the front office. She spent a few more hours helping people with various questions and concerns before heading home for the night. 
As she lay there staring at the ceiling, Mary couldn't help but feel excited about what lay ahead. Tomorrow was going to be another big day, and she knew that things were only going to get better from here on out. She drifted off into a deep sleep feeling happy and content as she dreamt of all of the days to come.
