But online dating was a disaster. When my matches would ask me questions about myself, I'd stumble over my words and be unable to describe the things I liked or wanted. As it turns out, I'm not great at talking in real life either. One particularly memorable match asked what my favorite color was; after a long pause, I replied with "red," but felt like an idiot for blurting something so simple and obvious.
As time went on, I realized that I could no longer stand feeling this way about myself. So here I am now, three years into singlehood, ready to start talking to people again -- even if it does feel weird and unnatural at first. Maybe you can relate? 
(To be clear: I don't mean dating someone in my office or anything crazy like that; this is more just about getting back out there for fun and maybe meeting new friends.)
I'm also worried about rejection. Whenever I think of talking to a stranger, the worst case scenario plays out in my head: I say something awkward or dumb, and they reject me immediately and then we never speak again.
But despite these fears, I am ready to start putting myself out there more. I've been single for three years, and it's time for a change. 
(As an aside -- if you have any tips on talking to strangers, or ways you cope with rejection, please let me know! This is new territory for me!)

Sure thing! Here's a possible first post for your "Getting Back Out There" subreddit:
Title: It's Time to Get Out There (And Maybe Even Meet Some New Friends)

Welcome, fellow single folks! Are you like me and have been feeling stuck in the same old routine for too long? Have you been single for so long that it's starting to feel shameful or embarrassing? Well, fear not, my friend, because this subreddit is here to help. We're going to work on getting you back out there and meeting new people - maybe even some potential friends! 
But before we get started, let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name is [Your Name], and I've been single for nearly three years now. I tried online dating, but it didn't work out so well for me (to be fair, I'm not very good at talking in public places either). So here I am, ready to start putting myself out there again - maybe even meeting some new friends along the way! 
Now, before we go any further, I want to set up a few ground rules: 
1. No hate speech or bigotry of any kind. This is a welcoming space for all singles, and we don't tolerate hateful language towards anyone. 2. Let's try our best to be respectful and understanding towards one another. We're all in this together, trying to get back out there and make new connections. 3. No spamming or self-promotion. This is a space for honest, genuine discussions and advice sharing. Keep your posts and comments focused on the topic at hand, and avoid promoting yourself or your business. 4. And finally, let's have fun! Remember, we're all here to support each other and make some new connections. So don't be afraid to share your experiences, ask questions, or offer advice - it might just lead us to a whole new world of possibilities! 
With that said, let's get started on our journey! Post any questions, fears, or success stories you have about getting back out there, and let's support each other along the way. Together, we can make some new connections and build a community that will last a lifetime! 
(As an aside -- if you have any tips on talking to strangers, or ways you cope with rejection, please let me know! This is new territory for me!)
