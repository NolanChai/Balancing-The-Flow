When a friend asked me about the best way to find love as someone who is out and queer, I had an unusual answer: go to law school. I've been single for nearly three years now, and it's gotten to the point of being shameful. I tried creeping around bars, but I am constitutionally inept in public places -- I tried online dating, but have yet to find a way to convey my dry sense of humor.
