24 years ago and I took the job.

I don't have to say what year that was. The world still remembers it as if it were yesterday, when every house in this town had its own grave.

But now I have a better place for my hat; one with a real head in it. But not a pretty girl's head or a manly-man's either but the head of an old crow. Her name is Mrs. Crowther, the mayor of this fine town, and she is a hard working woman. She is the kind of person who makes you think that even though we are all going to die someday, there is some good in this world after all.

I had never seen her before when I first saw Ana's grave, but since then I have seen her at funerals and other civic engagements as she has come along side of me with the same heartache and grief I still feel over my lost love. And now that I am the mayor of this town myself, we work together to make sure that all those who die here will be given a proper burial; something they wouldn't have had 24 years ago.

We sit there in silence for awhile as I remember Ana and the world before she came into my life. And then she came along; this young girl with more love than any one person could ever ask for, with hair that glistened like spun gold and eyes that sparkled like diamonds. Her voice was sweet like honey and her kisses tasted like strawberries and cream.

But 24 years is a long time to grieve over the loss of someone you loved so much, no matter how good she was or how bad it hurts. I am not even sure that I know if I still love Ana now; perhaps I only remember loving her once. But I do know that in those few short years we had together I fell deeper and deeper for her, until all I wanted to be was with her, to have her with me always.

And then the plague came and took her away from me as quickly as she came into my life; just like a lighting strike out of the blue without warning or reason. She never even knew she had it until the day she died. It all happened so fast and I was left behind, still grieving for what could have been but now was not to be.

I have since spent every moment since then trying to make sure that no one else has to lose someone they love like I did, especially children. That is why it means so much to me when Mrs. Crowther and I work together on the cemetery. It's a way for her to help keep Ana's memory alive in this town where she died, and a way for me to honor my lost love with something that is good and useful instead of just mournful thoughts about what could have been.

I had never met Mrs. Crowther before Ana died but now I realize how lucky I was to meet her and we work together every day. She has the same heartache as me over those who lost their loved ones in that terrible time 24 years ago when the plague came through town, and she makes sure that everyone is given a proper burial even if they don't have a lot of money.

I still wear my hat every day to remind myself to keep on remembering Ana and all those who were lost in her time. And now with Mrs. Crowther working beside me every day, I know that Ana will never be forgotten again. We make sure to take care of the cemetery together and fix up graves as they need it or add names if someone has died since the last time we checked; things that weren't done before when most people didn't care about anything except their own survival.

So, I tip my hat to Mrs. Crowther every day in thanks for all she does for our town and for Ana as well. We are never truly alone in this world no matter how much it feels like we are sometimes; there are always other people out there who care about the same things you do, even if they didn't know each other before. It just takes finding someone else who cares to help you keep on going.

It has been a long time since Ana died but now I have Mrs. Crowther as my friend and partner in this world and we make sure that no one is forgotten like she was; at least not if we can do anything about it, even if it's just keeping up with the cemetery. And now that I am mayor of our town, we work together to help everyone else keep their memories alive as well.

It has been a long time since Ana died but her memory still lives on in all of us who knew and loved her; especially through Mrs. Crowther's kindness and care for the cemetery that bears her name. It may not have been possible to keep her with us, but it is comforting to know that she will never be forgotten again.

It has been a long time since Ana died but in this town where so much suffering took place, we still find joy in keeping her memory alive and being kind to one another like Mrs. Crowther and I do every day as we care for the cemetery named after her; something that would have seemed impossible 24 years ago when most people didn't even care if their family members got a proper burial or not.

It has been a long time since Ana died but through Mrs. Crowther's efforts and my own, we make sure that Ana's memory will never be forgotten again. We still mourn our losses as everyone who lived in this town did 24 years ago, but now we do so with the hope that one day the dead will rise up to greet us like Ana would have if she had lived long enough.

I tip my hat every morning to remember Ana and all those lost in her time, especially Mrs. Crowther who works alongside me in taking care of the cemetery where Ana is buried. We both still mourn our losses but we do so with hope that one day they will rise again to greet us like they should have done 24 years ago when so many had to be forgotten because there was no one left alive who knew or loved them.

It has been a long time since Ana died but now I know she is never truly alone in this world as we keep her memory alive through Mrs. Crowther's efforts and mine, not only at the cemetery where she rests but also through our acts of kindness to one another; something that was impossible 24 years ago when most people just wanted to survive at all costs.
