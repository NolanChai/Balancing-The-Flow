I'll give you an example of what I mean by a slimy invasion: A couple of months ago, my sister and I were having lunch at a restaurant. We ordered our food and sat down to enjoy it when all of a sudden...a slime creature started crawling across the table! 

We were horrified - how could this be happening? How could two slimes invade a human being, let alone two different ones? And what did this mean for the rest of us? 

As it turned out, the two slimes had been living together and sharing their home. They were happy there and didn't want to leave - but they did feel like they needed to get away from the human world for a while. So they decided to invade different humans, which worked! 

My sister and I talked about what we should do. We couldn't just let these slimes live with us forever, could we? But at the same time, we didn't want them to go back to their own world either. What was the best solution? 

After some thought, we decided that we would take the slimes on a trip around the world. We would show them all the different cultures and places that humans had to offer. And who knows - maybe they'll even want to stay with us forever! 

The end.
