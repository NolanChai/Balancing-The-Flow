Sorry, I don't understand the question. Could you rephrase it?

Captain Ook's voice returned to its normal volume and pitch as he said "Let me get this straight. You're telling me that we should just accept these things as if they're totally fine?" 

The slime stared up at the Captain, who was now standing a good three feet above him. It looked back down at itself in disbelief and screamed "I'm not okay! I am not okay!" 

"You know what? You're right," said Captain Ook. He then turned to his left and snapped his fingers, causing the ground beneath them both to shake. The slime looked at its captain in confusion as he said "Let's just...go with it."

Captain Ook turned back to the slime in front of him and snapped his fingers again, causing a portal to appear in front of them. The two of them stepped through and reappeared on another planet. 

The slime looked around, taking in its surroundings for the first time since it had been possessed by Captain Ook. It was a barren, rocky landscape with nothing but sand and stones for as far as the eye could see. 

"What are we doing here?" asked the slime. 

Captain Ook chuckled to himself before turning back to his companion and saying "We're home, my dear fellow slime."

The slime looked up at Captain Ook in confusion as he said "We're home, my dear fellow slime," but it couldn't shake the feeling that something was...off. It looked down at its body and noticed that while its eyes had turned yellow, its skin color hadn't changed. 

Captain Ook turned to the slime and said "I know what you're thinking. But trust me, this is all for the best." He then placed his hand on the slime's head and smiled warmly as he said "We'll figure it out together." 

The slime nodded, still feeling a little uncomfortable but trying to put its trust in Captain Ook. The two of them continued to explore their new home, the slime slowly starting to adjust to its new form and abilities. 

As they walked further into the planet's surface, the slime couldn't help but notice that there were others like them - other slimes who had been possessed by Captain Ook and now lived on this planet. 

"How did you do it?" asked one of the slimes, its eyes still yellow but its skin a deep purple color. 

Captain Ook chuckled again before turning to his companion and saying "It's a secret, my dear fellow slime." He then placed his hand on top of the other slime's head and smiled warmly as he said "But don't worry, we'll figure it out together." 

The slimes looked at each other and nodded in understanding, knowing that they were part of something greater than themselves. They continued to explore their new home, feeling a sense of belonging and purpose that they had never felt before. 

As the days passed, the slimes continued to adjust to their new lives on this planet. They grew stronger together, their abilities and powers becoming more powerful with each passing day. 

One night, Captain Ook sat down with his fellow slimes and said "I've been thinking...we need a name for ourselves." 

The slimes looked at one another and nodded in understanding, knowing that they were part of something greater than themselves. They continued to explore their new home, feeling a sense of belonging and purpose that they had never felt before. 

"How about the Purple Slimes?" asked one of the slimes. "We're purple, we're strong, and we're powerful." 

Captain Ook chuckled again before turning to his companion and saying "I like it. We are the Purple Slimes." 

And with that, the Purple Slimes were born - a group of slimes who had been possessed by Captain Ook and now lived on this planet, working together to become stronger and more powerful than ever before.

"What about we elect someone?" asked one of the slimes. "We can have elections every so often."
