The man paused for a second. Then he looked at me and said, "You know what they say: it's not the destination, it's the journey."  
I raised an eyebrow. I didn't think much of that traveling cliche, but I kept quiet because my friend was looking a bit more serious than usual. He continued, "And besides, have n't you heard? You can always turn back. It's not like time is running out or anything."  
I rolled my eyes. This was the kind of nonsense that people said when they were too scared to take a stand and do something different in their lives. But then I remembered what my friend had told me earlier: "Don't worry, we have backup plans in case things don't work out."  
My friend was right; the journey is part of the experience. So, with a nod, I said, "Okay. Let's go with Breakout."   
I stood up and stretched my legs. My hands were still bound, but at least I could move around now. I looked over at my friend and asked, "Ready?"  
He smiled and nodded. Together, we made our way out of the room, down a long hallway, and into an elevator that took us to the lobby. Once there, we stepped outside, and the sun hit me like a ton of bricks. It was bright and beautiful, and I felt alive for the first time in months.  
I looked at my friend and asked, "How'd you know this place had a basement?"  
"Because I've been here before," he said with a grin. And that was all he would say about it.   
We started walking down the street, heading toward whatever adventure lay ahead of us. I felt a sense of excitement and curiosity that I hadn't felt in years. I knew things were going to get interesting from here on out.  
As we walked, my friend turned to me and said, "You know what they say: life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."  
I laughed. My friend was right - this was definitely shaping up to be an adventure. And I could tell that he was going to have fun, no matter what happened.   
And so we walked on, into the unknown, with our heads held high and our hearts full of excitement. Because when it comes down to it, the journey is always better than the destination.
