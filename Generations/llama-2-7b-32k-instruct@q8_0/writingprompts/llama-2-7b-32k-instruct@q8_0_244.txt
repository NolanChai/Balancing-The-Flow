When you're in love, even the most unexpected things can be exciting. For example, one day when I was watching my girlfriend sleep, I saw something that made me feel giddy with excitement: her nipples were hard! My girlfriend had a nice rack to begin with, and seeing those little buds swelling up like that was almost too much to handle.
It wasn't just the sight of them that got my engine revving - it was also the thought of what they could do. I imagined pinching one of her nipples between my fingers, feeling how hard it would be, and watching her flinch in pleasure as I did so. Or maybe I'd squeeze both of them gently, until she was writhing beneath me in ecstasy.
Of course, I couldn't act on these fantasies yet - my girlfriend had no idea that I was interested in her like this. But just knowing that she was potentially available to me in the future made me feel alive and electric. I couldn't wait until the day when we could finally explore each other's bodies together.
As for now, I'll have to content myself with watching her sleep and imagining what it would be like to touch her nipples in person. But who knows? Maybe one day soon, she'll wake up to find herself wrapped in my arms and feeling the tip of my tongue teasing at her hardened nipples. Fingers crossed!
