Friday, February 7, 2076, 1722 hours Atlantia Standard Time 
Jedd Ardin rushed into his apartment after finally getting the old retinal scanner to recognize him. Ardin was a senator from South Amin

Ardin entered and turned on the lights as he dropped all of his bags near the couch. He wiped the sweat off of his brow before heading towards the kitchen. After pouring himself a glass of water, he looked around to see that everything in his place was disorganized and needed to be picked up. With a sigh, Ardin decided to take out some clothes to go through so that he could make up his bed for tomorrow.

After taking off his jacket and putting it on the back of a chair, he removed his shoes and placed them in the corner beside the door before heading towards the bathroom. As he washed his hands and face, Ardin wondered what his evening would look like and whether or not there were any messages waiting for him from work that needed to be looked at right away.

Once finished with getting ready to go out, Ardin grabbed a jacket and some money before heading over to the elevator and pressing down on the button. It was only about two blocks to the bar where he would have drinks with his colleagues, but it gave him time to relax and let off some steam after what had been a pretty rough day at work.

Jedd Ardin, Senator from South Amin, was having a particularly bad day at work today. He'd just gotten out of an especially contentious meeting with his colleagues on the Committee for Foreign Relations. As he exited the Senate building, Ardin tried to shake off the frustration and anger that had been swirling around in his head all afternoon. But it wasn't easy - the day had started off poorly too, when his retinal scanner at home had failed to recognize him, forcing him to use a spare key he kept hidden in a fake rock outside of his front door.

Once inside his apartment, Ardin was greeted by more frustration: the mess left behind by his young son, who'd been playing with blocks when Ardin had arrived home earlier that evening. He sighed as he walked through the living room and tried to figure out how long it would take him to clean up before heading out again.

But first, Ardin decided, a drink was in order - after all, it was happy hour at his favorite bar, just two blocks away. So he grabbed some money and headed out the door, eager to unwind with a cold beer and the company of his friends. As he walked down the street, Ardin couldn't help but notice that the cityscape around him was starting to change. The old buildings were crumbling, their stone facades marred by cracks and stains, while new structures - gleaming glass-and-steel skyscrapers that seemed to sprout from nowhere - were going up everywhere he looked.

It was a strange juxtaposition: the old city, with its centuries-old history and traditions, fighting against the relentless forward march of progress. Ardin knew that his home city had been at the forefront of technological advancement for centuries, but he couldn't help but feel a little sad as he watched the slow, steady erosion of what had once been a vibrant and diverse neighborhood.

As he continued down the street, Ardin realized that it wasn't just buildings that were changing - the people too were starting to look different. The old-style clothing and fashion styles were being replaced by sleeker, more modern clothes, while the faces of his fellow pedestrians had taken on a new, almost mechanical quality that reminded him of the glowing screens he saw everywhere in the city.

It was as if Atlantia itself - once a proud and ancient civilization - was slowly being replaced by something new and unknown, something that didn't quite fit with the city's history and identity. Ardin couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding as he walked onward towards his destination, wondering what the future held in store for this once-great metropolis.

As Ardin reached the bar, he was greeted by the familiar sight of his colleagues gathered around the corner booth. He felt a warm feeling of relief wash over him as he saw their familiar faces, and took a seat across from them. As he raised his glass in a toast, Ardin couldn't help but feel a little bit lighter - even if for just a moment - before returning to the business at hand.

But as he sipped on his drink and listened to the conversation around him, Ardin couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been following him all day. It wasn't just his colleagues who were starting to look and act differently; it was also Atlantia itself, with its crumbling old buildings and sleek new structures.

What did the future hold for this once-great city? Ardin wondered. Would Atlantia remain a proud and ancient civilization, or would it be replaced by something new and unknown? And what did that mean for his own life - and the lives of those around him? It was a question that seemed to grow more urgent with each passing day.

As Ardin listened to the conversation at the bar, he couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection from the world around him. The old buildings, the people, even the air itself - it all seemed to be changing in ways that he didn't quite understand. And what would happen if Atlantia was no longer the proud and ancient civilization it had once been? Where would it leave him and those around him?

The sound of clinking glasses and conversation filled Ardin's ears as he sat at the bar, his mind wandering from thought to thought. It was a strange feeling - one that he couldn't quite shake off, even after several drinks. But it wasn't until much later, when he was sitting alone in his apartment, staring out the window at the changing skyline outside, that Ardin finally had an answer.

It hit him like a ton of bricks - Atlantia was evolving, and so was everyone else. The old ways were falling away, to be replaced by something new and unknown. And he was no exception - Ardin too would have to change in order to keep up. It was a daunting thought, but one that he knew he had to accept if he wanted Atlantia to continue being the great city it once was - and if he wanted his own life to continue on its current path.

As he sat there, staring out at the changing skyline, Ardin couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. After all, evolution wasn't always a bad thing. It could be a chance for Atlantia - and for him too - to grow and change in ways that would make it stronger and more resilient than ever before.

With this thought in mind, Ardin took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He knew he had work to do - to adapt to the changing world around him, to help Atlantia evolve into something new and wonderful. And while it might be scary at times, he was confident that he could do it.

After all, he was a senator from South Amin, wasn't he? He had experience in navigating change - and now he was ready to put that experience to good use. Atlantia would continue to evolve, and so too would Ardin. Together, they would make the most of whatever changes lay ahead.

And with that thought, Ardin smiled to himself, feeling a sense of pride wash over him. He knew he could handle whatever came his way - because he was Jedd Ardin, Senator from South Amin, and he was ready for anything Atlantia had in store for him.
