o and was known for his work on agricultural reform. The door chime sounded as he placed his thumb against the panel and the locking mechanism clicked open. Ardin took a deep breath before turning on the lights in the living room and beginning to take off his clothes, throwing them into a nearby hamper. He moved into the bathroom and stepped into the shower, running the water for a minute as he began washing himself with soap and shampoo from the dispenser. He used the body wash instead of soap because it lasted longer but still felt good on his skin. After about ten minutes, Ardin turned off the shower, grabbed the towel hanging behind the door, and dried himself off before going back into the living room. The lighting there was dimmed to save energy and he placed a pillow from the couch on the small table in the corner of the room so he could use it as a seat. Ardin took out his handheld and began scrolling through various news feeds, seeing that another protest had broken out against the government

Sure! Here's the continuation of the text:

"The latest news was a small group of demonstrators gathered outside of Senator Ardin's home calling for him to be impeached. The senator sighed and set his handheld aside, leaning back against the couch as he listened to the sound of his own breathing. He knew that if they were serious about getting rid of him they would have done it already. Ardin's thoughts were interrupted by a notification from his handheld. The message was a video link and the senator looked down at it, opening the message. He watched as the video began to play. It showed several individuals standing outside of their own homes with signs protesting various government policies, including the one that Ardin had proposed. The senator listened as the crowd chanted in unison calling for him to be impeached and then he saw a few individuals begin throwing eggs at his house."

"Ardin watched the video in silence before closing it out and opening up another news feed. He scrolled through various articles, seeing that the protests were spreading across the country. The senator sighed again as he realized that there was no way he could convince them that his policies were good for the country. Ardin's thoughts were interrupted by another notification from his handheld. It was a text message from his assistant, informing him that their meeting with the head of the government would be starting soon. Ardin looked down at his handheld and replied to her message."

"Sorry, I have something else going on right now. Can you please reschedule for tomorrow?" He waited a few moments before receiving a reply from his assistant. It was an agreement and the senator's face lit up as he realized that he might be able to get this whole mess handled in one day."

"Ardin placed his handheld aside and stood, moving towards his bedroom where he pulled out some clothes and put them on. He then moved into the kitchen where he opened a bottle of water and took several sips before heading back into the living room. The senator closed his eyes as he heard the sound of his own breathing once again, leaning against the couch and feeling tired."

"Ardin knew that this was not how it should be. He had spent most of his life fighting for what he believed in, only to see it all come crashing down around him. The senator listened to the sound of his own heartbeat before closing his eyes again, falling into a deep sleep."

"The dreams came soon after, filled with visions of protesters yelling at him and government officials shunning him. Ardin's mind was filled with images of the past that he wished would just go away. The senator watched as his own memories were ripped from him like a limb being torn from his body."

"Ardin sat up, gasping for air as he looked around in confusion. He was surrounded by nothing but darkness, unsure of where he was or how long he had been there. The senator closed his eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again, seeing that the darkness began to shift and move around him."

"Ardin watched as small tendrils of light slowly spread out from the center of the darkness, reaching towards him like fingers. He felt a sense of peace wash over him as he lay there, watching the light grow closer until it finally wrapped around his body."

"Ardin's mind drifted to his childhood memories, seeing himself playing with his friends in the fields behind their home. The senator watched as the light grew brighter, enveloping him completely before he felt a warmth spread throughout his body."

"The light continued to grow, filling Ardin's mind with memories of all the good things that had happened to him over the years. He saw himself graduating from university and then becoming a senator, fighting for what he believed in. The light began to fade as Ardin opened his eyes, looking around at nothing but darkness once again."

"The dreams continued on, leaving Ardin feeling tired and worn out. He knew that they would continue to haunt him until he was able to find a way to make them stop."
