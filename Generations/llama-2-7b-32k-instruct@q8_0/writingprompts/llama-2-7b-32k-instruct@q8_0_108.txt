My father was a lawyer for god's sake, my mother taught third grade English, but that didn't keep them from trying to teach me about politics incessantly. I don't care who runs the country as long as they do n't mess with my birth control pills or force me to go into debt paying for their war, I just want to be left alone and live life on my own terms. The problem is that no one leaves me alone. Not anymore. They all want a piece of the action. My friends too, they think they're special because we went to school together since kindergarten, like that means we're best friends for life. But I do n't have time for any of it. The only thing I'm good at is being me and I'd like to keep on doing that without a bunch of other people trying to change my mind or force me into doing something I do n't want to do.

I'm just one person, how can I be expected to care about every problem in the world? The sad truth is that all these people who are trying to make their voices heard end up drowning each other out. We need to focus on our own lives and not worry so much about other people's problems. If someone's a starving homeless person, yeah, I might give them some money but it's not like we have the same issues. I go home from work and eat dinner in front of my computer while watching trash TV while listening to loud music on blast. How many people in the world can say that? Most importantly, if they did n't like how I was living their lives it'd be none of their business. But no. They all want to make everything about them and their problems when there are so many more important issues in the world than some girl not wanting to marry.

So yeah. Fuck everyone and their opinions. This is my life. If you do n't like it, I guess that's tough shit. And if you have a problem with that, then I guess we ca n't be friends anymore. Because friendship's not just about fun times and gossiping to each other about boys or bitching about how much homework we have to do, it's also about being able to agree to disagree. It's okay if you have a different opinion than me but I will never respect anyone who tries to force their beliefs onto me. Life's too short for all that nonsense.

The government should not be allowed to make laws based on other people's opinions and no one should judge me because I am an independent woman who is living life on her own terms, just because a bunch of men in suits want to take control over my body does n't mean that they get the right. It's time for women like me to stand up against the patriarchy once and for all and refuse to play by their rules any longer. 

I do not have to marry or procreate with someone I am not in love with just because men feel threatened by the fact that there are so many independent, strong woman out there. There is nothing wrong with wanting my own life and living it on my terms. I think it's time for women like me to start saying "Fuck off" to the patriarchy once and for all and refuse to play by their rules any longer.
