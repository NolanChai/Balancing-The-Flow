arm strapped to my thigh, then stepped into the main hallway beyond the locked cell door.

The shouts grew louder as I approached the common area and its half-dozen doors that opened off it. Someone was clearly having a blast. Who knew how much time passed? Inmates could do all kinds of things in these walls, but getting from one end to another didn't happen by walking on air like someone was doing now. The footsteps grew louder as I approached the farthest door.

I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a key card that would let me get through the electronic lock. My heart pounded faster as I slipped it in to unlock the door. When I pushed it open, my body froze for a moment. What I saw left me stunned. The person who burst from the cell was not a prisoner. It was...a woman.

I'm Lana Harwood, and this is just one day of my life that made me realize how dangerous prison really can be. ​

A tumultuous jumble of roaring and whooping echoed down the metal corridor. The intensity of the sound made me pause. Seems like more prisoners got out than I thought. I flipped the safety on the sidearm strapped to my thigh, then stepped into the main hallway beyond the locked cell door.

I'm Lana Harwood, and this is just one day of my life that made me realize how dangerous prison really can be. ​

"What are you doing here?!" I demanded in shock.

The woman froze with her hand raised to hit me. "I've been locked up for months! The guards treat us like animals and won't give us any real food or clothing. We're starving and freezing to death in here," she replied, taking a deep breath. "We were trying to escape when I got out."

My mind raced as I processed what she said. "What's your name?"

"Jessica," she answered, lowering her hand.

I looked at the woman in front of me closely and saw that she was only a few years younger than me. Her long brown hair was tied back in a ponytail, and she had piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into my soul. She wasn't wearing any makeup but her skin was still smooth and unblemished. The orange prison jumpsuit she wore looked like it belonged in some B-movie.

"How did you get out of your cell?" I asked, still in disbelief.

"We found a way to pick the lock," Jessica replied, motioning for me to follow her down the hallway. As we walked, she explained that they had been forced to sleep on the cold floor and had barely enough food to eat. ​

When we reached the end of the corridor, Jessica stopped in front of a door and swung it open. The room inside was empty except for a small table and two chairs. She motioned for me to sit down as she poured out her story.

"We were sent here from another prison because we're members of the Bloods gang," Jessica said, taking a seat across from me. "But once we arrived, the guards treated us worse than they did the other inmates. They took everything we had and gave us these ridiculous orange jumpsuits to wear. The only thing we were allowed was a thin layer of cloth for clothing."

Jessica went on to say that the guards would often forget to feed them, so they had resorted to stealing food from the other prisoners or hiding it in their cells. "We're not animals; we're people who made mistakes and need to be rehabilitated," Jessica said with tears in her eyes. ​

I sat listening to Jessica's story, trying to comprehend what she was telling me. I had never heard anything like it before. Here I was, a prison guard, responsible for the safety of those inmates, but I had no idea how bad things were inside these walls. 

"I understand why you tried to escape," I said, my voice low. "But that's not the solution. There are better ways to make your voice heard."

Jessica nodded and wiped away a tear. "I know," she replied, taking a deep breath. ​

"What do you want me to do?" I asked.

"I don't know if you can help us, but we need someone who cares about what happens to us in here," Jessica said. "We're human beings, not animals. We deserve better treatment than this."

As she spoke, I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt for my part in the system. Here I was, responsible for their safety and well-being, yet I had no idea how bad things were. It was clear that something needed to change. 

"I'll do what I can," I promised Jessica. "But you need to be careful. The guards will come after you if they know you tried to escape."

Jessica nodded, her expression grave. "I understand," she said. "But this is bigger than just us. It's about all the prisoners who are suffering in here." 

As I watched Jessica walk back down the hallway, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets these walls held. What was happening to the people trapped inside? ​

"I'm Lana Harwood, and this is just one day of my life that made me realize how dangerous prison really can be."
