be fun; it always was when she was around...

She came through the door dressed in a pink nightgown, looking like the kind of woman who got all her beauty sleep, which she did—she was always tired. It wasn't that I didn't like her: she was very sweet and pretty, with blue eyes and dark hair, but there was something about her face that seemed too perfect for reality, almost artificial. She had an easy smile and a nice laugh, but not one I wanted to hear all night long.

"What would you like?" she said, sitting down on the sofa beside me. "Some tea? A brandy? A cup of hot chocolate?"

I just stared at her. She smiled again. "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone what we do here tonight." She patted my knee reassuringly. "It's our little secret."

"You know," I said, "you have a very nice smile and laugh—but you also have the most boring face in the world."

She smiled at that, but she didn't disagree with me. She sighed and looked around my living room. "Well, what do you want to talk about?"

"You know," I said, leaning back in my chair. "Anything."

"Let's start with the weather."

I rolled my eyes. "Fine. How about the weather? How is it where you are right now?"

She looked at me with her big blue eyes and tilted her head to one side. "It's sunny where I am right now," she said, then turned to me and added, "You know, there is a song that goes, 'I wish I were in England / In the month of May...'"

"Is that so?"

She nodded. "Yes."

I looked out the window. It was raining here. Hard. Outside it seemed like the end of the world was coming closer every day, and inside my apartment it felt like the end of civilization was right around the corner. I took a mint from my bag and crunched it up between my teeth.

"Do you want to hear a joke?" she said.

I just stared at her. She looked offended, but then she smiled again. "Okay," she said, "okay...here's one: what do you call a priest who doesn't like children? A pedophile."

I laughed out loud, and she looked relieved. Then she told another joke. It was terrible—it took forever to get to the punch line, which made it no funnier than the first.

"So," I said, "what do you want to talk about?"

She smiled at me again. "How about the fact that we are going to die one day?" She looked at me seriously and waited for my response.

I just stared back at her, trying to figure out what she was thinking. Was this a joke? I wasn't sure anymore; I was beginning to get a headache.

"Okay," I said finally, "let's talk about that."

She looked pleased. "Okay," she said, "so...how do you think we are going to die?"

I shrugged my shoulders and took another mint. "I don't know," I said.

"Do you have a favorite way of dying?" She asked this all innocently, as if it were a harmless game.

"Yes," I said finally. "Yes, I do."

She looked at me intently and waited for my answer. And so I told her my favorite way to die—and even though she'd never done it before, she would know the feeling of what it was like to die if she were to choose to commit suicide. As a priest, he had been an instrumental part of many deaths that happened throughout his life and so he knew how it felt.

"What is your favorite way to die?" I asked her.

She hesitated for a moment, thinking over what the answer would be. "I don't know," she said finally.

I smiled at her. It was good to see that we were on the same page here; it made me happy because when it came down to it, I couldn't think of anything worse than being stuck in a room with this woman for all eternity—but if she could be there, too...

"What did you think of my joke?" She asked.

I looked at her and shook my head. "You know," I said, "you're not as bad as the priest who told me that one."

She smiled again. We laughed together. The priest had come to visit me often before, but never with this woman beside him. And now it seemed like she was going to make an appearance at a lot more of them if I were to continue in this profession—and even though he always talked about the same things and made the same jokes every time, having her here tonight was different...

I looked up at him and smiled. "Do you want another drink?" I asked. It seemed like we'd be doing a lot more of these confessions from now on.
