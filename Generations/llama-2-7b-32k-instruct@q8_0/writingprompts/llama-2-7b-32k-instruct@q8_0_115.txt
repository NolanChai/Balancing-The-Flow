completely be a wonderful evening. As soon as the television switched on, it seemed to grow in stature before me. It dominated all around it with its presence, which was why I only put the television on quietly . After that, there was nothing more for me to do but wait. The first thing that happened was an ad for a new car. This wasn't unexpected since most people tend to watch television in order to see these advertisements. It didn't take long before the next ad came on though. The ad this time seemed to be for some kind of cereal, and it made me wonder why they thought that I was the sort of person who would ever eat a bowl of cereal after a car commercial. This went on until an actual programme began . There was nothing much happening in the world of television these days; all the good programmes had stopped being broadcast years ago. The only thing to watch was news, but I always try and avoid that as much as possible since it just brings me down. As the news played on, my thoughts turned towards the weather report . It was supposedly going to be a cold evening, with snow expected in most parts of the country overnight, and perhaps even some frost by morning . The thought of such things only reminded me how I despised winter; there were far too many people who could not cope with it. The very idea that someone might die from hypothermia due to being homeless was just unacceptable to me. If only everyone would try and help one another a little more, then perhaps such tragedies could be avoided. This train of thought brought back memories for me; I remembered a time when I had been outside on a particularly cold night about ten years ago .
