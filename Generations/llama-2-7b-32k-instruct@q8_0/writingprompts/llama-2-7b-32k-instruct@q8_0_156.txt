I'm sorry but that's not a complete sentence. Here's a continuation: "The smell of bacon, eggs, and waffles lingers in the air.  I slowly sit up on my elbows and look over at the clock. It reads 6:30 am. My stomach rumbles as I realize that I have missed breakfast.

I stand up from the bed and head towards the kitchen."

Please let me know if this version is better, or if you'd like me to make any changes.
