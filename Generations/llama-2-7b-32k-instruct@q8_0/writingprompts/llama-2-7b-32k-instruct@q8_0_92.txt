ids know about this new thing in my life (I was 24 at the time), so I posted on our group chat wall: "Hey fam! I want you all to pray for a friend of mine who's going through some really hard stuff right now." My friends responded with lots of encouraging words and prayers. That evening, I went over to the youth director's house in time to get dinner and spend the night before camp started at 8am the next morning. He asked if I wanted to share about my friend's struggles that night around the table--so I did. I didn't go into much detail because it was a family dinner, but I said something like: "My friend is having some really hard things right now and I am asking for all of you to pray for her." At this point, our youth director pulled me aside and asked if he could tell me about an experience he had at work that morning. He started talking, then stopped abruptly, looked at the clock and said: "I'll just get straight to it--this is weird but I hope you don't think I'm crazy." At this point, my youth director told me how his coworker had come in with a copy of *Arabian Amulets* that morning. He'd been trying to find the right words for what he wanted to say, and was flipping through the book looking for inspiration--the page he stopped on contained a prayer in Arabic for a friend in need. "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I prayed that exact same thing over my friend today!" My youth director told me more about his coworker's personal situation and how this man had come to him looking for words of encouragement, etc. It was clearly divine intervention; we all agreed that God had sent the right word at exactly the right time in order to encourage us to pray for my friend. My youth director pulled a copy of *Arabian Amulets* out of his office and handed it to me, saying "Here--this is for you." That was the first time I ever read Arabic (aside from some Quran memorization), let alone saw this type of book. It was amazing! A few days later, my friend and I met up at a Starbucks and we prayed together over lunch. I had this book with me so that she could see what it looked like. As she prayed in Arabic over us, I started to cry--this felt so beautifully intimate and vulnerable for her to share in a public place, and I was deeply moved by how close God must have been to us when He put this prayer book into my youth director's hand that morning. A few weeks after that encounter at camp, my friend messaged me and said: "I got the call today--it happened!" She went on to share about a conversation she had with her cousin who was struggling in their hometown (she'd been away for school). After sharing some of her struggles over the phone, they prayed together using the prayer from *Arabian Amulets* and it healed some wounds. They were so close that my friend even asked if she could come home with her cousin to visit their mom. We've since gone out for lunch again and used more Arabic prayers in our conversation. I don't think the words we spoke had anything to do with why it happened--it was simply divine intervention! In addition, that prayer from *Arabian Amulets* has continued to be a source of strength for my friend and me as we've kept up with each other over the last few months. I'm still blown away at how God orchestrates things like this in our lives--it is truly incredible.

I was introduced to Arabian Amulets through my father who purchased a copy of the book from Amazon while I lived abroad in Egypt during university. One evening, over dinner, he asked if I had any questions about my Muslim friends that I would like for him to ask around town for answers too--he's a professor at the American University and has lots of connections there. It was an exciting idea! He asked one of his colleagues in particular who happens to be a Christian convert from Islam: a friend he had grown up with, someone whose family were close friends of my father's in Egypt. The two of them got together to discuss the book and its significance in the Muslim community in Egypt; I was later invited to meet with this friend for coffee as well--it was an incredible experience! This is all when I was 21, just a year after arriving in Cairo. He shared how much he struggled with his faith while growing up in Egypt because of its Muslim majority and lack of Christian presence--and that even though the book wasn't explicitly Christian, it was very meaningful to him and had inspired him in his own journey as a believer. He also told me that one of my father's friends bought one for his wife who was sick. As she used it with faith, her health improved significantly, and word got out around the neighborhood. In fact, when the copyright renewal came up (it had been in print since the 1970s), many women bought copies as a gift to their mothers and grandmothers who were sick or struggling. It was then that my father's friend asked my father if he would like a copy too--and now, we have one at home! We have kept up with this man through the years via social media and he has continued to share how the prayers in the book are so meaningful for his faith journey. I was also able to visit him a few months ago while I was on vacation in Cairo; we had coffee together and chatted about the book, and it was wonderful to hear directly from someone who's experienced all of this first-hand!

*Arabian Amulets* is still widely used by Muslims in Egypt as a source of spiritual guidance and support. When I lived in Cairo, most women knew about the book because it had been passed down generationally to their mothers and grandmothers who would use them in times of need or just for daily readings/reflection. It was also a gift given between friends: my Muslim friends would often give each other copies when they'd go on trips together. I have many friends who still live in Cairo, including some women who are now in their late 80s and early 90s, and the book is part of their daily routines. Even though the book doesn't have a Christian message, its prayers have inspired my Muslim friends to look deeper into faith, to look more closely at how God works through us every day. It's been such a privilege for me to observe this first-hand and learn from them--these women are truly wise and beautiful people who I am so grateful to know. They often would ask me if I had the book in English translation, too, but unfortunately that was not available at the time (it has since come out!). It's been amazing to see how God is working through this book even though it's a non-Christian resource; there are so many stories of divine intervention and healing that I can attest to. In addition, some people from my church community in the U.S. have also purchased copies after hearing about them (again, no Christian connection!). It has been such a blessing for me to share this experience with others who may not know Arabic; it's even inspired me to take an online course and learn more of the language so I can be more connected to the Muslim community in Cairo.

Arabian Amulets was written by Hanna Mina, a famous Egyptian author. He wrote several books but is most known for writing this one as well as another popular book called The Prophet's Camel (which has now been translated into English). Arabian Amulets has been around since the 1970s and has had multiple editions, although it appears that the most recent ones were published in the early 2000s. I have never read any of Hanna Mina's other books but would love to check them out someday!

I don't have a copy of Arabian Amulets myself; however, my family has purchased three copies over the last several years: one for our home, one for the church library (which is now available online), and another for my dad to keep at work. I would highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already! It's a small book with lots of powerful prayers; it's worth having in your personal prayer library.

Thank you so much for considering this request--I pray that God continues to use *Arabian Amulets* to inspire people around the world. I know that He has already done great things through the book, and will continue to do even more!

It was a pleasure sharing my story with you all; thank you so much for reading. God bless you, and may He bring you peace!

Love,   Nora
