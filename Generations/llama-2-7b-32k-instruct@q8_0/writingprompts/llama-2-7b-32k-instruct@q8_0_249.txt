an Ouya!

"What's the hype?" I asked.

"It's not a game console," a voice replied. "It's a platform."

"For what?"

"Games!" the voice answered. "Indie games."

Another voice chimed in: "We can publish our own games, and we won't have to wait months for Sony or Microsoft to approve them! Plus, it'll run Android apps too - like Instagram! You know how cool that is?"

"I guess so," I responded.

And with that, the room erupted in chatter: "Did you see Angry Birds Space? It has astronauts!" "Yeah, and there's a game called Robot Unicorn Attack 2! So awesome!"

"But can it run Candy Crush Saga?" asked someone else.

The room went silent for a moment. Then one guy in the back raised his hand: "I heard it has emulators - you know, for playing games from other consoles? Like Nintendo and Sega?"

My jaw dropped. I had no idea there was so much buzz about this thing called Ouya. But even more surprising than that...

"Can we actually build our own games on it?" asked someone else. "Not just play them."

I shook my head in disbelief: "You heard right! You can create your own games with a programming language called Unity, and export them to Ouya!"

The room erupted again, this time with applause and cheers of excitement. It was clear that these guys were ready for their very own gaming revolution - one that didn't involve giant corporations or bloated platforms.

"So... what are you waiting for?" asked the guy who brought Ouya. "Let's get started!"

I looked around at all the faces eagerly waiting to get their hands on this thing, and I knew we were in for something special. The Ouya revolution was about to begin, and these guys - with their passion and creativity - were ready to lead the way.

As they flocked towards me, ready to learn more, I couldn't help but feel proud of what we had all built: a platform that would empower indie game developers and put power back in the hands of gamers everywhere. It was truly a revolutionary moment, one that would change the face of gaming forever.

And as they gathered around me, eager to learn how to make their own games, I knew we were on the brink of something big. The Ouya revolution was about to begin, and these guys - with their passion and creativity - were ready to lead the way.
