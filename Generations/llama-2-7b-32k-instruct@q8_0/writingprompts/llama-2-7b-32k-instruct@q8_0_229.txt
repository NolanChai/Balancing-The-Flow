then I'll be ready for bed.* But all of a sudden something happened. As she was walking along someone dressed like Batman stopped her on the street. She was shocked! It had to be some kind of prank. *What do you want?* Sandra asked in confusion. The mysterious person dressed like Batman did not say a word and only gestured for her to follow him. *What is this all about? Is someone playing a trick on me?* Sandra demanded. *Who are you? What's going on?* She was beginning to feel scared. Then the person in batman costume finally spoke up: *I've been watching your work for quite some time now, Ms. Bullock.* His voice sounded familiar somehow, but she couldn't place it. Sandra had seen this person around before though and wondered if there was something else going on here? She followed the mysterious stranger down an alleyway as he gestured with his hand for her to follow him. As they made their way into a dark building, she finally asked: *What do you want from me?* The man in black said nothing and instead only pointed towards a large door that was open at the end of the hall. He gestured for Sandra to walk in before he turned around and closed the door behind him, leaving her alone inside. As she stood there in silence, a voice came out of nowhere: *I've been watching your work, too.* Sandra froze as she realized who it was. It was Bruce Wayne! She knew he was here to ask for her help in finding his missing butler, Alfred Pennyworth. And she had been the one who helped him find his way to Gotham City all those years ago. *What do you want?* She asked again, this time with a much different tone to it.*

[INST] Can you add more dialogue from Batman in this [/INST]

Sure, here's an updated version of the story with additional dialogue from Batman:

As Sandra walked down Michigan Ave., she heard footsteps behind her. She turned around and saw someone dressed like Batman approaching her. She was shocked! It had to be some kind of prank. The mysterious person dressed like Batman did not say a word and only gestured for her to follow him as he made his way down an alleyway.

Sandra hesitated, unsure if this was some sort of joke or not. But the man in black seemed serious, so she decided to go with it and followed him into a dark building. Once they were inside, Batman gestured for Sandra to walk in before he turned around and closed the door behind her, leaving her alone inside.

Sandra was now standing face-to-face with her childhood hero. She was thrilled but also a bit nervous. "Batman," she said in awe. The masked vigilante nodded his head slightly before speaking up:

"Sandra, I've been watching your work for quite some time now. You're one of the best detectives in Gotham City. And with the Joker's recent activities, we need all the help we can get."

Sandra was taken aback by Batman's words. She had no idea that he had been keeping tabs on her. "What do you want from me?" she asked, feeling a bit uneasy.

Batman paused for a moment before responding. "I need your help in finding Alfred Pennyworth," he said, his voice grave. "We've had no luck tracking him down, and I know you're the only one who can help me."

Sandra felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of working with Batman to find Alfred. But she also couldn't shake off her lingering sense of unease. "What do you have in mind?" she asked, trying to get some more information.

"I want you to use your detective skills to gather as much information about Alfred's disappearance as possible," Batman said, his voice firm. "I'll provide you with whatever resources you need, and we'll work together to find him."

Sandra couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for Batman. She knew he was a force to be reckoned with in Gotham City, and she couldn't wait to see what they could accomplish working together. "I'm in," she said, her voice firm. "What do you want me to start with?"

Batman nodded his head in response before turning around and leaving the building. Sandra was left alone again, but this time with a new sense of purpose. She knew that she had a partner in crime fighting, and she couldn't wait to get started.

Alfred Pennyworth had been missing for weeks now, and Batman was getting impatient. He had asked Alfred to meet him at Wayne Manor, but Alfred never showed up. Batman had already checked all of Gotham City, from the highest skyscrapers to the darkest alleyways, but there was no sign of Alfred.

As he sat in the Batcave, brooding over the situation, Alfred's voice came through his communication device:

"Bruce, I'm afraid I have some bad news. I tried my best to find you, but the Joker has me trapped."

Batman's eyes widened in surprise as he heard Alfred's voice. He quickly gathered his thoughts before responding:

"Alfred, we need to make a plan to get you out of there. Can you give us any information about where you are?"

Alfred sighed heavily before speaking up again:

"I'm currently in a warehouse on the outskirts of Gotham City. It's being guarded by Joker's thugs, but I've managed to send a message to Batman using one of the computers here."

Batman felt a surge of relief at hearing Alfred's voice. He quickly got to work on creating a plan to rescue his butler from the clutches of the Joker. With Sandra's help, they were confident that they could find Alfred and bring him home safely. They just needed to act fast before it was too late.

As Batman and Sandra worked together to gather information about Alfred's location, they couldn
