Sandra would never spend a day shopping on Michigan Avenue; that's just not something she would do. She's more of a practical person who prefers to save her money for important things, like her next vacation or investing in her career. So, even though it may seem like a clich√©, Sandra wouldn't be spending her day shopping on one of the most famous streets in Chicago.
