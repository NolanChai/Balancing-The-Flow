 The former Archbishop of Scotland, Lord Hope, is under fire after it was revealed that he allowed a convicted paedophile priest to escape punishment.

According to a report by the Court of Session, Lord Hope failed to disclose crucial details to the court during the trial of the abusive priest, Father Thomas Hamilton.

It has been claimed that Lord Hope had knowledge of the extent of Hamilton's crimes, but chose not to reveal it to the court or the police. The report also suggests that he was aware of Hamilton's movements after his conviction and failed to alert anyone to the risk he posed.

Hamilton went on to carry out a horrific spree in which he murdered 16 people before being shot dead by police.

The report, which was written by Lord Carloway, President of the Court of Session, is highly critical of Lord Hope's handling of the case. He concludes that Lord Hope should have disclosed more information about Hamilton's past and his movements after conviction.

"Lord Hope failed to appreciate the seriousness of the case," said Lord Carloway. "He failed to recognise the risk posed by Father Hamilton."

The report has sparked a controversy over the role of the Church in cases involving child abuse. It raises questions about whether church leaders should have more power to protect children from abusers.

There are calls for an independent review into the handling of Hamilton's case and other instances where the Church has been accused of covering up abuse.

The Scottish Government is yet to respond to the report, but it is expected to make a statement soon.
