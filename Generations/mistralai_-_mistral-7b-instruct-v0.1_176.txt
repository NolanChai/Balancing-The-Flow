 Yes, that's correct. Some J.Crew customers have expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of shoes they have been receiving from the company in recent years. They claim that J.Crew has cut corners in production and materials to reduce costs, resulting in shoes that are less durable and don't hold up as well as they used to.
At the same time, customers also complain that the prices for these shoes have remained high or have even increased, despite the perceived decline in quality. This has led some to question the value of their purchases from J.Crew and consider looking elsewhere for their shoe needs.
