By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Kick back, relax and put those feet up because September is the least stressful month of the year. That is the word from researchers who warn Brits to make the most of life now as their new study reveals that the summer holidays are a time when we feel less stressed than at any other point in the year.

The scientists found that after an intense few months at work, people are more likely to take it easy during September and have fewer problems with stress than they do at any other time of the year. And this is because we have just had a break from our busy routines, and are feeling refreshed and rejuvenated from the sunshine and the holiday.

In fact, according to researchers from the University of Southampton, September is the least stressful month for Brits â€“ with January being the most stressful. The scientists looked at the diary entries of 250 people and found that September was when they felt the least stressed because it was after their summer holidays.

But January was a much more stressful time of year, particularly due to returning back to work after the festive period. The researchers found that the end of the year is one of the most stressful times for people, with the pressure of Christmas, New Year and going back to work all causing tension.
