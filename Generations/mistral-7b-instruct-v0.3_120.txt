 I'm sorry to hear about Kevin Mirallas' injury. Eight weeks is a significant period, and Everton will certainly miss his contributions during that time. Hopefully, he can recover quickly and return to form once he's back on the field. In the meantime, it might be an opportunity for other players to step up and show their potential. Best wishes to Mirallas for a speedy recovery!
