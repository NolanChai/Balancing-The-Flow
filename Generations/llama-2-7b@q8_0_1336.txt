1.  Nasa has launched a new probe into our solar system to solve a mystery which was discovered by another spacecraft sent out there five years ago.
2.  A spacecraft travelling through the mysterious and invisible boundary of our Solar System has made a startling discovery that could change everything scientists thought they knew about how it works.
3.  Space exploration has taken one of its biggest steps ever after Nasa sent an unmanned probe into the depths of our solar system.
4.  In this lesson, we will learn more about what the mysterious object is that spacecraft are travelling through in our solar system and how it is helping scientists to solve a mystery.
5.  There's something out there waiting for us - beyond Pluto and Neptune, beyond the outer planets, beyond the Oort cloud of comets, beyond even the heliopause. The "something" could be Planet X, but we don't know what it is or exactly where it's located.
6.  Our solar system has a new inhabitant – and that's one of two things scientists have discovered after sending a probe to investigate a mysterious space boundary.
7.  Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe into space on August 12th, from Cape Canaveral in Florida, and it is now heading for our Sun on its mission to explore what lies beyond our solar system’s edge.
8.  The Parker Solar Probe will be sent out in a journey that takes over seven years through the mysterious boundary of our solar system called 'the heliopause', which is about two thirds the way to the nearest star, four lightyears away.
