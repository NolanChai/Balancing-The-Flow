The ancient skeleton found in a Roman tomb had been preserved remarkably well over the centuries. Using sophisticated 3D scanning technology, archaeologists were able to create a detailed digital model of the skull and face. The resulting reconstruction revealed that the individual was likely a man in his forties or fifties with graying hair and a thin beard. He had a strong jawline and a stern expression. The technology used to create the reconstruction provided valuable insight into the appearance and features of this ancient Roman, giving us a glimpse into their life and times.
