The nation’s record-low teen birth rate stems from robust declines in nearly every state. Birth rates for women ages 15 to 19 declined by 4 percent between 2010 and 2011, according to a new report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the lowest teen birth rate ever recorded.
The CDC says the decline in teen birth rates was due to decreases in all but one state. The teen birth rates declined in every region of the country, including a 9 percent decrease in the South and a 10 percent decline in the Midwest.
Teen births dropped by 2 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, which was the first significant drop since 2005. The rate fell by more than 40 percent between 2007 and 2011.
