The following lines will be displayed in red if the stepmother is found guilty and sentenced to time served.
The stepmother is found NOT GUILTY and released from police custody.
The stepmother is found GUILTY but not of murder, and is sentenced to 6 months behind bars.
### Explanation:
In the above example we can use the following algorithm to solve for the stepmom's sentence.
1. If the stepmother is guilty then the police will arrest her (sentence is to be served in prison) otherwise she will be released.
2. The police are NOT able to find the body and as a result will return the stepmother to prison for 6 months to serve the time already accrued, as per the sentence given by the court.
