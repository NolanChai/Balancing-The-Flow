National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators said Tuesday that a number of factors contributed to the crash of a UPS cargo plane in Birmingham, Alabama, last year, but they blamed the pilots for making mistakes that caused the crash. The NTSB concluded that both pilots failed to properly monitor their altitude and did not use an automated system that could have prevented them from accidentally flying into mountain terrain.

The Boeing 747 cargo plane crashed on Aug. 14, 2013, killing both crew members and injuring two people on the ground. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error, according to the NTSB report released Tuesday. It said that a lack of proper training for the pilots contributed to the crash, along with UPS's failure to properly enforce procedures and provide adequate supervision.

The investigators also found that the company had not taken appropriate steps to ensure that its employees were properly trained and certified. They also criticized UPS for failing to provide adequate supervision of its pilots, which they said could have prevented the accident. The NTSB recommended that UPS improve its training and supervision programs for its pilots to prevent similar accidents in the future.
