The Neo-Nazi serial killer who targeted blacks in a series of racially motivated shootings is scheduled to be executed Thursday, and the federal government is seeking a last-minute stay.
Curtis Allen, 49, was convicted by a jury in the summer for three murders linked to the Atomwaffen Division, an international neo-Nazi group that recruits white supremacist teens and young adults through online social networks.
Allen is scheduled to die on Thursday at 4:15 p.m. MST in a state execution chamber near midnight. The stay request will be filed by the Justice Department's civil rights division, which said it was considering whether Allen could face the death penalty because of his racist motive, according to court documents.
The federal government is also seeking information on whether Allen had any role in an alleged plot to kill police officers, a U.S. official familiar with the request told The Associated Press late Tuesday on condition of anonymity because it was not authorized to speak publicly about the case.
The Justice Department could use that evidence if it decides to prosecute Allen for a federal hate crime, but so far there's no indication that will happen.
"We are considering all possible legal remedies," said spokeswoman Gina Talamona in an email Wednesday morning. "This is an evolving matter."
The Justice Department has never prosecuted a federal hate crime before, but the issue of white supremacy and violence is likely to be on the front burner when President Donald Trump takes office. He has said there are good people among the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups that rallied in Charlottesville, Va., last month against plans to remove a Confederate statue.
Allen's lawyers have argued that he was manipulated by two white supremacist gang members who used him as a pawn in an elaborate scheme involving weapons-training camps and explosives stolen from a military base.
The evidence showed Allen was "an idiot" who made up stories to impress his fellow racists, said defense attorney Scott Robinson on Tuesday night.
"There is absolutely no doubt that the government will use this case as a means of putting out propaganda against white supremacist organizations in general and Atomwaffen Division in particular," he said. "I believe it's political terrorism."
Allen was convicted of killing Jonathan D. Pitts, 32; Michael R. Cummings, 29; and Ronald T. McLelland, 69, a state district judge whose family Allen blamed for sentencing him to prison in 2010 for trying to steal firearms from a gun shop.
Allen was convicted with fellow white supremacists Shawn Michael Adam Osborne and Peter Edward Stautberg. The trio were arrested after the FBI linked them to Pitts' killing at his home near Wichita in July 2013. Prosecutors said Allen had plotted to kill police officers, but investigators didn't find any evidence that he actually did so.
Osborne and Stautberg are serving life sentences. The Justice Department has not decided whether they will ask for a federal death sentence for either of them, Talamona said.
The FBI found explosives stolen from the Fort Riley Army post near Junction City in Kansas were used to kill Cummings at his home and McLelland's home. The bureau said Allen's cellphone was also used as a trigger device in Pitts' killing.
Allen grew up on farms in the Midwest and South, served time for burglary and forgery, and had been a member of various white supremacist groups before joining Atomwaffen Division, which means "atomic weapons" in German.
Prosecutors said he became friends with Stautberg online when they were both serving sentences at the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. The pair began planning a bank robbery and an attack on police officers, court documents showed. Osborne was recruited into their plans after being released from prison, according to the Justice Department.
Pitts was targeted because he was black and McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were killed as Allen sought revenge against prosecutors who had charged him with crimes in 2010.
McLelland had sentenced Allen to up to 39 years on weapons charges that included attempted burglary and other counts for trying to steal guns from a gun store he owned, the FBI said.
A jury found Osborne guilty of murdering Pitts in July 2013 after prosecutors argued they shot him three times with an AK-47 assault rifle during a botched robbery at his home. Stautberg was convicted of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder in the killings of McLelland and his wife, Cynthia.
In 2016, a judge sentenced Osborne to life plus 80 years and Stautberg received two concurrent sentences of life without parole for killing Cummings.
