The parents of baby Sienna, who tragically passed away while in the care of a childcare worker, have called for better regulation of the childcare industry. They have urged the government to introduce written guidelines on safe sleeping practices for babies under their supervision. This would provide much-needed clarity and consistency in how childcare workers approach ensuring that babies are kept safe and secure during sleep.

Siennaâ€™s parents believe that better regulations and standards within the industry could help prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. They want to see clearer guidelines on safe sleeping practices for babies, such as the importance of providing a comfortable and safe space for them to rest, along with regular checks throughout their sleep. They also hope these guidelines will encourage childcare workers to take extra care when dealing with young children.
