 year-old daughter Amina Mohamud in their Alexandria, Virginia home in June 2011. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before reaching a verdict.

According to evidence presented during the trial, Ali-Mohamed Mohamud had a history of domestic violence and was physically abusive towards his wife and children. On the day of Amina's death, he became angry with her when she accidentally broke a plate while doing dishes. He then proceeded to beat her with a belt, causing severe injuries that ultimately led to her death.

Mohamud's defense attorney argued that the beating was an accident and that Mohamud did not intend to kill his daughter. However, the prosecution presented evidence that Mohamud had a history of abusive behavior and had previously threatened to kill Amina. They also argued that Mohamud's actions were deliberate and intentional.

The jury ultimately found Mohamod guilty of second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced on December 13, 2012.
