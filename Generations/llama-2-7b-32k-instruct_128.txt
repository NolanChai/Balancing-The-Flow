Lampard left Stamford Bridge for Manchester City at the end of last term and Terry has admitted he felt lost in training when the Blues began preparations for their upcoming campaign.

Terry said: "We are lucky to have a lot of players who have come from the youth team through. They are the ones that can fill those gaps we might miss, like Frank. They've got to get used to being senior players. It is different playing for your country than it is at club level but they need to step up.

"For me as a player I don't have a problem with any player wearing that number eight shirt or the number four shirt. Whoever wears those jerseys needs to perform and whoever wants to be a leader needs to stand up."

Terry also revealed he is not impressed by seeing Lampard in City blue, saying: "I've never seen him in sky blue but when you do see someone you know like Frank it does feel strange. I knew he had signed for City before the World Cup and that's why I didn't go to England games during the summer."

Terry also admitted Chelsea will have to find a way to replace their iconic skipper, who was named in the Three Lions squad for next month's European Championships.

The 32 - year - old added: "We are lucky enough that we can bring in players. That is what we do as a club and I think it shows we are ambitious. It's not always easy to replace a Frank Lampard or a John Terry, there are only one of those."

Lampard departed the Blues after 13 successful years at Stamford Bridge in which he made 429 appearances and scored 147 goals for Chelsea.

Meanwhile, Terry is hoping to stay fit for the start of next term but admits he has been told to manage his body carefully after struggling with a back injury last season.

The former England captain said: "I've had the odd back problems throughout my career and it's something I have learned to deal with over time. If you are having back problems, as a player, obviously you need to be careful how much you do in training or running."

Chelsea begin their 2016-17 Premier League campaign at home against Swansea on August 13 and Terry believes they will have the upper hand over new manager Antonio Conte, who arrived from Juventus last month.

The defender said: "We are going to be in a better position than we were when we finished with Jose (Mourinho). We know the type of coach he is, how he wants things and how he likes to work. I think it will help us to have that extra edge."

Terry has also stressed they must start strong if they are to compete for honours next season. He said: "We want to be challenging for trophies and hopefully we can do something special again this year. If we start well, we will give ourselves a chance of that happening."

Terry has also revealed the club is working hard on improving their stadium following the completion of a new state-of - the art training complex in Cobham, Surrey. He said: "We're looking to improve our ground for the fans and obviously we need to keep up with the Premier League when it comes to facilities."

Terry also reiterated Conte will be given time if he fails to win a trophy this season after being handed an initial three - year deal. He said: "The club's ambition is clear, as soon as I spoke to the chairman (Roman Abramovich) and the chief executive (Peter Kenyon), they made that clear. You know we are going to be in a transitional period for this season and maybe next."

Terry added: "We want him to come out with silverware at the end of his career here. I think it's important he gets time, to get things right. We need to keep that in mind and not put too much pressure on him because he is going to have a big job ahead."
