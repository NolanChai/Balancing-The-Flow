 The Smiths family from Brisbane, Australia, have been setting world records with their festive displays for over a decade. This year, they broke the previous record of 501,216 lights they set in 2019, by adding an additional 248,784 lights, bringing the total to 750,000 lights.

Their latest achievement has been certified by Guinness World Records, making them the world record holders for the most Christmas lights on a residential property. The Smith family has also set another world record with their previous display, which featured 304,968 lights.

Mrs. Smith, who is known for her love of Christmas and decorating, said in an interview that they put up the lights every year as a family tradition, and it takes them around six weeks to complete. She also added that they enjoy sharing their Christmas spirit with others by inviting friends and neighbors over to see the display.

The Smiths' festive home has become a popular tourist attraction in Brisbane, with many visitors coming from all over Australia to witness the spectacular sight. The family hopes that their world records will inspire others to get creative with their Christmas decorations and make their own holiday traditions unique and memorable.
