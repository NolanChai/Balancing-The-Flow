<p>I have heard that McDonald's is going to give free coffee to all its customers. It seems like a very nice gesture from the fast food chain but I am not so sure if it will work out for them in the long run.</p> <p><strong>First of all</strong>, this offer is only available during breakfast time which means that most people won't get a chance to take advantage of it. That doesn't mean they won't try though, because they are sure going to be lined up at their local McDonald's before 6:00 AM on January 4th just hoping for some free java!</p> <p><strong>Secondly</strong>, there are no restrictions placed on how much coffee you can get or when you have to drink it by. So what if you don't like coffee? What if you want a latte instead of a brew? How about cappuccino, espresso...? The list goes on and on.</p> <p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, McDonalds has made no mention that this offer is valid for all customers who purchase food from them during breakfast hours. Does that mean people who are just stopping in to grab a quick bite before work will get free coffee with their meal? Or does it mean that only those who spend at least $25 on food items will receive free drinks? The answer isn't clear yet but I have a feeling it might not be as simple as just walking up and ordering whatever you want!</p> <p><strong>Lastly, there are some serious concerns being raised about the safety of drinking unfiltered water in such small amounts. </strong></p> <p><em>It has been reported that more than 100 people have died from a stomach virus linked to the use of tap water in New Jersey alone since 2008. This was due to bacteria being present on the surfaces where drinking fountains were located.</em></p> <p>The CDC states that <strong>drinking contaminated water can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes even death</strong>. McDonald's has no way of knowing whether or not any given restaurant serves tap water so they aren't able to say with certainty how many people will be affected by this offer.</p> <p><em>McDonald's should take more precautions than simply offering free coffee for everyone because it would appear that there is still no guarantee anyone won't get sick from drinking unfiltered water</em>. If you are looking for something safe to consume during the day, I recommend getting an energy drink instead!</p> <div style="clear:both"></div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/h47w1.gif" />
