I decided to build my own version of the Mini-Manes after I came across the original tutorial on Instructables.com. After doing a little research, I learned that there are many versions available for sale but the tutorials are few and far between. So when I was ready to start building it, I knew what materials would be needed and where I could find them at our local hardware stores or craft stores in order to complete my own version of the Mini-Manes. The tutorial itself is very easy and simple enough that even someone with little or no woodworking experience should not have any problem following along with me as I go step by step through this project.

### Materials:
The materials needed for building one's first mini mane are relatively inexpensive, but there are some specialty items such as dowels and a drill bit set that you may need to purchase online if they don’t have them available at your local hardware store or craft store.

### Tools:
The tools used for building one's first mini mane can be found at any home improvement retailer, including Sears, Home Depot, Lowe’s and Ace Hardware.
