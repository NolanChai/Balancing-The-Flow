Just da | By . Sadie Whitelocks . Fans of Talia Joy Castellano, who tragically lost her six-year battle with cancer last Tuesday, are campaigning for MAC cosmetics to launch a make-up line in her honor. Just days before she died at the age of 13, the youngster made an appearance on Good Morning America where she said: "I will forever be that girl who lost her hair," and "I'm going to die from cancer." But instead of letting her condition get her down, Talia used it to motivate others by launching a make-up line called 'Talia Joy', which was exclusively sold on her YouTube channel. Now fans are hoping that MAC cosmetics will honor the late teenager and follow in the footsteps of brands such as Rimmel and Benefit, who have created products in memory of the late Stephen Hawking and Amy Winehouse respectively. |
