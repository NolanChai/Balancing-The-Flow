Samuel Dymott giggled uncontrollably as he chased after his favourite toy, a bright red ball that bounced and rolled across the floor of his nursery. His blonde hair was sticking up in every direction, and his big brown eyes were full of wonder and excitement as he played. Despite his young age, Samuel was already showing signs of being a curious and adventurous child, always eager to explore and discover new things. As he chased after the ball, he stumbled and fell, but quickly picked himself up and continued on, undeterred by the minor setback. His parents watched from the sidelines, smiling and cheering him on as they marvelled at their little boy's energy and determination. They couldn't believe how fast he was growing and changing, and they knew that these early years would be some of the most special and memorable of their lives.
