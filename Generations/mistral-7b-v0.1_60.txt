The article I decided to review was titled “Stevan Jovetic lit up the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, giving an eye catching all round performance for Manchester City that merited his two goals in the 3-1 win against Tottenham” by Nick Harris for MailOnline. The reason I chose this article is because of my interest in soccer and it being a Manchester United fanatic I was interested to see how Stevan Jovetic played.

### Analysis:
The article I reviewed was very descriptive, but not overly long. It had three paragraphs totaling 102 words. The author used many sports related words, such as, “strike,” “score,” and “goal” to describe the soccer game that just took place. The language was written in a way that appealed to people interested in the sport of soccer, but it also could be understood by someone who is not into sports.

### Quote:
The quote I found interesting in the article was, “Jovetic’s first goal came after 58 minutes when he met an inswinging corner from Samir Nasri with a glancing header that flew past Lloris.” This quote caught my eye because it shows how Jovetic played during the game. It also shows the author’s knowledge of soccer and his ability to describe the game using descriptive language.

### Conclusion:
Overall, I found this article to be well written and easy to understand. The author did a good job describing the game and how Jovetic played during it. The quote I chose was interesting because it shows how Jovetic scored his goals and how he played in general. It also gives the readers more insight into the game that they might not have had before reading this article.
