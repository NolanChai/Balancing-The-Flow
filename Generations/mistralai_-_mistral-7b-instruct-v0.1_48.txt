 In a rare interview with the state-run newspaper Granma, Castro criticized Obama's recent demands on Cuba, including increased democracy and human rights on the island.

"The American people should be aware that they have a president who is very stupid," Castro said in the interview. "He does not understand that he cannot impose his ideas on other countries."

Castro also expressed disappointment that Obama has not yet visited Cuba, despite the two countries re-establishing diplomatic relations last year after more than 50 years of isolation.

"I think it's a shame," Castro said. "The American people deserve to see their president in a place like this."
