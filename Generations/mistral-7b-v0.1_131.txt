Samantha Faiers and Billie Faiers are two of the most popular stars on "The Only Way is Essex", a reality show about the lives of young people living in Essex, England. They were arrested in September 2012 for shoplifting from a Selfridges department store. The sisters sent a letter to Judge Peter Beaumont asking him to be lenient on them during their upcoming trial.
The letter said that they were sorry for what happened and that they would never do anything like this again. They also said that they were trying to pay back all of the money they had stolen, but that it was very difficult because they were not working at the time due to filming commitments.
