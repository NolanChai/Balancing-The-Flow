The incident was first reported at 3:29 pm on November 10, and was first seen as a “ferry crew member fell” into the water at approximately 3:54 pm. However, no passengers were lost or seriously injured. The UK coastguard was notified by the ferry company about the incident at 8:15 am today, but the coastguard has confirmed that the passenger “was picked up.”
The passenger in question reportedly left his cabin after being told by the staff to move to a different room. When he found another cabin, it was locked and there were no other vacant rooms available on board the ferry. He then went outside and jumped into the water before he was rescued by police and lifeguards at 4:15 pm that afternoon.

### My Solution:
- Additional information may be found in [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-60486527) BBC article (thanks to @GrahamWright for the link).

### Question:
- The question I asked myself was, how can we check if a number is between two other numbers?
