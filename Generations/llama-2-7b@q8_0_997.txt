- In my opinion, it is very unfair to say that there is nothing serious going on right now because of the situation in Ukraine. This war might not be directly related to our country but it definitely affects us as well. As we all know, Russia has been one of the most important countries for trade and politics. If they become unstable it can create problems for everyone including America. In addition, there is a huge risk of other countries getting involved in this conflict which can have major consequences on both sides.
- The U.S government is doing their best to prevent any further escalation but I donâ€™t think that they will be able to do anything about it until something major happens and even then we may not be able to do much because of other countries getting involved as well. In conclusion, I believe that America should take more action in order to stop this war from happening or at least make it less likely for it to happen by trying our best to stop other countries from getting involved
- What are your thoughts about this? I would love to hear your opinion! ðŸ™‚
