Snails are not only a popular French dish but also an increasingly common sight in the UK. Once thought of as a treat for haute cuisine, they are now being seen as a sustainable and environmentally friendly source of protein. With their high levels of calcium and iron, snails are gaining popularity for their health benefits. In addition to this, snails require very little space to grow and can be farmed in an environmentally conscious way. As a result, they are becoming increasingly popular in the UK as a sustainable and healthy option for protein.
