 That's indeed a spectacular display! The family in question is the Dower family from Perth, Western Australia. They broke their own Guinness World Record by setting up 506,165 lights on their home, surpassing the previous record of 337,498 lights they set in 2017. The display attracted thousands of visitors and raised funds for charity during the holiday season. It's truly amazing to see such festive enthusiasm!
