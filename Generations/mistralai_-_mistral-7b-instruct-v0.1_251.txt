 ing three men in London.

Johnny Toscano, aka “The Guvnor”, was taken into custody at a hotel in the capital this morning following an international manhunt for the 63-year-old gangster.

He has been accused of ordering the murders of two men on Thursday in south London and another in Essex on Friday, all of whom are thought to be part of rival drug cartels.

Police have been on high alert since the killings as they believe there may be more violence to come in the battle for control of the lucrative illegal drugs trade in the capital.

The Guvnor’s arrest was made after a tip-off from American authorities who had tracked him to London using mobile phone and internet records.

Toscano fled the US in 1987 after being implicated in the murder of his close friend, fellow gangster Henry Hill.

He is believed to have taken over the running of a major criminal gang in London, known as The Firm, following the death of its former boss, Gary Dickinson, last year.

The Guvnor was wanted by Scotland Yard for questioning over several murders, but he fled to Portugal and has been on the run ever since.

It is understood that he had a number of henchmen working for him in London, who carried out his orders.

“The Guvnor is one of Europe’s most feared gangsters,” said a source close to the investigation. “He is known for his ruthless tactics and will stop at nothing to get what he wants.”

In a statement, Scotland Yard said it was working closely with American law enforcement agencies in pursuit of Toscano.

“We will bring him to justice in this country or any other,” the statement read.

Toscano’s arrest is likely to lead to further arrests of his associates and members of rival drug cartels, as police continue their investigation into the London killings.
