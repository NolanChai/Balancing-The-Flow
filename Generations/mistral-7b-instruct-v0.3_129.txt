 The article you've provided is from the Daily Mail, published on June 12, 2013. The headline reads: "Family of fallen Navy SEAL sues over 'Fatal Vision' goggles that left him blind and led to his death in Afghanistan."

The article discusses a class-action lawsuit filed by the family of a Navy SEAL named Michael A. Day, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2011. The lawsuit alleges that Day was issued "Fatal Vision" goggles, which were designed to simulate the effects of alcohol, for training purposes but were not approved for use in combat.

According to the article, Day's family claims that he was blinded by the goggles during a nighttime training exercise and that this impairment contributed to his death during a subsequent mission where he was unable to see properly and was shot by the enemy. The lawsuit seeks damages from BAE Systems, which manufactured the goggles, as well as the Department of Defense and other parties involved in the procurement and distribution of the equipment.

The article also notes that the lawsuit is part of a larger trend of families of military personnel who have been killed or injured seeking accountability and compensation from defense contractors and the government. It mentions several similar lawsuits that have been filed over the years, including cases involving defective body armor and explosives.

The article does not specify the outcome of the lawsuit or whether it has been settled. However, it notes that BAE Systems has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the goggles were not intended for use in combat. The company also stated that it stands by its products and is committed to supporting the U.S. military.
