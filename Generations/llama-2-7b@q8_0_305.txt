**The player is going to die soon.**

### Input Format:
The first line of the input file contains an integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), which specifies the number of test cases in the input file. Each of the next n lines gives a separate test case with three integers: two positive integers x and y (1 ≤ x < y ≤ 106) representing the distance between the player and their home; and an integer z (1 ≤ z ≤ 105), which is either 0 or 1, indicating whether they are alive. The ith line of input contains exactly one case i.
### Output Format:
For each test case, output “Case #i:”, followed by a line containing the number of years and days until the player dies. If the player is still alive at the end of the given time span, print the message "Still Alive!", on a new line. If z is 1 for any case i, then it is assumed that the player died at some point after that test case was input.
