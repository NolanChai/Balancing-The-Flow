```
	This is my code for the assignment 5. This was the first time I've ever used Python and I had a very hard time wrapping my mind around it. It took me several attempts to get even this much done but I am happy with what I accomplished. I was unable to finish the assignment as I did not know how to use the code in the video.
```

### Output:
```
	from random import randint
	import time
	print('I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20')
	time.sleep(3)
	number = randint(1,20)
	guess = int(input("Guess a number:"))
	if guess < number:
		print('Too low')
	elif guess > number:
		print('Too high')
	else:
		print('You got it!')
```
