Adam Busby, 24, of Glasgow was arrested on suspicion of cyber terrorism after he allegedly sent seven emails between September and October last year to university employees. A police affidavit said the student is accused of 'directing' a message stating: 'A bomb has been placed in the library.' Busby was also accused of sending another email that read: 'A bomb has been placed in your main building . . . it will go off today at 2pm.' A third email allegedly stated that the suspect had placed a 'bomb on the front steps' and one more message read, 'There is a bomb planted in the library. It will go off today between the hours of 5 to 7am.' The student was arrested last month after an FBI investigation into a series of emails threatening Pittsburgh University. Busby allegedly sent a total of seven emails . He was charged with two counts of cyber-terrorism and one count of sending threats through interstate communication on Tuesday. The three charges were filed in federal court in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Prosecutors say that Busby emailed a message stating: 'A bomb has been placed in the library.'
