Brian Byers, 24, of Sparta, allegedly staged an elaborate hoax after crashing his uncle's car while driving under the influence in January. Byers reportedly called 911 and claimed he had slid on black ice at the intersection of Eaton-Township Road and Porter Road, just outside of Sparta.

The police investigation quickly determined that there was no black ice present at the time of the crash. Instead, it appeared that Byers had simply lost control of his vehicle due to driving while intoxicated. Byers was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and falsely reporting an incident.
