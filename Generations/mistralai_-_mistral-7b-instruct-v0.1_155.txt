 y after suggesting that Britain should open its doors to thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries.

The shadow home secretary's comments came as part of an impassioned speech on the crisis in Syria, which has displaced millions of people.

Ms Cooper said: "We have a moral obligation to help those who are fleeing persecution, including those affected by the ongoing conflict in Syria."

She added that Britain should take in 10,000 refugees over the next five years, with at least 2,000 coming every year.

The suggestion immediately sparked a furious backlash from immigration minister Mark Harper, who insisted that any decision on refugee numbers must be based on national security concerns and the ability to integrate new arrivals into British society.

He said: "We have to consider not only what's right for those individuals but also what's right for our country as a whole. We need to ensure that our immigration policy is balanced and sustainable."

The debate comes as pressure mounts on David Cameron to take a more active role in the Syrian crisis, following criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.

Mr Harper has previously argued against taking in large numbers of refugees from Syria, fearing that it could lead to security risks and strain on local resources.

He said: "It's not just about numbers - we need to make sure that anyone who comes here is able to integrate into society and become part of our communities."

Labour has been criticised for its stance on immigration in recent years, with some MPs accusing the party of being too soft on refugees and failing to properly vet new arrivals.

However, Ms Cooper argued that Britain had a moral obligation to help those who were fleeing persecution, regardless of their nationality or background.

She said: "We have a responsibility to offer sanctuary to those who are in desperate need of it."

The shadow home secretary added that she would work with the government to ensure that any refugees coming to Britain were properly vetted and integrated into society.
