If your gift list this year includes gadget-obsessed early adopters who love snatching up the latest electronics, you're in luck. This year a raft of new phones, tablets and wearables are hitting the market -- offering some tantalizing options to tech enthusiasts.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7\nThe South Korean company is expected to unveil its next flagship phone at the MWC trade show in Barcelona later this month. The new device may include an iris-scanning feature, and rumors suggest that it'll also sport a USB-C port.\nApple Watch 2\nThe Apple Watch debuted last April, with the company making the bold claim that it was the "future of mobile computing." Well, now it's time for an upgrade. Rumors say it may feature a GPS chip and a barometric altimeter to track your height above sea level.\nGoogle Allo\nThis is Google's new smart-messaging app -- available in the Android Play store now -- which includes a "smart reply" that tries to guess what you're going to say next. It uses artificial intelligence, or AI. So far it only works on the iPhone.\nHTC Vive\nThe Taiwanese company's virtual reality headset is expected to go on sale in April for $799 -- a price tag that might give pause to some of those early adopters. But the device has received good reviews and offers a more immersive experience than Samsung's Gear VR.\nLenovo Phab 2\nThe phablet, or phone-tablet hybrid, is about 6 inches on each side. It'll run Android Marshmallow and include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor -- making it one of the fastest tablets you can buy.\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4\nThe new tablet computer sports a USB-C port, a higher resolution screen than the iPad Air 2, and the latest version of Windows 10. The Surface Book laptop also comes with that same USB-C port -- but it's pricier.\nSony PlayStation VR\nThe new headset will be able to run games such as "Batman: Arkham Knight" and "Final Fantasy VII." It'll cost $400 when it goes on sale next month.\nVirtual Reality (VR) gaming\nEven though the technology is still in its early stages, you can already play video games using VR headsets. The most popular choice is Oculus Rift -- which has received good reviews but is also expected to cost about $500. Samsung's Gear VR and Google Cardboard are less expensive options.\nMoto 360\nThe second version of Motorola's smartwatch features a round screen that'll give you more display space for information such as messages, weather or sports scores. It also offers an array of customizable watch faces, which can be changed by swapping out the strap.\nRazer Nabu\nThis is an Android-powered device that looks like a smartwatch but isn't really one at all. Instead it functions more as a wearable activity tracker -- counting your steps and other daily metrics. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth."
