 It seems like you're sharing a news excerpt about Fidel Castro's response to President Barack Obama regarding US-Cuba relations. In 2014, Obama announced that he would normalize diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than half a century of strained relations between the two nations. However, as your statement suggests, there were disagreements and criticisms from both sides during this process.

Fidel Castro was known for his strong and often fiery rhetoric throughout his tenure as Cuba's leader. His comment about President Obama being "stupid" likely refers to a speech he gave in Havana where he criticized Obama's conditions for improved relations, such as human rights improvements and economic reforms on the island.

This exchange underscores the complex history between the United States and Cuba, and the ongoing debates surrounding their relationship. It's important to note that Fidel Castro passed away in 2016, and his brother Ra√∫l Castro stepped down as President of Cuba in 2018, marking a significant shift in leadership on the island nation.
