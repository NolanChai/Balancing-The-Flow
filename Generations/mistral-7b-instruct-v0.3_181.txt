 It seems like you've shared a tragic news story about a young girl named Cameron Laughlin who passed away in Ohio. This is indeed a heartbreaking incident. It's always important to remind people about the dangers of leaving children unattended in vehicles, even if they are parked.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on average, every 10 days a child dies from heatstroke in a vehicle. Here are some safety tips to prevent such incidents:

1. Never leave children unattended in a car, even for a minute. The interior temperature of the car can rise almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit within the first 10 minutes.

2. Make it a habit to look in the back seat before leaving your vehicle.

3. If you see a child alone in a car, call 911 immediately. If they are in danger, emergency personnel have the authority to remove the child from the vehicle.

4. Teach children that a vehicle is not a play area and that they should never play in, sit on, or touch a vehicle without an adult's permission.

5. Keep car keys out of reach of children. If a child finds keys and gains access to vehicles, they could potentially lock themselves inside or start the engine and move the vehicle.
