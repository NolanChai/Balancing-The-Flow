In a building fire, every second counts for the first responders rushing to the scene. They need to act quickly and decisively in order to rescue people and put out the fire. The sooner they can get to the scene of the fire, the more likely it is that lives can be saved. That’s why it’s so important for them to have access to equipment like fire trucks and ladders, as well as training on how best to respond in these situations. With their quick thinking and skillset, they can help save lives when every second counts.
