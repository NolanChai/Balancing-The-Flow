 It seems like you're starting a biography of Sophie Jane Evans, who is linked to Princess Anne and has significant involvement in farming and conservation organizations. However, your message got cut off before completing the sentence about what Princess Anne was happy to speak out about.

Here's how I might complete that part: "But tonight, Princess Anne was happy to speak out about her shared passion for protecting and preserving the British countryside, emphasizing the importance of sustainable farming practices and conservation efforts."

Of course, this is just a suggestion based on common themes in biographies and the context given. You can adjust it according to your specific needs or the actual content you have available.
