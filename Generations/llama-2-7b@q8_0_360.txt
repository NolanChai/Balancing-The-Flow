| UPDATED: 15:24 EST, 3 November 2013 | An abandoned dog dubbed ET because of his hairless and wrinkled body has, like the loveable alien, become a celebrity in his community. The pooch, who was found by a resident as a puppy in California's Mojave Desert with no coat and so skinny he could be seen through his thin bones, now has an army of followers on Facebook after being given to the town veterinarian. ET's owner Dr. Gary Richter dubbed him 'ET' because of his hairless and wrinkled body - similar to that of Hollywood's most loveable alien The four-year-old dog, who now weighs 12 pounds after being given a healthy diet by Dr. Richter, was taken in after he became severely ill on the streets last year. 'I saw him and he was so skinny,' said his owner. 'When I first got him he had hairless areas that were black, he's so thin you can see through his bones.' The pup has become a hit with local children who visit Dr Richter for health checks at the Desert Animal Network clinic in Lancaster, California. He's also found love as a pet after his owner adopted him from the veterinarian, who named him after ET because of their similar appearances. 'He looks like an alien,' said Dr. Richter. 'I thought it would be funny to name him that.' Since becoming part of the clinic's staff he has won over locals with his friendly personality and charming nature, and now has more than 2,400 followers on Facebook. ET is one of many dogs who have been abandoned in California - according to the Los Angeles Times more than 50,000 pets are put down annually.
