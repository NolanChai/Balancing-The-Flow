County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- Mayor Peter Ross said Saturday that his decision to step down from the post in Clane, about 25 miles southwest of Dublin, was due to family reasons. But he added that he had been "attacked by elements who believe I should not represent people of black African origin." He did not elaborate and said he would make no further comments until legal proceedings have been concluded. Ross's resignation came after an outcry from the local community when a story about his remarks appeared in the Irish Times last week. "I just think it's very sad that this whole thing has happened because there are certain elements who want me to say things and do things," he told CNN on Saturday, saying he did not make racist comments. Ross said he had been under pressure from "certain sections" of the community since taking over as mayor in June but was not aware of any complaints made against him by anyone at that time. Ross's lawyer, Patrick McDonald, confirmed to CNN that his client resigned Friday and that he has received legal advice not to make any further public comments on the case. Ross is being investigated by police over comments reported in an Irish newspaper about how he would no longer represent black people in Clane. In a statement, An Garda Siochana -- the Republic of Ireland's national police force -- said it was "aware that such matters have been raised" and had been passed to the appropriate authority for further action. But McDonald said: "Peter Ross has not yet received any official communication from anybody in relation to this matter." He told CNN his client was "surprised by all of it and he's very, very disappointed that what he said -- which I believe is an unfortunate turn of phrase -- has been blown out of proportion. "This situation will be dealt with through the legal process in due course," McDonald added. Ross, a businessman from Clane, told CNN on Saturday: "I'm not making any further comment at this time." A spokeswoman for the Kildare County Council said Ross resigned as mayor Friday afternoon and that the council did not expect to meet again before next week because of Christmas. She would only say his resignation was "pre-determined," adding: "I have no other details." An Garda Siochana said it is aware of a complaint received by the county council about comments reportedly made by Ross on Facebook and that an investigation will take place in due course. It added: "The matter is currently being examined by the appropriate authority for action to be taken, should any offense have been committed." The Irish Times newspaper quoted an unidentified woman as saying Ross was not happy with black people who had moved into Clane and that he would no longer represent them or help them. But Ross denied making racist comments when contacted by CNN on Wednesday. "I can confirm to you that I never said what you are putting up there," Ross told CNN, referring to a news item headlined: "'We don't want any more blacks moving in.' "The people of Clane do not think I should represent them and they say the same thing about me representing Africans. But I have no problem with Africans." He added that his comments were taken out of context and had been reported inaccurately by an unnamed source at a meeting held after his inauguration as mayor. "There was only three people present at the meeting when I made the comment," Ross said, adding that he did not know any African children living in Clane. He also denied having a racist attitude and said he would be happy to meet with any black person who wanted to make contact with him. The Irish Times quoted a man who identified himself as Peter Ross but said his name was being misused when he complained on Facebook about "the number of people from Africa that have moved into Clane." He said it was wrong that he had been made mayor and added: "We don't want any more blacks moving in, we are a white village and always will be. We do not need this immigration." The newspaper also quoted the woman as saying Ross is not happy with the way black people have moved into Clane. He "has stated that he will no longer represent them or help them," she told the Irish Times. "He has also asked for a meeting with any of his black constituents to discuss their views on the situation, which I am sure they would welcome." In an interview last week with CNN's Hala Gorani, Ross denied having any problem with people from other races and said he wanted to meet anyone who felt aggrieved. "I have no problem with African children," he told CNN. "As a businessman, it is my policy not to get involved in politics and that's what I intend doing." Clane, which has a population of 14,500 people, according to the CIA Factbook, sits on the banks of the Liffey River and is about a 30-minute drive west of Dublin. The Irish Times reported Ross had said in May that he wanted to take over as mayor when he met with the current incumbent, Anne Doyle, who was stepping down after three years at the helm. "I have been invited by the people of Clane," Ross told the newspaper, adding: "We are a white community." The Irish Times quoted an unnamed man who said he had no problem with black people but that there were too many African immigrants living in Clane. "It's not racist to say that, is it?" he asked. "I know you wouldn't understand but when we have a white community and we are having to put up with these black Africans -- who do not integrate at all -- it is wrong." He said Ross was "not very good" as mayor but added: "There has always been that problem of blacks moving in." CNN's John Mukumi contributed to this report.
