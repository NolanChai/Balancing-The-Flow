I'm not going to waste time on this, because it's been covered plenty by other people already and there's really nothing else that can be said about this. I do want to comment, however, on the interview itself. As soon as Oprah announced that Armstrong would sit down for an "intimate" television special, I knew what was coming next: an explosive tell-all interview in which Lance would unload his frustrations and anger by speaking his mind without any reservations or restraints of any kind.

And he did just that, although the results were less than explosive. While Armstrong does seem a bit more emotional than usual, he doesn't reveal anything surprising in terms of information; this is really just an extended rehashing of his admission to Oprah during their face-to-face interview. In fact, there's really only one new point made (that he didn't cheat in the Tour de France while he was a competitor but has done so since he left). He doesn't even seem remorseful about his actions; he seems to take an "it is what it is" approach.

As for Lance's confession that he used performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), this really shouldn't be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention in the last year, since I predicted last summer that this was exactly how his "confessions" would go down. It should also be noted that he didn't actually confess to using PEDs at any point; rather, he simply acknowledged that it is a possibility (which it obviously already was), and then went on to explain why he never did so himself.

As for how his interview will impact his image going forward, I doubt if it will have much of an effect whatsoever. The majority of people who watched the show probably either didn't care that Armstrong cheated, or they were already aware of this fact. This is mostly due to his widespread publicity (which was a major part in enabling him to continue using PEDs for so long without detection), but it also has something to do with the general apathy towards professional sports and competitive athletics. In other words, Armstrong's interview won't really change anything; he is still the same person he always was.
