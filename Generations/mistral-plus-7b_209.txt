Lauren Thomas, 28, of Llanelli, shed 10st after she was mistaken for her own mother on Facebook. The retail assistant was mortified when a friend tagged her in a picture and made the embarrassing comment. “I felt so ashamed because I didn’t want to be compared with my own mum,” said Lauren.

Lauren had spent most of her life battling with her weight, turning to food to deal with the stresses of everyday life. As she grew older, she became increasingly unhappy with her appearance and would spend hours each day on social media scrolling through photos of slimmer women. She knew that it was time for a change when she could no longer fit into a size 26 dress.

Lauren began her weight loss journey by making some small changes to her diet, such as cutting back on processed foods and increasing her intake of fruits and vegetables. She also started walking more each day and joined an online fitness group for encouragement and support. As she continued to lose weight, Lauren became increasingly motivated and determined to reach her goal weight.

Now, 10st lighter, Lauren feels like a different person. She is proud of her accomplishments and has found that she has more confidence than ever before. “I’m so glad I took the plunge and started my journey,” said Lauren. “It hasn’t been easy, but it has been worth it.”
