A Taliban insurgent wearing an Afghan National Army uniform shot and killed three American service members at a base in southern Afghanistan on Friday, officials said. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks by Afghans dressed as police or military. The shooter was shot and wounded by other coalition troops.

The attack happened around 8 a.m. local time in a compound within a large military base in Helmand province, NATO said in a statement. All three dead were U.S. service members, and two others were wounded, the statement added.
