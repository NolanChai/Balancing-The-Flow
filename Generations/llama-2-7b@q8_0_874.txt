Arsene Wenger has said that he'll try and sign one more player in January. 
The Frenchman revealed after a 1-0 defeat by Liverpool on Saturday that his side have been scouring the market for players who can help them compete at the highest level of English football, but he added that he won't be making any rash decisions to sign players just because Arsenal are struggling this season.
