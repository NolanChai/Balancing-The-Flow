A few things I noticed straight away:
* The headline is a quote, but doesn't use quotation marks
* There's a full stop at the end of it
* It's not clear who's speaking - is it Miriam?

So first up, let's fix that.

```html
<p>Nick Clegg today looks to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in "the fight of our lives" to stay in power.</p>
```

That's better, but there are some other things I want to draw out of this:
* Nick is looking to his wife.
* He's asking her for help.
* The Lib Dems need help
* They are fighting a fight
* That fight is the "fight of our lives"

Let's make that clearer with some markup!

```html
<p>Nick Clegg today looks to his wife Miriam to help <strong class="highlight">the Lib Dems</strong> in
  "the fight of our lives" to stay in power.</p>
```

Now we have an emphasis on the Lib Dems, but I want to highlight the phrase "fight of our lives". It's a useful phrase in itself and it will be picked up by search engines. Let's give it some more prominence:

```html
<p>Nick Clegg today looks to his wife Miriam to help <strong class="highlight">the Lib Dems</strong> in
  "the fight of our lives" to stay in power.</p>

<p><strong>The fight of our lives</strong>, it seems, is the phrase Nick has chosen to describe their battle for survival. The phrase has been used by Clegg before but was deployed again today when he visited the Lib Dems' campaign HQ in Twickenham, south-west London.</p>
```

Now there's more emphasis on the phrase we want to draw out, and it has its own paragraph for even more prominence. We can also see how important this phrase is by seeing how many times it is used - here it appears three times.
