Write about how the girl got her dad's ashes into the river. [/INST]

There was once a young woman who had recently lost her father. She decided she wanted his ashes spread in the river where he used to go fishing when he was alive. She went home after work one day and told her mother that she needed help. Her mother looked at her with sad eyes, but agreed to help her.
The next morning, the young woman gathered up all of her father's ashes and put them into a small jar. She then went out to her car and drove to the river where her dad used to go fishing. She parked her car on the side of the road and got out. She opened the jar and let his ashes flow downstream, watching as they disappeared in the water.
As she stood there, she could see a small boat coming up behind her. It was her father's friend, who had come to say goodbye to him that last day. He saw what she was doing and got out of his boat to join her. She turned around and hugged him tightly, thanking him for being such a dear friend to her dad.
As they stood there together, watching the ashes float away, a bird flew overhead and dropped a feather on the water. They looked at each other and smiled, knowing that he was now free from the pain and suffering of this world, and had found peace in the next one.

The young woman's mother watched her daughter from afar, feeling a mix of emotions. She was sad for her own loss, but also grateful that her daughter had found a way to honor her father's memory. She knew how much he meant to both of them, and she could see the love and respect they had for each other in their eyes.
As the ashes continued to float away, the young woman felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that her father was now free from this world, and she was grateful for the time they had shared together. She also knew that he would always be with her, in her heart and in her memories.
And so, as the bird's feather fluttered down to join the ashes on the water, the young woman watched as her father's final resting place drifted away into the distance, knowing that he was now at peace.
