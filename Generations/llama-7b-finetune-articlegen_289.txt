The conflict has sparked protests by Palestinians across Israel, with demonstrations drawing hundreds of participants in Nazareth, Jaffa, Ramleh, Taybe and Haifa. The largest rally took place Saturday afternoon in the Galilean town of Umm El-Fahm, where 20,000 people marched through the streets to protest what they called Israeli government repression against Palestinian citizens. "They are killing us slowly," shouted one participant from a stage erected at the center of the demonstration. "We won't accept that. We won't accept any humiliation. We will defend our right, and we will bring down this government."
