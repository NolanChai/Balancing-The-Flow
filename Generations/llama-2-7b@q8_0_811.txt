I think that this is one of the most outrageous things that I have ever heard. It would be like the Russians not calling the Ukrainian Revolution a Coup because it did not meet their definition for what constitutes as a coup. There are several points here:
* The US has no idea what to do. 
    * The US will probably be in favor of the Egyptian military overthrowing Morsi but against them doing so if they were going to put a democratically elected leader back into power, since that is clearly not a coup according to US law or policy.
* We are being told what to do by other countries
    * Russia has a vested interest in the success of the Egyptian military because it wants to block any chance for Turkey (a US ally) to be able to make deals with Gulf Countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, or at least reduce their influence. 
    * The US on the other hand is not trying to do anything except to ensure that Morsi gets replaced by some one who will allow us to continue our support of Israel, which we have done for far too long now without questioning its legitimacy.
* We are willing to accept a lesser evil than our allies in the region (Russia) over our allies in the world at large (Turkey). 
    * This is not new news, but it is interesting that they would openly admit this policy and the fact that their definition of democracy is not universal.
* The US is willing to work with a military dictatorship for as long as it takes if they can bring about an environment where our goals in the region are achieved
    * In other words, we will do whatever needs to be done to make sure Israel stays intact and strong. We don't care that this may not be good for humanity, just so long as we achieve our own self-interest.
