 The location you are describing is Uxbridge, specifically RAF Northolt and RAF Uxbridge, both in Middlesex, England. During World War II, these airfields played a pivotal role in the Battle of Britain as they served as key command and control centers for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Fighter Command headquarters was located at RAF Bentley Priory, just northwest of Uxbridge town center. From here, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, and later his successor, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, directed the defense against the German air offensive in 1940. The Battle of Britain was a turning point in World War II as it marked the first time that the Royal Air Force successfully repelled large-scale attacks by the Luftwaffe, preventing a potential invasion of Great Britain by Nazi Germany. Today, Bentley Priory is home to the Battle of Britain Bunker Museum, which preserves and showcases the history of the Battle of Britain and Fighter Command's role in the defense of Britain during World War II.
