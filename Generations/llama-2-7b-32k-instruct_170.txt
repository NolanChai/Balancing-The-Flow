The game had been tainted by cheating in past matches and the allegations were another blow to its reputation, he added. "It's not just that some people have cheated," the judge said.  "There is something fundamentally wrong with the integrity of cricket."   Judge Edwin Glasgow was presiding over an appeal brought by Southport resident John Williams who wanted a court order forcing the sport to ban for life those involved in fixing matches. The hearing will resume on Wednesday.   Williams, 74, had argued that he and other fans were misled when they watched the England v Pakistan Test match at Lord's Cricket Ground last year because some of the players had been involved in fixing it. He said: "People are going to be a lot more suspicious from now on ."
