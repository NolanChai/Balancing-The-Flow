#### 1st Approach (20 Points):
The Arsenal manager is not so foolish to spend such wealth without reason or thought, he knows the club are a long way off being able to compete with European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Wenger has always been a keen advocate of ‘spending smart’ and, while there have been some expensive mistakes over the years, his purchases are usually worth far more than their price tags would indicate.
#### 2nd Approach (25 Points):
It is worth bearing in mind that Arsenal's debt at this point in time was £173.4m when they published their financial results last year. However, with a number of contracted players in the final months of their deals and some big names such as Podolski, Szcesny and Arteta out of contract in 2016, Wenger’s cash will be needed to ensure that he can attract top class talent.
#### 3rd Approach (30 Points):
The Gunners have never had a transfer budget close to £175m, the only times they've come close was in 2012 and 2008 when they spent around £94.3m and £73.7m respectively. Even at their peak, they could only bring in top class talent such as Theo Walcott, Cesc Fabregas (twice) and Samir Nasri for the club's biggest ever transfer fee of £25m.

#### 4th Approach (35 Points):
Arsenal will continue to spend at the same levels as in previous seasons which means they could be looking at a net spend around £50m-£60m with the club's wage bill unlikely to fall significantly this season.

#### 5th Approach (40 Points):
Arsenal will continue to sell players each season and with a number of high profile names out of contract next summer, we could see a huge turnover in players in 2015 as they look to rebuild the side around Wenger's new recruits.

#### 6th Approach (45 Points):
Arsenal will continue to spend at the same levels as in previous seasons which means they could be looking at a net spend around £50m-£60m with the club's wage bill unlikely to fall significantly this season.
