Cuba’s reclusive former President Fidel Castro has been photographed in public for the first time in almost a year. The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an arts institute in Havana on Saturday, more than 11 months after he stepped down. The frail-looking 83-year-old, who is still Cuba’s president, walked with a cane and was accompanied by his wife Dalia Soto del Valle.
