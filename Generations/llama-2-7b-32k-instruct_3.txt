The TLC network has decided to pull the June 13th episode of Cake Boss off their schedule for the time being. They are currently undergoing a review and assessment of the episode to determine if any changes need to be made. They had received complaints about the content of the show, which features Buddy Valastro making an effigy of President Obama out of candy, complete with a "birth certificate." This was a reference to the controversial birth certificate released by Mr. Obama's camp last year.

According to TLC president and general manager, Nancy Dubuc, the network is very sorry if people were offended by this episode. She claims that she takes pride in their commitment to creative excellence while also taking great care to avoid hurting or offending viewers. This decision was made after careful consideration of these concerns.

The president and CEO of Discovery Communications, the parent company of TLC, stated that they value diversity, inclusiveness, and respect for all people regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion. They were not aware of the content of the episode when it was originally recorded. They have a zero-tolerance policy regarding discrimination in any form and are reviewing this incident thoroughly.

The show's producers stated that they had no intention of making fun of the President, his birth certificate or his race. The purpose of the cake was to bring attention to an ongoing fundraising effort for a charity called Autism Speaks in which Mr. Valastro and many other celebrity chefs were taking part. They did not think that their joke would offend anyone but they understand if it does, and sincerely apologize if any was caused.

It's important to note that this is not the first time a television network has come under fire for airing content that may be considered inappropriate or offensive. The Cake Boss episode will continue to play out as originally scheduled through June 27th, and TLC will make a final determination regarding any changes they may need to make after this period of time.

The network has also released a statement saying that it is "deeply sorry" if anyone was offended by the content of the episode, and that they are committed to creating programming that is respectful and appropriate for all viewers. They will be reviewing the show's scheduling practices to ensure that such episodes do not air again in the future.

Overall, it seems like TLC has taken responsibility for their actions and has made a commitment to being more sensitive to the concerns of their viewers in the future. However, the controversy still raises questions about whether or not television networks should be held accountable for the content they air, and if so, how much freedom should they have in choosing what shows to air.

It's also worth noting that the episode has been viewed by many people who found it entertaining and harmless, and there is no proof that any harm was done to President Obama or his supporters. Ultimately, whether or not TLC's decision to pull the episode was the right one will be up for debate, but it's clear that they are taking steps to address these concerns.

In summary, TLC has apologized and is reviewing the content of the Cake Boss episode after receiving complaints about the content, which featured Buddy Valastro making an effigy of President Obama out of candy with a "birth certificate." The network's president and CEO have stated that they value diversity and respect for all people regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion.
