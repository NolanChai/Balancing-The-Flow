I didn't know about this before so I looked it up. Here's what I found and my thoughts on the matter...

"The International Criminal Court (ICC), also known as the World Court or Hague Court, is a permanent international court that tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The ICC was established by the Rome Statute, which opened for signature in July 1998. It entered into force on 1 July 2002. The ICC has its seat in The Hague, Netherlands.

The court is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore only exercise its jurisdiction when certain conditions are met, such as when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals or when the United Nations Security Council or individual states refer investigations to the Court. The ICC is intended to help end impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes."
(Wikipedia)

My thoughts:  It seems like a good thing that people who commit genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity can be tried by this court.

### Reflection:
I'm not sure why the news is talking about this now?
