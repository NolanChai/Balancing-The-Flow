The nation's record-low teen birth rate stems from robust declines in nearly every state. But there are some bright spots for the young mothers, including Washington and New York. A report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that teens 15 to 19 had fewer than 30 births per 1,000 females in 2011. The low rate was 7 percent below 2010 and the second lowest since 1945. Birth rates fell in nearly every state, though Mississippi reported an increase of three teen births per 1,000 girls from the previous year. Still, the South continued to have the highest rate at 37.6. The CDC report says it's unclear why there has been a decline in teen pregnancy and childbirth rates nationwide. Many states and localities are requiring young women to receive information on long-term contraceptive methods before leaving high school, the agency said. About 80 percent of births were to unmarried mothers, though that rate is trending downward. The report says abortions declined slightly among teens in 2011 and was the lowest since 1975. The data are collected as part of the CDC's National Vital Statistics System program. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2331864/CDC-reports-record-low-teen-birthrate-But-there-bright-spots-young-mothers-including-Washington-New-York.html
