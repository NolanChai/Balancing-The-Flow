```
1. In Lebanese, "shawarma" means "shwarma" as the person in CNN article wrote it.
2. The name of the dish was spelled wrong. It should be "Shawerma". 
3. The restaurant owner should have spelt shawerma correctly because he is from Lebanon and he knows how to spell it properly. 
4. In this case, the owner doesn't know how to speak English well enough and I can see why they made a mistake with spelling Shawerma instead of Shawarma. It could be that he was raised in America where they are not good at speaking Arabic or their dialect. This would explain the misspellings as it is easy for someone who is not good at English to make mistakes when trying to write something down from memory.
