Schoolboy, 13, lands fish of a lifetime after pulling in huge 8ft, 500lb catfish at Loch Ness

The teenager was enjoying an afternoon on the water with his brother and father when they decided to try their hand at fishing for salmon.  

But the youngster ended up landing something much more exciting - a "beast" of a fish that would have made even Nessie blush.

The 8ft, 500lb catfish is roughly as heavy as a world champion boxer and its 12-year-old brother is half the size of an average adult male human.  

Dad Gordon Scott said: "He was swimming away with it and I thought 'what on earth is he doing?'"

Gordon, 56, added: "My son came out and says 'I've got something for you'. He had the biggest smile on his face.

"It was a beast of a fish that would have made even Nessie blush."

The schoolboy, named as Alex by friends, said he thought it was a "normal size" salmon before his dad pulled the creature out of the water and declared: "'Well I think we've caught something else".  

Alex's mum Fiona, 48, told how she watched on in horror as her husband tried to pull the giant fish from the Loch.

Fiona said: "I was getting quite worried watching Gordon trying to drag this huge thing out of the water."

The family - who have lived next to the famous loch for 14 years - decided to take their catch home and put it in their freezer before returning to Loch Ness to try again.  

Alex said: "I'm quite proud but also a bit scared now. It was really heavy."

A spokesman for the Loch Ness Monster Investigation Bureau (LNMIB) told Daily Record Online: "It looks like Alex may have caught a real beast of a fish but we're not sure if it's a catfish or something else.  

"We don't know anything about Alex and his catch, other than what he has told us himself."

Loch Ness is a huge freshwater loch in the Highlands of Scotland that measures 23 miles (37km) long, 1 mile (1.6 km) wide and about 750ft (230m) deep at its deepest point.  

It has been surrounded by myth for centuries and claims include a creature that lurks in the dark depths of Loch Ness that has become known as 'Nessie' .

The latest sighting was on October 14, when three people said they saw "a long black humped shape with an oval head" and described it as being around 30ft (9.1m) in length, swimming east to west at a depth of between 25ft (8m) and 45ft (13.7m).

It came just days after sightings were made near Drumnadrochit on the southwest shore of Loch Ness where two witnesses said they saw "something" around the same length moving at a depth of between 20ft (6.1m) and 45ft (13.7m).

Another sighting was made by a group of four tourists in Inverness on October 9, who reported seeing an object with "two humps" at a distance that was around 2.5 miles away from the shore.  

They described it as being about 30ft (9.1m) long, 8-10ft high and 4-6ft wide and moving slowly southwest across Loch Ness.  

The spokesman added: "We have had a number of reports recently so there is clearly something in the water."

A further four sightings were made between October 3 and October 5 with descriptions ranging from a large, dark shape to an object with two humps travelling at speed.  

They came as a team of marine biologists announced they had discovered a new species of "Loch Ness monster" - which they called Nessicornis brevirostris - in the loch.  

Scientists from Natural History Museum, Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews were studying the deep-water lake in Loch Ness when they came across the remains of an 18ft (5.5m) long prehistoric fish .   

They believe that the creature could have been a relative of the "Loch Ness monster" or its ancestor, which went extinct around 4,000 years ago.  

Dr David Marshall from the Natural History Museum told the Times: "I'm very excited about this find, as it helps us to understand more about how loch monsters evolved in Scotland."

The latest sighting was made by a tourist who said she saw a large black object on the west bank of Loch Ness that looked like a 15ft (4.6m) long animal with two humps and appeared to be travelling south at between 3pm and 4pm.

The witness, named as "Eileen" who gave her age as over-70 said: "It was huge - about the size of a small boat."

Another sighting was made on September 10 when a man driving his car along the A82 at Inverness saw an object with two humps that he estimated to be 50ft (15.2m) long, which then disappeared beneath the water.  

He told MailOnline: "I thought I was seeing things - it was really strange."  

And on July 6 a man said he saw something with two humps that measured around 30ft (9.1m) in length and moving at speed through Loch Ness, near the Drumnadrochit pier.   

The witness, who did not want to be named, described it as having "two humps" travelling at a depth of between 20ft (6.1m) and 45ft (13.7m).  

He added: "I was driving on the A82 when I saw something very large with two humps swimming across Loch Ness .

"It was about 4pm, travelling southwest.

"There were no other boats in sight and the water was calm."

A further two sightings were made on June 17 - one from a caravan park in Fort Augustus near Inverness which described seeing something that moved "too fast for any known animal" at speed with two humps, while another witness saw it again three days later.  

On May 24 a man spotted an object with two humps travelling at speed through the loch from north to south . He said: "It was big and black but I couldn't see any detail - just two humps."   

A further sighting on April 15 came from a man who saw something that measured around 40ft (12.2m) in length, travelling east to west at a depth of between 30ft (9.1m) and 60ft (18.3m).

A further sighting was made on March 5 by a group of tourists who reported seeing something that "appeared to be moving slowly" with two humps travelling north from near Inverness Castle.

It is not the first time Alex has come across monster-related mystery - last year, he and his brother spotted what they described as a "glowing UFO".  

Dad Gordon said: "I didn't believe them until I saw it for myself."

Alex said: "It was strange because there were no stars in the sky at that time of night but then we spied something with two lights, flying slowly and in a straight line towards the south.

"My dad even got out his phone to video us as it went over our house."

The latest sightings came as police revealed they are investigating claims of "harassment" at Loch Ness .  

Police said they have received reports from people who have been harassed or intimidated by a group of men in Loch Ness .

They added: "This has included being told that Nessie does not exist, shouting and throwing stones near the shoreline.  

"If you experience any incidents like this on the loch please call us."

It came just days after a new documentary claimed to reveal the real identity of the Loch Ness monster as a giant eel .   

The footage, which was shown at the Wildscreen Panda Award Ceremony in Bristol last week, has been viewed over 15million times.  

It also features an interview with one of the world's leading experts on fish - Dr Steve Duffield from Nottingham University who said: "The mystery is solved."   

A number of people have come forward to claim they saw the e
