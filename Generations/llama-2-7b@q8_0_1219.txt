Brussels has infuriated ministers with a provocative series of proposals to boost economic growth in Britain - including higher taxes, new levies on expensive homes, and more free movement of people from the EU's poorer nations.
The demands came as officials at European Commission headquarters published details of a new strategy for tackling youth unemployment which they believe could cut the jobless rate among 15 to 24 year-olds by 30 per cent.
The plan includes calls for the UK to introduce new taxes and extra levies on properties worth £1million or more, as well as extending free movement rights to young workers from outside EU countries like Romania and Bulgaria.
In return the UK would have to pay billions of pounds in contributions to fund a series of new European projects and initiatives. The proposals will be discussed by leaders at this week's summit in Brussels, but are likely to meet resistance in Downing Street.
British officials are alarmed about the implications for the UK economy if more EU workers come here, including how it would hit public services and drive down wages. The plans also highlight divisions within the EU over the future of free movement - with some member states already moving to restrict access from outside Europe.
The 100-page report by Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso calls for an expansion of existing measures to tackle youth unemployment, but also includes a number of other proposals which will be put to leaders at the summit.
It includes an extension of free movement rights for young workers from outside Europe to work in the EU and 'address mobility barriers' - including a call to relax rules on access to social housing, where EU nationals are prevented from being able to buy homes even if they have worked and paid taxes for more than five years.
The report says: "We must remove obstacles to the labour market integration of young migrants to ensure that young people can fully enjoy their rights as citizens and find employment in accordance with EU law." The move will raise concerns among Tory MPs, who have long argued against allowing unlimited numbers of immigrants from outside Europe.
The document says there should be a 'renewed focus on the social integration of young people' including an expansion of programmes to encourage young EU migrants to learn languages and ensure they are included in local communities.
There is also a call for greater use of a new funding pot, called Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), which would allow member states to offer financial support to young people who were unemployed or at risk of leaving education early. The fund has already been earmarked with £700million of EU cash for the next seven years but it is not clear how much more will be made available in a bid to help cut youth unemployment, which stood at 25.1 per cent across the eurozone last year and almost double that in parts of southern Europe.
The report also includes demands for the UK to increase its contributions to the EU budget as part of plans to raise revenue from countries where growth is stronger than predicted. The proposals will be discussed at a summit in Brussels this week - but are likely to face resistance in Downing Street.
