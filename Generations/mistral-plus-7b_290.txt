The New York Knicks received a boost with the arrival of their star player, Carmelo Anthony, ahead of their game against the Milwaukee Bucks in London on Thursday. Anthony had been sidelined by an injury for several weeks but his return to the court could help the struggling team get back on track. The Knicks have struggled for consistency this season and with Anthonyâ€™s return, they will be hoping for a change of fortune.
