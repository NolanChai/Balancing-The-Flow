One year ago today I woke up in a hospital in Beirut with bandages covering most of my body. The blast had left me scarred and shaken, but I was determined to overcome the trauma and rebuild my life.

I spent the next few months in physical therapy, slowly regaining my strength and mobility. It wasn't easy, but with the support of family and friends, I pushed through the pain and got back on my feet.

As I recovered, I began to reflect on what had happened and the impact it had on my life. The blast was a reminder that life is fragile and unpredictable, and it made me appreciate every moment of my life even more. It also taught me the importance of resilience and determination in the face of adversity.

Today I am grateful for the opportunity to start over again. I have learned that no matter what happens, I have the strength and courage to overcome it.
