I just want to say that I'm happy the two boys are safe, but I do wish there was more information about how they got themselves into this situation in the first place! The article has a lot of great information about how the emergency crews were able to rescue the brothers, and it mentions that ice can be shifting even though it may not look like it. But there is no explanation as to why these boys were on a frozen river in the first place when they should have been at home safe with their family! It's great news that everyone made it out alive, but I hope we learn from this and make sure that nobody else gets put in danger like this again.
