 It is reported that Home Secretary Theresa May has been pushing for changes in UK surveillance laws to allow security services greater access to individuals' email and internet records. However, former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been actively campaigning against these measures and is working to delay the passing of the Communications Data Bill, which would legalize such surveillance.

Clegg argues that the proposed changes would undermine privacy and security, as it would give law enforcement agencies unprecedented access to citizens' personal information without proper oversight or safeguards in place. He has called on MPs and other politicians to stand up for individual rights and demand that any surveillance measures be subject to rigorous legal oversight and transparency.

The debate over surveillance and privacy has been a contentious issue in the UK and around the world, with many people arguing that government agencies should have limited access to citizens' personal data in order to protect their privacy and security. The proposed changes to UK surveillance laws would likely be met with resistance from civil liberties groups, human rights organizations, and individuals who are concerned about the potential consequences of such measures.
