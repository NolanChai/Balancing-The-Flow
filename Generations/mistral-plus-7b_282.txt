John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has been criticized for his expensive travel habits. He has been known to take many lavish limousine rides, including one that cost £177 for a four-mile journey. This is not the first time that John Bercow has come under fire for his extravagant spending. In fact, he has been called “the most expensive Speaker in parliamentary history” due to his frequent use of private jets and luxury cars.
