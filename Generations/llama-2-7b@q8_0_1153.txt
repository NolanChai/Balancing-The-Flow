I visited my mother's family there for a few weeks and met people who remembered the Second World War as if it had happened only yesterday. They lived in a country that was still coming to grips with its Nazi occupation.

The Germans invaded Poland in 1939, just before Britain and France declared war on Germany.

A few years later, the United States joined the Allies after Pearl Harbor. By then, more than 10 percent of Poland's population had been killed -- a death toll greater than any other country except Russia and Yugoslavia.

The Red Army helped liberate Poland in January 1945 after three years of occupation by Hitler and Stalin. But the price was high: 6 million dead, including millions of Polish Jews exterminated by Nazi Germany's Final Solution.

By 1989, Poles had grown tired of communist rule and rose up against it -- a revolution that quickly spread across eastern Europe and finally toppled the Berlin Wall in November.

In May 2004, I returned to Poland for the 60th anniversary commemorations of World War II. That's when I met Andrzej Pfeifer, now chairman of the Warsaw-based International Auschwitz Committee (IAC), and his friend Marek Jan Chodakiewicz.

Chodakiewicz was in the U.S. Army during the war and later a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University, where he wrote about the Soviet Union's role in World War II.

In 1972, Chodakiewicz joined the faculty of American University in Washington, D.C., and has taught at Georgetown University since 2003. He is also the author of many books including: "After the Holocaust: Polish-Jewish Conflict in Poland Since 1945" (London, New York: Routledge Curzon, 2003) and "Intermarium: The Land between the Black Sea and the Baltic -- History and Politics."

Chodakiewicz explained that after World War II, Poles began to rebuild their country. In the process they came to terms with what had happened under Nazi occupation. But communist rule made it more difficult for Poles to examine how Russians had supported Germany during the war and later helped the Soviet Union suppress Warsaw's uprising in 1944 -- an effort that killed more than 200,000 civilians and wounded another 500,000.

Poland is now free but many Poles remain angry about their country's role during World War II. They want the world to know what happened to Jews there -- as well as to Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and others.

The International Auschwitz Committee was formed in 1989 to help document and memorialize Polish victims of the Holocaust. The organization now has chapters all over Europe, Latin America, North America and Asia, including one in Jerusalem.
Pfeifer said that before he joined IAC, he never thought about Jews or World War II. But he was so moved by the stories he heard from survivors of the Holocaust -- including some who had escaped from Auschwitz on a death march and survived -- that he volunteered to work at IAC.
As vice chairman, Pfeifer has been instrumental in organizing the commemoration of World War II in Poland -- an event that draws thousands each year to places like Gdansk, Warsaw and Torun. The events include lectures by scholars from around the world and meetings with survivors.
Today Pfeifer is a history professor at the University of Warsaw and chairman of IAC, while Chodakiewicz remains on the faculty at Georgetown University.
