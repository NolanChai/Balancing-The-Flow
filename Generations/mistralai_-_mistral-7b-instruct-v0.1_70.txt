 to the relief of those watching, the turtle managed to escape the deadly clutches of its predators thanks to a group of tourists who intervened.

The incident occurred at Lake Nakuru in Kenya, where two large Nile crocodiles were spotted stalking a turtle on a small island near the shore. The tourists, who had been watching the scene unfold from a safe distance, decided to take action and scare off the crocodiles.

According to reports, the tourists threw rocks and sticks at the crocodiles, making loud noises and splashing water in their direction. This effectively startled the predators and caused them to swim away from the island and towards the open water.

The turtle, which had been trapped on the island for several hours, managed to swim to safety and was later found by local guides who were alerted to the situation. The tourists were praised for their bravery and quick thinking in saving the turtle's life.

"We were horrified when we saw the two crocodiles stalking the turtle," one of the tourists told local media. "But we didn't want to just stand there and watch as it was killed. We knew we had to do something."

Despite the danger, incidents like this are not uncommon in Africa, where large predators such as crocodiles and lions are known to hunt turtles for food. However, tourists who witness such events are often able to intervene and help save the animal's life thanks to their quick thinking and bravery.
