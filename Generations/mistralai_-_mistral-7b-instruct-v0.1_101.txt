 to an article by Jenny Hope for Daily Mail, there is a new non-surgical treatment available called the "fat-eater" therapy that can help people say goodbye to double chins. This treatment involves using radiofrequency and ultrasound technology to melt away excess fat in the chin area, leading to a more defined jawline.

The article states that the treatment works by heating up the fat cells in the chin area until they are broken down and eliminated from the body. The procedure takes about an hour and is said to be painless. It also notes that some clinics offer a combination of radiofrequency and ultrasound treatments for better results.

However, the article does caution that the treatment may not work for everyone and that it can be expensive. It also advises people to do their research before undergoing any cosmetic procedure.

Overall, the "fat-eater" therapy may offer a non-surgical alternative to traditional methods of reducing double chins. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any decisions about this or any other cosmetic treatment.
