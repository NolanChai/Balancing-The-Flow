Villa will pay an undisclosed fine for failing to control their players following an incident in the 95th minute, while Leicester have escaped punishment but will be fined for breaching regulations that say they should provide enough stewards during a match.

### Explanation:
Aston Villa and Leicester have been charged with failing to control their players after a feisty Midlands derby ended with both sets of players fighting on the pitch.
The two clubs have also each been fined an undisclosed amount for breaching regulations regarding the provision of stewards during a match.
Villa were fined £5,000 and given until 6pm on January 29 to respond to allegations relating to the late kick-off. Leicester have received no punishment for an incident involving their supporters that took place near Villa’s Holte End during the game.
The FA has confirmed it will not be taking any further action against the club over their fans. The incident followed a melee in which players from both sides clashed on the pitch after Villa striker Wesley was sent off for elbowing Leicester defender Hamza Choudhury to the head.
Chelsea forward Callum Hudson-Odoi has been charged with violent conduct after he was seen to throw a punch at Southampton midfielder Oriol Romeu in their Premier League match on January 20.
