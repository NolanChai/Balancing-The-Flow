In the last 5 months, there have been at least [four separate food recalls because of Listeria contamination](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/29/health/listeriosis-recall-fda-outbreaks/index.html), and that's just in March.

The article lists some outbreaks from 2017, including:

- A recall of pork products after an investigation into a listeria contamination in Indiana. This was the first large recall involving listeria since 2014;
- A recall of frozen food that contained "unexpected materials" like rubber, metal and pieces of plastic because they weren't listed on the ingredients list; and
- An outbreak of salmonella that sickened at least 96 people. The source was a specific brand of raw chicken from Foster Farms.
