Nicolas Sarkozy is not the first politician who has been involved in a scandal. He is also not the last one. These cases are a sign that corruption and bribery can be found everywhere, even among the most honest politicians. If you want to fight against corruption, it’s better to take action before your opponent wins an election or becomes the president of a country.
Corruption is a serious problem in many countries and there are several ways how people try to fight this issue: through education, by introducing new laws etc., but all these methods have their limitations too: some people will always find loopholes in those rules, while others will simply ignore them completely… So what should we do? Firstly, it’s important not only to educate people about the consequences of corruption but also explain why they shouldn’t engage in such activities themselves – especially if they have already been caught red-handed! Secondly, we should make sure that our laws are clear enough so that everyone understands them and knows what kind of punishments await those who break them.
