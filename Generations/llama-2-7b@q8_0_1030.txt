I am not sure that it is necessary for all of England to be playing like Liverpool. That said, there is an argument to be made in favour of England using a bit more attacking football, but I think we need to focus on our midfield and attack first (a topic for another time), and then move towards playing with the full backs higher up the pitch as well.
