 According to a report released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC reported that the national teen birth rate fell 10 percent between 2006 and 2011. The decline was particularly sharp in states with higher rates of education and lower poverty levels, such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island.

The report also found that the decline in teen births was driven largely by a decrease in unintended pregnancies. About 60 percent of teen pregnancies were unplanned, compared to 52 percent for older women aged 18 to 44.

Teen pregnancy rates are highest among Hispanic and African American girls, particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods. However, the decline in teen births has been most pronounced among non-Hispanic white girls.

The decline in teen births has been attributed to a combination of factors, including increased access to contraception, improved sex education programs, and greater social support for young parents. However, some experts warn that the decline could reverse if these factors are not sustained.

"We need to keep up our efforts to provide teens with access to accurate information about their health and options," said Dr. Judith Vesperman, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego who led the study. "We also need to ensure that teenagers have access to affordable contraception."

In addition to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island, other states with declines in teen birth rates include Minnesota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Ohio. The report did not provide specific reasons for these declines, but said that they were likely driven by a combination of factors such as education, poverty, and access to healthcare.
