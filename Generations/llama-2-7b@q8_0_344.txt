#### Luke Shaw 

Its a long road to recovery, but he's already back in the gym which is great news. It was also good that England were able to get him out of Brazil quickly as it meant he could be seen by experts back at home instead of being forced to fly for an unrelated procedure and then wait two weeks until he sees someone else again.

There's no doubt about his ability or character though, so I think he'll come through this even stronger than before.
