 of their summer holiday before it's too late.

Scientists say that people tend to be happier in September as they enjoy the final weeks of warm weather without the pressures of work or school looming over them.

In contrast, January is widely considered the most stressful month, with many facing financial difficulties and struggling to cope with the winter blues.

To help Brits make the most of their last chance to relax before the busy autumn and winter months, researchers have come up with a list of things people can do to reduce stress levels and improve their mood.

Firstly, they suggest taking time outdoors to enjoy the remaining sunshine and fresh air, whether it's going for a walk in the park or a beach day.

They also recommend spending time with friends and family, as social connections are key to reducing stress levels and improving overall wellbeing.

Other ideas include practicing mindfulness, such as meditation or yoga, which can help people stay focused and calm in even the most challenging situations.

Finally, researchers suggest setting aside some time for hobbies and interests that bring joy and relaxation, whether it's reading, painting, or playing music.

So if you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, take a break and make the most of September â€“ it's the perfect opportunity to unwind and enjoy life before things get too busy again.
