A former policeman who became a feared cartel boss has been arrested on suspicion of killing thousands of people as part of his work for the Mexican drug trade.

Jesus "El Rey" Reyna, 42, was detained by authorities in Mexico City after two years on the run.

Reyna was once a member of the Federal Preventive Police and is now accused of working for the Zetas cartel, one of the most violent drug gangs in Mexico.
