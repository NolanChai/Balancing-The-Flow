Allen Sheinman, 58, who works in the technology industry and lives in Brooklyn, met his wife, Debra Goldman, online through JDate.com seven years ago when she was living in St Louis. He says they had their first date on a Friday night at a restaurant in New York, and he knew pretty quickly that there was something special about her. "I just fell for her immediately," he recalls. Sheinman describes Goldman as "very attractive with dark hair and beautiful eyes" â€“ the sort of woman who might be described by her friends as "a real catch".
