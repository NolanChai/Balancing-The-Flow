Vidal was a key figure for Juventus in their domestic success, helping them to six consecutive Serie A titles and three Coppa Italia wins since joining from Bayern Munich.

However, he suffered an unfortunate injury that forced him out of action at the tail end of last season as they chased European glory.

The Chilean midfielder was unable to play any part in their UEFA Super Cup win over Real Madrid or in their subsequent 2017-18 Champions League campaign, although he did appear briefly against the same opposition in their 2017 FIFA Club World Cup triumph.

Vidal missed out on a place in Chile's World Cup squad and was subsequently linked with a move to Barcelona before eventually joining Inter Milan this summer for Â£20.5million.

He has made four appearances so far but is yet to make his mark for the Nerazzurri, who currently sit fifth in Serie A ahead of Wednesday's clash against Chievo.

Vidal was speaking to DAZN after the game and said that he had been forced to pull out of a Juventus match just three days before their Super Cup win over Madrid due to the knee injury, which would eventually rule him out for the season.

He is yet to score or assist in his new club but Vidal feels it will take time for him and the rest of the team to get used to each other.

"We need some time," he said. "This team has not had a lot of continuity because they have brought many players, while I have only been here three months."

Vidal also admitted that it was tough to play against his former club and that his injury would make him feel somewhat vulnerable against Milan's Dario Donnarumma.

"I played with them for five years and it is always a challenge to play against them," he said. "But, physically I have the strength and confidence in myself."

He also praised his new manager Luciano Spalletti, who Vidal believes can take Inter Milan on the road to success.

"Spalletti is doing well," he said. "In my three months here, we have been training very hard but it will be important for him to win the trust of everyone."

Inter currently sit fifth in Serie A with nine points from 10 matches and travel away to Chievo on Wednesday. The match is Vidal's first against the Verona-based club, who are placed 12th in the table.

Vidal will be hoping for a positive result but he will also be working hard not to get injured once more and let his team down.
