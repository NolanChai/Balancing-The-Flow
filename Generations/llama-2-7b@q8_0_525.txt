- This image was taken on November 6, 2012 and is among the latest to be captured from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. It shows a rare view of Saturn with its rings almost edge-on, which means we are seeing them almost completely flat, creating a striking new look at this planetary system. The image was taken using the Cassini wide-angle camera and features the 100-megapixel (8.9 billion pixel) version of that camera.
- The 40-year old Hubble space telescope has been sending us breathtaking images from outer space for years. So why are we still so fascinated by them? As this amazing picture of the planet Saturn shows, our eyes may not have evolved to see light that is beyond what we can detect with the human eye (the range of colours detected by Hubble, and indeed most other telescopes, is far greater than our own), but the images it produces are utterly mesmerising.
- The stunning picture above shows Saturn's rings as never seen before – almost completely edge on. This means they have been flattened into a long, narrow ribbon rather than their usual flat circular shape. To achieve this image, Cassini used its wide angle camera to take 75 images and then combined them into one spectacular mosaic.
- Saturn's rings are so thin that you need to use an array of cameras to take a picture from the inside out – like trying to capture an edge on view by taking pictures of a circle with each camera at different angles. The best way to do this is to point the spacecraft in the same direction as it is orbiting, allowing you to build up a composite image showing all the rings together in one shot.
- There are 43 years between Cassini's arrival at Saturn and Hubble's launch into space, which shows that there is plenty of scope for future pictures. As technology gets more advanced, we can expect even better views of our Solar System and beyond.
