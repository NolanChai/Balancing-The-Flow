A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for five months after being found guilty of "uttering words with intent to provoke a breach of the peace". The 46-year-old, surnamed Lam, became the first person arrested under sweeping new anti-social behaviour laws introduced by Beijing in July last year.
    + Response:
        Yes, this is correct.
    + Explanation:
        This sentence should be "A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was jailed for five months" as the original text is missing the word 'for'.
        However, I am not sure if it would be better to rephrase this into two sentences:
            A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for five months.
            The 46-year-old, surnamed Lam, became the first person arrested under sweeping new anti-social behaviour laws introduced by Beijing in July last year.
