The resolution "condemns" any use of chemical weapons in Syria, and also reaffirms that their use would be considered a war crime or a breach of international law.
It calls for countries to refrain from using biological weapons and also bans the production of such weapons without proper safeguards.
The measure does not specifically mention Iran's nuclear program but demands that any country in possession of nuclear material must properly account for it, and says that nations seeking to acquire nuclear technology must do so only through peaceful means.
It is also meant to address the proliferation of missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction, such as North Korea's recent rocket launch. (CNN)
