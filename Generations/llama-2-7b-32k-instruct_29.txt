 The conservative radio star slammed the Georgetown law student after she gave a speech at the university supporting birth control benefits and defending Sandra Fluke, the law student who made waves earlier this year when she testified in front of Congress on behalf of contraception access. 
  
 In his comments on Wednesday Limbaugh said: "If we're going to be fair, it seems to me that Ms Fluke, and the rest of you feminists, should post the videos on YouTube so we can all watch in real time as they have sex ." 
  
 He also questioned why she would need contraception because "there are plenty of available men who want to have sex with this woman," before suggesting: "Why doesn't Ms Fluke put that energy into an intra-uterine device and not parade it on stage for all of us to look at?" 
  
 The 23-year-old law student, a self described 'feminist' said she was 'not offended' by the comments but wanted people to focus instead on the issue. She also dismissed suggestions that contraception was linked to promiscuity and questioned why there was not more talk about men and how they should protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases. 
  
 "It's really easy for a guy to go home with a condom in his pocket but it takes two people to get pregnant," she said . 
  
 The slur came just hours after Limbaugh announced he was cutting his contract short by four years and apologised to Ms Fluke for calling her a "slut" and a "prostitute" on the radio show."
