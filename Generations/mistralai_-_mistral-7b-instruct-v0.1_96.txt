 They also serve as a celebration of life. The deceased is often referred to as the "father," "mother," or "king" of the community. The funeral typically lasts for several days, with different rituals and traditions taking place on each day. The final day is often the most elaborate, with family members, friends, and community members coming together to pay their respects and celebrate the life of the deceased. It is customary for men to wear black and women to wear white or brightly colored clothing. Music, dancing, and feasting are also an integral part of the festivities.
