### Attempted Solution:
I was hoping to use some of the libraries from the python-panda library but I can't get them to work. So for this project, I will just be reading a file line by line and counting how many times a certain word shows up.

### Challenge:
It should read in a text file that contains words and count how many time each of those words appear.

### Outcome:
The output should be 10, which is the number of instances of "word" in the text file.

### Stuff I Learned:
This was my first foray into Python. I've been dabbling with some other programming languages but this project is the first time that I felt like I really understood what I was doing. I feel pretty good about getting this solution right because of all the research and testing that went on behind the scenes. I also learned a lot more than just how to get this program to work, so for those reasons I am giving it my highest score.
