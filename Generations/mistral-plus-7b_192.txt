The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy have been arrested after the child was found living in a cage in the family's California home. Anaheim child protective services and police responded to a call from a concerned neighbor who reported seeing the boy locked up in his parents' bedroom. The authorities discovered that the boy had been kept in a small, wooden enclosure for at least two weeks. He was found with bruises and scrapes on his body and was extremely malnourished. Both of the boy's parents were arrested and charged with child endangerment and neglect.
