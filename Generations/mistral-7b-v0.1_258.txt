But it isn't just President Obama who's looking to rebuild trust with Americans.  The healthcare.gov website is looking for help too.  And that's why we're here today.

It's been a rough few weeks for the White House, and let me tell you, the site has taken its share of lumps too.  We know some people have had trouble navigating the site to sign up for insurance.  The problems with the site are not due to lack of effort on our part.

When it came time to build healthcare.gov, we didn't just slap together a bunch of code and throw it over the transom.  No, sir.  We had a plan for this.  And that plan was to have our top programmers work long hours in their offices, drinking energy drinks and eating pizza, writing code non-stop until the site was ready.

So you can see that we really did try to get it right, but sometimes things don't go as planned.  We're sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.
