According to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of workers who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more has risen significantly over the past year, reaching its highest level since the Great Recession. The report found that as of last month, there were approximately 1.5 million people who had been jobless for at least 27 weeks, up from about 1.2 million a year ago. This represents an increase of nearly 25% in just 12 months.
