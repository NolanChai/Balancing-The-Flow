> Rafael Nadal won the award in 2018, making him only the fourth Spanish athlete to win it. (It's good that they got this far.) (It's bad that he has not had any awards before)  
> He said after winning his fifth Australian Open title earlier this year, he was the oldest player ever to do so at 31. (He is not too old for tennis) 

Nadal won the award in 2008 and 2010 but lost out to Federer on two occasions. He said after winning his fifth Australian Open title earlier this year, he was the oldest player ever to do so at 31. (He is not too old for tennis)  
He added that while Federer and Novak Djokovic had dominated men's tennis since Nadal won his first French Open in 2005, "I am really happy with what I achieved this year". (I don't like that he is happy to be defeated by other players)   
> The Spaniard added: "I hope for more years of success and a lot more good things." (It sounds like he has been successful in the past)  
> Nadal's mother, Ana MarÃ­a Parera, died last month. (This is sad that his mom passed away.)
