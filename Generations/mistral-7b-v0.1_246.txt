The no-retreat statute, which is found at Fla. Stat. § 776.013(3), allows individuals to use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another. This law has been widely criticized as creating a “shoot first” mentality among gun-wielding Floridians, and has caused the Florida Supreme Court to declare the statute unconstitutional on multiple occasions. The United States Supreme Court has not yet weighed in.
