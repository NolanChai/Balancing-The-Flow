In Portland, the city attorney and his wife are fighting over how much they spend on their dog.  The wife wants to buy a new car for it; she has spent $120,000 on grooming for the dog in the last year alone.  Meanwhile, the husband says he would like a second home but is unwilling to get one until the wife stops spending so much money on the dog.
