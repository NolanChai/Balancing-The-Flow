The House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has appointed Representative Andr√© Carson (D-Ind.) to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, making him the first Muslim member ever to serve on the committee. Rep. Carson will join the committee as a senior Democrat, alongside five other Democrats and seven Republicans.

Rep. Carson's appointment comes in response to criticism from conservatives and some Republicans that he does not have sufficient experience or expertise to serve on such a high-level committee. Pelosi has defended the decision, saying Rep. Carson's background and knowledge of intelligence matters make him well suited for the job. She also emphasized the importance of having a diversity of perspectives represented on the committee.
