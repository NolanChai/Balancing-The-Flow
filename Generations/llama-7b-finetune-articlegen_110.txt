A 31 year old man has been charged with theft of a car and driving while disqualified after allegedly stealing an Audi A4 in Sydney's south-west this morning and hitting several cars at a busy intersection.

The alleged thief was seen to smash his way into a locked garage on Gymea Bay Road, Bexley South, shortly before 7am (AEST) before driving off with the owner's Audi. He then drove down Anzac Parade towards Moore Park where he allegedly collided with two stationary cars at a traffic light near Wentworth Avenue and crashed through a zebra crossing into a car park, police said in a statement.
No-one was injured during the crash but several pedestrians were struck by flying debris from the vehicles as they crossed the intersection. The man was found unconscious in his wrecked vehicle and taken to St George Hospital where he was treated for minor injuries before being arrested, police said. He was later charged with theft of motor vehicle and driving while disqualified and refused bail. Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the crash or may have dash cam footage of the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au . Audi has released a statement saying they are shocked at the news, but the driver was not one of their employees. "We can confirm that this is an isolated and unrelated incident. We take road safety very seriously," the statement read. "Audi takes no responsibility for any damage to cars or injury sustained by people in other vehicles." The garage owner's Audi has been impounded by police. It comes a day after a 25-year-old man was caught stealing $60,000 worth of goods from luxury car dealerships and showrooms across Sydney during the same week. Michael McGuire allegedly stole $11,788 of merchandise from Porsche Centre Sydney on October 15 before taking a Toyota Prius for test drives that he later crashed in Penrith. He was arrested again last Sunday after stealing a BMW X6 worth $49,000 and two Mercedes-Benz GLEs valued at more than $33,000 from Audi Centre Sydney on October 18. The thefts came after an alleged ram raid on Holden Special Vehicles' headquarters in Melbourne earlier this year where a Holden Colorado pickup was stolen. A man and two women have been charged over that incident while another woman is still on the run. Police believe the men were connected to a $3million cash-in-transit robbery at Moorabbin Airport on September 20 where more than 50 police were involved in an operation. A woman, 40, and two men, aged 18 and 21, were charged over the incident but one of the men allegedly fled to New Zealand.
