 It is highly unlikely that people across the entire United Kingdom would have heard roars just because ITV had switched off the sound, as there are many factors affecting sound propagation such as distance, terrain, and weather conditions. However, if a significant event like a natural disaster or a major sporting event caused widespread noise, it could potentially be heard over long distances. But in this case, it seems more likely that you're referring to a broadcast, in which case ITV would not affect the ability to hear sounds from outside sources.
