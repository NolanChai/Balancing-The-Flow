 While buying a boat may be out of reach for some, there are still plenty of affordable ways to enjoy the water. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Renting a kayak or canoe is a great way to explore the rivers and lakes in your area. You can usually rent them by the hour or day, and many places offer guided tours as well.
2. If you're looking for something more adventurous, try stand-up paddleboarding (SUP). It's a fun and relatively easy activity that requires minimal equipment and can be done on a variety of bodies of water.
3. For those who prefer to stay dry, consider going on a river cruise. There are many different types of cruises to choose from, ranging from short day trips to multi-day excursions.
4. Finally, if you have the time and energy, why not try swimming? Many public parks and beaches have designated swimming areas where you can cool off in the water for free. Just remember to follow safety guidelines and never swim alone.
