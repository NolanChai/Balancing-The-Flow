Tina Baldwin was arrested and charged with murder after her 19-year-old daughter was found dead outside a Texas abortion clinic.  Police are investigating the death of Ashley Baldwin, who began working at the clinic when she was just 15 years old.

Police believe that Tina killed Ashley in order to prevent her from continuing work at the clinic and to protect her younger sister from following in her footsteps.  The two women had a tumultuous relationship, with Tina often trying to control and manipulate Ashley.

Tina is currently being held without bail pending trial for first-degree murder.
