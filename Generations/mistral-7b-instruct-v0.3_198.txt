 That's correct. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was sentenced to death for her role in the 1997 murder of her husband in Georgia, USA. The exact date of her execution may vary depending on the results of legal appeals and stays that have been granted. As of my last update, the execution is scheduled to take place between February 25 and March 4, 2015. However, it's important to note that I don't have real-time capabilities, so please verify any information with a reliable source.
