 This phrase is a line from the poem "Recessional" by Rudyard Kipling, written in 1897. The full quote is: "The lights of Asia glow like flames in suspense; The lamps of European ease drop, one by one." It was often used to refer to the beginning of World War I, as it seemed like many countries' lights (or influence) were being extinguished as they entered into conflict. However, in the context you provided, it doesn't directly refer to a specific historical event but is rather a poetic way of describing a dimming or fading of something, such as the lights (or influence) spreading across Europe.
