 to 40 people, including 18 foreign tourists. The blast took place at a popular tourist attraction called Charles Bridge, which is also known as the Charles Bridge Tower.

The cause of the explosion is still being investigated, but witnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing smoke coming from the tower. The tower itself appears to be badly damaged, with debris flying into the air and shattering windows.

Authorities are urging tourists to stay away from the area while the investigation continues. Prague is a popular destination for tourists from around the world, and the explosion has caused disruptions to many flights and travel plans.

The Czech Republic's prime minister, Petr Necas, has condemned the explosion and promised to provide support to those affected by it. "I deeply regret this incident, which happened at one of Prague's most important tourist attractions," he said in a statement. "We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of tourists and residents."

The Charles Bridge Tower is one of the oldest buildings in Prague and is home to several museums and art galleries. It is also a popular spot for sightseeing and events, including concerts and festivals.
