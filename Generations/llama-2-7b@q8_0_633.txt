This is the most idiotic, stupidest response I have ever heard in my life. How can you refuse to rule something out that clearly has no chance of happening? That would be like saying "I won't rule out being able to stop the sun from rising." Of course he's not going to say that because it makes him sound idiotic and stupid, but if Boehner wants to look dumb, this is how you do it.
