5-year-old twin girls were found unconscious inside their Kent, Washington home early Saturday morning by a family member who came over for a visit, according to the King County Sheriff's Office. The family member called 911 after seeing what appeared to be cut marks on the children's throats, the sheriff's office said in an incident report obtained by CNN affiliate KOMO-TV.

The girls were taken to a hospital where they were treated for injuries to their necks and are expected to survive, authorities said.

Authorities arrested 21-year-old Shanette Omar Roberts of Kent on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. She's being held in the King County Jail without bail and will next appear in court December 17, according to jail records.

Roberts didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. It was unclear if she had an attorney who could speak on her behalf.

"We take these types of crimes incredibly seriously," said King County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kedzie Patterson. "We believe the children are safe now and we have arrested a suspect."

The sheriff's office received an initial report that the girls were found unresponsive and "with signs of trauma" at around 8:45 a.m., but had to wait until after midnight Saturday morning before they could enter the home, according to KOMO-TV. Patterson said investigators believe Roberts lived at the home with the children's father, who wasn't present when deputies arrived and hasn't been arrested or charged in connection of the incident.

Patterson said she did not yet know a motive for the alleged crime and would not speculate on how long authorities had been aware Roberts might be a threat to her children.

"We are going back as far as we can, trying to figure out who is responsible," Patterson told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV."We're trying to find out if this person has any history of mental health or criminal issues in the past so we can understand what led up to this. "

The sheriff's office said it was conducting an investigation into whether other children were involved, but did not say how many. The girls are twins and authorities would not disclose their names.

Roberts had been released from the jail in April after being charged with assault on a child and felony domestic violence, according to CNN affiliate KCPQ-TV. Her trial was scheduled for January 7, court records show.

In that case, Roberts was accused of hitting her daughter's head against a wall multiple times while the girl sat in a stroller, police said. The child had injuries on her face and head, according to court documents.

Authorities are not yet clear whether Roberts intended to kill her daughters or simply hurt them. The sheriff's office said it was looking into whether she has any mental health history that could have played a role in the incident, KOMO-TV reported. 

"This is an isolated incident, this person hasn't been previously arrested for similar types of crimes," Patterson told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. "We do not know if there are other people that may be involved."

Authorities did not specify how much time had passed between the incident and when Roberts was arrested at midnight Saturday morning.

Roberts has been held in the King County Jail without bail since her arrest, according to jail records. She's next scheduled to appear in court on December 17 for a hearing. It's unclear if she has an attorney who can speak on her behalf at this time.

"We take these types of crimes incredibly seriously," said Kedzie Patterson, King County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman, to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. "We believe the children are safe now and we have arrested a suspect." 

This is an ongoing investigation and more details will be released as they become available, authorities said. The sheriff's office did not specify whether it had any motive for arresting Roberts or how much time had passed between the incident and when she was arrested at midnight Saturday morning. 

This story will be updated with further information.
