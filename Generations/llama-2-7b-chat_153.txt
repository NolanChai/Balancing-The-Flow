Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be in a 'state of incomprehension' today after being accused of accepting large sums of money from the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The former French president has denied any wrongdoing and has claimed that he was unaware of the source of the funds he received during his 2007-2012 presidency. Sarkozy's lawyers have also released a statement denying the allegations, saying that their client had 'no knowledge of any illegal activities' and that he was 'completely innocent'. Despite this, the investigation into Sarkozy's financial dealings with Gaddafi's regime continues, with prosecutors reportedly looking into several other high-profile figures in addition to the former president.
