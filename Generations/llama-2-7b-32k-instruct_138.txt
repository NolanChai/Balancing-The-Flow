In 2018, a 3-month-old infant named Harper passed away at her daycare center while the staff member was giving her a nap in an unsuitable room with no cameras. The family's legal representative has revealed that they had spoken to numerous other families about sleeping difficulties and that Harper wasn't the only baby who died or got injured as a result of these conditions.
