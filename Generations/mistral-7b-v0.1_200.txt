The article does not give any background about who wrote the book. The author also makes no mention as to what the new information is that the book contains. This leads me to believe that this article is biased towards John Edwards and the Democratic party, due to the lack of context given. I also feel that the article is trying to manipulate the audience's view on John Edwards by saying he was a cold calculating person who did not care about his marriage or daughter.
