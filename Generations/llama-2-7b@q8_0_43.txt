> There was a time when we had a guy called Matt Prior, who played cricket for England at Test level. And there were times where he couldn’t play against Australia because of his batting. He used to go through periods where he would have a couple of 30s and 40s and then it would all go to shit again. I was the same with my cricket, where I had two or three games when I felt like a genius and then the next few were just rubbish.

> I think the difference between England and Australia when you talk about their team spirit is that I think England have a very close group and they are all very, very good friends. I think it’s important to be good friends with your mates.

> When I look back at my career as a whole I see someone who was always on the move, always busy, never really happy in one place. But now that I know how lucky I have been – I want more of it!
