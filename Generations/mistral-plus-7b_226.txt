These are the "Ghost" killer thugs pumped up on steroids who are proving key to keeping Syria's brutal President Bashar Assad in power. Covered in tattoos of images of their leader, they have been recruited from poor urban areas and rural towns across the country to act as a ruthless army of enforcers for the regime.

The Shabiha are believed to be responsible for some of the most horrific acts of violence committed by government forces against civilians during the ongoing civil war in Syria. They have been accused of killings, torture and kidnappings. Some reports suggest they even carry out targeted assassinations and disappearances.
