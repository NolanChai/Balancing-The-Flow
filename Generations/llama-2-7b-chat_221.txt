The South Korean family of the 2013 X Factor Australia winner, Dami Im, made headlines earlier this year when they successfully crossed the restricted North Korean border. The daring feat was captured on camera, showing the family navigating through dangerous terrain and narrowly avoiding detection by North Korean soldiers. Despite the risks involved, the family remained determined to reach their destination, where they hoped to find a better life for themselves and their loved ones.
