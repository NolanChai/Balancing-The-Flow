 The organism you're referring to is likely a tube worm (Alvinella pompejana), which was discovered during the Alvin expedition in 1977 at a hydrothermal vent site called the Guaymas Basin in the Pacific Ocean. These tube worms are indeed fascinating creatures that thrive in extreme environments, surviving off the chemicals released by the hot vents rather than sunlight. However, it's important to note that while they may seem alien-like, they are still Earthly organisms.

NASA's involvement in this discovery is somewhat indirect. The study of these tube worms and other hydrothermal vent life forms has been instrumental in understanding the potential for life on other planets with similar extreme environments, such as those found on Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa. So while these organisms may not be aliens themselves, they provide valuable insights into the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.
