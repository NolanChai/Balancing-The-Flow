A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by her own appearance. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, began to put on weight after the birth of her first child, and by the time she reached her heaviest point in February this year, she weighed 270lbs.

But after being sickened by her own reflection in the mirror, she made a drastic lifestyle change. She joined a local gym, cut out all processed foods and sugary drinks, and started to exercise six days a week.

Over the past six months, she has lost an incredible 140lbs, bringing her down to a healthy weight of 130lbs. And now, as she prepares for Christmas, she feels confident in her own skin again.

“I was horrified when I looked at myself,” the woman said. “But I realized that I couldn’t continue living like this. I had to make a change if I wanted to be happy and healthy.”

The mother-of-two credits her success to a combination of hard work, dedication and support from her family. She also says that joining a gym was a game changer for her.

“I’ve been going to the gym for about five months now and it has made such a huge difference,” she said. “Not only have I lost weight, but I feel so much stronger and more confident.”

The woman says she still struggles with cravings for unhealthy foods, but she knows that she can’t give in to them if she wants to keep her new body.

“It’s not easy, but I know that I have to be disciplined if I want to maintain my weight and my health,” she said.

Despite the challenges she has faced, the woman says she is proud of what she has achieved and feels more confident than ever before.

“I used to feel like a failure because of my weight, but now I know that I can do anything I set my mind to,” she said. “And that’s what makes me so happy.”
