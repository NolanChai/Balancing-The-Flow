I thought the idea of a leopard frog was pretty good. I liked that they used Nigel's recipes and made them more suitable for amphibian consumption, but this recipe seems too complicated to me. Why not just make it easier like the rest of the cookbooks? Also, it seemed rather difficult to read. It would be a lot simpler if it were written in normal text with paragraph breaks and all that.
