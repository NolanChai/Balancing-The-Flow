The reality-based show "Rob Ford: What's My Line?" was set to air on the Toronto-based network CityTV but was quickly pulled from its lineup following intense media scrutiny of the Toronto mayor's antics. The show, which followed Rob Ford around as he went about his duties as a public official, included scenes in which he is seen drinking and smoking marijuana.

The cancellation of "Rob Ford: What's My Line?" comes after the Toronto city council voted to strip Ford of much of his power, including the ability to hire or fire senior staffers, and his ability to control the budget of the mayor's office. The move came after a series of scandals involving Ford, including a video that appears to show him smoking crack cocaine, allegations of drunk driving, and an ongoing conflict with Toronto police over alleged illegal activities by the mayor.
