 r a homophobic slur made by the show's host, Buddy Valastro, during an appearance on Fox News.

The controversy began when Valastro was asked about his thoughts on same-sex marriage during an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly. Valastro responded by saying that he did not agree with same-sex marriage because it "goes against everything God has put on this earth." He also used a homophobic slur in the process.

The comments sparked outrage from LGBTQ+ activists and viewers of Cake Boss, leading to an outpouring of complaints to TLC. In response, the network announced that it would not be airing an episode featuring Valastro on Cake Boss that was scheduled to air next week.

"We are deeply sorry that Buddy Valastro's comments on Fox News did not reflect our values or those of our viewers," said TLC in a statement. "We understand the impact his words have had and we take this very seriously."

Valastro has since issued an apology for his remarks, saying that he did not mean to offend anyone and that he regrets what he said. However, some are calling for Valastro to be removed from Cake Boss altogether, arguing that his views are incompatible with the show's message of inclusivity and diversity.

TLC has not yet indicated whether or not Valastro will be returning to the show in the future.
