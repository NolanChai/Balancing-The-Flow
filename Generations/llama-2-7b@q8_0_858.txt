I am sorry that I don’t have a better answer for you but I believe this was done to keep students from “gaming” the system (e.g., enrolling in a few classes but doing very little work) which would result in poor performance. So, if it is true that students are not getting the full benefit of their tuition dollars then maybe they are actually receiving more than the amount of education they’re paying for.
