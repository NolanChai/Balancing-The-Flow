Robert Carroll, a drugs squad officer from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, became hooked on heroin after posing as an addict for undercover operations. He would inhale the drug by smoking it or snorting it up his nose and began using it during the course of his work. Eventually he was taking up to Â£20 worth of the drug a day and even used it while on duty. His addiction led him into debt, which he tried to cover by stealing money from police station funds. He was eventually caught and sentenced to 2 years in prison for fraud.
