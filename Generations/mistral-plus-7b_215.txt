Chron's Disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It affects mainly young adults between the ages of 15-30, and its prevalence has been increasing in recent years. The exact cause of Chron's disease is unknown but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

Studies have shown that the number of people with Chron's disease has increased threefold over the past decade. This increase could be due to a variety of factors, including an increase in awareness and diagnosis, an increase in stress levels, and an increase in exposure to food allergens and environmental pollutants. Regardless of the cause, it is important for those with Chron's disease to seek medical attention and treatment as soon as possible.
