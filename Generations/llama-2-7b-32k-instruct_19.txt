The killing came days after Blaylock was honored by the Houston Medical Association for his work in a mobile clinic in Honduras, according to a news release from the association's website .  
"This is a very sad day for all of us at the HMA," association president Dr. Daniel Kajun said in the statement . "Dr. Blaylock was an outstanding doctor and person."  
According to the Harris County medical examiner, Blaylock died at 12:45 p.m. Saturday. A man identified as George Blaylock of Richmond, Texas, had been charged with murder in connection with his death.  
The sheriff's office said Blaylock was "a well - loved and respected member of the medical community."  
"He spent many years serving this county through his medical practice," said Lt. Scott Bolton, a spokesman for the sheriff's office .  
Blaylock had practiced medicine at his clinic in nearby Bellville since 1973 and was also affiliated with CHI St. Luke's Health System in Bryan-College Station, about 20 miles away from Richmond, Texas, according to the medical association news release .  
His practice treated "all ages" and specialized in pediatrics, internal medicine, endocrinology and diabetes care, said Dr. Chandra M. Wilson, Blaylock's longtime friend and business partner at Blaylock Medical Clinic in Richmond.  
Wilson told CNN that she was "totally shocked" by the news . She has worked with Dr. George Blaylock since 1987.
"He was such a great doctor, he always had a smile on his face," said Wilson.   
Blaylock's wife of more than three decades, Joyce Blaylock, told CNN that she and her husband were at home when they heard a knock at the door .  
Joyce Blaylock told CNN affiliate KHOU the incident was "very scary" because the suspects did not identify themselves.
She said Dr. George Blaylock was shot through the back as he was trying to run away from them, and that it happened in a matter of seconds .   
Joyce Blaylock told CNN affiliate KHOU, "I would like for everyone who has anything to do with this to be caught."  
The sheriff's office did not have an updated count Monday on how many suspects remained at large.
"There is a description of them," said Lt. Scott Bolton, spokesman for the sheriff's office . "We are following up on any leads that we can find."  
The motive behind the shooting was not immediately known, but authorities did not believe Blaylock was targeted because he was a doctor, Bolton said Monday .   
According to the medical association news release, Blaylock had worked in Richmond since 1973 and received his medical degree from Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1968.  
His practice also treated children with special health care needs, diabetes management, thyroid disorders, adrenal gland dysfunction, autoimmune diseases, pediatric cancer, blood disorders and immunodeficiency .
