I have created a python script using the openCV library to detect vehicles in a video. The script is able to successfully detect vehicles in the video, however it has difficulty with low-contrast areas. In this instance, the vehicle was difficult to detect due to the low contrast between the white car and the background of the tunnel.

### Video:

### Code:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')

# Initialize some variables
frame_width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
frame_height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
output_video = cv2.VideoWriter('output.mp4', fourcc, fps, (frame_width, frame_height))

# Define the color of the vehicle to detect
blue_lower = np.array([100, 50, 50])
blue_upper = np.array([123, 255, 255])

# Initialize some variables
left_lane_found = False
right_lane_found = False
count = 0
while True:
    # Read a frame from the video file
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Convert the frame to grayscale and blur it
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    gray = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (3, 3), 0)

    # Create a binary image using Otsu's thresholding method
    ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

    # Find the contours in the binary image
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # Iterate through each contour and check if it's a vehicle
    for cnt in contours:
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(cnt)
        area = w * h
        if area > 100 and area < 5000:
            # Draw a rectangle around the vehicle
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        else:
            continue

    # Write the frame to the output video file
    output_video.write(frame)

    # Show the frame with the detected vehicle
    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)

    # Check for ESC key press
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the video capture and close all windows
cap.release()
output_video.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
