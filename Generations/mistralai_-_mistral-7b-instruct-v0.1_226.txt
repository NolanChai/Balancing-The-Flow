 the powerful Syrian warlord Hezbollah, they operate as an elite military force within the government, known as the "Shabeeha" (thugs). They are feared and respected for their brutal tactics, including torture, executions, and kidnappings.

The Shabeeha are estimated to number in the thousands and are believed to be well-armed with modern weapons and vehicles, thanks to support from Iran and Russia. They also have access to a large cache of chemical weapons, which have been used by the Syrian government in its brutal crackdown on opposition forces.

The Shabeeha are often blamed for human rights abuses in Syria, including the disappearance of activists, journalists, and opposition figures. The government has denied any involvement in these crimes, but reports from human rights organizations and opposition groups suggest otherwise.

Despite growing international condemnation of Assad's regime, the Shabeeha remain a powerful force in Syria and continue to support the government's efforts to maintain control.
