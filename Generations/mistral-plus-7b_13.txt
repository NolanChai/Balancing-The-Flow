Red Bull’s Formula One trophies were stolen during a daring smash-and-grab raid on the team’s headquarters in Milton Keynes, England on Friday night. The thieves made off with three World Championship trophies and six Constructors’ Trophies worth an estimated £150,000.

The burglary occurred shortly after midnight when four masked men broke into Red Bull’s headquarters in Milton Keynes. They smashed their way through the glass doors of the building, causing considerable damage to the property. Once inside, they made straight for the trophy cabinet and stole the trophies before making a clean getaway.

The team has reported the incident to the police and are cooperating with the investigation. Red Bull is offering a reward for any information that leads to the recovery of the stolen trophies.
