The investigation was prompted by complaints that the owner, a well-known animal trainer and author, had been using Obie as part of a fundraising campaign for her pet weight loss program. According to the complainants, the owner had been making false statements about Obie's weight loss progress in order to encourage donations to her program. The Attorney General's Office has stated that it is investigating whether the owner violated Oregon's consumer protection laws by making misleading claims about Obie's weight loss.
