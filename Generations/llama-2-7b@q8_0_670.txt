1. By using the given list of numbers we can calculate each number in the sequence using modulus.
2. We know that the next number is 4375 - 5000 = -625. Because the list has a start value (4375) and an end value (14650).
3. Therefore, if we take away 625 from the next number in sequence it will give us 375, which is then added to our result by using modulus.
4. Then, once this has been done for all numbers in the list we have the sequence: 1000, -225, -500, 195, 265, 300 and finally 375.
