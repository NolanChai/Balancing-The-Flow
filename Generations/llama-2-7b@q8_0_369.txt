*I think the question here is why would there be so much light from the impact? I believe it has to do with the surface of the meteoroid. I don’t have any references handy right now but I remember that the meteors are made up primarily of rock and iron, which will heat up when they hit Earth’s atmosphere because of friction with the surrounding air.*

### Answer:
*I believe the reason for so much light from an asteroid explosion in earth's atmosphere is related to the fact that a meteoroid has a very high density. If the object is traveling fast enough and collides with earth, it can burn up quite quickly.*
