 The Mona Lisa's sparse treatment of eyebrows and absence of eyelashes is a result of artistic choices made by Leonardo da Vinci during the painting's creation in the early 16th century. Da Vinci was known for his meticulous attention to detail, yet he chose to leave the subject's brows subtle and her eyes largely devoid of eyelashes. This minimalist approach is consistent with the overall softness and enigmatic quality that makes the Mona Lisa one of the most famous and analyzed paintings in history. The painting's subtle details have fueled much speculation over the years, contributing to its enduring allure.
