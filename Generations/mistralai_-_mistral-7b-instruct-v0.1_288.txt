 The president's announcement comes a day after the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) reported that more than 47,000 Egyptians had fled to Tunisia since the beginning of the conflict in Libya. The Obama administration has previously expressed support for the international community's response to the crisis, and on Wednesday announced $23 million in additional aid to the region.

"The United States will continue to do everything we can to support our Egyptian and Libyan partners through this difficult time," Obama said in a statement released by the White House. "We are committed to working with our international allies to help bring stability and security to the region."

In addition to providing aid, the U.S. has also been working closely with Egypt's government to address the situation in Libya. On Wednesday, Obama spoke with Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to discuss the refugee crisis and other regional issues.

The Tunisian government has welcomed the refugees, but has expressed concern about their ability to support them. The UNHCR has called on the international community to provide more aid to help meet the needs of the refugees.
