Lassana Diarra, the former Chelsea midfielder, has agreed a three-year deal worth £10million to join QPR. Diarra, who turned down the chance of returning to Stamford Bridge last month, will be unveiled at Loftus Road on Monday morning and will travel with the club to South Africa later this week for the start of their pre-season training camp. The 27-year-old is due to arrive in London today, after a medical was completed successfully overseas. Diarra's move comes as QPR close in on deals for England winger Ryan Bertrand and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who have both agreed personal terms with the west London club and will travel to South Africa for talks next week. The 24-year-old Bertrand has told his bosses at Chelsea he wants to leave after they blocked a proposed move to Aston Villa last summer, while Drogba's agent claimed on Friday that the former Marseille and Milan striker was close to signing a one-year deal with Rangers. Lofty ambitions: QPR are hopeful Lassana Diarra can help them push for promotion . However, Rangers are refusing to confirm any new deals until Bertrand's current contract expires at the end of the month and there is no rush on Drogba, who wants a two-year deal. Manager Mark Hughes has already made his first signings of the summer with the £2million capture of Welsh international defender Neil Taylor from Swansea and the loan signing of Tottenham winger Andros Townsend for a further 12 months after a successful spell at White Hart Lane last season. QPR have also added England Under-20 midfielder Jack Cork on a free transfer following his release by Southampton, while young striker Tommie Hoban is the club's third signing of pre-season after moving from Arsenal. Diarra is likely to be unveiled at Loftus Road in the next few days and will then join up with England Under 21 players Benik Afobe (Arsenal), Connor Wickham (Sunderland) and Tom Ince (Blackpool), as they prepare for two games against Portugal this week. The trio are on England duty until tomorrow, when they leave the country to resume their club careers ahead of a busy season with QPR. Diarra is expected to link up with his team-mates in South Africa after undergoing a medical abroad and signing his new deal. 'I've been working really hard during pre-season for my chance to be given this opportunity,' the player said on Friday night. 'I am ready now - I just want to prove myself. It was difficult to go through last year but it has made me stronger, more mature and hopefully that will make a difference.' Rangers have also been boosted by the news that defender Danny Simpson could be available in August after he failed to secure a move away from Newcastle. The 25-year-old right-back is out of contract at St James' Park this summer but manager Alan Pardew wants him back, although it seems unlikely the player will sign new terms and he would likely have to take a pay cut to stay on Tyneside. However, QPR are hopeful Rangers could be offered Simpson with Pardew keen to trim his squad ahead of next season. The former Leeds defender is one of several players who failed to agree a move away during the January window and has been made available for transfer this summer. QPR manager Hughes is also hoping to land midfielder Jermaine Jenas on a free transfer after the former England international was released by Nottingham Forest at the end of his two-year deal with the Championship club. Rangers are hopeful Lassana Diarra can help them push for promotion . The 32-year-old spent last season in Spain with Real Zaragoza and he has been training with QPR during pre-season while considering his options. But it's understood Hughes is looking to sign the veteran midfielder on a one-year contract as he looks for some experience in his squad, who will be aiming for promotion next season. Jenas was signed by Forest boss Steve Cotterill after impressing during a loan spell at Derby last term. In other news from Loftus Road, QPR have agreed to take goalkeeper Ben Hamer on trial after he was released by Reading . The 25-year-old has already been training with the Championship club and he will now link up with Rangers ahead of their trip to South Africa next week. It is understood Hughes would like to bring in two more goalkeepers before the start of the new season, although he could also move for another striker after losing out on the loan signing of Benik Afobe from Arsenal this month. 'Ben has been a good addition,' said Hughes. 'He has had an unfortunate injury but he is still in that age bracket where there will be lots of interest and I would like to keep him here for as long as possible.' QPR have been linked with a number of players this summer including striker Danny Graham, who is currently at Blackburn. But the Championship club are believed to have had one bid rejected by Rovers for the England Under 21 international, although they will return with an improved offer after making a £500,000 bid last week. Hughes has already made his first signings of pre-season and added young winger Andros Townsend (left) to his squad on loan . QPR are also hopeful of signing England Under-21 midfielder Jack Cork after he left Southampton this summer following their promotion to the Premier League. The 23-year-old has penned a three-year deal with Rangers and will be unveiled at Loftus Road next week. 'He is a player that I know well, having worked with him when we were together at Southampton,' said Hughes. 'He is an outstanding talent but one who has been restricted to playing in the Under-21s because of the quality in our first team squad.' Cork was left on the sidelines last term by Mauricio Pochettino as the Argentine boss prioritised signing new players over keeping hold of a number of his existing squad. The 6ft 3ins midfielder scored four goals in 23 appearances for Southampton during their promotion campaign last season and is expected to become Hughes' sixth signing this summer. Rangers are also keen on Fulham winger Damien Duff, who has been told he can leave Craven Cottage after manager Martin Jol indicated he would not be in his plans next term. The 32-year-old was left out of the squad for the majority of last season and will be allowed to move on this summer as part of a clear out by Jol, who is looking to rebuild his side following their Premier League promotion at the end of last season. Duff has been offered to Rangers but the Welshman could also attract interest from other clubs in England, although he would likely only want to play for one team during the next campaign. The winger scored just two goals in 28 appearances last term and is now looking to revive his career after being told he can move on this summer . QPR are hoping Lassana Diarra (left) could be reunited with former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas at White Hart Lane after the French midfielder's proposed £15million move to Spurs collapsed last week. Tottenham are keen on a deal for the 27-year-old following an injury hit season in Italy with AC Milan, but have been put off by the player's wage demands and the fact they believe he is too injury prone. However, Diarra has made it clear to Spurs that he is open to a move back to the Premier League after previously rejecting a move to West Ham last summer. Tottenham are in desperate need of a midfield player with Luka Modric and Jermaine Jenas both looking for moves away this summer, while Aaron Lennon has been offered to Everton and David Bentley is likely to be sold too. Rangers were hopeful they would complete the £15million signing of Diarra last week but a deal collapsed after his agent failed to show up at Spurs' training ground for talks on Friday morning - something which left boss Andre Villas-Boas annoyed and frustrated. But Rangers are still hopeful the move will go through with QPR keen to sign Diarra as soon as possible ahead of their trip to South Africa next week. Spurs are also interested in signing Manchester United's Nani following his move from Old Trafford last month but are prepared to let him leave if they can secure a deal for Diarra, who was formerly on loan at White Hart Lane during the 2008/09 season. However, the Portuguese winger is also wanted by Everton and Arsenal with boss David Moyes and manager Arsene Wenger both keen to take him back to his homeland. QPR are hoping Lassana Diarra could be reunited with former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas at
