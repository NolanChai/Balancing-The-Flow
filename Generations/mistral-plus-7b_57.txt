Jenny Dawson had everything she wanted at age 25 – a successful career as a hedge fund trader, beautiful clothes, luxury holidays, and regular visits to expensive restaurants. However, despite her material comforts, Jenny was not happy. She felt a constant sense of anxiety and stress due to the pressure of her job, and was struggling with depression and burnout.

Jenny decided that it was time for a change. She took a sabbatical from her job and went on a soul-searching journey in order to find out what really made her happy. After several months of travelling and soul-searching, Jenny realized that she wanted to pursue a more meaningful career – one that would allow her to help others and give back to society. She decided to become a social worker and has since found a new sense of purpose and happiness in her life.
