In an attack on the village of Kilambo in December, rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) killed at least 274 people and abducted 100 others, including women and children. In a separate attack last November on the village of Kigumba, FDLR rebels killed at least 48 people and abducted more than 150 others.

The attacks took place in Congo's North Kivu province, which has been plagued by violence since the collapse of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. The rebels are believed to have been responsible for massacres and other atrocities against civilians during that time.

The FDLR is a rebel group composed largely of Hutus who participated in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. They are widely blamed for a series of attacks on civilian populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including the December attack on Kilambo.

In its report, Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to take urgent action to protect civilians from FDLR abuses and to bring those responsible for the killings and abductions to justice. The group also urged the Congolese government to work with international partners to dismantle the rebel group and bring peace to the region.
