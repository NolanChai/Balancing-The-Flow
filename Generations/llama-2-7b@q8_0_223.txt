- By . Margot Pepper . A father has hit back at critics who left racist comments on a picture of him adeptly taking care of his two young daughters. When Los Angeles, California resident Doyin Richards posted the photo online with the caption ‘My princesses’, it was meant to be an empowering snapshot capturing his pride in being a single dad. But the image was soon targeted by racist trolls who slammed his parenting skills and referred to his daughters as his ‘mules’. The 36-year-old entrepreneur, who runs the website Daddy Doin Work, responded to the hate with an equally powerful statement of his own - he shared another photo which shows him on one knee, feeding a hungry baby while holding a toddler on his back. He captioned it: ‘My princesses (one year apart)’. The message has since been liked more than 18,000 times and shared by more than 4,500 people. ‘The first comment that came in was “I’m not racist but …”’ Doyin told The Huffington Post. He went on to explain how he is a black single father who has been the subject of racial discrimination from both black and white women throughout his life, adding: ‘It’s always going to be my truth.’ While it was heartening for him to see his daughters being praised by other parents, he said he is also grateful for the negative comments because they gave him an opportunity to make a powerful point.
