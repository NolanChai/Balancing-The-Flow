The shocking revelation was made in a new book, 'Spying on the Royals', by author John Benson. According to the book, the KGB used a variety of tactics to gather information on the Royal Family, including planting bugs in their homes and following them on their travels. Princess Margaret, who was known to be particularly fond of her privacy, was said to have been particularly targeted by the Soviet spies.
