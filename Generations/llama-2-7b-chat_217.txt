In a statement issued to reporters, Keaton said, "I have known Woody for over 40 years and I can say without hesitation that he is one of the kindest, most caring people I have ever met." She continued, "I stand by my friend and will continue to do so until there is evidence to the contrary. Dylan's allegations are deeply troubling and I believe it is important to listen to all sides of the story before jumping to conclusions."
