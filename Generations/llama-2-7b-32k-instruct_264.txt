The law change is an attempt to protect sexual assault victims from having to endure humiliating questions about their personal lives under questioning by a lawyer for the defense. The current laws make it virtually impossible for rape victims to pursue charges if they are unwilling to undergo what amounts to sexual harassment. This change will allow women to come forward without fear of having to relive horrible experiences in court and have their character attacked.
