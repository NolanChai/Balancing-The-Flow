 Fraser Island, also known as Kangaroo Island, has experienced an increase in dingo attacks on tourists in recent years. The blame for this has been placed on tourists who have been seen taking selfies with the wild dogs and not heeding warnings from park rangers about their behavior. These photos have been shared on social media, contributing to a growing problem.

Dingoes are known to be territorial animals and can become aggressive when they perceive humans as a threat. Tourists who approach the dingoes or try to take selfies with them may be putting themselves and others in danger. The Australian government has warned tourists not to approach wild animals and to respect their space.

In addition to the dingo attacks, Fraser Island has also faced challenges from climate change, which has caused erosion of the sandy beaches. This has led to concerns about the island's sustainability and the impact it may have on the environment and wildlife.
