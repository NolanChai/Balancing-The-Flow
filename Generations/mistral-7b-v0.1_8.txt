This is an article that was published in The Daily Mail Online about an elderly man who died after being struck with a cricket ball. I chose this news story because it deals with a sport related issue and it gives a description of how he was injured as well as what happened to him afterward. The title of the article is “Elderly Pensioner Dies from Cricket Ball Injury” and the author is Jill Reilly. This article can be found at this link:
