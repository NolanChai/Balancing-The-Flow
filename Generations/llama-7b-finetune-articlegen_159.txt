It's the scene of some of the most crucial developments in British history, where RAF commanderes masterminded the defeat of the Nazis during the Battle of Britain.

The RAF Museum in Hendon in north London is a popular tourist attraction and was home to one of only two surviving Spitfires from the historic air battle that lasted six months between July and October 1940. But, sadly, it has been confirmed that the aircraft has now been moved to RAF Colerne in Wiltshire because its wing is 'not safe to fly'. A spokeswoman for the museum said: ‘It was with regret that the RAF Museum Board decided earlier this month to move the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire from the Hendon site.
'The airworthiness of the aircraft is not as good as it once was and therefore it had to be moved. It now resides at Colerne.’ The Spitfire, which flew for the first time in 1936, has been preserved by the RAF since 1973 and has starred in several films including Battle Of Britain, Where Eagles Dare and A Bridge Too Far. The museum spokeswoman added: ‘The Hendon site will be redeveloped into an improved world-class aviation attraction.’ Last month the museum moved two Spitfires and a Hurricane from its Grahame White Hangar because it needed to make way for new galleries. It has not been decided when they will return but the plan is that the exhibition will be completed in 2018. The RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is made up of five aircraft, two Spitfires, one Hurricane and two Lancasters. They are kept at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and RAF Cosford near Wolverhampton.
