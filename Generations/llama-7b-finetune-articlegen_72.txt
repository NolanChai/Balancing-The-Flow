It's an incredible coincidence that my husband Spencer is about to be cast in a new movie playing a man who has been brutally cheated on by his wife. In real life I am, of course, the very opposite of my character. For me, fidelity is paramount. But how can anyone know what's going on inside their marriage? It's like when people say they don't want to have sex with you any more: until it happens, who would believe them?'
