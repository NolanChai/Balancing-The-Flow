ChildLine is receiving an increasing number of calls from children and young people who are worried about the amount of pornography that they see online. The charity has reported a 41% increase in calls and emails about this issue since last year, with more than half of these coming from girls. Children as young as eight are being exposed to hardcore pornographic images on the internet, which can be extremely distressing for them. The fact that so many children feel anxious or worried after seeing pornography is a huge concern and highlights the need for better education about this topic. Itâ€™s essential that parents, teachers and other adults talk to children and young people about safe and healthy online behaviour to help protect them from inappropriate content and the risks associated with it.
