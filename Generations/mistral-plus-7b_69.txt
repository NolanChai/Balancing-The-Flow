When his rescuers found him, Ol Boy was in a state of pain, but they cared for him in his time of need. He was suffering from severe dehydration and starvation and had wounds all over his body. Despite his condition, the kind people who rescued him took the time to give him food, water, and medical attention. They bandaged his wounds and provided comfort as he recovered. It is truly heartwarming to see strangers come together to help an animal in need, especially when it is so obviously suffering.
