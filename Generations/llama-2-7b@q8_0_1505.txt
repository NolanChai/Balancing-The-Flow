The title is a bit misleading; it's about an "oceanographer" finding some ship wrecks that he thinks are linked to a Biblical flood. The story talks of one ship wreck, but not even the oceanographer himself has any idea whether or not these ships were part of the same Biblical flood, so how could the story title be anything other than speculative?
