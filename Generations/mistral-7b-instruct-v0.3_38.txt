 That's correct! On February 25, 2011, a judge in Cleveland, Ohio, affirmed the jury's decision from December 2010, which recommended the death penalty for Anthony Sowell, who was found guilty of murdering 11 women and hiding their bodies in his home. The sentencing hearing had taken place earlier that month. This case is one of the most notorious in Cleveland's history, earning Sowell the nickname "The Cleveland Strangler."
