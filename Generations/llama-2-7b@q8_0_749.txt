<p>This story is about an old newspaper editor who hires two young reporters to work for him. The first day they both come into the office and the boss gives them a stack of papers, tells them to get to it and that he wants one back by noon.</p> <p>The first guy comes in at 10:30 with his paper. It's full of holes, grammatical mistakes and poorly written sentences but the boss is impressed with it none the less.</p> <p>The second guy comes back an hour later with a much more well-written report than the first one and asks how he did? The editor tells him that his writing isn't up to par but that if he works at it, maybe in another year or two, he can write like this too.</p> <p>The second guy gets angry, yells at the boss and storms out. The editor goes back to his office thinking that he made a huge mistake. He asks one of his other reporters about the incident but she says "Well, the first kid was always like that."</p> <p>The next day the same thing happens: 10:30 with an awful story and then 11:45 with another good one.</p> <p>At this point the boss is starting to think he made a terrible mistake. He goes back out and asks his reporter "Did you tell that first guy what I said?" She tells him no, so they go upstairs to the guy's office, where he starts to explain himself.</p> <p>"I told you that your writing needed work but that if you worked hard enough at it, maybe in a year or two you could write like me."</p> <p>The second kid looks at him and says "You don't understand, do you? I already write like this."</p>
