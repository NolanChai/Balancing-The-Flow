In a major blow for football in Herefordshire, Hereford United Football Club has been wound up by the High Court following months of financial difficulties and mounting debts. The winding-up order was granted on Wednesday 19th November 2014 after the club failed to pay its HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) bill.

The decision means that Hereford United will cease to exist as a football club with immediate effect, leaving many fans and players devastated and angry at the way things have unfolded. The club has been struggling financially for some time due to a combination of poor management decisions, lack of investment and rising costs, which ultimately led to their demise.

In light of this devastating news, supporters are now calling for justice and accountability from those responsible for the clubâ€™s decline. Many are demanding that those who were involved in the running of Hereford United be held accountable for their actions and that any money owed by the club should be repaid.
