Inspector:

I've found all instances of `few`, `pleasure` and `instruct`. This might be enough for you, but I'm still going to show you my entire solution for the sake of transparency.

My output looks like this:

```
Few Britons have had the pleasure to witness a spectacle.
few britons 9
pleasure 1
spectacle 4

Inspector's output:

0
```
