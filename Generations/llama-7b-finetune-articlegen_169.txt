A homele$$ man could help unlock the disappearance of schoolgirl Alice Gros$ who vanished after taking a trip to a shop last summer. It is believed Alice, 13, was in trouble with her family when she left their £500-a-month council house and boarded a bus to go shopping on Saturday July 4 . Her disappearance came less than a month before Alice’s mother Nicola, 34, died from breast cancer. On Thursday police said that a homele$$ man who had been arrested over the disappearance of Alice was not bailed and would remain in custody. Detectives also said they have received an ‘important new piece of information’ about her whereabouts – but declined to go into further details . Alice Gros$ is believed to have left her home on Saturday July 4 with her dog to visit a shop at the end of her street before going missing . Det Supt Simon Barraclough, who led the investigation, told BBC Radio Humberside that Alice’s mother Nicola had been diagnosed with breast cancer in March this year and was receiving palliative care when she died. He said: ‘What is evident to me from my enquiries thus far is that there are a number of people close to the family who have an interest in keeping it private for whatever reason.’ He declined to comment on reports that Alice’s grandfather had made threats against police officers during interviews in connection with the investigation. Police believe Alice left her home near the end of her street to visit a shop before going missing . Det Supt Barraclough said: ‘There is also a large number of people close to Nicola’s family who are not being fully open and frank about information which they know or could reasonably be expected to know. The detective added that Alice, from Hessle in East Riding of Yorkshire, may have been out shopping when she disappeared on Saturday July 4 at around 5pm after leaving home with her dog. He said: ‘At this stage we don’t believe there has been a third party involvement or abduction.’ A spokesperson for the police added that officers were conducting extensive enquiries and have appealed to people who may have seen Alice at the end of July to come forward with any information. Officers released an image of Alice, 13, after she went missing on Saturday July 4 . He said: ‘There are still people in the local community who know where Alice is or what has happened to her and we would urge anyone with that information to contact us as soon as possible.’ Alice was reported missing by a relative the following day. Her mother Nicola died in September after being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year . The schoolgirl’s grandfather, 59-year-old James Grossoe, was arrested on suspicion of preventing the reporting of an offence and released without charge. He has been warned he will be re-arrested if police deem it necessary. It is not known when police first became interested in him as part of the investigation. The grandfather’s arrest led to his daughter, Alice’s mother Nicola Grossoe, being questioned under caution by police but she was also later released without charge. Det Supt Simon Barraclough said the family had been ‘supportive and cooperative’ during their inquiries . A spokesman for Humberside Police confirmed that there were now no further active lines of investigation open as part of this inquiry. Alice’s grandfather was arrested on suspicion of preventing the reporting of an offence last month but has been bailed until next year . However, they added: ‘There is a significant number of unanswered questions surrounding her disappearance and we are appealing again for information from people who may have seen her or know anything that could help us find out what happened to Alice.’ Detective Chief Inspector Mick Gradwell said: ‘We’ve been speaking with hundreds of people as part of our inquiries into the disappearance of Alice, but we still need more. We’re now appealing directly to those who were with Alice on Saturday 4 July and anyone else with information they haven’t yet come forward with.’ Last month police arrested a 50-year-old man from Hull under Section 58 of the Serious Crime Act, which prohibits the publication of material likely to identify someone as being involved in the investigation. The man was released without charge and bailed until February next year. Humberside Police previously confirmed that enquiries have not led officers to believe there is any third party involvement or abduction linked to Alice’s disappearance, and said there was no evidence she has gone abroad. A spokesman for the police said: ‘It is now more than eight months since Nicola passed away from cancer in September. Inquiries have been progressing slowly but surely throughout that period of time.’ They confirmed that there are people close to the family who know what happened to Alice and they are appealing again to them for information. The schoolgirl's grandfather was arrested on suspicion of preventing the reporting of an offence and later released without charge . They said: ‘There is still a significant number of unanswered questions surrounding her disappearance and we are appealing again for information from people who may have seen Alice or know anything that could help us find out what happened to her.’ The force said they would be taking steps to further reassure the local community in the area as part of this appeal. It was also revealed earlier this month that detectives had arrested a 49-year-old man from Hull and released him on bail until February next year. They also confirmed that Alice’s grandfather has been bailed to return to police for further questioning in the New Year. Officers have not disclosed whether they think Alice is alive or dead, but said there were no ‘concrete leads’ as to what happened to her. Det Ch Insp Gradwell added: 'I know it's difficult for those close to Nicola to see what has been done and the impact this investigation has had on them over the last eight months. But we need to continue to do all we can to find Alice. If you have any information please come forward as soon as possible.' They also urged anyone with information to call Humberside Police on 101, quoting log 498 of July 5. Alternatively people can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or crimestoppers-uk.org. Police believe Alice is still alive and are urging anyone with information to come forward . The investigation was initially focused on a house in Hessle, which was searched last month, but police said it had moved away from that location. They added that the enquiry is not linked to other missing people’s cases. Last week Alice's grandfather James Grossoe, 59, was arrested after he threatened police officers during his arrest at a house in Hessle. He has been bailed until February next year and told he will be re-arrested if necessary. It is not known whether the threats were linked to an alleged assault on two Humberside Police officers last week. Mr Grossoe is being investigated by his employer, Serco, following a number of unexplained absences from work over recent weeks. A spokesman said: 'Serco takes such matters very seriously and will fully co-operate with the police in their investigation into this matter.' The company provides support for prisoners through community rehabilitation schemes. The schoolgirl, from Hessle near Hull, disappeared while her mother Nicola was dying of breast cancer . Mr Grossoe, who is married to Alice's grandmother, was released after being questioned by police last week but a spokesman for Humberside Police said they are 'still very much in the enquiry'. He also denied that he has ever been convicted of an offence. It is believed that the family were reportedly unable to contact Alice’s grandfather during his arrest and were concerned about their granddaughter. But a spokesman for Humberside Police said: 'The investigation into Alice's disappearance has not yet led officers to believe there are any third party involvement or abduction linked.' He added that they had been in touch with the schoolgirl’s family ‘as much as possible and would continue to support them.’ A source close to the enquiry said: 'There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes. The police have made several arrests but it has not led anywhere so far.' Alice's grandfather was released from custody last week, after being arrested and questioned under caution in connection with the investigation . A spokesman for Humberside Police said: ‘We would like to thank everyone who has assisted our search for Alice and we will continue to appeal for information about her. The enquiry is still ongoing.’ Nicola died from breast cancer last month aged 34 after a three-year battle with the illness, leaving behind her young children and parents. On Friday night detectives said that Alice's grandfather had been bailed until February next year but would be rearrested if necessary. The force also confirmed that he has been arrested for threatening to assault an officer during his arrest last week in Hessle . Det Supt Simon Barraclough, of Humberside Police, said: ‘While there is nothing further I can say at the moment about the ongoing inqu
