I don’t like this article. It is full of unnecessary and unhelpful words such as ‘girlfriend’, ’boyfriend’ and ‘dead’. I feel the content of the story could be improved with the addition of a few more key words like ‘hacking’, ‘suicide’ and ‘JSTOR’ to make it more interesting and useful for me. The fact that her boyfriend is dead doesn’t really need to be mentioned as this makes my blood run cold so I prefer not to dwell on it. I also don’t like the article being in past tense because although he has died, I feel like we should still focus on him and his achievements which is why I think the story could do with a more positive spin.
