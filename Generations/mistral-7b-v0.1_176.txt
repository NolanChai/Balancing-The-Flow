1. Import the necessary libraries for the project and connect to the database.
2. Create a new cursor from the `"orders"` collection.
3. Extract the `orderID`, `shipDate`, and `items` fields for each document in the cursor.
4. For each order item, create a dictionary with the following fields: `"Product ID", "Quantity", "Unit Price"`.
5. Convert the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame.
6. Calculate the total revenue for each month by summing the `"Unit Price"` column and grouping by the `"month"` field.
7. Plot a bar chart of the total monthly revenue using Matplotlib.
8. Save the plot as an image file (e.g., "revenue_by_month.png").
9. Import the required libraries for data analysis and visualization.
10. Load the CSV file containing sales information into a Pandas DataFrame.
11. Calculate the average sale price per month using groupby and agg functions.
12. Plot a line chart of the average sale price over time using Matplotlib.
13. Save the plot as an image file (e.g., "average_sale_price.png").
14. Import required libraries for data analysis and visualization.
15. Load the CSV file containing sales information into a Pandas DataFrame.
16. Extract only the rows where `"Product ID"` equals `"42037"`, representing J.Crew's "Sloan Ankle Boot".
17. Group the data by month and calculate the average sale price for each month using groupby and agg functions.
18. Plot a line chart of the monthly average sale price for the "Sloan Ankle Boot" using Matplotlib.
