Serena Williams was inspired by her older sister, Venus, who made it all the way to the quarterfinals at this year’s Australian Open. The 23-time Grand Slam champion overcame a slow start, falling behind 0-5 in the opening set against Elina Svitolina before coming back to win the match in three sets.

“Venus inspires me every day,” Serena said after her victory. “She’s such a strong woman and such an amazing athlete. She always pushes me to be better, and I want to do everything I can to make her proud.”
