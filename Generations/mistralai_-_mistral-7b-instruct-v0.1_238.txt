 As Mark Duell reports, flooding caused by unusually high water levels on the River Thames is wreaking havoc on properties in some regions. The photographs show damage to homes and businesses, with water seeping through floors and walls, damaging furniture and fixtures.

Surrey, located south of London, has been particularly affected by this issue, as river levels have reached their highest point in a decade in certain areas. This has led to widespread property damage and disruption for local residents.

The cause of these high water levels is attributed to heavy rainfall over the past few months, combined with melting snow and ice in the mountains. While this event was rare, it serves as a reminder of the risks associated with living near rivers and other bodies of water.

It is important for property owners to take steps to mitigate damage from flooding, such as installing flood barriers or elevating floors and appliances above flood level. Governments can also implement policies and infrastructure improvements to better manage water levels and protect communities from future flood events.
