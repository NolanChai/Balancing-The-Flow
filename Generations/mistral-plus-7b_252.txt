There was a time when films stood little chance of success unless there was something in it to appeal to the widest possible audience. However, this is no longer the case. With the advent of streaming services and social media platforms, independent filmmakers now have access to tools that allow them to create and distribute their own content without relying on a major studio or distribution company. This means that films can be made for much smaller budgets and still reach a wide audience. In addition, niche audiences are now able to find films that appeal directly to their interests and preferences. This has led to an increase in the number of independent films being produced each year, as well as a wider range of genres and themes being explored.
