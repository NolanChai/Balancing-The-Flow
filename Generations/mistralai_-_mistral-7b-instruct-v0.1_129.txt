 ing the makers of the military equipment that he was using at the time of his death.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that the defendants, including Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co., knew or should have known that their products were defective and that they failed to warn the military about the risks involved.

The couple, who are not being named for fear of retribution from the government, claim that their son's death was a direct result of faulty equipment that malfunctioned during a mission in Afghanistan. They also allege that the companies knew of the potential dangers associated with their products but failed to take adequate steps to address them.

According to the complaint, the couple's son, who served as a SEAL in Iraq and Afghanistan, was killed on April 15, 2012, during a helicopter mission in Afghanistan. The helicopter, which was equipped with Northrop Grumman-made equipment, crashed due to a malfunctioning part that failed to properly secure the rotor blades.

The couple alleges that they were notified of the defective equipment shortly after their son's death, but that it was too late to save his life. They also claim that the companies knew of the potential dangers associated with their products and should have taken steps to address them before their son's death.

The lawsuit seeks damages for the couple's emotional distress, as well as any costs incurred by the military in investigating the incident. It also seeks to prevent future use of defective equipment by the military and to hold the companies accountable for their actions.

The companies named in the lawsuit have not yet responded to the allegations.
