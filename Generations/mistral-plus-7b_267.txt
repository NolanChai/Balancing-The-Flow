A Beijing theatre audience 'gasped in shock' after a banned image of a lone protestor blocking a tank on Tiananmen Square was projected onto the stage.
The picture, which has never been shown in China since it was taken in June 1989, was used during the performance of The People, at the Beijing Fringe Festival.
It showed a young man standing defiantly as a row of tanks rolls towards him. He is carrying a shopping bag with his belongings.
The image has become synonymous with the Tiananmen Square protests and crackdown on June 4th 1989.
A number of audience members were reported to have gasped in shock when the picture was shown.
