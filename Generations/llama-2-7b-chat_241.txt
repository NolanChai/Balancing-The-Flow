The successful launch of the rocket, which was seen as a major step forward for North Korea's military capabilities, has raised concerns about the country's growing nuclear ambitions and the potential threat it poses to regional security. The U.S. State Department has condemned the launch, calling it a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and saying that it undermines international peace and security.
