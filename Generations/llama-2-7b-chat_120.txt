Mirallas, who has been struggling with a hamstring injury since November, underwent surgery on Tuesday and is expected to be out of action for at least 8 weeks. The news comes as a huge blow to Everton, who were already without Romelu Lukaku and Yannick Bolasie through injury. With Mirallas set to miss the majority of the season, Ronald Koeman will have to re-evaluate his attacking options and find alternative solutions to replace the missing firepower.
