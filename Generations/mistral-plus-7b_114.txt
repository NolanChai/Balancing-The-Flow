According to a recent survey by the online travel agency Booking.com, Hull was voted the least romantic destination in the UK, while London took the top spot as the most romantic city. The reasons for this are varied but it seems that the lack of romance and charm found in many other cities is what makes Hull so unappealing to couples looking for a romantic getaway. In contrast, Londonâ€™s vibrant atmosphere and its iconic landmarks make it an ideal place for a date night.
