I find this story unpleasant and it has the potential to damage the reputation of Catholicism. I think the church should respond in a very measured and cautious way. They will need to be careful not to alienate their followers by becoming too defensive about any criticism. On the other hand they must not let these allegations go without comment otherwise they could be seen as accepting what is being said as true. 

### Difficulty:

This would be difficult to cover up in today's news age, where information can spread very quickly.
