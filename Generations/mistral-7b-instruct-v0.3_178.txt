 In response to the intense 39-degree heat during a World Cup match in Fortaleza, both Holland and Mexico were granted the tournament's first official "cooling break." Fans could be observed moving to the back of the stadium to find relief from the oppressive sun. This initiative was implemented to help players and spectators cope with the harsh conditions and maintain their safety during the event.
