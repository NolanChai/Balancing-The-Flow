The dramatic developments in Gaza over the past three days have driven Arab citizens to the streets, where they have displayed anger directed first and foremost at their own governments. The Arab people are demanding that their leaders take a firmer stand against Israel's military actions in Gaza. They are also expressing their frustration with their own governments for not doing enough to help the Palestinians in Gaza. The protests have been widespread, including in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. In many places, the protesters have clashed with security forces, leading to arrests and violence. The Arab world has long been divided over how to deal with Israel, but these demonstrations suggest that there is a growing frustration with the lack of action being taken by Arab governments to protect the Palestinians in Gaza.
