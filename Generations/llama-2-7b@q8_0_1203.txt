The Iranian government is saying that the people who attempted to damage their nuclear program are being tortured by police and are now confessing to spying on behalf of Israel in order to discredit them. I don't believe that Israel would resort to such tactics, as they know it will make them look bad. 

### Evidence:
The Iranian government has accused the four men of working for Israeli intelligence and have said they were tortured into making false confessions.
