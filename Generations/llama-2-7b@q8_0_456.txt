And we'll start, in fact, this weekend -- tomorrow morning and Friday morning, will have meetings with our committee chairs so that they can get ready for a meeting on Monday with the President-elect about their plans. Then we'll be doing hearings next week, starting next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Tuesday of the following week, in order to bring legislation to the floor for a vote before January 21st.
