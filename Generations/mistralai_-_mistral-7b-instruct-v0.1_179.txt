 In a speech on Tuesday, former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg appealed for support from his wife, Miriam, as he sought to rally Liberal Democrats ahead of upcoming elections.

"We are facing the fight of our lives," Clegg said, speaking to a group of Lib Dem supporters in central London. "But I know that together we can do it."

Clegg, who served as deputy prime minister under Prime Minister David Cameron from 2010 to 2015, highlighted the challenges facing the party since its ouster by Conservative Boris Johnson in the 2019 general election.

"We need your help," he said. "We need your energy and enthusiasm."

Clegg also thanked his wife for her support and urged Lib Dems to remember that they are fighting not just for themselves, but for the future of the country.

"Thank you, Miriam, for being here today," Clegg said. "And thank you all for what you do."
