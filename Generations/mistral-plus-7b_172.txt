In a remarkable display of corporate bravado, Apple CEO Tim Cook took aim at his Samsung rival, Greg Lee, in an email exchange that was published on Tuesday. Cook sent the message to Lee, who is president of Samsung's mobile division, after the South Korean company announced plans for its own smartwatch.

"I will personally make sure your next phone does not ship," Cook wrote in response to Lee's statement about Apple's smartwatch. "Yours sincerely, Tim."

The exchange was reported by Re/code, which obtained the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request. The publication said it had edited out any profanity and other personal information.

Samsung announced its Gear S smartwatch on Sunday, along with two new flagship phones. Samsung's announcement came just weeks after Apple unveiled its own smartwatch, the Apple Watch.
