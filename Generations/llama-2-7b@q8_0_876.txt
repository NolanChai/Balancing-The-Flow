The nurse, who was identified as Pauline Cafferkey from London, had been transferred to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London yesterday after being flown back from Sierra Leone with a high fever and vomiting blood. Doctors are still carrying out tests on her to determine whether she has contracted Ebola but her family said they were confident she will make a full recovery.
