This might be an opportunity for a solar flare and possibly even a coronal mass ejection (CME) heading towards Earth. 

### Explanation:
The sun spot was spotted by a network of spacecraft that orbit around the Sun called SOHO, as they are constantly scanning the surface of the star for magnetic activity.

The solar flare is more likely to cause issues if it occurs at a time when our planet is directly in line with the solar systemâ€™s nearest star - 24th July.
