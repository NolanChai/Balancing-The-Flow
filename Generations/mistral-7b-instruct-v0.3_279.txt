 According to an article published by Ashley Collman on July 30, 2013, the girlfriend of Aaron Swartz, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, has criticized the ongoing investigation into his death as "whitewash." Swartz was a prominent computer programmer and internet activist who committed suicide in January 2013 while facing federal charges for allegedly illegally downloading millions of academic articles from the JSTOR database. Stinebrickner-Kauffman's comments come as the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts continues to review the circumstances surrounding Swartz's death, including his treatment by law enforcement and the prosecution's handling of the case against him. Swartz's family and supporters have argued that he was unfairly targeted by the government and that the charges he faced were excessive. Stinebrickner-Kauffman has called for a more thorough investigation into the factors that led to Swartz's death, including the impact of the legal proceedings on his mental health. The U.S. attorney's office has said that it is committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the case and will release its findings when they are complete.
