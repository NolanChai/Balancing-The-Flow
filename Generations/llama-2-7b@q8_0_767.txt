I'm not sure what the right answer is, but here are my thoughts on the questions asked in this instruction:
1. How does the plaintiff define "gender discrimination"? What are examples of such discrimination?
2. Does the plaintiff believe Goldman Sachs has a policy that favors one gender over another? If yes, which? If no, why not?
3. Can you identify any potential problems with the way in which the case is presented to you? Are there any ways that the case might be improved upon?
4. Is it reasonable for Goldman Sachs' female employees to expect a fair and equitable working environment where they are treated with respect by their peers, colleagues and supervisors? Why or why not?
