The Metropolitan Police Service is carrying out an investigation in relation to allegations that Lord Janner, 86, committed historical offences.

Officers from Operation Fairbank have executed search warrants at the House of Lords and a property in north London as part of this investigation.

Inquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

Police say they are not prepared to comment any further at this time, but they do say that it is not appropriate to name Lord Janner.
