 It seems like you've provided a fragment of a story, but it's missing some context. Here's an attempt to continue based on the given information:

"By Allan Hall and Alexandra Williams. This was not how she would have imagined spending the eve of her husbandâ€™s 45th birthday. Instead of wrapping his presents or sorting out a party, Corinna Sc (the main character) found herself pacing back and forth in the dimly lit interrogation room, her heart pounding against her chest like a drum.

The detective sitting across from her, with his cold, stern gaze, was not helping to ease her nerves. She had been questioned for hours about her husband's sudden disappearance, but she still couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right.

As the clock struck midnight, Corinna's thoughts were filled with worry and doubt. Where was her husband? Why wasn't he answering his phone? And what did the police know that she didn't?"

This is a brief continuation of the story based on the provided fragment. Of course, this is just one possible interpretation, and the actual narrative might vary.
