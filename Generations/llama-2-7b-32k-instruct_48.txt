Castro called Obama's speech Wednesday a "manifesto of hypocrisy" and accused the President of being a representative of Cuban exiles. Castro was referring specifically to Obama's statement that Cuba should stop jailing political dissidents, which is something he has denied doing repeatedly in the past
Castro also noted that there are several U.S. citizens imprisoned for committing acts of espionage against his government. He added that these individuals should be freed along with Cuban nationals jailed in the United States on similar charges.  
The former Cuban leader also called the President "stupid" because he had to rely on a teleprompter to deliver his speech, which was written by others and delivered with difficulty at times, according to the Cuban state-run television network TVC
Castro wrote that Obama's call for Cuba to free political prisoners was like telling Jews in Nazi Germany to release their concentration camp guards.  
"The President of the United States speaks about human rights, democracy and freedom, but at the same time his government is not thinking about granting political asylum to Cuban refugees or even to those who are deportees," Castro wrote on his blog Cubadebate. "That is not hypocrisy? It's just plain stupidity."  
Obama was in Brazil Wednesday and made a stop at a favela, where he met with young people and listened to their concerns about unemployment and education
In an interview published on the front page of the Rio de Janeiro newspaper O Globo, Obama said Brazil is proof that countries can grow out of poverty through hard work and determination.  
Obama's speech in Sao Paulo Wednesday also mentioned Cuba several times as an example of what he called "a nation that refuses to be free." He cited the lack of political freedoms, press freedom and economic freedoms in the communist country.  
"Those who govern in Havana should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cubans," Obama said during his speech at Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova, where he was joined on stage by former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. "In too many ways, Cuba is trapped in the past."  
He continued that the United States doesn't seek to make Cuban politics for them but rather allows the Cuban people to decide their own destiny
"The future of Cuba should be in the hands of the Cubans," Obama said. "We will insist on the steps needed for democracy and human rights."  
Obama also said that U.S.-Cuban ties have been restored but that much still needs to be done before relations are normalized, especially with respect to Cuba's human rights record. The President is scheduled to arrive in Costa Rica Thursday on the final leg of his visit to Latin America
(CNN)President Obama said Wednesday he will ask Congress for permission to resume commercial travel between the United States and Cuba
The White House announced that Obama would address changes to Cuban policies when he visits Brazil's capital later in the day. The President plans to visit Argentina and Chile before returning home on Friday, after a weeklong trip that has taken him to Sao Paulo, Fortaleza, Mexico City and Washington D.C.  
The decision comes as Obama prepares for his final year in office and seeks to cement his legacy through diplomatic outreach to the rest of the world
But he still faces stiff opposition from some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who have criticized him for his Cuba policy since its implementation in 2014.  
Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio and other opponents say the change is akin to "selling out" Cubans suffering under the repressive regime of Raul Castro
The President has faced criticism from some former Cuban political prisoners, as well, for not doing enough to help those imprisoned by their government  
But in his speech Wednesday, Obama made it clear that the policy would remain unchanged until Cuba releases all political prisoners. "We will insist on the steps needed for democracy and human rights," he said.  
"It is still not a good enough answer to say, 'You can have relations with us if you release your political prisoners,' " Obama added during a press conference earlier Wednesday at the White House.
