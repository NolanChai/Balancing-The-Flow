Lee's retirement has been a long time coming and it was something he wanted to do for some time, but the 34-year old said that it was a sad day and one that he wouldn't forget.
"It was great playing with those guys for so many years, but I just didn't feel like I could give my all any more." Lee told CNNS. "I think I might do some Twenty20 cricket in the future if I feel up to it, but right now, I don't see myself doing that anymore either"

### Other Information:
Lee was regarded as one of the finest fast bowlers in world cricket over the last decade and his record speaks for itself. During his career he played 76 test matches, taking 310 wickets at an average of just under 25 per test match. He also holds a number of other records such as the most no-ball deliveries in Test cricket with 18, and is ranked the best Test fast bowler ever by some critics.
