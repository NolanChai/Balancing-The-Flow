The son, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that he has not been able to sleep since his father was beheaded and his mother kidnapped by ISIS militants a week ago. He said, “I can’t stop thinking about them both, and I just hope they are together now – that she is dead and he is at peace.”

The boy added, “It breaks my heart to know that my mom is probably in pain right now, after what those monsters did to her. I wish she was gone so that she would no longer have to suffer.” He said he knows that this might sound harsh, but he has to do whatever it takes to cope with the loss of his parents. “I can’t live with the thought of my mom suffering any longer,” he said tearfully.

The family had been living in a Syrian refugee camp for over two years before ISIS militants attacked their village and took both parents captive. The boy, who is now 13 years old, has not seen his father or mother since then. He hopes that if his mom is dead, it means she is finally at peace and no longer in pain.
