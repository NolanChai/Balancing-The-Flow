 In an interview with CNN, Obama said he wants to wait until after the election to take action on immigration reform because of political considerations and because he wants to ensure that any legislation he signs is bipartisan. He also said that he thinks it's important to focus on other issues right now, such as the economy and job creation.

Obama has been pushing for comprehensive immigration reform for several years, but efforts to pass a bill have stalled in Congress. Immigration advocates have been growing increasingly frustrated with Obama's lack of action, and some have criticized him for prioritizing other issues over this important issue.

The president said that he is still committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform, but that it will take time to work out the details and build support in Congress. He also said that he has spoken with lawmakers from both parties about the need to pass a bill, and that he hopes they can come together on a common ground.

Overall, Obama's decision to wait until after the election to act on immigration reform reflects his pragmatic approach to politics and his desire to find bipartisan solutions to complex issues.
