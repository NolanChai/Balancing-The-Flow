 their younger brother, Charlie Faiers, who was caught selling cocaine to a vulnerable teenager.

Sam and Billie, both 26, have spoken of their close bond with Charlie, 23, and how they were devastated by the revelation that he had become involved in drug dealing.

In the letter, which has been seen by the Daily Mail, the sisters say: "We understand this is a very serious matter, and we take full responsibility for our brother's actions. We can only imagine the pain and suffering that has been caused to this young man."

They add: "But we cannot stress enough how much Charlie means to us and how shocked and devastated we are by his involvement in such dangerous activities. He is a kind-hearted, caring person who has always looked up to us. We know he has made mistakes but he does not deserve the harsh penalty that will inevitably be handed down."

The letter also expresses the sisters' fear that Charlie will lose everything if he is sentenced to a long prison term, including his job, his girlfriend and their mother.

It concludes: "We ask you to show him leniency in your sentence. We believe that given the circumstances of this case, and our brother's good character, we are confident that he will not make similar mistakes in the future."

Charlie Faiers was caught selling drugs to a 16-year-old boy outside a pub in Romford, east London, in June. He pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was given an eight-year sentence at Old Bailey on Monday.
