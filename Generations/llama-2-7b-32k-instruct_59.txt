1 / 1 (CNN)A shocking video shows the moment of near-miss between two cars in a tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts -- one being an out-of-control car that nearly collides with another driver, and the other being a state police cruiser that narrowly avoids getting hit.

The video was shot by passenger Elias Khouri from inside his vehicle on May 4 near Southampton Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The driver of the car in front is seen losing control and moving into another lane, almost hitting the first state police cruiser that came upon them at a red light.

"I think she was trying to swerve out of the way to avoid him," Khouri said. "But it didn't work because he just kept going." 
The second state police officer on scene tried his best to stop the first cruiser but couldn't, resulting in a near collision with the other driver. Luckily no injuries were reported from the incident.

"I was just glad that nobody was injured," Khouri said. "And I was even more surprised by how close it could have been." 
A spokesperson for the Massachusetts State Police said they are investigating the incident, but didn't have any further comment on Sunday night. [/INST]
