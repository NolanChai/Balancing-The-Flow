The conventional wisdom is that the Minoans — people of the island of Crete during the Neolithic and Bronze ages, from around 3,600 BCE to about 1,600 BCE — were refugees fleeing the catastrophic volcanic eruptions in the Aegean. They have long been thought to be descendants of North African farmers who came to Greece during a wet period known as the Holocene Optimum (7,000-5,000 BCE) because of their darker skin tone and other physical characteristics. However, scientists have now discovered that the Minoans actually had their own origins on Crete, with no direct link to North African populations until about 2,300 years ago, after they were conquered by Mycenaean Greek warriors .
The evidence comes from a new study published in the journal PLOS One. Researchers used genetic sequencing techniques to analyze DNA samples taken from people across Europe — including modern inhabitants of Crete and other Aegean islands — and compared their genomes to those of present-day peoples living elsewhere in Africa, the Middle East and Asia . They found that the Minoans were indeed direct descendants of Neolithic populations native to Crete. Their genetic diversity indicates that they did not originate from North African farmers who came to Greece during a wet period known as the Holocene Optimum (7,000-5,000 BCE), but rather developed independently on Crete . “We can now state with certainty that all Minoans were native to the island,” says study co-author David Goldberg of University College London. “It’s really exciting.”
The findings suggest that many common theories about the Minoan civilization, including the idea that it was inspired by North African culture and religion, are not entirely accurate — but the researchers still have more questions than answers about how the ancient people lived . For one thing, they don’t know much about their origins prior to 6000 BCE. “The Minoan civilization was very different from other societies of this era,” says study co-author Joanna Pytrus of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany . “We need further evidence to understand why.”
