 I'm sorry to hear about the dissolution of Hereford United. This is indeed a significant event in the world of football. The club, which was founded in 1876 and had a rich history in English football, was declared insolvent after entering into administration twice in four years. As a result, the High Court ordered its liquidation on August 22, 2014.

However, it's worth noting that although the original club no longer exists, a phoenix club called Hereford FC was formed by supporters and started playing in the Southern League Division One West in 2014-15 season. The new club plays at Edgar Street, the home ground of Hereford United.

The history of Hereford United is marked by some notable moments, such as winning the FA Trophy in 1972 and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1972 and 1987. The club also gained promotion to the Football League Third Division in 1960 and reached the Second Division (now Championship) for the first time in 1973.

While the dissolution of Hereford United is a sad chapter in football history, the resilience shown by their supporters in creating a new club offers hope for the future.
