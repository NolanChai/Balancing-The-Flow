The tourist industry has been left fuming as visitors take selfies with dingos and share them online, making it look like they are no longer afraid of the deadly animals. 

There have been an average of eight attacks a week in North Stradbroke Island since April this year. 

Animal activist Angela Kendrick said she has seen photos on social media where tourists are sitting right next to the dingos, with some even putting their head into the dingo's mouth for pictures.

"It's a very concerning situation," Ms Kendrick told 7 News. 

"People need to realise that you don't have the right to put your hand in any animal's mouth, let alone a wild dog."

The attacks come as a new warning sign has been placed around popular beaches on Stradbroke Island. The signs tell swimmers not to go into the water with their kids. 

But local tourism operators say they are having trouble keeping visitors away from the beach. 

"It's just an absolute disaster," one tour operator told 7 News. "People need to start realising that we have a serious issue."

Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service said it has received more than 10,000 calls from concerned people in the last few weeks. 

The group also released information on how tourists can help reduce the number of attacks. It says visitors need to keep their children close when visiting beaches and never feed or approach dingos. 

"It's a natural predator that has existed for thousands of years," QPWS spokesperson, Lisa Sullivan said. "We can't tell them to turn the other cheek." 

But for some people it is too late as they have already lost loved ones in deadly attacks. The family of a four-year-old girl who died in one of the attacks last year still grieves her loss every day. 

The mother and father of the little girl said their child was attacked by two dingos near Cylinder Beach just before Christmas last year. 

The attack happened just metres from where they were standing. 

"She went down to pet a dog, it bit her on the back," Ms Brennan told 7 News at the time.

Another mother who was also attacked by dingos while out with her daughter said she would never let her child go near a beach again. 

"There's nothing worse than seeing your four-year-old bleed and being unable to do anything about it," Ms Rice told 7 News. 

Most attacks happen in the morning or afternoon when dingos are more active, according to local police.
