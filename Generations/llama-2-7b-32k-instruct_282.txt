House of Commons speaker John Bercow ran up a Â£ 177 fare for a four - mile limousine ride that should have cost just over half as much, according to his office . The taxi fare was more than twice what a typical black cab would charge for the journey from Parliament to Westminster City Hall and back . The Commons spokesman said Mr Bercow had asked the driver of the car which he hired at Heathrow Airport if there were any alternative routes as he did not want to pay too much. However, he was offered a price which was twice what he would have paid for an ordinary taxi . When the MP told him of his concerns, the driver insisted that he had booked Mr Bercow's ride through a special website used by airlines and tour operators . The spokesman said: "The speaker has asked us to apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."
