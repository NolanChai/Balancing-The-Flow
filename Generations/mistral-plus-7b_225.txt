This is the terrifying moment a teen robber holds up a shop at gunpoint - all for 24 cans of beer.

A video has emerged showing a masked boy brandishing a firearm and threatening to shoot the clerk if he didn't hand over two dozen cans of Corona.

The footage, shot by surveillance cameras inside a convenience store in California, shows the robber pointing the gun at the young shop assistant as she hands over the 24-pack of lager.

When the man turns to walk out of the shop he realises that he has left his mask behind and goes back into the store to collect it.

He then flees with the beer.
