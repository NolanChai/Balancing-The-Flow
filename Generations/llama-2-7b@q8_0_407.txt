However, according to [Meghan Keneally](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2321590/Friends-Boston-bomber-Tamerlan-Tsarnaev-posted-pictures-themselves-trips-laughed-Islam-celebrated-Ramadan.html) (Daily Mail, May 2), Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov were never really friends with the bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov posted pictures of themselves on spring break in Florida while Tsarnaev was in Boston.
