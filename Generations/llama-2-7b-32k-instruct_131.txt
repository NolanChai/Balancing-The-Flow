Sam and Billie Faiers have asked a judge for leniency towards their mum who is going to jail for assaulting one of their boyfriends .   The former TOWIE stars have written to the Old Bailey Judge asking him not to punish her so severely because it will be hard on them and she'll miss Christmas with them .   They are also worried that if she spends more than three months in jail, she won't be able to apply for bail ahead of sentencing when the trial date is set - and they want her to have that option .
