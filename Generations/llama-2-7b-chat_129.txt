A couple whose Navy SEAL son was killed in Afghanistan have joined a class-action lawsuit against the military for allegedly ignoring warning signs of mental health problems among special forces personnel. The parents, who wish to remain anonymous, claim that their son's death in 2012 was preventable and that the military failed to provide adequate support for his mental health issues. According to the lawsuit, the Navy SEALs have a culture of silence surrounding mental health problems, which has led to a lack of treatment and support for servicemen and women struggling with these issues. The couple is seeking compensation for their son's death as well as changes to the military's policies and procedures regarding mental health care.
