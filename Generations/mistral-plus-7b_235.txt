As the woman approached the school, the teacher told her that she would have to fill out some paperwork before the child could be registered. The mother replied that she didnâ€™t have much time as she was in labor. The teacher then suggested that perhaps she should bring her son back after she had given birth. The mother thought for a moment and then decided that it would be best if he stayed with the teacher until she returned home from the hospital.

The teacher agreed, and the mother went off to the hospital. A few hours later, the woman gave birth to a healthy baby boy. She was so relieved and excited that she immediately called the school to let them know about her safe delivery. When the teacher heard the news, they were overjoyed for both the mother and child. They promised to take good care of the young boy while his mom was away.

A few days later, when the mother returned home from the hospital, she went straight to see her son at the school. To her surprise, he had already made some friends and seemed very happy and content in his new environment. The teacher told the woman that they would do their best to make sure he felt safe and comfortable while she was away.
