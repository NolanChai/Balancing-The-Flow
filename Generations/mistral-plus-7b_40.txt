The Smith family in Perth has once again set a new Guinness World Record for having the most Christmas lights on their house with an incredible 502,165 LED lights. The previous record was held by them in 2018 when they lit up their home with 378,000 lights. This year's display features more than double the number of lights and took nearly four months to set up. It is estimated that the Smith family spent around $35,000 on this year's display.
