<p>This is an instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_(film)" target="_blank">The Rite</a>.</p>

### Explanation:
<p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> The song is a reference to the <strong>2011 film</strong> "The Rite" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_(film)" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_(film)</a>) in which a seminary student is sent to Rome for his training to become a priest. There he falls under the influence of a charismatic professor, who leads him down the path of demonology.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 2: </strong> The line "The Devil's coming back" refers to the final scene of the film, when the seminary student is haunted by visions of demons and must fight them off to exorcise them from a young boy. The final battle between the two characters is set in a football stadium and is accompanied by the chanting of the crowd.</p>
