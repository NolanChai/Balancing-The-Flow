 It seems like you're sharing a news article about the Towie stars Sam and Billie Faiers writing a letter to a judge on behalf of someone. However, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access specific articles. Here's a general response based on your text:

In your message, you mentioned a news article from 2012 about the Towie stars Sam and Billie Faiers writing a letter to an Old Bailey judge asking for leniency for a third party. This kind of action highlights the strong bond between family or friends when they come together in support during challenging times. It's interesting to see how celebrities can use their influence to help others, even if it means stepping into the courtroom. The exact circumstances and outcome of this case might not be known to me, but it underscores the importance of compassion and empathy in our society.
