The best way to answer this question is by giving two reasons for doing something that can be classified as "good". For example:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello")
main()
```

This will not pass because we have only one argument in our function, which is the print statement. The above code can be changed to this:

```python
print(3 + 5) # prints 8
```
