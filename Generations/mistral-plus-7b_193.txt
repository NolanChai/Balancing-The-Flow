At the end of first grade, 7-year-old Cameron Hale, an easy-going, cheerful little boy from a tiny rural town in western Washington, suddenly didn't want to go to school anymore. His parents noticed that he had become withdrawn and moody, and would often complain about stomach pains. After several weeks of trying to figure out what was wrong, they took Cameron to the doctor for a check-up.

The doctors discovered that Cameron suffered from severe anxiety, which was causing him to feel anxious and afraid even when there was no apparent reason for it. The doctors prescribed medication to help him deal with his anxiety and referred him to a counselor. With their help, Cameron learned coping strategies to manage his anxiety and began to improve.
