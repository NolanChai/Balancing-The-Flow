 According to the report from the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File (ISAF), the number of shark attacks worldwide in 2020 decreased to a four-year low. However, despite the decrease in the total number of attacks, the fatality rate was higher compared to previous years.

The ISAF report states that there were 64 unprovoked shark attacks recorded in 2020, a drop from 83 attacks in 2019. The decline could be due to travel restrictions and closed beaches as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number of fatalities increased to six in 2020, up from four in 2019.

The report also notes that most shark attacks occurred in the United States, with Florida being the state with the highest number of incidents. The decrease in shark attacks could be a positive sign for conservation efforts, as it shows that sharks are not a significant threat to humans compared to other causes of accidental death. However, it is important to continue promoting safe interactions between people and sharks to prevent future attacks and protect these vital marine predators.
