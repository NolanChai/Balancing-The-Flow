The United States has been involved in Afghanistan for over ten years. The original intention was to root out Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Today, the United States still faces a struggle against the Taliban who still control large parts of the country. In addition, the United States has had to deal with the rise of a new threat: the Haqqani network which is believed to be behind many of the attacks on US troops in Afghanistan. The US military presence in Afghanistan is now at its peak and it remains to be seen whether or not they will succeed in their goal of establishing stability in the country.
