A family's cat had given their daughter a rare form of meningitis that almost killed her.

### Explanation:
This sentence contains four separate clauses:

* The first is the main clause and it reads as follows "A three-year-old girl almost died after her family's cat gave her". This clause has two verbs (almost died, gave) and an adjective (family's).
* The second is the dependent clause that follows "the rare form of meningitis" which has a relative pronoun "that" and a verb phrase ("had given"). The relative pronoun can be omitted if it is clear what the antecedent of this relative pronoun is. It seems to me that it's the same girl as in the first clause, but you may have other opinions about this.
* The third contains another relative pronoun "which" followed by a noun phrase ("had given"). In this case, it is possible for some speakers or writers to omit "that" and write "which gave her".
* Finally, the fourth clause has two verbs (almost died, gave) and an adjective (family's). This time we can omit the relative pronoun and have a sentence without relative clauses.
