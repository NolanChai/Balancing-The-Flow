Kate Moss, known for her stunning looks and successful modeling career, is not taking a break to enjoy her recent successes. In fact, just two days after unveiling her collection for Topshop, she's already gearing up for her next project - this time in the world of technology.

Moss has been working closely with the tech industry to develop a new app that will revolutionize the way people shop for clothes. The app, which is set to launch later this year, will allow users to try on clothes virtually, using augmented reality technology to see how they'll look on their own bodies.

"I've always been passionate about fashion and technology," Moss said in an exclusive interview with Vogue. "So when I had the opportunity to work with these amazing developers, I jumped at it."

The app is still in its early stages, but Moss is confident that it will change the way people shop for clothes. "I think it's going to be game-changing," she said. "It's going to make shopping so much more fun and accessible."

Moss has been known for her ability to adapt to new trends and technologies in the fashion industry. She's worked with some of the biggest designers in the world, from Alexander McQueen to Marc Jacobs, and has been a trailblazer for women's fashion in the 90s and early 2000s.

Now, as she ventures into the world of technology, Moss is excited about what the future holds. "I feel like this is just the beginning," she said. "There are so many other ways we can use technology to enhance fashion and make it more sustainable."
