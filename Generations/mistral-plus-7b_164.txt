The poster that has appeared around Cambridge offers students "easy cash" for information about their academic performance. The poster is aimed at students who are struggling academically and in need of some extra financial assistance. It promises a small sum of money for any information provided about the student's academic progress, coursework, exam results or grades. The aim of the poster is to encourage students to come forward with any information that could help them improve their academic performance.
