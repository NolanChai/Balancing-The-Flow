(CNN) -- The son of the-highest ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage was sentenced Tuesday to probation and community service for continuing his jailed father’s espionage activities, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Portland, Oregon.

Joshua Adam Schulte, 32, pleaded guilty last year to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer and was sentenced Tuesday to two years supervised release, including six months home confinement followed by six months of probation. He also received a three-year term of community service.

Schulte is the son of James A. Schulte, Jr., who spent more than 25 years with the CIA and was the highest-ranking officer ever sentenced for espionage. Joshua was charged in connection to his father’s case.
