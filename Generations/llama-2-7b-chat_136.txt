Law enforcement sources claim that Pedro Hernandez, 54, who was arrested last week for the 1979 disappearance and murder of Etan Patz, can be seen on the tape pretending to strangle the young boy during a fake confession. According to reports, the video was captured during a meeting with detectives in New York City on May 28th, 2012. The footage is said to have been taken as part of an ongoing investigation into the case and has left investigators shocked by its contents.
