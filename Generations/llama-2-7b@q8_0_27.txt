Exhuming a body to get DNA is not as simple as you might think, because there are many ways to preserve DNA over time. In general, the older the DNA, the less likely it is to survive the exhumation process and analysis.

Some of the techniques used for preserving DNA include:
- Cooling a body down after death (i.e. using ice packs).
- Mummification.
- Embalming fluids.
