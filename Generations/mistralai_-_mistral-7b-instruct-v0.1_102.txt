Bus passengers ganged up on some French tourists on an Australian bus, even threatening to kill them.

A Frenchman and a woman were on a bus in Australia when they were approached by a group of angry passengers. The group began shouting at the two tourists, who tried to defend themselves but were quickly overwhelmed.

One of the passengers reportedly grabbed the tourist woman's throat and threatened to kill her, while another threatened to stab the man with a knife.

The bus driver intervened and managed to separate the two groups, but not before the tourists had been badly shaken. The group was eventually dispersed, and the tourists were taken off the bus.

This incident occurred in Victoria, Australia, on November 17th. The police are currently investigating the matter and looking for witnesses.
