"I was really shocked when I first saw it," said mum-of-one, Claire Sutherland, 28, who spotted the grub in her Tesco Extra store in Glasgow on Wednesday morning.

"It is so disgusting. It is unbelievable that a company can be allowed to sell food with mice living inside of it."

Claire said she was shocked when she saw the mouse inside a sandwich, but Tesco's response has been "shocking in itself".
"They have basically told me to eat the sandwich," she said. "I've not touched my breakfast since I saw that and don't intend to now."
