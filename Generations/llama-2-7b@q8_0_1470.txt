A young mother returned home with her baby boy yesterday just 13 days after a nightmare labour which put her into a coma. Fiona Moore, from Waltham Cross, Herts, spent four weeks in hospital recovering after having emergency surgery to deliver the baby and had to be resuscitated at one point. The 29-year-old said she was 'thrilled' her son Cash was finally allowed home as a doctor said it was not safe for him to stay any longer in hospital.
Mrs Moore, who has four other children - aged from six months to eight years â€“ had a Caesarean section on December 26 after being in labour at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow for almost three days. But complications set in when she went into cardiac arrest and doctors had no choice but to operate to deliver her son, Cash Moore, who weighed just seven pounds six ounces.
She said: 'It was a very scary time as I did not know how long the surgery would last or if I would survive. I didn't even know when my baby had been born but later found out he was fine and healthy. 'I had to have an MRI scan which showed that I had bleeding on the brain, so I've been in intensive care since then.'

The mother-of-five was unable to see her son for weeks due to fears about the pressure she would be put under. But doctors said they felt confident she could finally be discharged from hospital after two of her previous children were born by Caesarean section without any complications, and that there are no obvious reasons why Mrs Moore should not have a normal pregnancy in future.
The 29-year-old was discharged yesterday afternoon, with Cash's father Paul Dewhurst, 31, who had been at her bedside throughout her ordeal. She said: 'I am absolutely thrilled to be home. I don't know how many more times I can go through the trauma of having a baby but it will have to be more as this is my fifth.'
She also added that she would not change anything about her pregnancy or birth, saying she had been 'overjoyed' with Cash since the moment he was born. Mrs Moore said: 'It was great being back in hospital today because I got to meet my new baby boy and see all of his little fingers and toes.' She added that although it may seem strange for her first child to be home just two weeks before Christmas, she feels blessed that the family can celebrate him.
'Cash will have a very nice present,' Mrs Moore said. 'We are very lucky.'
