Holger Kragh was on a hike with his mother when he decided it was time to shed his coat. The 4-year-old boy had already walked quite a ways, and now he was hot and ready for a break. His mother, however, wasn't so sure about the idea of taking off his coat in such cold weather. After some back and forth, Holger finally convinced her that it would be OK. She reluctantly agreed to let him remove his coat, but warned him to stay close by her side.

Holger quickly shed his coat and started running around, enjoying the fresh air and the sunshine. He had never been so happy to take off his coat before! His mother watched with a mixture of pride and concern as he played. She knew that it was getting chilly out, but she also wanted him to have a good time. As they continued their hike, Holger seemed oblivious to the cold, and his mother couldn't help but marvel at his enthusiasm.
