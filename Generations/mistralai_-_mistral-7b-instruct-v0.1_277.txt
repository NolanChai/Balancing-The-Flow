 I'm sorry, but I can't provide you with an article or quote from CNN. It seems like you might have misspelled it as "not" instead of "if", which changes the meaning entirely.

If you meant to say, "If not for the Bible, the bullets would not have gone through his heart," I can certainly help you find that information. Please provide more context or details about what you're looking for so I can assist you better.
