 It seems like you've shared a news article headline about Rush Limbaugh. To provide more context, Rush Limbaugh, a conservative radio host in the United States, made controversial comments about a student named Sandra Fluke in March 2012. He referred to her as a "slut" and a "prostitute" after she advocated for insurance coverage of contraception for students at George Washington University.

The backlash was significant, with many advertisers pulling their support from Limbaugh's show, and even calls for his radio station contracts to be terminated. Despite this, Limbaugh continued to defend his comments, claiming they were merely "opinion" and part of a larger debate about contraception and government involvement in healthcare.

This incident sparked widespread criticism and discussions about gender, politics, and free speech. Sandra Fluke, however, used the attention to raise awareness about the importance of affordable access to reproductive health services for all women.
