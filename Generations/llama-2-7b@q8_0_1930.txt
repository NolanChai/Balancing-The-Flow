Another called Jessica Ennis a 'girly girl'. But Jessica has shown she doesn't mind a bit of a fight if she is out of her depth. And, after a year in which she had to get used to living up to expectations and fighting the pressures put on her by her coaches and sponsors - not to mention winning hearts on TV's ITV show Dancing On Ice – 
- this week she was looking like a champion again. She won the Heptathlon at the European Championships in Stockholm, Sweden, with a total score of 6897 points, including the gold medal and £30,000 prize money. 
- She's just amazing. Jessica Ennis is a world champion who has now added another title to her name," said coach Toni Minichiello. "She showed herself as an Olympic champion she has never been anything but brilliant."
