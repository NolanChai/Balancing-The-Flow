 nistry records for nearly two years while on deployment in Afghanistan. Major General Penny Rees, a decorated officer who served as the deputy commander of British forces in the region from 2012 to 2013, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by altering financial and administrative reports submitted to her superiors in London.

The court heard that Rees made changes to records related to the use of UK troops in Afghanistan, including the amount of money spent on salaries, training and equipment. The changes were made with the intention of concealing shortfalls in the budget for British forces and minimizing any potential negative consequences for the UK government.

Rees, who has been a member of the military for nearly 30 years, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by Judge Alistair Hetherington at Woolwich Crown Court. She denied any wrongdoing and expressed her regret for what had happened.

The court heard that Rees made changes to the records in the presence of her subordinates, who were also aware of what she was doing. The judge said it was clear that Rees had taken a deliberate decision to deceive her superiors in London and had done so with the full knowledge and support of those around her.

Rees’s conviction is significant as it marks the first time a high-ranking officer has been jailed for falsifying military records. It also comes at a time when the UK government is facing growing pressure over its role in Afghanistan, with many questioning whether the conflict is still worth pursuing.
