The nation's record-low teen birth rate stems from robust declines in nearly every state, according to new data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reported that the national teen birth rate plummeted 7% last year, reaching a historic low of 32.3 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19. This marks the sixth consecutive annual decline in the teen birth rate, which has fallen by nearly 40% since 2007. The CDC credited improved contraception use and increased education about sexual health for the significant drop in teen pregnancies.
