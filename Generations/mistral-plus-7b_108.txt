Stephen Hendry, the seven-time world snooker champion, has left his wife of 19 years and their two sons for a children's theater star who is 20 years younger than him. The 46-year old walked out on his wife Mandy and their two sons to be with former West End actress Gaynor Patterson, now 26. Stephen and Mandy have been married since 1993 but are said to have grown apart after he went into semi-retirement in 2002.

Stephen met Gaynor while she was performing in a children's production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Glasgow's Kings Theatre earlier this year. The pair, who first met in January, are said to be very much in love and are planning a new life together. Stephen has reportedly been living with Gaynor in her one-bedroom flat since leaving his wife in February.
