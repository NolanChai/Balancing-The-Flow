 The 36-year-old man worked as a housekeeping attendant on several of Royal Caribbean's ships and is accused of stealing valuable items from cabins while passengers were away, according to police.

The man, whose name has not been released, was arrested at his home in Miami, Florida, after investigators traced his movements to the scenes of the burglaries using security footage and other evidence. He is charged with 24 counts of grand larceny.

According to police, the man would enter cabins while passengers were out and about during the day, or when they were asleep at night, and steal items such as jewelry, electronics, cash, and credit cards. The man also allegedly stole personal identification information from some victims in order to open credit card accounts in their names.

Royal Caribbean has since released a statement saying that the man's actions are not representative of their crew members and that they take all safety concerns very seriously. They have offered support to the affected passengers and have implemented additional security measures on board their ships.
