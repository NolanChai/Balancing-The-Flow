 It seems like you've shared an interesting scenario! While it's important for children to be registered in school, this situation might not be the best idea due to the mother being in labor. Prioritizing her immediate health and the upcoming birth should be the primary focus.

In a real-life situation, it would be more appropriate for someone else to take care of registering the child at school when things have settled down. It's always crucial to ensure everyone's safety and well-being first. If you were writing a story or script, this scenario could make for an engaging plot twist!
