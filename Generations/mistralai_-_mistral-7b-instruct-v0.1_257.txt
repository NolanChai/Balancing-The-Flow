 from the drug during a police raid and was later offered crack cocaine by a dealer. He then became dependent on heroin and was caught stealing from work to fund his addiction.

Mr Carroll's descent into drug addiction began when he was assigned to infiltrate a gang of drug dealers as part of an undercover operation. During the raid, he claimed he accidentally inhaled fumes of heroin and was offered more by the dealer. He then became increasingly dependent on the drug, spending his evenings injecting himself with heroin at home before driving to work the following day.

The officer's addiction eventually led him to steal from work, including £200 from the station cash machine and £400 from a colleague's bag. He was caught red-handed and suspended from duty pending an internal investigation.

Mr Carroll, who has now been sacked from his job, admitted stealing the money and said he had lost control of his addiction. He blamed the pressure of the job for his descent into drug addiction, claiming he felt like he couldn't say no to his fellow officers or the people he was trying to catch.

Speaking about the incident, Mr Carroll said: "It started off as just trying something once, and then it escalated from there. I just lost control and couldn't stop."

He added that he regrets what he did and has no excuses for his actions. "I have no idea how I let myself get to this point. It was just a downward spiral from there on in."
