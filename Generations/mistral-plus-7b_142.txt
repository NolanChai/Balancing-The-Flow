Cheetahs use a combination of stealth, speed, and flexibility in a similar manner to that of a secret agent. They are extremely fast, able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just three seconds, and their agility is unmatched by most other animals. In order to remain undetected, they rely on their camouflage and their ability to blend into their surroundings. Once they have spotted potential prey, they will stalk them for a prolonged period of time before making their move. They are also known for their incredible flexibility as they often need to contort their bodies in order to make sharp turns while running at high speeds.
