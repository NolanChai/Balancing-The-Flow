California officials said Tuesday that they would not be releasing all of the state's 33,000 prisoners and would instead submit plans to the federal courts in two weeks detailing how they plan to reduce prison overcrowding in accordance with a U.S. Supreme Court order this week. The court ruled that California's prisons were dangerously overcrowded and ordered officials to release thousands of inmates within six months or face potential intervention by the federal judiciary.

The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) said it was working with legislators, law enforcement groups and other stakeholders to develop a plan that would ensure the safety of prisoners and the public while complying with the Supreme Court's ruling. The CDCR said the plan would include releasing some nonviolent inmates who pose little risk to society, expanding parole opportunities for others, increasing prison healthcare services and expanding treatment programs for prisoners suffering from mental illnesses or drug addictions.
