The TV show, "Ford Nation," which aired on CNN, was pulled from the network's schedule after only one episode due to low ratings. Despite its premature cancellation, the show had generated significant controversy and criticism since its debut on Monday. Many viewers were shocked by Ford's unapologetic and often offensive behavior on camera, while others praised his raw and unfiltered honesty. In a statement released Tuesday, CNN said that they had made the decision to cancel "Ford Nation" due to low viewer interest and the potential for further controversy. The network also expressed regret for airing the show in the first place, citing Ford's well-documented struggles with addiction and his recent death from cancer.
