 The man, who has not been named, is currently in custody in France after being arrested for the murder of his former wife. During an interview with police, he claimed to have no memory of the incident and stated that he did not know why he committed such a violent act.

The victim's body was discovered in her home, covered in multiple stab wounds and with a pig mask placed over her face. It is unclear what the man intended to achieve by placing the mask on her face, but it is believed to be a reference to his ex-wife's profession as a veterinarian.

The man has denied any wrongdoing and has claimed that he did not have any motive for attacking his former wife. However, police are still investigating the case and are looking into possible evidence linking him to the murder.
