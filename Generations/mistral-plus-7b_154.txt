Record numbers of British couples are heading abroad to get married in a bid to avoid the spiralling cost of weddings.

With an average cost of Â£25,000 for a wedding in Britain, many are choosing to tie the knot abroad where costs can be less than half that.

Italy is proving particularly popular with couples and has become one of the most fashionable locations for a foreign wedding.

Many venues offer an all-inclusive package which includes the reception venue, food, accommodation and entertainment.

Italian weddings are also popular due to their relaxed atmosphere.

A new survey by holiday company Splendia found that 38 per cent of British couples have considered getting married abroad with Italy being one of the most popular destinations.

One reason for this is the lack of bureaucracy involved in getting married in Italy, compared with Britain.

Couples can get married on a whim at a registry office in Italy and do not need to wait six months before they tie the knot.
