In February 2009, Sam Bassett got called to Gov. Rick Perry’s office for a meeting about the Texas Department of Transportation. It was a job he had wanted since childhood, and it finally seemed like his dream was coming true. But there was one thing Perry wanted him to do first.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I want you to take this bill through the Legislature,'” Bassett recalled. “I asked him what it was, and he handed me a piece of paper with House Bill 20 written on it.”

House Bill 20 would allow Texans to carry concealed handguns without a permit. It also did away with rules that required people who wanted a gun license to take a class, submit fingerprints and pass a background check. The bill was controversial for many reasons, but Perry made it clear he wanted it passed.

Bassett had just been named the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), which oversees the state’s law enforcement agencies. He knew this was going to be a difficult task, especially since the governor had asked him to lead the charge on such an unpopular piece of legislation. But he also knew that if he didn’t do it, someone else would. So he took a deep breath and got ready for the fight of his life.

Over the next few months, Bassett worked tirelessly to get HB 20 passed through both chambers of the Texas Legislature. He faced opposition from law enforcement officials across the state, as well as gun control advocates who argued that making it easier for people to carry guns would lead to more crime and violence. But he was determined to see this bill become law, no matter what.

In May 2009, HB 20 finally made its way through both chambers of the Texas Legislature and was signed into law by Gov. Perry. It was a victory for Bassett, who had worked so hard to make it happen. But he knew that this was just the beginning — now he would have to work even harder to ensure that Texans were able to exercise their Second Amendment rights without fear of repercussions or consequences.
