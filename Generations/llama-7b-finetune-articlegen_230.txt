Brian Moore has been named as a substitute for the touring British and Irish Lions side to play New Zealand in Auckland.

The 38-year-old is the only front rower on the squad, but will be forced to wait at least until July before he takes part in any of the Tests. The former England skipper has not played since suffering a stress fracture against Ireland last September and was initially given an eight month lay-off by his club side Wasps. Moore's injury is unlikely to keep him out for the whole campaign, but he will miss Wasps' run-in in the Heineken Cup as well as any action this summer with the Lions. Moore has been included on the bench after a stunning recovery from ankle surgery which threatened his place on the tour. 'Brian is just going to have to be patient and wait for his opportunity,' said coach Warren Gatland. 'He is looking good, but he's still some way away. He has been training hard for us and doing a lot of rehab work. We'll see what happens after the Lions tour.' Moore joined Wasps from Leicester Tigers in 2006 following an outstanding career that included winning four Premiership titles with the Tiger and being capped on 51 occasions for England. His place in the squad has come at the expense of Wales back-rower Alix Popham, who has a calf injury and will miss the rest of the season. The British and Irish Lions are due to play two warm-up matches against Crusaders (June 8) and Wellington (June 15) before tackling New Zealand in the first Test at Eden Park on June 26.
