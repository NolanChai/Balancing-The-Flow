The Bianconeri had lost the first leg of their matchup with Real Madrid 1-3 and it seemed that they were on course for a similar result this weekend. Lazio were playing in white, the same color as Real Madrid's kit, but Juventus turned around their fortunes at the Stadio Olimpico by putting in a strong performance on Sunday afternoon.

Juventus got off to an excellent start with two quick goals from Douglas Costa and Paulo Dybala in the first half-hour of play. The pair put away chances which they should have been expected to convert as Lazio's defenders struggled to cope with Juve's pace and precision.

Juventus kept their foot on the gas after the break but couldn't find a third goal before the final whistle, instead having to make do with their 2-0 win which puts them firmly in pole position to claim another Scudetto title this season.

Lazio were left to rue their missed opportunities as they now lie fifth on the table behind Juventus's closest rivals Napoli and Inter Milan, who play each other at San Siro tonight.
