 It seems that the university students' union made an unfortunate mistake by using a symbol associated with Nazi Germany for their German-themed event advertisement. The SS (Schutzstaffel) was a powerful organization within the Nazi Party, and its victory symbol is widely recognized as offensive and hurtful to many people due to its association with Nazism and the horrific atrocities committed during World War II.

To avoid such incidents in the future, it's crucial that organizations take extra care when planning events that involve cultural themes. It may be helpful to consult with experts or individuals from relevant communities to ensure sensitivity and avoid unintentionally causing offense. In this case, I hope that the apology offered by the students' union is sincere and helps to educate its members about the importance of being mindful of historical symbols and their meanings.
