The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer.
Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers from a rare condition called cleidocranial dysostosis, which means his skull and collarbone are malformed. As a result, his head is permanently twisted and hangs at an unusual angle.
Despite numerous surgeries to try and correct the condition, Mahendra's head remains fixed in place. His parents have now revealed they would rather he died than continue to endure the constant pain and embarrassment he faces.
"I cannot see my child suffering like this," his mother, Shobha Ahirwar, told local media. "It is better that he dies than living with this condition. I don't want him to go through all this humiliation."
Mahendra's father, Ram Naresh Ahirwar, added: "We have tried everything to help our son but nothing seems to work. It's heartbreaking to see him in so much pain and discomfort. We just want him to be free from all this suffering."
The family has been struggling to provide proper care for Mahendra due to financial constraints, and have recently launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for his treatment. However, despite their efforts, they remain hopeless about his future.
"We are doing everything we can to help our son but it's just not enough," Ram Naresh said. "We cannot afford the expensive surgeries he needs and it seems like there is no other option left for us."
Mahendra's condition has already had a significant impact on his education, as he struggles to attend school due to the constant pain and discomfort. His parents fear that if nothing changes, he will be unable to lead a normal life.
"We want our son to have a better future but it seems like that is not possible," Shobha said. "We just want him to be happy and healthy, but it seems like that is not going to happen."
