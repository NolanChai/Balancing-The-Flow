 and bomb-making documents in his flat.
Al-Khori, who moved to the UK in 2013, was arrested in May last year after officers searched his property in Newcastle.
He was found with 678 grams of hydrogen peroxide, a key ingredient in making explosives, as well as other chemicals and documents detailing how to make bombs.
Police also discovered that Al-Khori had been in contact with a terrorist group in Syria, and he was suspected of planning an attack on UK soil.
Al-Khori, who worked as a doctor in Syria before moving to the UK, was found guilty of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life at Newcastle Crown Court last week. He was sentenced to six years in prison.
Detective Chief Inspector Steve Mï¿½rey, from Northumbria Police, said: 'This case highlights the extreme danger posed by those who seek to cause harm to innocent people.
'Faris Al-Khori had a significant stockpile of explosives and bomb-making materials in his home, and he was actively engaging with terrorist groups abroad.
'Thanks to the diligence and professionalism of our officers, we were able to prevent what could have been a catastrophic attack on UK soil.'
