The video shows Limmy lying in bed with his mouth open when suddenly a huge black spider emerges from his mouth and starts crawling across his face. Despite looking terrified, Limmy tries to stay calm and slowly lifts his head off the pillow to give the spider more space to move. He captioned the video: "Spider crawled out of my mouth while I was sleeping. No idea how it got in there either." The video has racked up thousands of likes and comments on Instagram, with fans expressing their shock and disgust at the bizarre sight. One user wrote: "Wtf is wrong with you? That's terrifying!", while another said: "Holy s**t that's crazy!" A third added: "How did it get in there?! It's like something out of a horror movie." Despite the shocking incident, Limmy seemed unbothered by the spider's presence and even managed to crack a smile during the video. He is yet to make any further comments on the unexpected visitor. The comedian has been active on social media this year, sharing hilarious sketches and stand-up routines with his fans.
