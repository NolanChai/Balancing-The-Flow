Michael Phelps made a winning return to competitive racing as the 18-time Olympic gold-medallist claimed 100 meters butterfly victory at the Arena Pro Swim Series in Arizona.
Phelps, back in action after taking a break from the sport last year, touched the wall in 49.67 seconds to beat world champion Tom Shields and Japan's Kosuke Hagino.
The 31-year-old Phelps was competing in his first meet since the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where he won five golds and retired from the sport.
"It felt great to get back out there and race," Phelps said. "I'm glad I could come out here and compete against some of the best in the world."
Phelps, who holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals won by an individual, will compete in the 200 meters butterfly and 4x100 meters medley relay at the upcoming World Championships in Budapest.
He has said he plans to compete in several meets this year, including the Tokyo Olympics in July, where he hopes to add to his medal count.
