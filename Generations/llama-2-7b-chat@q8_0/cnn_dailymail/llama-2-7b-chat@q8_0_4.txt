 2012, made the controversial decision to switch allegiance last year after claiming he was not given sufficient support by British Taekwondo.
Speaking exclusively to ESPN, Cook revealed that he has been working with Moldova's national team coaches for several months and is confident of winning a medal at the Games. "I have had enough of being overlooked and under-supported," Cook said. "Moldova have shown me more interest and support than Britain ever did, so I am going to take my talents there and show the world what I can do."
Cook claimed that he was not picked for the British team in 2012 because of his weight, despite being ranked number one in Europe at the time. He also criticized the lack of funding and resources available to British taekwondo fighters, saying that it made it impossible to reach his full potential.
Cook's decision to switch allegiance has sparked controversy within the sport, with some accusing him of being disloyal and others praising him for taking a brave step. However, Cook is adamant that he has made the right choice. "I am not doing this for personal glory or recognition," he said. "I am doing it because I want to compete at the highest level and win medals. I believe Moldova gives me the best chance of doing that."
Cook's move to Moldova is expected to be formalized in the coming weeks, and he will begin training with the national team in preparation for Rio 2016. His decision has also raised questions about the future of British taekwondo, with some calling for greater investment in grassroots development and coaching to prevent more talented fighters from switching allegiance.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has yet to comment on Cook's decision, but it is expected that he will be eligible to compete for Moldova at Rio 2016 provided he meets the qualification criteria.
