ool in California was one of 40 students selected to ask the President questions at the White House as part of the annual STEM Fair.
The 12-year-old boy didn't waste any time in getting straight to the point when he approached the podium, asking the President if he had seen his science project on "the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems."
President Obama began to ramble on about climate change and its impact on coastal ecosystems, but Osman was not deterred. With a confident smile, he interrupted the President and said, "Excuse me Mr. President, could you please answer my question directly?"
The room fell silent as the President looked taken aback by the bold move, but he quickly regained his composure and responded to Osman's question with a smile.
"Wow, that's an impressive project," Obama said. "I think it's great that you're thinking about these issues at such a young age."
The crowd erupted in applause as Osman beamed with pride, realizing he had just successfully held the President accountable for not answering his question directly.
Despite the initial shock of being interrupted, President Obama handled the situation with grace and humor, showing that he is still a master of the political arena even in his final year as President.
