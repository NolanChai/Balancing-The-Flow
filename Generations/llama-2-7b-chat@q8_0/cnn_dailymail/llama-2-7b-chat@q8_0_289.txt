Trump's staffer, Dan Scavino Jr., retweeted a message from an account that linked to a conservative blog post with the headline "Hillary's Cover-Up: New Evidence Reveals She Knew About Benghazi Attack in Real Time." The post claimed to have evidence that Clinton was aware of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, as it was happening, and that she had lied about her role in the events surrounding the attack.
The post was quickly debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations and journalists, who pointed out that there was no new evidence to support the claim and that the blog post was based on conspiracy theories that have been thoroughly discredited.
Despite these criticisms, Scavino's retweet managed to attract a lot of attention, with many Twitter users expressing their outrage at what they saw as a baseless attack on Clinton's character. Some critics accused Scavino and Trump of using the Benghazi issue to distract from more pressing political issues, while others pointed out that Clinton had already been cleared of any wrongdoing by independent investigations into the attack.
The incident highlighted the politically charged atmosphere in which Clinton is running for president, with many Republicans eager to exploit her controversial past for political gain. It also underscored the challenges facing Trump and his campaign as they try to shift the focus away from their own scandals and toward Clinton's perceived weaknesses.
