As the world celebrates the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death, a growing number of writers are questioning the importance of his works and those of other classic authors. Some argue that the traditional literary canon is outdated and irrelevant in today's society, and are instead turning to new voices and unconventional forms of storytelling.

"The works of Shakespeare and other classic authors have been the bedrock of Western literature for centuries, but they don't speak to the experiences and concerns of contemporary society," says novelist and critic, Deborah Treisman. "It's time to move beyond these dusty old texts and embrace new voices and perspectives."
Treisman is part of a growing movement of writers who are rejecting the traditional literary canon in favor of more modern and diverse works. They argue that the classic authors, such as Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, are out of touch with the complexities and challenges of today's world.

"The literary canon has been shaped by a narrow group of white men, and it reflects their experiences and viewpoints," says novelist and essayist, Roxane Gay. "We need to expand the scope of what we consider 'great literature' and include works that reflect the diversity of our society."
Gay and other writers are advocating for a more inclusive approach to literature, one that includes works by women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ authors. They argue that these voices have been marginalized or excluded from the traditional literary canon, and that it's time to give them the recognition they deserve.

But not everyone is on board with this movement. Some critics argue that the traditional literary canon has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant today. They point out that these works have endured for centuries, and continue to be studied and loved by readers around the world.
"The classic authors have a timeless quality that transcends their historical context," says literary critic, Harold Bloom. "They speak to universal human experiences and emotions, and they continue to inspire and challenge readers today."
Bloom and other critics argue that the traditional literary canon should be preserved and cherished, rather than discarded in favor of more modern and diverse works. They believe that these works have a unique place in the history of literature, and that they deserve to be studied and appreciated for their own sake.

The debate over the traditional literary canon is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. But one thing is clear: the world of literature is changing, and the voices of new generations of writers are being heard. Whether or not these works will eventually supplant the classics remains to be seen, but it's clear that the literary landscape is evolving in exciting and unpredictable ways.
