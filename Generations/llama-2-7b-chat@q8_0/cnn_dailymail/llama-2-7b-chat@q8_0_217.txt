An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board.
The pensioner, who was travelling in economy class, became disruptive and refused to follow instructions from the crew, according to airline sources.
She began shouting and swearing at fellow passengers and crew members, causing a significant disturbance on the flight.
The flight captain made the decision to divert the plane to Shannon Airport as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all on board.
The elderly woman was met by airport security personnel when the plane landed at Shannon Airport and was taken into custody for questioning.
Air Canada said in a statement: "We apologize for any inconvenience this diversion may have caused our passengers, but the safety of everyone on board is always our top priority."
