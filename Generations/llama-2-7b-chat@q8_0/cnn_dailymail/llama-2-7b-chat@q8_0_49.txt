Alcaraz and Distin are both out of contract at the end of the season and have been linked with moves away from Goodison Park. However, Martinez believes there is still a role for both players in his plans, provided they continue to perform at a high level.
"It's important to look at each player individually and see if they can maintain their standards," Martinez told Everton's official website. "Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin are both great professionals who have been very important for the club, but we need to assess whether they can still contribute in the same way next season.
"We will give them every opportunity to show us that they can be part of our future plans, but ultimately it's about finding the right balance and making decisions that are good for the team."
Martinez also revealed that he has held talks with both players about their futures at the club.
"I have spoken to Antolin and Sylvain separately and they are both eager to prove themselves," he added. "They know we will make decisions based on what's best for the team, but they want to show us that they can still be important figures here."
