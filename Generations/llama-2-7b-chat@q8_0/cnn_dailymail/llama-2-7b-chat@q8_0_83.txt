 the Gunners since 1996, has always been known for his meticulous approach to team selection, and it seems he spends hours pondering over who will start each game.
Wenger revealed in an interview with beIN Sports: "I don't make the final decision until the morning of the match. I have a lot of information to take into account - formations, opposition, injuries, suspensions and of course the players' fitness levels. It can be very agonising at times!"
Wenger has always been known for his willingness to rotate his squad and give young players a chance in the team, but he insists that his decision-making process is not just about giving opportunities to the next generation of players.
He added: "It's not just about giving chances to young players - it's about finding the right balance and the right combination of players to win the game. It's a very difficult job, but that's why I love it."
