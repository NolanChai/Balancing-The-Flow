 over his future at Stamford Bridge.
Juventus have long been admirers of Oscar, who is contracted to Chelsea until 2019, and they see him as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba, who left the club last summer to join Manchester United.
Liverpool are also interested in Oscar and see him as an ideal addition to their midfield, where he would provide creativity and vision alongside Emre Can and Jordan Henderson.
Chelsea are reluctant to sell Oscar, however, and will only consider offers in excess of £50m for the 24-year-old. That could prove to be a significant obstacle to any potential deal, particularly given the current financial constraints at Juventus.
Meanwhile, Oscar has reportedly told friends that he is unhappy with his situation at Chelsea and would welcome the opportunity to move elsewhere in search of regular first-team football.
Oscar’s agent, Wagner Ribeiro, has been in contact with several European clubs in recent weeks, including Juventus and Liverpool, as he seeks to explore potential transfer options for his client.
