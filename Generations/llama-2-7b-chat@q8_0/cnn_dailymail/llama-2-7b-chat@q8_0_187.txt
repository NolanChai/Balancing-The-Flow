 footage showed a huge sandstorm engulfing a city in China, with roads and buildings obscured by thick clouds of dust.
In recent months, similar storms have hit countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. They are known as khamsin events, which occur when a high-pressure system sits over the region for several days, causing hot air to rise and dust to be picked up. But experts cannot agree on why these storms have become so frequent in recent years.
Some say climate change is playing a role, with rising temperatures and changing weather patterns leading to more frequent extreme weather events. Others point to changes in land use, such as desertification or overgrazing, which can increase the amount of loose dust in the atmosphere. And then there are those who blame the growing number of dust storms on a natural cycle - with scientists suggesting that the region's climate has always experienced periods of drought and sandstorms.
Regardless of the cause, the frequency and intensity of these storms is causing problems for people living in affected areas. Dust can reduce visibility to just a few meters, making it difficult or impossible to drive or fly. In some cases, it can also aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma.
In the case of China's dust storm, authorities were forced to cancel flights and close roads in several cities after the storm hit on Tuesday. The city of Xi'an was particularly hard hit, with footage showing buildings and cars buried under thick clouds of dust.
The frequency and intensity of khamsin events may be linked to climate change, but it is not clear why they have become more frequent in recent years, according to Dr David Parsons, a meteorologist at the University of Reading. He told BBC News: "It's likely that a combination of factors is contributing to these events, including changes in land use and desertification."
The storms are also causing problems for farmers in the region, who rely on clear skies to grow crops. In some cases, the dust can make it difficult for plants to get enough sunlight, leading to lower yields and economic losses.
In Saudi Arabia, the government has launched a major project aimed at reducing the impact of sandstorms on roads and buildings. The programme involves planting more than 10 million trees across the country, which will help to reduce dust levels by up to 25%.
Dr Parsons said: "While there is still much to learn about these events, it's clear that they are having a significant impact on people's lives in the region." He added that more research was needed to understand why khamsin events were becoming more frequent and how they could be mitigated.
In conclusion, while climate change may be contributing to the increased frequency of dust storms in the region, it is not clear why they have become so frequent in recent years. Experts suggest that a combination of factors, including changes in land use and desertification, are likely to be involved. The impact on people's lives in affected areas cannot be overstated, with reduced visibility making travel and transportation difficult or impossible and the potential for health problems such as respiratory issues. Further research is needed to understand these events better and how they can be mitigated.
