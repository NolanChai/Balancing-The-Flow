2019, last played a Test match in 2017 and had been out of the side since due to a combination of form and injury issues.
However, with opener Tom Latham nursing a calf injury, Guptill has been given another chance at the top level, along with fellow opener Will Young, who also hasn't played a Test match since 2017. "We're looking forward to having Martin back in the Test squad," said New Zealand coach Gary Stead. "He's a world-class batsman and his recent form in limited-overs cricket has been impressive. We believe he can add value to our top order."
Guptill himself expressed his excitement at being given another chance in the longest format of the game. "I'm really looking forward to getting back into Test cricket," he said. "It's a format I love playing and I've been working hard on my game in the hope of contributing to the team's success."
The two-match Test series against England starts on September 1 at Mount Maunganui, followed by the second match in Hamilton from September 3.
