 the upcoming Formula E championship.
The car, known as the 'Drive eO Electric Race Car', uses advanced battery technology and a high-performance powertrain to deliver an estimated 1,050 horsepower. This makes it significantly more powerful than the Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode', which produces 762 horsepower.
The car's high power output is achieved through the use of advanced battery technology, including solid state batteries and a high-performance powertrain. The vehicle also features aerodynamic bodywork to improve downforce and reduce drag, allowing it to achieve high speeds on the race track.
Drive eO plans to enter the car into the upcoming Formula E championship, which is an all-electric racing series that takes place on street courses around the world. The company hopes to use the car to showcase the performance and efficiency of electric vehicles, as well as to develop new technologies for future generations of electric cars.
"We are very excited about the potential of this car," said Roberts Vasiljevs, CEO of Drive eO. "We believe it has the potential to be one of the fastest electric race cars in the world, and we look forward to competing with it in the Formula E championship."
The Drive eO Electric Race Car is expected to make its competition debut in the upcoming season of the Formula E championship. The exact details of the car's specifications have not been released at this time.
