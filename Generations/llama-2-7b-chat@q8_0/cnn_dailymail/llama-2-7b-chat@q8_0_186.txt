Made in Chelsea: The Best Fashion Moments
If there is one thing the Made In Chelsea cast are known for it's their love of shopping. In fact, barely an episode goes by where they're not filmed swanning around the boutiques that line the fashionable King's Road in London. And let's be real, who can blame them? With designer duds at every turn and a cast of stylish characters to inspire you, it's no wonder the show has become synonymous with fashion. From Binky's love of luxury brands like Alexander McQueen to Jamie's penchant for streetwear, here are some of the best fashion moments from Made in Chelsea:
1) Binky's Fashion Frenzy: Binky has always been one of the most fashion-forward members of the cast, and her love of luxury brands is no secret. From designer dresses to statement accessories, she's never been afraid to push the boundaries when it comes to style. In fact, one of her most iconic moments came when she rocked up to a party in a custom-made Alexander McQueen gown that left everyone in awe. Talk about making an entrance!
2) Jamie's Streetwear Obsession: While Binky prefers high-end fashion, Jamie has always been more of a streetwear fan. From his Adidas trainers to his Supreme hoodies, he's never been afraid to embrace the latest trends. And let's be real, who can resist that adorable smile of his?
3) Sophie's Fashion Phobia: On the other hand, not everyone in the cast is as fashion-forward as Binky and Jamie. Enter Sophie, who has a bit of a love-hate relationship with fashion. While she's never been shy about rocking up to events in her trusty wellington boots, there was one episode where she admitted to being scared of fashion. Talk about relatable!
4) Frankie's Fashion Mishaps: Speaking of fashion mishaps, let's not forget Frankie's infamous wardrobe malfunction. Remember that time she wore a dress that was slightly too small and ended up flashing more than she intended? Classic Made in Chelsea moment right there!
5) Proudlock's Style Evolution: Last but not least, let's give a shout-out to Proudlock who has undergone quite the style evolution over the years. From his early days as a gym-obsessed hunk to his more recent incarnation as a stylish and confident singleton, he's come a long way fashion-wise. And let's be real, who can resist that chiseled jawline of his?
Overall, while Made in Chelsea is primarily known for its drama and romance, the show has also given us some unforgettable fashion moments over the years. Whether you're a fan of high-end designer dresses or streetwear staples, there's something for everyone in this stylish cast of characters!
