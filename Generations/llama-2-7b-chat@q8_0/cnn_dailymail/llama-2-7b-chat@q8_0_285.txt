metics industry leads the way.
For some time now there have been claims that insects are a good source of protein. It is said that 100g of grasshoppers contain about 13g of protein, while a kilogram of beef has just over 20g. In addition to being rich in protein they are also low in fat and high in iron.
But itâ€™s not just about the nutritional benefits. The environmental impact of insect farming is also significant. It has been estimated that one pound of crickets requires only half a gallon of water compared with 1,000 gallons needed to produce one pound of beef.
Now the cosmetics industry is set to take advantage of this trend. The first insect-based beauty products are already on sale and they include face creams, lip balms and even eyeshadows containing cricket powder.
The idea is that by using insects as an ingredient in skincare products they will provide additional benefits such as anti-aging properties or improved skin hydration. 
Certainly, there are some advantages to using insect powder in cosmetics. The high protein content makes it a good moisturising agent and it is also said to have soothing properties. However, we need more research before we can conclusively say that insect-based products are the next big thing in skincare.
In conclusion, while there are some potential benefits of using insect powder in cosmetics, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness and safety as a skincare ingredient. However, if the trend towards edible insects continues, it may not be long before we are all sprinkling crickets on our faces for their beauty benefits.
