An artist has carved out a unique genre for herself with her colorful portraits of celebrity bottoms. Spanish artist Catalina Viejo, 31, who is based in New York, paints miniature pictures from candies and chocolates to create highly detailed images of famous buttocks. From Jennifer Lopez to Kim Kardashian, the artist has captured the curvaceous derrieres of some of Hollywood's most popular stars.
Viejo's passion for art started at a young age when she would spend hours doodling and drawing with her crayons. She studied fine arts in college but found herself drawn to the world of fashion and beauty. It was during this time that she discovered her love for creating intricate designs using food as her medium.
'I was experimenting with different techniques and materials when I realized that I could use food to create art,' Viejo told Dailymail.com. 'It was a game-changer for me because it allowed me to be creative without having to worry about the traditional constraints of painting.'
Viejo has spent years perfecting her craft, experimenting with different types of candies and chocolates to achieve the right texture and color. She uses a small scalpel to carve out the details of each portrait, taking great care to ensure that every curve and bump is captured perfectly.
The end result is a series of vibrant and playful portraits that celebrate the beauty of the human form. Each piece takes Viejo around 20-30 hours to complete and she only works on one portrait at a time to ensure maximum attention to detail. 'It's a very meditative process for me,' she said. 'I find myself getting lost in the details and losing track of time.'
Viejo's work has gained international recognition, with her portraits being exhibited in galleries around the world. She has also collaborated with several fashion brands and celebrities, creating one-of-a-kind pieces for their campaigns and events.
While some may find the subject matter of Viejo's art to be unconventional, she believes that it's exactly what makes her work unique and special. 'I want my portraits to make people smile and laugh,' she said. 'Art should be fun and playful, not always serious and stuffy.'
And the artist seems to be succeeding in her mission. Her Instagram account has gained over 100,000 followers who eagerly await each new portrait she posts. Viejo's work is a reminder that art doesn't have to be traditional or conventional to be beautiful and meaningful. Sometimes, it just takes a little creativity and a lot of candy to create something truly special.
