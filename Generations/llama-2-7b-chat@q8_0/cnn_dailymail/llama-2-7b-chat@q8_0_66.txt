romatosis Type 1 (NF1), a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body.
Heslip's condition has left him with hundreds of lumps covering his face, neck and torso. Despite his unusual appearance, Heslip said he feels like he finally has a sense of belonging after being featured in this week's issue of the National Geographic magazine.  "I felt like I didn't belong anywhere, like I was an outcast," Heslip told CNN affiliate KNXV. "But now I feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself."
Heslip said he wants to help raise awareness about NF1 and other rare genetic disorders. He hopes his story will inspire others who may be suffering from similar conditions to speak out and seek support.  "I want people to know that they're not alone," Heslip said. "There are people like me out there, and we're here to help each other."
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately one in 3,000 people worldwide, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. It causes noncancerous tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. While NF1 is not cancerous, it can cause a variety of symptoms such as headaches, vision problems, and skin abnormalities. There is no cure for NF1, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms and prevent complications.
In addition to Heslip's story, the National Geographic issue also features profiles on other individuals with rare genetic disorders, including a young girl born without eyes and a boy who was born with a rare skin condition that causes his body to produce too much melanin.
"Rarely Seen: Portraits of Life with Rare Genetic Disorders," the National Geographic issue dedicated to these individuals and their families, is on newsstands now.
