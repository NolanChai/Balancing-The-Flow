More than half of U.S. high schoolers have tried vaping, but most don't become regular users - study | Fox News
Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few adopt the electronic devices as habit, a new study has found. According to the study published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 70% of high school students in the US reported having ever tried an e-cigarette, while only about 13% reported using them on a daily basis.
While many teenagers are curious about vaping, most do not become regular users. The study found that the majority of those who tried vaping did so out of curiosity or because their friends were using them. However, few continued to use e-cigarettes regularly after the initial try.
The researchers note that the low rate of regular vaping among teenagers may be due to parental restrictions on access to e-cigarettes, as well as the perception that vaping is not cool or trendy anymore since it has become more widely known and regulated.
