low has now led to an unexpected side effect: skin so dry it crackles when you laugh or even talk.
This is not the first time that the trend for fake tanning has had an adverse effect on people’s skin health. Earlier this year, dermatologists warned that using self-tanners could cause long-term damage to the skin, including premature ageing and a higher risk of skin cancer.
However, despite these warnings, many women are still keen to achieve their tanning goals – even if it means putting their skin at risk. Some have admitted to using self-tanners as often as three times a week in order to maintain the perfect glow.
One woman who is particularly concerned about the impact of fake tan on her skin is Sarah, 28, from London. She has been using self-tanners for several years and says that her skin now feels so dry it crackles when she laughs or talks. ‘I’ve tried to cut back on how often I use them but I just can’t seem to get the hang of it,’ she said.
Sarah is not alone in her concerns – many other women have taken to social media to share their experiences of dry, cracked skin after using fake tanners. Some have even created hashtags such as #FakeTanFails and #DrySkincrisis to document their struggles with the product.
Despite the growing concern about the impact of fake tan on skin health, many beauty brands continue to promote their products as a quick fix for achieving a sun-kissed glow without the need for UV exposure. In fact, some have even released new lines of self-tanners that are specifically designed to combat dryness and leave skin feeling soft and smooth.
But dermatologists say it’s important to be realistic about what these products can offer – and to understand their limitations when it comes to achieving healthy, glowing skin. ‘Self-tanners may help to give you a temporary tan but they won’t replace the benefits of spending time in the sun safely,’ said Dr Sam Bunting, a dermatologist based in London.
So what can women do to achieve their tanning goals without putting their skin at risk? One option is to embrace natural methods of tanning, such as spray tanning or tanning beds that use UV-free light technology. These methods can provide a similar glow without the long-term damage associated with fake tan.
Another option is to focus on caring for your skin in other ways – by using moisturisers and exfoliating regularly to keep it looking healthy and hydrated. By taking these steps, you may find that you don’t need to rely on self-tanners quite so much after all.
In conclusion, while fake tan can provide a quick fix for achieving a sun-kissed glow, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks associated with its use – especially when it comes to skin dryness and cracking. By exploring alternative methods of tanning or focusing on proper skin care, women can achieve their tanning goals without compromising their skin health.
