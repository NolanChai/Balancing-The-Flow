911 operators a detailed account of what the children, ages 6 and 8 were doing and claimed they were left alone without supervision.
The call was placed at around 5:30 PM on Saturday when the children were playing outside near their home in Silver Spring, Maryland. The person who made the call stated that the two children were barely clothed, were not wearing shoes, and that one of them had a bloody knee.
The operator asked the caller if they knew where the children's parents or caregivers were, but the caller replied that they did not know their location. The operator then told the caller to stay on the line until police arrived.
After police arrived, the two children were taken into custody and held for five hours before their parents were able to secure their release.
Police have since confirmed that the children were not in any immediate danger and that they had been left alone momentarily while their parents ran errands nearby. The Montgomery County Department of Social Services (DSS) has also stated that they are investigating the incident to determine if any neglect or abuse occurred.
The case has sparked a heated debate on social media with many people expressing outrage over the way the children were treated by authorities. Some have argued that the parents should have been allowed to pick up their children immediately, while others have defended the actions of the police and CPS.
As a result of this incident, Maryland lawmakers are now considering changes to state laws regarding 'free range' parenting.
