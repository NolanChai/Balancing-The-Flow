(SAN FRANCISCO) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered a 25 percent overall cutback in water use by cities and towns in the Golden State on Wednesday, but as these photos taken on Saturday show, the ongoing drought is already taking a toll on the state's water supply.
The photos show the dry, cracked earth and withered vegetation that have become all too common in California due to the prolonged drought.
Brown's order requires cities and towns to reduce their water usage by 25 percent compared to 2013 levels, and he gave them until February 2016 to reach that goal.
"The time of abundance is behind us," Brown said in a statement. "California families and farmers are going to have to use water more efficiently, use it more wisely, and use it in a more sustainable way."
The drought, which has been ongoing since 2012, has already had severe consequences for California, including devastating wildfires, crop losses and the death of millions of trees. The lack of water has also led to restrictions on industrial use, irrigation and urban areas.
The order is the latest in a series of measures taken by Brown to address the drought, which he has called "the greatest challenge of our generation."
The California Department of Water Resources said in a statement that the state's water storage is at 71 percent of its capacity, compared to an average of 86 percent for this time of year.
The department also reported that the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which provides about a third of California's water supply, is at just 25 percent of average for this time of year.
Brown's order requires cities and towns to take a number of steps to reduce their water use, including:
* Reducing urban water use by 25 percent through the use of more efficient irrigation systems, water-efficient appliances and fixtures, and other measures.
* Implementing water conservation measures in public schools, hospitals and other state buildings.
* Encouraging the use of drought-resistant landscaping in public spaces.
Brown has also called on California residents to take action by reducing their own water use and supporting the development of new technologies that can help conserve water.
The governor's order comes as no surprise, given the severity of the drought and the ongoing dry conditions in California. The state has been working to address the crisis for months, but the situation remains dire.
"We need to do more than just make do with less," Brown said in his statement. "We need to change our relationship with water and use it in a more sustainable way."
