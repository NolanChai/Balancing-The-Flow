Researchers at New Zealand's University of Otago gave a group of mice a diet rich in peanuts and then infected them with a strain of E. coli bacteria known to cause food poisoning. The results were astonishing: the mice that had consumed peanuts every day had significantly higher levels of beneficial gut bacteria, including those that produce antimicrobial compounds, than the unpeanut-fed mice.
Peanuts are rich in polyphenols and other plant compounds that have been shown to support gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms. The skins of peanuts contain even more of these beneficial compounds than the kernels themselves, so eating them without their skins may be especially beneficial for gut health.
Overall, this research suggests that consuming a handful of unroasted peanuts every day could help promote overall gut health and reduce the risk of food poisoning from E. coli bacteria. Of course, it's important to note that proper food handling and storage practices should always be followed to prevent any type of foodborne illness.
In addition to their potential health benefits, peanuts are also a tasty snack that can be enjoyed on their own or added to a variety of dishes for extra flavor and nutrition. So go ahead and give your gut some love with a daily handful of peanuts â€“ your body (and taste buds) will thank you!
