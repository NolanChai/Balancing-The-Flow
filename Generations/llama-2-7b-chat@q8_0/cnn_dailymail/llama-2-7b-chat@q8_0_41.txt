Dramatic footage has emerged of the Hatton Garden safe deposit facility heist, showing how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery. The footage, obtained by ITV News, shows the gang breaking into the vault on April 2, and then returning on April 4 and 5 to empty the remaining safes.
The gang of thieves used a drill to break through the vault door and then made off with an estimated Â£14 million worth of valuables. The heist has been described as one of the most brazen in British criminal history, and has left police scrambling to catch those responsible.
As the investigation continues, it has emerged that police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm that was triggered during the robbery. The alarm was triggered by a security guard who noticed suspicious activity at the vault, but no one responded to the alert.
'It is clear that the police and security companies involved in this case dropped the ball,' said Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who has been following the investigation. 'They failed to take the alarm seriously, and now they may have to pay the price for their negligence.'
The heist has also raised questions about the security measures in place at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, and how the thieves were able to carry out such a brazen robbery without being caught. The company has issued a statement expressing its shock and disbelief at the incident, and promising to cooperate fully with the investigation.
Police have arrested six people in connection with the heist, but the mastermind behind the operation remains on the run. The investigation is ongoing, and police are urging anyone with information about the robbery to come forward.
