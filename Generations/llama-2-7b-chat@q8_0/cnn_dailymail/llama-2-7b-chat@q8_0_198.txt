The warning comes as a new investigation into the crash revealed that Lubitz had been suffering from severe depression but still managed to fly commercial jets with passengers on board.
MI5, the UK’s domestic intelligence agency, has identified a growing trend of ‘insider threats’ where workers in key sectors are turning their skills and knowledge against their employers or the public.
In a report seen by The Times, MI5 warns that rogue workers could use their expertise to wreak havoc on Britain’s critical infrastructure, including power plants, transport networks and healthcare services.
The alert comes as police are investigating how Lubitz managed to carry out the attack on Germanwings Flight 9525 despite showing signs of mental illness.
It is feared that rogue workers could use their knowledge to cause chaos in Britain’s transport network, including train stations and airports, or target power plants and other critical infrastructure.
MI5 has warned the Government that insider threats are a growing concern and have called for increased security measures to protect Britain from such attacks.
The agency is also working with other security services and industry leaders to identify ways of preventing rogue workers from carrying out attacks.
A source said: “This is an emerging threat and we need to be vigilant. We are working closely with the Government, industry and other partners to identify the risks and take action to protect the public.”
The warning comes just days after Lubitz, 28, deliberately crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board.
Lubitz had been suffering from depression for years but was able to keep his condition hidden from colleagues and passengers.
Investigators have revealed that he had a mental breakdown in the months leading up to the crash but still managed to fly commercial jets with passengers on board despite showing signs of illness.
The investigation has raised questions about how airlines and regulatory bodies can better protect passengers and crew from rogue pilots, and what more can be done to prevent such attacks.
