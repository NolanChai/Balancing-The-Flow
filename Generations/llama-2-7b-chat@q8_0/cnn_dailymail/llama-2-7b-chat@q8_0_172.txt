 currently facing charges of murder, abuse of a corpse and tampering with evidence following the death of his ex-girlfriend, 25-year-old Karen Hajja.
But police now believe that Oberhansley may have also raped Hajja before killing her, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Clark County court. The document alleges that Oberhansley told investigators he had sex with Hajja on the night she was killed, and that he later cooked some of her organs and ate them.
Police were called to Oberhansley's home on September 26 after he told a friend he had 'taken care of something', according to the affidavit. When officers arrived, they found Hajja dead inside the residence, with signs of trauma to her head and neck, as well as evidence that she had been cooked and consumed.
Oberhansley initially told officers he had stabbed Hajja in self-defense after she attacked him, but later changed his story and claimed he had killed her during a fit of rage, according to the affidavit. He also reportedly told investigators that he had eaten parts of her body, including her liver and kidneys, before disposing of her remains.
The probable cause affidavit notes that Oberhansley's DNA was found on Hajja's body and clothing, as well as on a knife discovered at his residence. It also suggests that Oberhansley's statements to investigators 'do not match the physical evidence'.
