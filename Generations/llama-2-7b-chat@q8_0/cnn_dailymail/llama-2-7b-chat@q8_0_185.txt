Water theft is rampant in California’s agricultural heartland, where growers are accused of secretly siphoning off millions of gallons of water from public canals to irrigate their crops. The problem has become so severe that state officials have launched a crackdown on illegal pumping, threatening farmers with fines and even criminal charges.
“It’s like the Wild West out there,” said Jim White, an environmental attorney who has spent years tracking water theft in California. “There’s no regulation, no oversight. Farmers are basically stealing water from their neighbors.”
The illegal pumping is particularly problematic during times of drought, when every drop of water is precious. As California struggles to supply water to its 38 million residents, farmers are accused of taking advantage of the situation by secretly diverting water meant for the environment and homes into their fields.
The situation has sparked a heated debate in California over how to balance the needs of farmers with those of the environment and residents. Some argue that farmers are entitled to a certain amount of water, while others say they must do more to conserve during times of drought.
“It’s a classic case of ‘I’ve got mine, you get yours,'” said Bill Croyle, acting director of the California Department of Water Resources. “We can’t afford to let that continue.”
California’s water crisis has been building for decades, fueled by population growth and climate change. The state is home to some of the most productive farmland in the world, but it also has a long history of poorly managed water resources. As a result, the state is now facing a perfect storm of drought, over-allocation of water rights and lack of investment in new water supply infrastructure.
The crisis has hit small farmers particularly hard, as they struggle to compete with larger operators who can afford to pay for expensive irrigation systems. Many have turned to illegal pumping as a way to stay afloat, but the practice is dangerous and unsustainable in the long term.
“It’s a desperate situation,” said Paul Helliwell, a small farmer in Merced County who has been accused of water theft. “I’m not proud of what I’ve done, but I’m doing what I have to do to survive.”
Helliwell is one of many farmers who have turned to illegal pumping as a way to irrigate their crops during times of drought. He has been accused of stealing water from a public canal and using it to grow alfalfa, a crop that requires a lot of water. Helliwell denies the accusation and says he is simply trying to keep his farm afloat during a time of crisis.
The problem of water theft in California’s agricultural heartland has been building for years, but it has come to a head during the current drought. State officials say that millions of gallons of water are being illegally siphoned off from public canals each year, depriving the environment and homes of vital water supplies.
“It’s not just a small problem,” said White, the environmental attorney. “We’re talking about huge amounts of water being stolen.”
The state has launched a crackdown on illegal pumping, threatening farmers with fines and even criminal charges. But many farmers say they are caught in a no-win situation, with little choice but to break the law to survive.
“I understand why people are angry,” said Helliwell. “But it’s not easy to give up your livelihood.”
