ouyant on court. But when he is in the zone, few players are as exciting to watch as Monfils.
He began well here against Benneteau, racing through the first set with an impressive array of winners and angles. He was making it look easy, and that's exactly what Benneteau couldn't do.
But then things got a little more complicated for Monfils. A series of double faults in the second set, followed by some wayward shots, saw him struggle to hold his serve. Benneteau sensed an opportunity and pounced, breaking Monfils twice to level the match.
For a moment it seemed as though Monfils was about to fold, but he summoned up the strength and resolve to fight back once more. He saved two break points in the final game of the match, before delivering a superb forehand winner to secure victory. It was vintage Monfils - full of flair, drama and above all, passion.
Monfils is a player who has divided opinion for some time now. Some see him as a talented but ultimately erratic player who can never quite reach his potential. Others see him as a true artist on court, capable of producing moments of pure magic at any moment. And perhaps that's the thing about Monfils - he is impossible to predict. One minute he'll be making stunning shots and winning easily, the next he'll be losing his serve or making unforced errors.
But despite the ups and downs, there is no denying that Gael Monfils has a certain je ne sais quoi that sets him apart from many other players on tour. He has a unique style of play, full of flashy shots and creative angles. And when he's in the zone, few players can match his level of excitement and unpredictability.
Monfils may never quite reach the heights that some fans believe he is capable of, but he will always be a player worth watching. Whether it's his dazzling footwork, his powerful groundstrokes or his sublime volleys, Monfils has an arsenal of shots that few others can match. And when he's in the mood, there is no one quite like him on a tennis court.
