 of Mount Sharp, using its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on April 4.
Nasa said in a statement that Curiosity was detected in the picture because of the darker patches where its rover’s solar panels are exposed to sunlight. The robotic geologist has been exploring Gale crater since landing inside it in August 2012 and has found evidence of ancient lakes, rivers and a habitable environment that could have supported life.
According to Nasa, the latest sighting is significant as it showcases how well the two spacecraft are working together to explore Mars. The orbiting spacecraft provides global coverage of the planet while the rover on the ground investigates specific areas in detail.
The agency added that the sighting also demonstrates how technology used for one mission can benefit future missions, such as the Perseverance rover set to launch in July this year.
The sighting of Curiosity on Mars comes just two weeks after Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe captured images of its companion, the InSight lander, on the red planet. The space agency said that these joint missions have demonstrated how effectively multiple spacecraft can be used to explore the red planet together.
