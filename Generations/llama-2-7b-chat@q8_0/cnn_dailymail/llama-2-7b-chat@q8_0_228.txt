British couple who fled UK with kids to join ISIS are arrested in Turkey
A British couple who are believed to have fled their Berkshire home with their four young children in a bid to escape to Syria and join the Islamic State (ISIS) have been arrested in Turkey. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara, and their kids were last seen leaving their house in Cookham Dean on September 27.
According to reports, Turkish authorities detained the family at Istanbul Airport as they attempted to board a flight to the Middle East. The couple and their children, aged between two and nine, are believed to have been heading to Syria to join ISIS.
The arrest comes after concerns were raised about the family's disappearance earlier this month. Malik, who was born in Pakistan, had previously been investigated by counter-terrorism police for suspected links to extremist groups.
A source close to the investigation said: "It is believed that the family left their home in Cookham Dean last week and were attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS."
The source added: "This is a very serious incident and it is feared that they may be planning to carry out terrorist acts. We are working closely with Turkish authorities to ensure the safety of the family and to prevent any further dangerous activity."
Malik and Sara, who were both born in Britain, had previously been known to police and had been under surveillance for some time before their disappearance. It is believed that they had been planning their escape for several months.
The couple's decision to flee the UK with their children has raised concerns among friends and neighbors, who describe them as a "nice, ordinary family".
One neighbor said: "I can't believe this has happened. They seemed like such a nice couple and their kids were always so happy. It's just horrifying to think they might be planning to join ISIS."
Another neighbor added: "It's absolutely terrible. I don't know what's going on, but I hope the authorities can find them and bring them back safe and sound."
British counter-terrorism police are working closely with their Turkish counterparts to investigate the matter further and ensure the safety of the family.
