a-half years in prison in Rangoon for displaying a picture of the Buddha on a beer mat at his Yangon pub.
The Foreign Office has come under fire from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International after it emerged that they had not intervened in Blackwood’s case despite being aware of it since last year.
A spokesperson for HRW said: “It is disturbing that the UK government appears to have abandoned Mr Blackwood, leaving him to face a lengthy prison sentence in Burma for a minor offence. The UK should be doing more to pressure the Burmese authorities to release him and drop the charges.”
Blackwood was arrested at his pub in June 2013 after a customer complained about the image of the Buddha on a beer mat. Under Burmese law, it is illegal to defame or insult the religious feelings of any religion, including Buddhism.
The UK government has faced criticism for not doing enough to help Blackwood, with some accusing them of being too close to the Burmese military regime.
A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are aware of Mr Blackwood’s case and have been in touch with his family to offer support. However, we cannot intervene in legal cases outside the UK.”
Blackwood’s wife has been campaigning for his release, accusing the Burmese authorities of discrimination against foreigners. She said: “It is not fair that Phil has been treated so harshly just because he is a foreigner. We are calling on the UK government to do more to help him.”
Blackwood’s case highlights the complex relationship between the UK and Burma, where the military regime has been accused of human rights abuses but also seen as a key player in the country’s political transition.
