 Junction prison in Massachusetts, following a guilty plea for murdering semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, now 29, will likely spend the rest of his days behind bars after being convicted of first degree murder last week. In his 1st official prison photo, taken by Mass Dept Corr on Aug 18, Hernandez is seen looking down with a blank expression as he wears a striped prison shirt and grey sweatpants...
The former New England Patriot tight end was found guilty of the June 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e. The conviction came after weeks of deliberation by jurors who heard evidence from 15 witnesses and viewed hours of footage during the trial.
On Monday afternoon, a judge sentenced Hernandez to life in prison without parole plus five years for Lloyd's murder, as well as an additional five years for illegal gun possession. He will likely spend at least 18 years behind bars before he becomes eligible for parole. The sentence is a stiff punishment that reflects the brutality and senselessness of the crime and the fact that Hernandez left Lloyd's body in an industrial park near his home.
