ison Square Garden, where Manchester United had just beaten AC Milan 3-2 in an entertaining friendly match, Ancelotti turned to his assistant, Paul Clement, and delivered a stark warning: "We must not get carried away."

It is easy to understand why the Italian coach felt the need to deliver this message. After all, it was only a few days ago that AC Milan had beaten Inter Milan 4-0 in their own derby match, and there was a sense of optimism around the team and its fans that they could finally end their long wait for silverware. However, as Ancelotti knew only too well, nothing in football is ever certain, and there were still plenty of challenges ahead before AC Milan could truly start dreaming of success. 
As it happens, Carlo Ancelotti's words of caution proved to be prophetic. Just a few weeks later, AC Milan suffered a shock defeat at the hands of AS Roma, their city rivals, which left them languishing in mid-table in Serie A. Despite this setback, however, Ancelotti remained resolute and focused on his team's ultimate goal: winning the Champions League. And so, as the season progressed, he continued to work tirelessly with his players, honing their skills and perfecting their tactics in preparation for what he knew would be a highly competitive tournament.
But even as AC Milan struggled to find their feet in the league, there was one player who remained an exception to the rule: Mario Balotelli. The enigmatic striker had joined AC Milan on loan from Manchester City just a few months earlier, and his impact on the team had been nothing short of transformative. With his lightning quick speed and unpredictable movements, Balotelli was a nightmare for opposing defenders to deal with, and it was no surprise that he quickly became the fans' favourite.
As the Champions League draw approached, Ancelotti knew that his team faced some stiff opposition in the form of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich - all of whom were among the top teams in Europe at the time. But with players like Balotelli at his disposal, he was confident that AC Milan had a chance to go all the way. And so, as the tournament got underway, Ancelotti watched on nervously from the sidelines as his team took to the pitch against their first opponents, Galatasaray. The match ended in a thrilling 1-1 draw, with Balotelli scoring AC Milan's equalising goal deep into injury time. It was a performance that left everyone - including Ancelotti - breathless with excitement, and it seemed to confirm what they had all been thinking: this could be AC Milan's year.
