12-round battle, and while most of the attention has focused on their boxing prowess, it's important to remember that both men have had strong support from their significant others throughout their careers.
For Mayweather, that means his longtime girlfriend, Shantel Jackson. The two have been together since 2009 and have a daughter together, Iyanna Mayweather. While Mayweather has been married three times before, Jackson is the one he credits with keeping him grounded and focused outside of the ring.
As for Pacquiao, his wife Jinkee Jamora-Pacquiao has been by his side through thick and thin. The two were married in 2006 and have five children together. While Pacquiao's boxing career has taken him all over the world, Jamora-Pacquiao has remained a constant presence, supporting her husband both inside and outside of the ring.
Both Mayweather and Pacquaio have credited their significant others with helping them stay focused and motivated during their careers, but it's worth noting that they also face unique challenges as high-profile athletes in a male-dominated sport.
Mayweather has been particularly open about the scrutiny he faces as a successful black athlete, saying in a recent interview that "being a black man in this world is like being a superhero." Jackson has also faced her own share of criticism, with some fans accusing her of being overly involved in Mayweather's career.
Pacquaio meanwhile, faces his own set of challenges as a fighter from the Philippines. The country has a relatively small boxing scene compared to other nations, and Pacquaio has often had to face skepticism from fans and media who doubted his abilities early in his career. His wife Jamora-Pacquiao has been a constant source of support throughout this journey, helping him navigate the ups and downs of life as a professional athlete.
Ultimately, while the attention will be on Mayweather and Pacquaio when they step into the ring on May 2nd, it's important to remember that their success is not just due to their own hard work and dedication, but also the support of those closest to them.
