iley, 15, was knocked down and killed by a Ford Focus as she walked home from school in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, last August. The driver of the car, Danielle Hodgson, 24, had been taking cocaine and cannabis at the time of the crash.
Ms Bailey’s mother, Donna Smith, was seen by witnesses sitting on the ground near the scene with her head in her hands and appearing to be in distress. In a statement read out in court, Ms Smith said: ‘I had dark thoughts about committing suicide at that spot where my daughter died. I couldn’t bear the thought of living without Liberty any longer’.
Hodgson, who was driving with her partner and two young children in the car at the time of the crash, is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court accused of causing death by dangerous driving. Prosecutors say that Hodgson had been taking cocaine and cannabis at the time of the crash, which left Ms Bailey with fatal injuries.
Ms Smith, who was in court to hear the prosecution evidence, added: ‘I’m just so angry and upset about what happened to Liberty. She was such a sweet girl and had her whole life ahead of her. It’s not fair that she was taken away from me like this’.
Prosecutor Mark McAulay told the court: ‘The defendant was driving at a high speed, in excess of 60mph on a 30mph road. She failed to slow down or stop when she saw Liberty Bailey step off the pavement and into the road’.
Hodgson, of Arnold Road, Nottingham, denies causing death by dangerous driving. The trial is expected to last for two days.
