Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex.
Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday when the fire broke out. Two of them, a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, were pronounced dead at the scene. Their names have not been released.
The other two children, ages 8 and 5, were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Police say the fire is believed to have started in the minivan's engine compartment and spread quickly. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
The incident is a tragic reminder of the importance of vehicle safety, especially when it comes to children who may be playing inside or around parked vehicles.
