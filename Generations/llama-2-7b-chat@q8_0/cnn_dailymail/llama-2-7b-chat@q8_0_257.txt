, UK, wants the government to provide financial support for couples who want to tie the knot in a traditional church ceremony.
She has started an online petition calling on David Cameron and Nick Clegg to make it happen - and is determined to reach 100,000 signatures by the end of the year. Anna, 32, says that she believes it's every couple's basic human right to have a 'fairy-tale church wedding' and insists that the government should be providing financial support for such events.
She told The Sun: "I think it's absolutely ridiculous that we're expected to pay tens of thousands of pounds for a wedding when it's something that is a basic human right. We have the right to get married, but we don't have the right to afford it? It doesn't make sense."
Anna has been unemployed for two years and currently receives job seeker's allowance. She claims she would be willing to work part-time while planning her wedding if the government provided financial support.
She added: "I understand that there are going to be some people who say 'you're not going to get what you want', but I genuinely believe that it is every couple's basic human right to have a fairy-tale church wedding."
Anna's petition has already received over 3,000 signatures and she is determined to reach her target of 100,000 by the end of the year. She believes that if enough people get behind her campaign, it could make a real difference to couples across the country who want to tie the knot in a traditional church ceremony but can't afford to do so."
I think this lady has some interesting ideas! While I don't personally believe that anyone should be expected to pay for their own wedding (and certainly not an expensive fairy-tale one), I think it's great that she is advocating for financial support for couples who want to tie the knot in a traditional church ceremony.
It's important to remember that marriage is a basic human right, and every couple deserves the opportunity to have their special day recognized and celebrated in a way that is meaningful to them. While I understand that the government may not be able to provide financial support for every couple who wants a fairy-tale wedding, I think it's definitely worth considering as an option for those who are struggling to make ends meet.
Plus, who knows? Maybe if more people get behind Anna's campaign, we could see some changes in the way that society views and supports marriage! Either way, I think this is a great issue to be advocating for - good luck, Anna!
