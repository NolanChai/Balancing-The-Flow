As inexperienced first-time parents, we shower our baby with gifts and document their every milestone. But second children are left to rely on hand-me-downs, with around £500 less spent on them in their first year alone, a study has found.
Researchers analyzed data from 2,000 parents of two or more children and discovered that while the average spend on a first child is £1,476, this drops to just £971 for their second child.
This equates to a staggering £500 less spent on each child in their first year alone, with many parents admitting they prioritize their eldest child's needs over those of their younger sibling.
The study also found that the gap between the amount spent on each child widens as they get older, with second children receiving around £100 less per year on average after the age of five.
Despite this, the majority of parents (85%) say they want to give their second child the same level of support and resources as their eldest. However, financial constraints often make this difficult, with many parents having to prioritize essential expenses like food and clothing over non-essential items like toys and gadgets.
Conducted by the UK's largest parenting website, Mumsnet, the study also found that while some parents do manage to splash out on their second child, others are forced to get creative with hand-me-downs and second-hand items.
One in ten parents admitted they have had to use their credit card to buy their second child something special, while around one in twenty (5%) have even resorted to buying their second child's clothes from charity shops or online marketplaces.
To help parents who may be struggling financially, Mumsnet has launched a new feature on its website called 'Second Child Syndrome', where parents can share advice and tips on how to save money when buying for their younger children.
Sarah Crown, editor of Mumsnet said: "While many of us want to give our second child the same level of support as our eldest, financial constraints often mean we have to get creative with how we spend our money. Our new feature aims to help parents who may be struggling with the cost of raising two children at once."
With 60% of parents feeling guilty about not being able to give their second child the same level of support as their eldest, it's clear that the pressure is on for families to find ways to make ends meet while still providing for all their children's needs.
