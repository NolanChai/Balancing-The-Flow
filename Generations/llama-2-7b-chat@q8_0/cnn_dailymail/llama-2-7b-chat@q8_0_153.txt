ury as Manchester United leapfrogged them into second place with a 2-1 win over Stoke on Sunday, and they now find themselves five points off the top of the table with just seven games remaining.
Pellegriniâ€™s men face a daunting trip to Palace on Wednesday night, where they will face a side who are unbeaten in their last 12 home matches in all competitions. Despite their poor away record this term - they have won just three of their 14 league games away from the Etihad - Pellegrini remains confident that his team can turn their fortunes around on the south coast.
"It is a difficult game, but we must go there with confidence," he said. "We know we have the players to win, and we must take advantage of the opportunities we create to get three points."
Pellegrini has also urged his side to be more clinical in front of goal if they are to turn their recent form around. City have scored just 12 goals in their last eight games, a return that is significantly down on their usual standards.
"We must be more precise in the final third," he added. "We create many chances, but we must take them to win games. If we don't score, it is difficult to win."
