na Kuzmich was on vacation in the Maldives last year when she realized her passport had gone missing.
She had checked it in her luggage when flying from Abu Dhabi to Mal√©, the capital of the Maldives, and upon arriving at her destination, she realized that the document wasn't among her other bags. "I was like, 'Oh my goodness, I think I lost my passport,'" Kuzmich told CNN Travel from her home in New York.
Her flight had been delayed, so she had to wait for hours before filing a report with the airline and the local authorities. Passports are usually valid for 10 years, but if you lose one, it's considered invalid and must be replaced immediately. Kuzmich had to spend $200 to obtain an emergency passport so she could return home.
She now carries a photocopy of her passport with her at all times while traveling, and makes sure to keep it separate from the original document in case of lost luggage or other mishaps. "It was a huge inconvenience," said Kuzmich, who had planned to spend three weeks on vacation in the Maldives before returning home for Christmas.
"I had to cut my trip short and come back early because I couldn't get a new passport in time." The Maldives is a popular tourist destination known for its pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and luxury resorts. But the country has strict rules regarding travel documentation, and visitors need to have their passports valid for at least six months beyond their intended stay date.
Kuzmich was lucky that she could get an emergency passport quickly, but not everyone is so fortunate. In some cases, it can take several days or even weeks for authorities to process a lost passport, leaving travelers stranded and unable to continue their trips.
Lost luggage and misplaced documents are just two of the many potential mishaps that can happen when traveling internationally. But there are steps you can take to minimize your risk. First, always keep a photocopy of your passport with you, in case the original is lost or stolen. Second, make sure you have all necessary documents and visas for your destination country before you leave. Third, pack a small bag with essentials like clothing and toiletries, so if your luggage does go missing, you can at least change into something comfortable and get what you need.
And fourth, consider purchasing travel insurance that covers lost or stolen passports or other travel-related issues. Kuzmich now makes sure to have a spare copy of her passport with her at all times, and recommends that other travelers do the same. "It was definitely a learning experience for me," she said. "I'll never fly without a photocopy of my passport again."
