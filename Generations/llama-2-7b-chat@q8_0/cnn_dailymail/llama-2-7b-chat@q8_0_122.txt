Rory McIlroy was joined by Niall Horan at the Masters on Wednesday as the One Direction singer caddied for the Northern Irish golfer in the traditional Par-3 Contest at Augusta.
The 21-year-old singer, who is a big fan of golf, took up the caddie role to support McIlroy during the competition. And while he may not have had much experience on the course, Horan seemed to be enjoying himself as he helped his friend navigate the challenging holes.
Horan was seen chatting and laughing with McIlroy throughout the contest, which features some of the game's top players competing over a series of short holes. Despite being new to the sport, Horan showed off his skills on the course, helping McIlroy to a respectable finish in the competition.
In addition to Horan's caddie duties, he also sang the national anthem before the contest, treating fans to a performance of "God Bless America." It was just another exciting day for Horan, who has been making waves in both the music and golf worlds lately.
While some fans may have been surprised to see Horan on the course, he seemed right at home among the other players and caddies. And with his love of golf clearly on display, it's possible that we could see more of him on the course in the future.
