 died during childbirth but she was actually still alive, while her son Lee was given the wrong medication which left him brain damaged.
Ms McKay and her husband John have now received a Â£300,000 payout in an out-of-court settlement with the hospital trust. The couple said they were "relieved" by the settlement but still "angry and upset" about what happened.
Speaking to BBC News, Ms McKay said: "It's hard to put into words how we feel - it's a mixture of relief that it's all over now and anger and upset that this happened in the first place."
She added: "We were told our daughter was stillborn, but she was actually alive. And then they gave my son the wrong medication which left him brain damaged. It's just unbelievable that it could happen at a hospital."
Mr McKay said: "We're glad it's over but we'll never forget what happened to our kids. We'll always be angry and upset about it."
The couple's lawyer, Sian Gwilliam, said the mistakes were "catastrophic" and that the family had been left to "pick up the pieces".
The hospital trust has apologised for the mistakes and said it was taking steps to ensure they did not happen again.
Ms McKay said: "I just hope no other family has to go through what we've been through."
