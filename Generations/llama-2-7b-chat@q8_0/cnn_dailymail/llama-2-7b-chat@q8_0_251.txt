idi on Tuesday after a court in Lahore granted him bail, reports Geo News.
Lakhvi, the leader of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), has been behind bars since 2008 when he was arrested by Pakistani authorities in connection with the attack that targeted several high-profile targets in Mumbai, including the Taj Mahal hotel, the Oberoi Trident and the Leopold Cafe.
The 54-year-old Lakhvi has been facing charges of terrorism and murder after India accused Pakistan of masterminding the deadly attack that also left over 300 people injured. But despite being detained for more than a decade, he has not been convicted or sentenced in any court of law.
Lakhvi's release on bail comes as tensions between India and Pakistan continue to escalate following the Pulwama attack earlier this month that killed over 40 Indian security personnel. New Delhi has accused Islamabad of backing the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group responsible for the assault, a charge rejected by Pakistani officials who have vowed to take action against the group.
The Lakhvi release has sparked outrage in India with politicians and citizens demanding that Pakistan be held accountable for its alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai attack. "Pak must be held accountable for their crimes," tweeted Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
"Releasing LeT mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi is a clear signal from Pak that they will continue to support terrorism. India will not forget and never forgive this heinous act," added External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.
The Mumbai attack was one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in modern Indian history, with many of the victims being foreign tourists and businessmen. It marked a turning point in India's relationship with Pakistan, which has been accused of supporting cross-border terrorism for decades.
Pakistan has long denied any involvement in the Mumbai attack but India and other countries have linked it to LeT, which is considered a proscribed terrorist organization by many nations including the United States and European Union.
