 jungle, Kanko, a 13-year-old elephant in Thailand’s Chiang Mai province, was reunited with her mother, Mook, who had not seen her daughter for over three years.
The emotional reunion took place at the Mae Wong National Park, where rangers and conservationists were keeping an eye out for Kanko as part of a research project. As soon as she spotted her mother, Kanko ran towards her and embraced her in a warm hug, trumpeting joyfully.
According to the video footage, the reunion was an emotional moment for both Kanko and Mook, as they clung to each other tightly. The conservationists involved in the project said it was remarkable how quickly the elephants recognized one another after such a long time apart.
The researchers are still unsure of why Kanko left her mother’s side three years ago, but assume she may have been searching for food or a new place to live. However, the fact that she has now made the long journey back home is a testament to the strong bond between elephant mothers and their offspring.
While Kanko and her mother were reunited in this heartwarming story, sadly, many elephants are still separated from their families due to habitat loss, poaching, and other human activities. The video serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure they can continue to thrive in their natural habitats.
