, was repeatedly subjected to bullying by teachers and other pupils at a primary school in Wigan, Greater Manchester, but the council failed to take action despite several complaints.
The court heard that Tianni, who is autistic, was called names, pushed and excluded from social activities by her classmates. Ms Stratton claimed that she reported the incidents to the school and the local authority several times but no action was taken. The bullying continued for more than two years before Tianni left the school in 2017.
Ms Stratton, who is seeking damages for her daughter's suffering, told the court: "Tianni has been left with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the bullying she suffered at school. She is now struggling to cope in mainstream education and has become anxious and withdrawn."
The local authority denies any wrongdoing and claims it took appropriate action once it became aware of the incidents. But Ms Stratton claims that despite her warnings, the council did nothing to address the problem. She added: "I am grateful for the support Tianni has received from some teachers at the school but overall I feel let down by the local authority."
The case highlights a growing concern about the treatment of children with special needs in schools. In recent years there have been several high-profile cases of bullying and abuse of children with disabilities, including those on the autism spectrum, in schools across the UK.
Ms Stratton's lawsuit comes after a government-backed inquiry into bullying in schools found that many schools are failing to protect vulnerable pupils from bullying. The inquiry called for greater awareness training for teachers and greater support for children with special needs, as well as a clear framework for dealing with incidents of bullying.
Ms Stratton's case is expected to be heard in court next year.
