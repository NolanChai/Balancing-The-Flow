 spokesperson for the Utah Department of Public Safety told KSL-TV that the plate design featuring a Purple Heart medal is not allowed because it's considered an "issue-based" design, which is prohibited by state law.
Johnny Johnson, 73, who served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969 and was wounded in action, applied for the personalized plate last year but was told recently that his request was denied. Johnson said he's disappointed because the Purple Heart is an important symbol of his military service and sacrifice.
"I feel like I've been slapped in the face," Johnson said. "I've got a Purple Heart for what I went through, and they won't let me put it on my license plate? It just doesn't make sense."
A spokesperson for the Utah Department of Public Safety told KSL-TV that personalized plates are not allowed to commemorate "issues" or "political statements," which is why Johnson's request was denied. However, Johnson said he believes his request doesn't fit into either category and is simply a way to honor his military service.
Johnson has been told he can reapply for the personalized plate with a different design, but he said he wants to keep his original request because it's important to him personally and represents his sacrifice as a veteran.
