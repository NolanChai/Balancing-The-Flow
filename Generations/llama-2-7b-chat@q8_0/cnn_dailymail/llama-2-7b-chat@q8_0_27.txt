ounds like a fun time!


But animal welfare advocates say the event was cruel and inhumane. The church had been hosting the annual Mud Pig Stomp for 40 years, with people paying to participate and watch as pigs were covered in mud and wrestled on the ground. The event raised money for the church's food pantry and other community programs, but it was cancelled this year after complaints from local animal shelters and animal rights groups.


The church had defended the event in the past, saying that the pigs were well-cared for and that they were not harmed during the stomp. However, undercover videos taken at previous events showed people kicking, punching and jumping on the pigs, as well as pouring mud over their heads.


Animal welfare advocates say the event was cruel and inhumane, and they are celebrating its cancellation. The church says it will instead focus on more humane ways to raise money for its community programs.
