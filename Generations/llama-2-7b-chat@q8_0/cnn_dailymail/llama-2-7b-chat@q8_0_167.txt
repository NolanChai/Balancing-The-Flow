The row kicked off after Ms Bartholomew took to social media to complain about her 'traumatising' experience at the butcher's shop in Bondi Junction, where she claimed staff made derogatory comments about her boyfriend and refused to sell her a chicken.
But the butcher has hit back, claiming Ms Bartholomew was unreasonable and rude during her visit, and that his staff were simply trying to protect their business from overzealous customers.
In a series of social media posts, Ms Bartholomew detailed how she had gone to the butcher's shop in search of a chicken to cook for the Game Of Thrones-inspired feast she was hosting that weekend.
But when she asked if they had any chickens available, the staff allegedly started making fun of Mr Guerra and refused to sell her one, claiming they didn't want to 'feed a rugby player'.

Ms Bartholomew claimed she was left feeling 'humiliated' and 'upset' by the experience, and that she would never shop at the butcher's again.
But the butcher has hit back, claiming Ms Bartholomew was unreasonable and rude during her visit, and that his staff were simply trying to protect their business from overzealous customers.
In a statement on Facebook, the butcher said: 'As soon as Belinda walked into our shop, she started being really rude and demanding. She was asking for a chicken and when we told her we didn't have any, she just kept pushing and complaining.

'We have a lot of customers who come in here and make unreasonable requests all the time, and we just can't always accommodate them. We're a small business and we can only do so much.'
Ms Bartholomew has since responded to the butcher's claims, insisting she was simply trying to buy a chicken for a meal and that she didn't act in an unreasonable or rude manner.
She said: 'I was just looking for a chicken to cook for my dinner and they refused to sell it to me because of my boyfriend. It was really upsetting and I don't think it's fair that they would treat customers like that.'
The row has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many people siding with Ms Bartholomew and accusing the butcher of being unreasonable and disrespectful. Others have defended the butcher, saying that they understand their frustration at dealing with demanding customers all day long.
The incident has highlighted the challenges faced by small business owners in the face of increasing competition and high customer expectations, and serves as a reminder to always be respectful and considerate when interacting with service providers.
