New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling for him to apologize.
The confrontation occurred during a town hall meeting in Livingston, N.J., where Christie was fielding questions from constituents. A teacher named David Sciarra stood up and began to criticize the governor's education policies, including his decision to cut funding for teacher training programs.
"You're not investing in our children's future," Sciarra said. "You're not investing in us."
Christie fired back, saying that he has increased funding for education and pointing out that the state has a $8 billion budget surplus. But Sciarra countered that the governor's policies are hurting students and teachers.
"You're making it impossible for me to do my job," Sciarra said. "I have 105 kids in my classroom right now. I can't give them the education they deserve."
Christie grew visibly frustrated as the exchange continued, and at one point he cut Sciarra off, saying, "I understand that you don't think I'm doing a good job. But let me tell you something: I'm the governor of this state, and I've got to make decisions."
The New Jersey Education Association (NJEA), the state's largest teacher's union, is now calling on Christie to apologize for his behavior at the town hall meeting. In a statement, NJEA President Wendell Young said that the governor's actions were "unacceptable" and "disrespectful."
"Gov. Christie has a long history of disrespecting educators and ignoring their concerns," Young said. "Tonight's town hall meeting was just the latest example. We expect better from our governor, and we demand an apology for his behavior."
Christie's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the NJEA's statement. But the governor has been facing criticism from teachers and education advocates throughout his tenure as governor, with many arguing that he has failed to prioritize public education in New Jersey.
