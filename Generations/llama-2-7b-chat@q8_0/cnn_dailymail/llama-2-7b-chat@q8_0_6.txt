Wenger revealed that Walcott had been struggling with his form and confidence before England boss Gareth Southgate decided to leave him out of the squad. He told reporters: Im concerned about Theos confidence. He has not played as many games recently and he has not scored as many goals as he would like. Its normal when players are not playing regularly that they go through a period of low confidence.
