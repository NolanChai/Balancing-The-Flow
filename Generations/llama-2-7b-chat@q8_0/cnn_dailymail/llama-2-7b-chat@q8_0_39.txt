A young waitress has claimed that England footballer Aaron Lennon grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top as he partied in the VIP suite of a nightclub.
The 18-year-old reportedly fled to the toilet and locked herself in after the alleged incident at the club in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on Sunday morning.
Police were called to the scene and Lennon was arrested on suspicion of common assault, according to The Sun. He has since been released under investigation while officers continue their probe.
The waitress, who wishes to remain anonymous, claimed that Lennon approached her in the VIP suite and began "making sexual advances" towards her. When she declined his advances, he allegedly became aggressive and attacked her.
"He grabbed me and pulled me towards him, I tried to push him away but he was too strong," she told The Sun. "He then slapped me across the face and ripped my top. I was in shock and ran straight to the toilet to lock myself in."
Lennon's representative has since released a statement denying the allegations, saying: "Aaron Lennon categorically denies any wrongdoing and will cooperate fully with the police investigation."
The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many calling for Lennon to be banned from playing football again.
Lennon has played for several clubs throughout his career, including Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Leeds United. He has also made 37 appearances for England.
