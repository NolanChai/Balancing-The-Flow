 will replace them.
Atletico Madrid is a club with an illustrious history of developing young players into some of the best in the world, and this season has been no different. With the departure of Diego Costa to Chelsea, many fans were worried about how Atletico would cope without their leading scorer from last season. However, the arrival of Kevin Gameiro from Paris Saint-Germain has more than made up for that loss.
Gameiro has scored four goals in his first three appearances for Atletico, including a hat-trick against Levante in his debut match. His pace and movement have caused problems for opposing defenders, and he has quickly established himself as one of the most dangerous attacking players in La Liga.
But Gameiro is not the only young player to make an impact at Atletico this season. 19-year-old midfielder Saul Niguez has also caught the eye with his impressive displays. Saul has scored two goals and provided three assists in his first four appearances for the club, showing great maturity beyond his years.
Atletico's development of young players is not limited to this season, however. The club has a long history of producing talented players who have gone on to achieve great things at both Atletico and elsewhere. Players like Sergio Aguero, Thibaut Courtois, and Antoine Griezmann all began their careers at Atletico before moving on to bigger clubs and greater success.
This commitment to youth development is one of the reasons why Atletico has become a destination for some of the best young players in Spain and Europe. The club's coaches and scouts work tirelessly to identify talent early, and then provide them with the training and support they need to reach their full potential.
Atletico Madrid fans have every reason to be excited about the future, with a talented crop of young players waiting in the wings to take the club forward. And with the likes of Gameiro and Saul leading the charge, there's no doubt that Atletico will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in La Liga and beyond.
