Adi Viveash's Chelsea U19 side have booked their place in the UEFA Youth League final with a 4-0 thumping of Roma in the semi-finals. Here are the player ratings from the game:
GK Nathan Baxter (7/10) - Made some excellent saves, particularly in the first half to keep Chelsea in the match.
RB Tariq Lamptey (8/10) - Looked dangerous down the right flank and provided a constant outlet for Chelsea's attack.
CB Lewis Bates (7/10) - Solid display from the young centre-back, who dealt with Roma's attacks expertly.
CB Billy Gilmour (8/10) - Another impressive performance from the Scotland U21 international, who read the game brilliantly and won several key challenges.
LB Ethan Ampadu (7/10) - Had a more quiet game than his defensive colleagues but still put in a solid shift down the left flank.
MF Charlie Colkett (9/10) - The midfielder's 30th-minute strike proved to be the turning point, as it gave Chelsea the momentum they needed to dominate the game. He also created several other chances for his teammates.
MF Billy McKay (7/10) - Worked hard in midfield and helped to control the tempo of the game, but struggled to make an impact on the score sheet.
MF Conor Gallagher (8/10) - Showed flashes of his undoubted talent with some clever footwork and a well-struck effort that was saved by the Roma goalkeeper.
FW Armstrong Oko-Best (6/10) - Looked lively in attack but struggled to make a real impact on the game, despite several promising runs.
FW Tammy Abraham (8/10) - Continued his impressive form with a well-taken goal and worked tirelessly throughout the game.
MF Jordan Houghton (6/10) - Came off the bench to add some extra pace to Chelsea's attack, but struggled to make an impact on the game.
MF Duane Holmes (6/10) - Like Houghton, struggled to make a real impression on the game after his introduction.
