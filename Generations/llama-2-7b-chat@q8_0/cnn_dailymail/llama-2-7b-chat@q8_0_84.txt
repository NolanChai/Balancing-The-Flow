Shapiro, who has represented the likes of OJ Simpson and Michael Jackson in high-profile legal battles, sent Pacquiao a specially tailored boxing glove with the message "Fight Like A Champion" emblazoned on it.
Pacquiao was reportedly touched by the thoughtful gift and plans to wear the gloves during his training for the blockbuster bout against Mayweather, which is expected to generate over $400 million in revenue from pay-per-view sales alone.
"I am very grateful for this amazing gift from Robert Shapiro," Pacquiao said in a statement. "It's an inspiration to know that he believes in me and my abilities, and I will carry his message with me every time I step into the ring."
