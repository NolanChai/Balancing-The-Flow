wardly fidgeting with his gloves as he listened to Lewis Hamilton's post-race interviews.
"It was a bit of a lonely race," Hamilton said cheerfully. "I had a lot of pace today and I could see Nico struggling, so I just went for it. It was a great feeling passing him on that final stint."
Rosberg didn't look like he was in the mood to be cheered up by Hamilton's words. He looked annoyed, frustrated, maybe even angry. His team-mate had just outdriven him for the fourth time in succession and this time it had cost him a podium finish.
The two Mercedes drivers were locked in an intense battle all afternoon with Vettel (Ferrari) and Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) making up the top four. Rosberg started from third on the grid, with Hamilton fifth, but he quickly moved ahead of his team-mate and then began to pull away.
As the race entered its final stages Rosberg's advantage was just over three seconds. He looked set for a comfortable second place until Hamilton made his decisive move. The Briton passed him on lap 53 and then pulled away to take the chequered flag more than 10 seconds ahead of his team-mate.
"It's frustrating," Rosberg admitted after the race. "I was struggling with my pace today and Lewis just had a bit more. I couldn't keep up with him in that final stint, but overall it was a good result for the team."
But Rosberg couldn't mask his disappointment at being beaten by his team-mate for the fourth time this season. It's a record that will not be welcome at Mercedes and will raise questions about whether he can really challenge Hamilton for the drivers' championship in 2016.
