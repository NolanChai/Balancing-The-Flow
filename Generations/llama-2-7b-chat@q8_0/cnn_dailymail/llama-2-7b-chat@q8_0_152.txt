45 minutes of excitement for the home fans as he made his first start in the league since January, but ultimately fell short of inspiring a victory despite creating several chances for his teammates. The draw leaves Milan four points off the Champions League places with just six games remaining, while Sampdoria remain in the top half of the table and within striking distance of their opponents tonight.

The game was certainly entertaining to watch, with both sides creating good chances throughout the match. AC Milan had a great opportunity to take the lead early on when Eto'o found himself one-on-one with Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano, but his finish was saved by the keeper's quick reflexes.
Sampdoria equalized just before halftime through a well-worked corner kick, with defender Angelo Palombo rising highest to head home the ball from close range. The away side almost took the lead shortly after the break, but Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati made a crucial save to keep his team level.
In the end, it was a fortunate deflection that earned AC Milan a point as Nigel de Jong's overhed kick struck the crossbar and bounced back into play, narrowly avoiding falling behind once again. The draw may not have been the most exciting result for Milan fans, but it at least kept their hopes of European football alive next season intact.
