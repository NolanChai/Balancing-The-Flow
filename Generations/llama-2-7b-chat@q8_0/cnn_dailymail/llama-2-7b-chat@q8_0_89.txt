 -- were executed Wednesday night in Indonesia, Veloso was spared from the same fate. The Supreme Court postponed her execution by a day, granting her a temporary reprieve just as the curtain was closing on this drama.
Veloso's story has captivated people around the world, not just for its tragic elements but also because of its global implications. Veloso is an Indonesian maid who was arrested and sentenced to death in 2010 after being found with heroin in her luggage at Jakarta's airport. Her case has sparked outrage among activists who argue that Indonesia's drug laws are too harsh and unfairly target foreign workers, particularly women from developing countries like Veloso.
The execution of the eight inmates was originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, but it was delayed by several hours after Veloso's lawyer made a last-ditch effort to save her life. The appeal was rejected, and the execution went ahead without Veloso. But just as the condemned prisoners were being led to their death chambers, the Supreme Court announced that it had granted Veloso a reprieve until Thursday.
Veloso's fate now hangs in the balance, with her lawyers preparing a final appeal to be heard by the Indonesian Constitutional Court on Thursday. If they fail, Veloso will be executed at 12:05 a.m. local time on Friday. The drama has captivated people around the world because of its global implications. Indonesia is one of the few countries in Asia that still carries out death by firing squad, and its drug laws are widely seen as draconian and discriminatory.
Activists have been campaigning for years to get Veloso and other foreign workers off death row, arguing that they are unfairly targeted by Indonesia's drug laws. "This is a moment of great relief for Mary Jane," said Sophie Anselm, director of the anti-death penalty organization Reprieve. "But we cannot let our guard down until she is finally free from this nightmare."
Veloso has been on death row for five years, and her case has become a symbol of the need for reform in Indonesia's criminal justice system. Her execution had been delayed several times before, but it seemed that this time was different -- that Veloso would actually be put to death. But in the end, it was not meant to be.
