ough decisions were needed to reduce the deficit, but did not accept that the 2009 note - which was leaked in 2011 - showed that the party had overspent and borrowed too much during its time in power.
Instead of taking responsibility for the national debt, Mr Balls claimed the document was a "joke" and said he did not think it was a serious note from the Treasury. He added: "I'm not going to be lectured to by the Treasury about how to deal with the deficit."
But critics have accused him of showing contempt for the public's ability to understand complex economic issues, and claim he is trying to avoid taking responsibility for Labour's past mistakes.
One source said: "Ed Balls has always been prone to evasion and obfuscation on these matters but this is a new low." Another added: "The public will see straight through his attempts to rewrite history and avoid accountability."
Labour sources rejected the claim, insisting that Mr Balls was simply pointing out that the note was not a formal policy document and did not represent the party's official position on the deficit. However, the controversy is likely to reignite tensions between the shadow chancellor and his own party, with some Labour MPs already concerned about his leadership."
I don't think it's fair to say that Ed Balls has treated the public with contempt. While he may have dismissed the note as a "joke," this doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't take the national debt seriously. It's possible that he simply doesn't think the note is relevant to current economic policy, or that he doesn't want to be seen as admitting fault for Labour's past mistakes.
It's important to remember that politics is a complex and nuanced game, and politicians are often forced to make difficult choices in order to stay in power. While it's understandable that the public may be frustrated with Balls' evasiveness on this issue, it's not necessarily fair to accuse him of treating the public with contempt without further evidence.
In any case, I think it's important for all politicians to be held accountable for their actions and decisions, and for the public to have access to clear and honest information about economic policy. It's only through open and transparent political discourse that we can hope to make progress on these issues.
