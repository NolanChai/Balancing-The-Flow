Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls into his innings. Trott last played a Test for England in November 2013 due to a mental health issues that caused him to take an extended break from the game.
The 34-year-old left-handed batsman faced two deliveries from India skipper Virat Kohli before being dismissed, with his departure sparking a period of resistance from the England tail. Trott's innings lasted just three balls and yielded no runs, but he received a warm welcome back from the Lord's crowd as he walked off the field.
