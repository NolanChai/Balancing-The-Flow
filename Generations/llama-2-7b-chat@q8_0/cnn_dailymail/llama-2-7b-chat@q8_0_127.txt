 the journey crying.
The game was all but over by half-time, a 3-0 scoreline flattering to the hosts who had dominated the first period. Karanka will have been grateful his players made the short trip back to Teesside without conceding any more goals, as they were second best in every aspect of the game.
Middlesbrough’s one chance of note came midway through the first-half when a long-range effort was well saved by Watford ‘keeper Heurelho Gomes. That was as good as it got for Boro, who struggled to create any other clear cut chances and looked vulnerable at the back whenever they did get the ball forward.
Watford’s front three of Richarlison, Deeney and Gray tore the Teesside club apart with their pace and movement. They were a constant threat down Middlesbrough’s flanks and found plenty of space in behind the Boro defence. By half-time the score was 3-0 and could have been more but for some good goalkeeping from Darren Randolph.
In the second-half, Watford continued to dominate and Middlesbrough looked increasingly tired and stretched. The introduction of George Friend and Martin Braithwaite offered a little more attacking threat but the damage had already been done.
It was another disappointing away day for Boro, who have now won just one of their last ten on the road in the league. It’s hard to see how they will turn this form around with such an impotent attack and a leaky defence.
