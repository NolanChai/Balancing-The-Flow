Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Geronimi criticized Thiriez for his absence, saying: "He should be here today to congratulate the players and the staff after this magnificent victory."
Geronimi also expressed frustration that Thiriez had not been in touch with him since Saturday's match, which Bastia won 2-1 against Lyon.
"It's unacceptable for a president who has forgotten the values of football," Geronimi added. "We need a president who will always be there for the players and staff."
Thiriez has faced criticism before for his handling of various issues in French football, including the controversial relegation/promotion playoffs that were introduced this season.
Geronimi's comments come at a time when French football is facing a number of challenges off the pitch, including financial issues and concerns over player welfare.
