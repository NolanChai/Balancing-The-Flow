The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court.
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), said she had taken a "careful and meticulous" approach to the case against Greville Janner, who is accused of abusing children in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.
Ms Saunders' decision not to prosecute Lord Janner was criticised by some victims' groups and MPs, who argued that she had let the peer off the hook.
But responding to the criticism, Ms Saunders insisted that her office had acted in accordance with the law and had done everything possible to bring charges against Lord Janner.
"If people have concerns about our decision not to prosecute, I would encourage them to challenge us in court," she said. "That is how the justice system works."
Ms Saunders added that her office had faced a "huge amount of criticism" over the Janner case, but insisted that it was "not about being soft on crime or protecting anyone".
She said: "It's about ensuring that we follow the law and apply it consistently. We have done everything in this case to bring charges against Lord Janner, but we cannot proceed where there is no realistic prospect of conviction."
The DPP also revealed that her office had considered charging Lord Janner with a number of offences, including rape, sexual assault and indecent assault, but had ultimately decided not to do so.
"We have taken a careful and meticulous approach to this case because we understand the seriousness of these allegations," she said. "But ultimately, it is for a jury to decide whether or not Lord Janner is guilty of these offences."
