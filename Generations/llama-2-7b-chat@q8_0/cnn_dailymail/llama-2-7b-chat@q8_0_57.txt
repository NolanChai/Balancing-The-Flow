 nd they will compete for the title of Miss Army at an annual military parade next month.
Organisers said that the contest would help to increase the number of women in the armed forces and boost morale among existing recruits. "It's important to attract more young people, especially women, to the army," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence. "This competition will show that being in the military can be glamorous and exciting."
The 123 female soldiers competing for the title are all between the ages of 18 and 27 and come from various branches of the armed forces, including the army, navy and air force. They were selected based on their physical fitness, military skills and appearance. The winner will be crowned Miss Army during a parade in the capital, Astana, on September 24.
The competition has sparked controversy among some Kazakhstani women who say that it objectifies and demeans women. "It's not right to reduce women to just their physical appearance," said Zhanar Aitzhanova, a spokeswoman for the Women's Fund NGO. "This competition is not going to encourage more women to join the military, it will only serve to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about gender and war."
Despite the criticism, military officials say they are determined to go ahead with the competition. "We want to show that being a soldier can be a positive and respected profession for women," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence. "This is just one small step towards achieving that goal."
The Miss Army competition comes as Kazakhstan's military is facing growing challenges, including increased tensions with neighboring Russia and China. The country's armed forces are also dealing with internal conflicts, including a recent incident in which 12 soldiers were killed in a training accident.
Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has made military modernization a key priority for his administration, and the Miss Army competition is seen as part of that effort. The country has also launched a number of other initiatives aimed at increasing the number of women in the armed forces, including the establishment of a special female battalion.
Overall, while the Miss Army competition may be controversial, it represents a broader trend towards greater gender equality in Kazakhstan's military. As the country continues to develop its armed forces and face new challenges, it will be important to see how these efforts play out in practice.
