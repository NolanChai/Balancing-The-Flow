The comments come as the exit polls predict a hung parliament, with neither the Conservatives nor Labour set to secure an overall majority.
Theresa May warned that without a working majority in parliament, it would be difficult for the next government to pass new anti-terror laws. She also highlighted the need for a swift and stable transition of power to avoid any disruption to national security measures.
"We cannot afford to have a situation where vital legislation is unable to be passed because of political deadlock." May said. "The safety and security of our citizens must be our top priority and we cannot take that risk."
She also called on all parties to put aside their differences and work together to ensure the country's security. "We need a government that can act swiftly and decisively in the face of these threats, without political obstruction or delay," she said.
The Home Secretary's comments come after several high-profile terror attacks on British soil in recent years, including last month's bombing at Manchester Arena which killed 22 people.
May's warning is likely to be seen as a challenge to the opposition parties, who have criticized the government's response to terrorism and called for greater powers to be given to police and security services.
