The Queen’s staff will take industrial action for the first time in history over their ‘ridiculously low’ wages. Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including guarding the monarch during her annual holiday at Balmoral, without receiving any additional pay. The workers, who are paid between £18,000 and £23,000 a year, have been balloted for strike action after their pay was frozen for several years. ‘We feel like we’re being taken advantage of because we work so hard to keep the Royal Family safe and secure, yet our wages are ridiculously low,’ said one warden, who wished to remain anonymous. The union representing the workers, Unison, has called on the Queen and other royal staff to ‘show some respect’ for their employees’ pay demands.
