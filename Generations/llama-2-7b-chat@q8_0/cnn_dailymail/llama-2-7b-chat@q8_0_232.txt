 severe than would be expected from a typical runway accident.
As seen on surveillance footage, the bus can be seen driving down the runway before suddenly veering sharply to the left and crashing into the plane. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic with people running in all directions following the collision. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured in the incident but it serves as a stark reminder of the dangers associated with airport operations.
A full investigation is currently underway to determine the cause of the accident and how this could have happened. The Uzbekistan Civil Aviation Authority has released an initial statement saying they are taking all necessary measures to ensure safety at the airport.
