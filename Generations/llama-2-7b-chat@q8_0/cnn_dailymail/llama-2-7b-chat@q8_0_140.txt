1-0 win at Anfield on Tuesday as they advanced to face Chelsea in the last four.
Coutinho struck with a precise finish from the edge of the box after Henderson had controlled a long pass and laid it off for the Brazilian playmaker. The goal was the first for Coutinho in eight games in all competitions and gave Liverpool their first win in three home matches against Blackburn, who are now bottom of the Championship.
Henderson, whose only other goal for Liverpool came from the penalty spot against Stoke City in February 2019, celebrated with a delighted jump on the pitch as he was substituted by Trent Alexander-Arnold four minutes later. The victory took Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 2007 and set up a meeting with Chelsea at Wembley Stadium on April 18.
Liverpool had to overcome a tricky test against a Blackburn side managed by Tony Mowbray, who played for the club in their Premier League title-winning season of 1994-95. The visitors were well organised and posed a threat on the counter-attack, but Liverpool’s superior quality eventually told as they secured a deserved victory.
Jurgen Klopp made three changes from the side that drew with Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at Anfield, with Henderson, Coutinho and Divock Origi coming in for Jordan Rossiter, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Mane.
Liverpool dominated the early stages but created little clear-cut opportunities until Henderson’s superb pass found Coutinho on the edge of the box, allowing him to beat goalkeeper David Raya with a clinical finish. The win was Liverpool’s 10th in their last 12 home games against Blackburn and leaves them on course for a third FA Cup triumph under Klopp.
