14 months old when their father, Dung Wagner, died in November 2015 from complications related to liver disease.
At the time of his death, Phuoc had already received a liver transplant while Vietnamese was placed on a waitlist for an organ. However, due to a shortage of available organs and Vietnamese's deteriorating health, doctors were unable to perform the transplant before it was too late.
In a heartbreaking decision, Dung Wagner chose to donate his liver to Phuoc, leaving Vietnamese without an organ. Despite this difficult choice, Dung's family remained hopeful that they would find another way to save their daughter's life.
Six months after Dung's death, a matching liver became available for Vietnamese. She underwent the transplant surgery in March 2016 and has since made a full recovery. Her new liver has given her the chance at a healthy and normal life that she may not have otherwise had.
"We are very grateful for the gift of life that was given to Vietnamese through the selfless act of organ donation," said Phuoc's mother, Mai Nguyen. "It is a reminder of how precious life is and how important it is to make the most of every moment."
Vietnamese's story highlights both the importance of organ donation and the challenges that families face when dealing with end-of-life decisions. While it is impossible to repay the debt of gratitude owed to Dung Wagner, his family's decision to honor his memory through organ donation has given Vietnamese a second chance at life.
