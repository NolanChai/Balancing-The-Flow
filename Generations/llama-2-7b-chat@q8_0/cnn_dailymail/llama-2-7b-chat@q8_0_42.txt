, central defender, left-back and a striker to challenge for major honours next season.
Henry, who played for Arsenal between 1999 and 2007, has been critical of the Gunners' lack of activity in the transfer market this window, with Unai Emery's side only signing one player - Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid - so far.
Speaking to beIN Sports, Henry said: "Arsenal need to improve in certain areas, they need a goalkeeper, a central defender, a left-back and a striker. They need players who can help them challenge for the top four, and then the top three.
"I understand that Arsenal have a young team and they want to give opportunities to their youth players, but you also need experience in certain areas. And at the moment, I don't see enough experience in those areas."
Henry believes that if Arsenal can recruit four top-class players this summer, they will be able to challenge for the Premier League title and the Champions League. He added: "If Arsenal can get the right players in, they have a good team. They have young players who are hungry to learn and improve, and with the right experience and guidance, they can achieve great things."
Arsenal fans will be hoping that Henry's comments will prompt the club's board into action, as they look to build on their sixth-place finish in the Premier League last season.
