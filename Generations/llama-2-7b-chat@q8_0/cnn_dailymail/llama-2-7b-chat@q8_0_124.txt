 and Lisa tie the knot before he passes away. So with just days left to live, the family made sure that his heartfelt request was granted.
Crai and Lisa had been together for 15 years but never married until now. They decided to get married at Exeter Hospital where Corey has been receiving treatment for a rare genetic disorder since he was born. With the hospital's permission, they invited friends and family to be by their side as they exchanged vows and rings in a small ceremony.
Corey, who is just 10 years old, looked on with tears in his eyes as his parents were united in marriage. The little boy's sister Ava read out a special message from him before the couple exchanged their vows.
