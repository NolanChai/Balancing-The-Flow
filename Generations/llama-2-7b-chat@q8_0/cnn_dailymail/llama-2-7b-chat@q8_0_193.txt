 of the shooting was released, showing him firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled.
Slager claims he fired in self defense, but prosecutors say there is no evidence to support that claim. The shooting has sparked protests and calls for justice in the community.
The incident highlights ongoing concerns about racial disparities in policing and police use of force, particularly against African Americans. According to a study by the Washington Post, African Americans are 2.5 times more likely than whites to be shot and killed by police in the United States.
The shooting also comes as the Justice Department is investigating police departments across the country for civil rights violations, including excessive use of force against minorities. The Justice Department has announced it will review police departments' use of force policies and practices, as well as their interactions with people in mental health crisis or other vulnerable populations.
The shooting of Walter Scott is a tragic reminder of the need for greater transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies," Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. "We will continue to work with state and local authorities to ensure that justice is served and that the public can trust their law enforcement agencies."
Calls for reform have been mounting across the country, with protesters demanding better training for police officers and greater accountability within law enforcement agencies.
"We need to fundamentally change the way that policing works in this country," said DeRay Mckesson, a civil rights activist who has been involved in protests and organizing efforts following the shooting. "The status quo is not working."
Mckesson and other advocates say police departments must do more to address implicit bias and cultural sensitivity training for officers. They also call for greater diversity within law enforcement agencies, as well as better community engagement and outreach efforts.
"We need to create a culture of policing that values human life and recognizes the dignity and worth of every person," Mckesson said. "That requires more than just training - it requires a fundamental shift in how we think about our role as law enforcement officers."
The shooting of Walter Scott has sparked a national conversation about police use of force and racial disparities within law enforcement agencies. Advocates say the incident highlights ongoing systemic issues that must be addressed to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
