Brynn Johnson and Cassie Miller have known each other for some time, but seven months ago they were brought together by a terrible tragedy. Cassie was in her car picking up Brynn's son for preschool when she was hit by a drunk driver at an intersection. Brynn was one of the first people to arrive on the scene and saw Cassie struggling to breathe as she lay pinned inside her car.
Thanks to Brynn, Cassie survived that terrible day but lost her unborn child in the accident. As they grieved together, something unexpected happened - a deep bond formed between them. They began talking about their lives, hopes, and dreams for the future. In time, their conversations evolved into more than just sharing their sorrows but also supporting each other through tough times.
Brynn and Cassie have been there for each other ever since - standing by one another no matter what life throws their way. They know that they can always count on each other, and this unbreakable bond has helped them heal in ways they never thought possible.
