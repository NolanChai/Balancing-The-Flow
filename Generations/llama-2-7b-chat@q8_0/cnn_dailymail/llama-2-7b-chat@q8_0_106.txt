hmichen was found dead with her toddler, Landon, at a railway station in California on July 20 last year. The coroner's report revealed that the pair died from blunt force injuries caused by the train that hit them after they lay down on the tracks.
In a heart-wrenching hearing, the court heard how Donna discovered her husband had been leading a double life with another woman in Egypt. It was claimed that he had been dishonest about his finances and his relationships with other women during their 15 years of marriage. The court also heard how Donna became increasingly depressed and isolated after discovering the truth, and that she struggled to cope with her emotional pain.
On the day of her death, Donna's friends and family said they had noticed a change in her behavior, which led them to believe something was wrong. They told the court how she had been acting more irrationally than usual and seemed detached from reality. They also described how she had been struggling with suicidal thoughts in the days leading up to her death.
In a statement read out in court, one of Donna's friends said: 'She was a happy, vibrant person who always put others first. But after she found out about her husband's infidelity, she seemed lost and alone.' Another friend added: 'I knew something was wrong when she started talking about suicide. She didn't seem like herself at all.'
Donna's husband, whose name has not been released, is believed to have been in a relationship with another woman for several years. He had reportedly lied to his wife about the nature of their relationship and claimed that it was just a friendship. The court heard how Donna only discovered the truth after hacking into her husband's email account.
In a statement read out in court, Donna's brother described his sister as 'a caring and loving person who always put others first'. He added: 'She was devastated when she found out about her husband's infidelity and felt betrayed by him. She struggled to cope with the pain and loneliness that followed, and it ultimately led to her tragic death.'
The hearing also heard how Donna had been in contact with a mental health hotline in the days leading up to her death. The coroner ruled that both Donna and Landon died as a result of blunt force injuries caused by the train hitting them at high speed.
Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. Many people struggle with depression, anxiety and other mental health issues after discovering their partner has been unfaithful. It's important to remember that there are always people who can help, including hotlines and counseling services. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out for support.'
