yal all failed to settle their debt by last week's deadline.
A source said: "Take That are in a mess and it seems they can't get their finances in order. They're still owing the taxman a huge amount of money and it's a disgrace that they haven't paid up yet."
The band, who are currently on tour and have just released a new album, have been accused of dodging their debts to HM Revenue & Customs. They were ordered to pay back the £20million in 2014 after an investigation into their financial dealings. But despite numerous warnings, they have failed to settle the bill.
Take That's representatives have been approached for comment but have yet to respond.
A spokesperson for HMRC said: "We understand that paying tax can be a complex issue for many people and businesses, but it is essential that everyone pays their fair share. We will continue to work with Take That to ensure they settle their debt."
Take That have had a successful career spanning over three decades and have sold millions of records worldwide. The band, which was formed in the late 1980s, originally consisted of Robbie Williams, Barlow, Owen, Doyal and Jason Orange. However, Williams quit in 1995 and the remaining members continued to perform as a trio until Orange left in 2014.
The news comes after Take That were accused of dodging their taxes in 2014. At the time, it was claimed that they had failed to pay £17million in income tax dating back to the 1990s. The band denied the allegations and said they were "shocked and disappointed" by the claims.
Take That have been contacted for comment but have yet to respond.
