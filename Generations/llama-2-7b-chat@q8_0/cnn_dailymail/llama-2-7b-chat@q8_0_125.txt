45-foot Response Boat-Medium crews from Station Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and Station South Portland, Maine, around 10 p.m. Wednesday.
The stranded sailors included Captain James Blackwood, his wife and ship's doctor, First Mate Timothy Greenleaf, bosun Pauline Fletcher, Quartermaster Michael O'Connell, and four crew members whose names have not been released by the Coast Guard.
A Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter from Air Station Cape Cod, Massachusetts, was launched to provide a visual search for the missing crewman who had fallen overboard during the incident.
The schooner's owners reported that the ship was returning to Portland after a day of sailing in the Gulf of Maine when it experienced engine failure around 5 p.m. Wednesday. The crew tried to make repairs, but were unsuccessful. As the vessel drifted closer to shore, the wind and waves became too rough for the sailors to remain on board.
"The crew did an excellent job in abandoning ship quickly and safely," said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Andrew Barker, command duty officer at Station Cape Elizabeth. "We are grateful that they were able to make it aboard our boats without incident."
A tow is being arranged for the schooner, which remains afloat off Boon Island. The cause of the engine failure is under investigation.
I'm sure you have many questions about this incident. I know I do. Why was a replica pirate ship sailing in rough seas? Didn't anyone on board think to check the weather forecast before setting sail? And what was the crew doing trying to make repairs when they were so close to shore and in danger of sinking?
But for now, let us be thankful that all members of the Liana's Ransom crew are safe. It could have been much worse if they had not received such quick and effective assistance from the Coast Guard.
