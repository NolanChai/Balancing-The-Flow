"It's crazy because I never knew how hard it was to be a boxer until now," the 18-year-old told Complex. "I thought it was just running and punching, but there's so much more to it. And my dad is 40 years old! I can't even imagine how much harder it must have been for him when he was my age."
Iyanna, who has been accompanying her father on his training camp in Las Vegas, says she's learned a lot about the sport and its demands. "I'm actually really proud of my dad," she said. "I never realized how much work he puts into every fight. He's always in the gym, no matter what time of day it is. And he's still got it!"
The young Mayweather has also been working hard alongside her father, and says that boxing has become a passion for her too. "I never knew I had it in me," she said. "But now that I'm here, I feel like I could do this forever."
Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, and Iyanna knows that being the daughter of one of the greatest boxers of all time comes with its own set of challenges. "Sometimes it feels like everyone's watching me," she said. "And they're not just watching my dad â€“ they're watching me too. So I have to make sure I represent him well."
As for her father's upcoming fight against Pacquiao, Iyanna says she's excited but also nervous. "I know this is going to be a tough one," she said. "Manny's a great fighter too, so it's not going to be easy for my dad."
But with her father's experience and expertise in the ring, Iyanna believes that he'll come out on top. "I have faith in him," she said. "He's the best, and he always will be."
