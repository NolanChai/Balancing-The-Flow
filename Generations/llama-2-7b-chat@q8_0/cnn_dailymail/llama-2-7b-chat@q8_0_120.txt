esurveillance footage of the marathon bomber, and the horrific moment when he realizes what happened is clear. On Monday, Woolfenden spoke publicly for the first time about the bombing that killed his 8-year-old son, Martin Richard, and injured his wife. He described feeling a sense of responsibility to share their story and warn others about the dangers of terrorism, after witnessing the chaos and fear that erupted in the wake of the bombings. "We need to stand together as a community, as a country, and really take a hard look at what happened here," Woolfenden said during an emotional press conference. "We can't just let this become a distant memory. We have to remember those who were lost, and we have to work to prevent anything like this from happening again." Woolfenden spoke alongside his wife, Patty Richard, and their other two children, Henry and Mary, who were also injured in the bombing. The family has been through an incredible ordeal since that day, including multiple surgeries for Martin's injuries, countless therapy sessions, and a long struggle to come to terms with what happened. But they have found strength in each other, and in their community, as they try to heal and move forward. "We are so grateful for the support that we have received from our friends, family, and neighbors," Patty Richard said. "It's been a hard road, but with all of this love and support, we know we can make it through."
