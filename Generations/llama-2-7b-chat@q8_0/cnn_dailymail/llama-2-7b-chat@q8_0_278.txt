Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are billed as two great rivals of modern day football but if former Brazil striker Ronaldo has his way, they could one day be in the same team.
The 2002 World Cup winner has called for the two superstars to join forces at Barcelona, where he played from 1996 to 2007.
Ronaldo, who is currently playing for Brazilian club Corinthians, believes that Messi and Ronaldo could be an unstoppable force on the pitch if they worked together.
"I think it would be great to see Messi and Cristiano play together at Barcelona," Ronaldo said in an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca. "They are both incredible players, and I think they could do a lot of damage on the field."
While Messi has long been associated with Barcelona, where he has played since 2004, Ronaldo believes that the Argentine star could benefit from having a partner like him on the team.
"Messi is a great player, but he needs someone to complement him," Ronaldo said. "With me and Messi on the same team, we could create a lot of goals and win many games."
Despite their rivalry on the pitch, Ronaldo says that he has nothing but respect for Messi off the field.
"Messi is a great guy, and I have a lot of admiration for him," Ronaldo said. "We may compete against each other on the field, but we are both professionals who want to do well for our teams."
While it remains to be seen whether Messi and Ronaldo will ever play together at Barcelona, their combined talents could make for a formidable partnership on the pitch.
