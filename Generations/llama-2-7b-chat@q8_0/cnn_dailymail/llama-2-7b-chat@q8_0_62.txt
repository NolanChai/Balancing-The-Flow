k a sci-fi film, this is not the case. Rogue planets are worlds without a fixed orbit around a star and can move freely through the galaxy. They are often found in regions of space where stars are scarce and may provide conditions suitable for life to exist. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is one of astronomy's most popular pursuits, with scientists scouring the universe for any signs of alien civilizations.
Scientists have been able to detect biosignatures in other worlds by looking for methane gas in their atmospheres and studying the atmospheres of exoplanets for signs of life. This has led to a new search for rogue planets that may be hiding extraterrestrial life.
According to researchers, rogue planets could offer a habitat for life forms to evolve and thrive without being influenced by their host star. They also suggest that rogue planets could provide insights into the conditions under which life emerged on Earth.
