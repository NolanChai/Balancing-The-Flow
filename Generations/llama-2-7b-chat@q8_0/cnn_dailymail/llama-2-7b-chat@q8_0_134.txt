Did you blink? There was a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday - but it was an unusually short one. The lunar event - where Earth's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes, making it the briefest total lunar eclipse in 150 years.
"It's been 150 years since a total lunar eclipse has occurred so quickly after the previous one," said NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams. "In fact, this is the shortest total lunar eclipse of the moon since 1863."
The event was visible from parts of the world including North America, South America, Europe and Africa. The eclipse began at 9:04 a.m. EST Saturday and ended at 9:10 a.m. EST - just six minutes after it started.
