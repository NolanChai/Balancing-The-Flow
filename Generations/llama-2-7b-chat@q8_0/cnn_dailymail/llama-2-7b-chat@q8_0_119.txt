The body of a girl who vanished on her fifth birthday while playing at a Texas marina has been found in the water nearby.
Fiona 'Kitty' Carroll was at Kemah Boardwalk Marina as her father worked on his boat when she wandered off and disappeared last Saturday afternoon. Despite an extensive search involving divers, police dogs, and volunteers, no sign of the youngster was found until early Tuesday morning.
Police in Clear Lake Shores, Texas, said they were called to the marina around 5:30am on Tuesday after a fisherman reported spotting a body in the water. The body was confirmed to be that of Fiona Carroll, who turned five years old last Saturday.
The cause of death is not yet known and an autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause and manner of death.
Fiona's father, John Carroll, said he and his family are devastated by her loss. 'We are heartbroken and our thoughts are with Fiona's mother during this difficult time,' he said in a statement. 'We ask that people respect the privacy of our family as we come to terms with this tragedy.'
The marina where Fiona vanished has been closed until further notice while police investigate the circumstances surrounding her disappearance and death.
