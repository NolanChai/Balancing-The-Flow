Andrew Hennells, 24, admitted possessing a shotgun and ammunition in the days leading up to the planned heist, as well as posting messages on social media about his intentions. He was arrested after police raided his home and found the weapons.
Hennells appeared at Exeter Crown Court via video link from HMP Exeter today (WED) where he pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and one charge of making threats to kill. He was sentenced to six years in prison.
Prosecutor Peter Coombe said: "The defendant made various posts on Facebook, including one that said 'I'm planning a Tesco job, any1 got any ideas?' and another that said 'I need a getaway car'. These posts were made 15 minutes apart."
Police found a shotgun, a pair of gloves and a balaclava in Hennells' bedroom during the raid. He also had a further five rounds of ammunition in his pocket.
Hennells was arrested at his home in Plymouth on November 24 last year after police received information about the planned robbery. He admitted that he had been planning to hold up staff at the Tesco store in the city and steal cash from the tills.
Judge Erik Salomonsen told Hennells: "You have shown a callous disregard for the law and for the safety of others. You have a history of offending and you need to take responsibility for your actions."
Hennells, who has previous convictions for robbery and assault, was also given a five-year extended licence period meaning he will be on licence for an additional five years after his release from prison.
