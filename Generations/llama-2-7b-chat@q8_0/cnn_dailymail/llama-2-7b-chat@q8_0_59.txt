7/4 underdog going into the match, but is adamant that he will come out on top against Mayweather.
"I am ready to give everything I have in this fight," said Pacquiao, who has won world titles in eight different weight divisions during his career. "This is my last chance to prove myself and show the world what I can do. I cannot afford to lose. It would be a tragedy if I didn't come out on top."
Pacquiao, 38, believes that Mayweather, 40, has underestimated him and will be shocked by his speed and agility inside the ring. "Floyd thinks he can just walk in there and dominate me," said Pacquiao. "But I am faster than him. I am stronger than him. And I have a plan to beat him."
The fight, which is expected to be one of the highest-grossing bouts of all time, will take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2. It is set to be shown live on pay-per-view around the world, with millions of viewers expected to tune in to see the two fighters go head-to-head.
Pacquiao and Mayweather have a long history of animosity between them, with both fighters trading insults and barbs during their promotional tour leading up to the fight. But Pacquiao is adamant that he has no personal issues with Mayweather and is only focused on winning the fight.
"I don't hate Floyd," said Pacquiao. "I just want to beat him. I am a fighter, not a hater. And when we touch gloves in the ring, it will be like it is the last of my life."
