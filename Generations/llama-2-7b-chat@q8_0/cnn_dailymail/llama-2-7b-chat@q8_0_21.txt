 discovery has left experts stunned and officials are now working to identify the mummified remains.
The cleaner, who wishes to remain anonymous, told local media: "I was sweeping the streets when I saw something wrapped in a dirty old sheet. I thought it might be a dead body, but as I got closer, I could see that it was covered in dust and dirt."
However, upon further inspection, the cleaner realized the remains were actually a mummy. The mummy was found in a cardboard box along with some trash.
Experts from the National Institute of Culture (INC) have taken charge of the discovery and are working to determine the identity of the mummy. They believe it could be up to 900 years old, making it one of the oldest mummies ever discovered in Peru.
The discovery has sparked a flurry of questions, including how the mummy ended up on the street and why it was left there. Local residents say they have never seen anything like it before.
Peru is home to many ancient cultures, including the Incas and the Nazca. The country has a rich history of mummification, with many mummies found in caves, tombs, and other archaeological sites across the country. However, this discovery is particularly significant due to its age and location.
The cleaner who made the discovery said: "I never expected to find something like this on my job. I'm just glad I could help uncover a piece of history."
Officials are now working to preserve the mummy and learn more about its origins. The INC has promised to carry out further analysis to determine the age, gender, and other details of the mummy.
