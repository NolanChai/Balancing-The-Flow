United are set to face Inter Milan in two friendly games during their trip, as well as take on a Major League Soccer All-Star team. Van Gaal has revealed that he was keen to arrange the pre-season tour so his players could hit the ground running when the league season kicks off in August.
"I think it's very important we start the season well and this tour will help us do that," said van Gaal. "We have a lot of work to do before the season starts, but I believe this tour will give us the perfect opportunity to prepare for the challenges ahead."
Van Gaal believes the short nature of the tour - United will play three games in 12 days - will help his players avoid fatigue and ensure they are fully fit and raring to go come August.
"We have a very tough schedule next season and I don't want my players to be tired before the season has even started," he added. "This tour will give us the chance to work on our fitness and tactics, as well as giving the players the chance to get used to playing in hot weather conditions."
United are also set to face Roma in a friendly game during the tour, but the details of that match are still to be confirmed.
The pre-season tour will be United's first since 2012 and van Gaal believes it will be an important stepping stone towards achieving success next season.
"I believe this tour will be a great opportunity for us to build momentum and get our campaign off to a flying start," he added. "It's going to be a tough road ahead, but I have every confidence that we can achieve our goals if we work hard and stay focused."
