 he tests the Siri feature on his iPhone 7 Plus by asking it a series of questions, including some that are clearly designed to provoke a negative response.
In one instance, Alex asks Siri "What is wrong with gays?" and the assistant responds with the phrase "I don't have an answer to that." However, when Alex asks a similar question about people with disabilities, the response is more positive and supportive.
Siri's responses in Russian are generated by a machine learning algorithm that Apple has trained on a dataset of text in the language. It's possible that the algorithm was trained on a biased or incomplete dataset, which could explain why it produced such offensive responses in this case.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue, but it is likely to be taking a closer look at its Siri training data to ensure that it does not contain any harmful or discriminatory content. The company has a reputation for being LGBTQ-friendly and inclusive, and it will want to avoid any appearance of homophobia or disrespect towards the community.
