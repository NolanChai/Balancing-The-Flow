 lawsuit against Vergara, demanding she hand over the eggs as he believes he has "equal rights" to them after they were both involved in the fertility treatment.
According to court papers obtained by RadarOnline, Loeb is claiming that Vergara failed to disclose her frozen eggs when their relationship ended, and he now wants to take legal action against her for "hiding" them from him.
Loeb's lawsuit states: 'The defendant (Vergara) has refused to return the frozen embryos despite numerous requests and demands. The plaintiff (Loeb) is entitled to equal rights in the frozen embryos.'
The couple were together for several years before splitting up last year, with Vergara moving on to date True Blood star Joe Manganiello.
A source close to Loeb told RadarOnline: 'Nick has been trying to get these eggs back since their breakup and Sofia has been dragging her feet. Now he's taking legal action to make sure she doesn't hide them from him forever.'
Vergara's rep has yet to comment on the legal dispute, but it is unclear how a court would rule in such a case as there are no laws that specifically address the ownership of frozen eggs or embryos in the event of a split.
Frozen eggs and embryos are typically considered property, rather than people, under US law, meaning they can be subject to division in a divorce just like any other asset.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states that 'the ownership of frozen sperm, eggs or embryos should be determined by the laws of the state where they are stored', but there is no federal law on the matter.
