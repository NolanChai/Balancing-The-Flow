Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four finish in the Premier League – there had been concerns about the timing of the match, which is traditionally one of the most highly anticipated fixtures in English football.
However, Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that they will not be objecting to the 4:30pm kick-off, which is earlier than usual for a Premier League match. The force has taken into account the feelings of both sets of fans and has decided that the earlier kick-off will not pose a significant risk of disorder or violence.
A spokesperson for GMP said: "We have taken into account the views of both Manchester United and Manchester City fans, as well as other stakeholders, and have decided that an earlier kick-off will not pose a significant risk of disorder or violence. We will be working closely with both sets of supporters to ensure their safety and security on the day."
The derby has always been a highly charged fixture, but tensions were heightened in recent weeks following controversy over United's Europa League exit and City's Champions League victory over Real Madrid. However, police are confident that the match will be peaceful and that both sets of fans can enjoy the occasion without any issues.
United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has urged his players to approach the match with caution, saying: "It's a massive game for us and we need to make sure we're at our best. We know how important it is for our fans and we want to give them something to cheer about."
City boss Pep Guardiola has also called on his players to be focused and determined, saying: "This is a huge match for us and we need to take our chances. We know United will be tough opponents, but we're confident in our ability to win."
With the pressure mounting on both managers, Sunday's Manchester derby promises to be an unforgettable occasion. And with the earlier kick-off time, fans will have even more time to savor the atmosphere and excitement of this most iconic of Premier League fixtures.
