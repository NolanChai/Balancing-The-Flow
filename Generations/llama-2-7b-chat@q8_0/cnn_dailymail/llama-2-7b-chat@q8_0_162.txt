 and Jamie were married on the show, things quickly went awry when Jamie revealed that he had a large man-boob. The couple struggled to connect, with Amy admitting she was uncomfortable with his physical appearance. She even tried to leave him at the altar during their ceremony.
But after several months of separation, Amy has now revealed that she has started to develop romantic feelings for Jamie despite his larger-than-usual breasts. In a recent interview, she said: "I never thought I'd say this about Jamie, but I have to admit he's grown on me. Despite his man-boob, he's actually a really sweet guy and I find myself feeling drawn to him."
The 32-year-old reality star went on to explain that her initial discomfort with Jamie's appearance was due to her own insecurities rather than anything to do with him as a person. "I know it sounds shallow, but I'd been comparing myself to other women on social media and feeling insecure about my own body," she said. "So when Jamie revealed he had a man-boob, it was like the final straw for me."
Despite their rocky start, Amy and Jamie have reportedly been spending more time together and are even considering giving their marriage another go. A source close to the couple told reporters: "Amy's finally realized that she has feelings for Jamie beyond just his looks, and they're both excited about the prospect of giving their marriage another chance."
While it remains to be seen if Amy and Jamie will actually reconcile, one thing is clear â€“ the couple's love story has been nothing short of drama-filled! Will they make it work this time around or will their differences ultimately tear them apart? Only time will tell.
