The Blues are believed to be long-term admirers of the Spain international, who has established himself as one of La Liga's top midfielders since joining Atletico from Barcelona in 2014.
Koke has scored 16 goals and provided 28 assists in 136 appearances for Atletico, and has also been capped 29 times for Spain.
Mourinho is keen to strengthen his midfield options at Stamford Bridge, with Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas both approaching the final year of their contracts.
Koke's versatility in playing as a central midfielder or on either flank makes him an attractive proposition for Mourinho, who is looking to add more depth and creativity to his squad this summer.
Atletico are understood to value Koke highly, but could be willing to sell if the right offer is made. However, they may also want to keep hold of their star player if they are able to secure Champions League football for next season.
