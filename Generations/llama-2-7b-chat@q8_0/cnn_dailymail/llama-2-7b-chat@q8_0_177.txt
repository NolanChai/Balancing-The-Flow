 The exhibition has been praised for its bold and powerful portrayal of black culture, history, and identity, which were often ignored or erased by mainstream American society at the time.
The series, created between 1940 and 1941, was originally intended to be a single painting, but Lawrence saw the story as too vast to be contained in one work. Instead, he divided it into 60 small panels, each measuring just 8 by 10 inches. The paintings are arranged chronologically, from the end of slavery in 1865 to the beginning of World War II in 1941, and they depict scenes of rural poverty, violence, and hardship as well as images of hope, resilience, and determination.
Lawrence's technique was unique for its time, blending African-American folk art traditions with modernist styles like cubism and expressionism. The works are characterized by bold colors, simplified forms, and a raw emotional power that speaks to the experiences of black people in America. Each panel is accompanied by a brief text explaining the event or historical figure depicted, which serves as both an educational tool and a way to personalize the narrative for viewers.
The series has been hailed as a masterpiece of American art and a powerful testament to the resilience and strength of black people in America. It was first exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1941, where it was praised by critics and attracted national attention. Today, "The Migration of the Negro" remains one of Lawrence's most celebrated works, and its impact on American art and culture continues to be felt.
