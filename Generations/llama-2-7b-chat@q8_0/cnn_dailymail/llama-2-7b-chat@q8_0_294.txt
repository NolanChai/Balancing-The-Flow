. Bandini was secretly recorded by detectives in a sting operation after she told them that Weinstein had groped her breast and pulled down her pants during a meeting at his office in 2015.
During the recording, which was made available to The New York Times, Weinstein can be heard admitting that he touched Bandini's breast, but insisting that it was not sexual. "I'm not sure what to call it because of the circumstances," he said. "It was a dark time for me, I was in a dark place, and I made a terrible mistake."
Weinstein's lawyer has denied any wrongdoing by his client. But the recording has sparked outrage among women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault, with many taking to social media to express their support for Bandini and call for justice. As investigations into Weinstein's conduct continue, it remains to be seen how these allegations will impact his career and reputation.
