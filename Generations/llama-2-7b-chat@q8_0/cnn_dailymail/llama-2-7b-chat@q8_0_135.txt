Today it's the norm to order taxis using an app, but now a service lets its users schedule a delivery of drugs to their door. The app, called Eaze, has been dubbed ‘Uber for weed’ and enables people to get marijuana delivered to them in California and San Francisco, reports the Verge.
Eaze provides customers with a list of local dispensaries that deliver through its platform, allowing users to browse menus, compare prices, and track their orders from pickup to delivery. The service has been popular among recreational and medical marijuana users who live in areas where pot is legal.
According to Eaze’s CEO, Keith McCurdy, the app has grown 30% each month since its launch last year, with over 150,000 active customers using it. The company plans to expand into more cities as marijuana becomes legal in additional states and countries.
The service has faced opposition from law enforcement agencies who say it contributes to drug use and illegal distribution of drugs. However, McCurdy argues that Eaze is merely providing a safe and convenient way for people to obtain legal products.
While the app’s popularity suggests there may be a market for such services in other areas, lawmakers continue to debate whether or not to legalize marijuana nationwide. If pot were made completely legal, it seems likely that apps like Eaze would become more commonplace and widespread.
Do you think we'll see more of these types of services pop up as marijuana becomes legal in additional places? Or do you think lawmakers will find a way to shut them down? Let us know in the comments below!
