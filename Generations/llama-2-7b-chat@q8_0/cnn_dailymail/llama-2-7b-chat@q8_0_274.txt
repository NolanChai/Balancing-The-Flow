 he airport in Leicestershire, England on Monday. The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) posted a photo showing the damaged aircraft and the debris scattered on the runway.
Investigators said that they are still trying to determine what caused the wheel to break off during landing. A spokesman for East Midlands Airport said the pilot of the flight from Amsterdam made a "safe emergency landing." No injuries were reported among the 163 passengers and five crew members on board the plane.
AAIB is investigating the incident with the help of experts from Boeing, the manufacturer of the aircraft. The AAIB said it will look at several factors in its investigation, including the condition of the landing gear and any potential structural issues with the aircraft.
The incident is similar to one that occurred last year when a British Airways plane suffered a landing gear failure during landing at London's Heathrow Airport. In both cases, the pilots were able to make safe emergency landings without any injuries.
Air safety has been an increasingly important issue in recent years due to growing concerns about security threats and technical failures. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has warned of potential risks from aging aircraft fleets in Europe, and the AAIB is investigating a number of incidents involving older planes.
In conclusion, the landing gear failure on the Boeing 737 at East Midlands Airport highlights the importance of safety measures in aviation industry. The investigation into the incident will help determine the cause of the wheel breaking off during landing and prevent similar incidents from occurring in future.
