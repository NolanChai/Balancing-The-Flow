According to experts, the endurance of the panda couple is due to their age and experience. "At around six years old, pandas are physically and mentally mature enough to mate," said Dr. Liu Qing, a researcher at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding. "Their longer mating time may also be attributed to their higher level of fitness."
Lu Lu's record-breaking love-making comes after a year of preparation and excitement among zookeepers. The panda couple had been observed engaging in pre-mating behaviors, such as sniffing and rubbing against each other, for several months beforehand.
The record-breaking mating is significant not only for Lu Lu but also for the conservation of the giant panda species as a whole. "The longer mating time means that the panda couple has more opportunities to mate and produce offspring," said Dr. Liu Qing. "This is crucial for the survival and propagation of the species."
The news of Lu Lu's record-breaking love-making has been met with excitement among zoo visitors, who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the panda couple's offspring. As Dr. Liu Qing pointed out, "Every panda birth is a significant event for conservation and is closely monitored by scientists and animal lovers alike."
In conclusion, Lu Lu's record-breaking mating is a testament to his strength and endurance as a panda. His impressive performance sets a new standard for the species and brings hope for the survival and propagation of the giant panda in the wild.
