And at the top of that list is pizza - something Mayweather Jnr reportedly can't resist no matter how much he's training or how big his fight purse is.
According to chef Sharon Watkins, who has been cooking for Mayweather Jn since 2013, her boss has a soft spot for pizza and will often request it when they are on the road together. 
'He loves pizza so much that we even have a special pizza day on the tour,' Watkins told DailymailTV. 'We'll stop at a local pizzeria wherever we are and he'll get a slice or two to tide him over until dinner.' 
Mayweather Jn is known for his strict diet and training regime, but it seems even the best laid plans can't resist the temptation of a good pizza every now and then. Watkins also revealed that while her boss is particular about what he eats, there are some things he won't touch with a bargepole, including vegetables and fruit. 
But despite these quirks, Mayweather Jn remains one of the fittest and best-conditioned boxers in the sport, thanks in no small part to Watkins' culinary expertise.
