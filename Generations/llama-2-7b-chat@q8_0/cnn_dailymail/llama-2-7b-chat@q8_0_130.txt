fti Gambhir's side in the Indian Premier League (IPL) against Sunrisers Hyderabad last week and will miss at least the next two matches.
Finch, who has scored over 5000 runs in T20 cricket, has been an integral part of Yorkshire's set-up for several years, having played a key role in their World Cup victory in 2019. However, his availability for the upcoming season remains uncertain as he continues to recover from the hamstring injury sustained during the IPL.
Despite Finch's absence, Yorkshire have a strong squad and are confident of maintaining their high standards in the county circuit. The likes of Alex Lees, Jonny Bairstow, and David Willey will be crucial to the team's success this summer, as they look to defend their title and challenge for silverware in all formats.
The start of the new county season is fast approaching, with the first round of matches set to take place in early May. While Finch's availability remains uncertain, Yorkshire fans will be eagerly waiting for his return to action as they look to make a strong start to the campaign.
