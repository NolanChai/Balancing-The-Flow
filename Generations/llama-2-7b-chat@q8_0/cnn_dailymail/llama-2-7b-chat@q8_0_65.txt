 home will act as a ' Virtual reality ' wake-up call and bring back memories and emotions.
The " Dementia Virtual Reality Project" is the brainchild of a team of researchers from New York University's School of Medicine who have been working with local care homes to create a tailored VR experience for each resident. The videos are created by filming the loved ones of the residents, usually family members or close friends, talking to them and sharing happy memories and stories. These recordings are then edited into short VR clips that can be viewed wearing a headset.
The idea behind the project is to tap into the emotional connections between people with dementia and their loved ones in a way that traditional methods of stimulation may not achieve. The team believes that by evoking strong emotions, such as happiness or sadness, the VR experience could help to wake up the part of the brain responsible for emotional processing, potentially improving mood and overall well-being.
The project is still in its early stages, but initial results are promising, with some residents showing improved cognitive function after viewing the VR recordings. As the technology advances, it is hoped that it could become a valuable tool in the fight against dementia, providing a new way to stimulate and engage patients in care homes around the world.
