Danny Boudreaux, 63, will be released from prison after Jefferson County Circuit Judge Lisa Schmid Lupo vacated his death sentence in light of new evidence that has raised serious doubts about his guilt, reports the Associated Press.
Boudreaux was convicted and sentenced to death in 1987 for the murder of a convenience store clerk and the kidnapping and murder of a young girl during a carjacking. However, on Wednesday, prosecutors told the court that they had found new DNA evidence that may have exonerated Boudreaux.
The development came after Boudreaux's lawyers discovered a state police crime lab report from 1986 that revealed a partial DNA profile from the crime scene did not match Boudreaux. The report was never shared with his legal team during his original trial, the AP reports.
Prosecutors told the court they will not appeal the judge's decision to vacate Boudreaux's death sentence and will instead work on re-testing DNA evidence from the crime scene to determine if it could exonerate him.
"I want to thank everybody who has stood by me all these years," Boudreaux said in a statement after the hearing. "I am grateful for the opportunity to prove my innocence and move on with my life."
Boudreaux's release comes months after a similar case in Alabama, where a man named Tommy Brown was released from death row after prosecutors admitted they had misled the court during his trial.
