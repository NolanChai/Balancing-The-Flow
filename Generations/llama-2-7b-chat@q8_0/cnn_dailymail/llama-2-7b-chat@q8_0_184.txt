 it was launched from Kazakhstan aboard a Soyuz rocket on April 21.
Roscosmos officials say they are working to regain control of the spacecraft, which is currently drifting in an unpredictable orbit around Earth. The ship contains about two tons of food, fuel and supplies for the International Space Station's crew, but it's not clear if any of those items will be lost if the spaceship can't be brought under control.
The Progress M-27M spaceship was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on April 21st at 9:45 a.m. EST (1445 GMT). Just three minutes later, communication with the spacecraft was lost, and officials quickly realized something had gone wrong.
"The spacecraft is in an orbit that's not controlled," Igor Komarov, the head of Roscosmos told reporters. "We are trying to establish contact with it, but so far we haven't succeeded."
The Progress M-27M is one of a series of cargo vessels that Russia uses to supply the International Space Station. The ship contains 2.3 tons of fuel, 1 ton of water, and about 1.5 tons of food and other supplies for the station's crew. It was scheduled to arrive at the space station on April 23rd.
The cause of the malfunction is not yet clear, but Roscosmos officials say they are investigating several possible reasons, including a possible rocket failure or a systems failure aboard the spaceship itself.
Roscosmos says it will continue to try and regain control of the spacecraft, but if they are unable to do so, it could mean the end of the Progress M-27M mission and a significant loss of supplies for the International Space Station's crew.
