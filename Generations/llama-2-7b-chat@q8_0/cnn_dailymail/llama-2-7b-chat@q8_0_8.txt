 years ago, to our modern-day immigration and cultural diversity, how has being English evolved over time?
The English are a nation of storytellers and poets, so it is fitting that we turn to literature to help us explore what it means to be English. From Shakespeare’s plays that defined the national identity of Elizabethan England, to modern-day writers like Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan who grapple with issues of race and belonging, literature provides a unique window into our understanding of Englishness.
But how does this relate to contemporary Britain? As we face the challenges of Brexit and social change, what does it mean to be English today? Do we still feel a sense of shared history and culture? Or have these evolved over time to encompass a more diverse range of experiences and identities?
In this podcast, we’ll explore the evolution of Englishness from ancient times to modern day, looking at how literature has helped shape our understanding of what it means to be English. From the Romans, Saxons and Normans to our modern-day immigration and cultural diversity, we’ll examine how different historical events have shaped our national identity. And as we reflect on this rich history, we’ll ask ourselves: what does it mean to be English today? Is there still a shared sense of history and culture that defines us, or has this evolved over time to encompass a more diverse range of experiences and identities?
So join me on this journey as we explore the evolution of Englishness through literature. Let’s find out what it means to be English today, and how this has shaped our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.
