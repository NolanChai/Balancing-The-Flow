When Barcelona midfield maestro Xavi came on as a half-time substitute against PSG in the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday night he sent records tumbling. The former Spain international player, who is now 38 years old, became the oldest player to feature in the Champions League knockout phase with his appearance for Barcelona.
According to UEFA statistics, Xavi broke the previous record held by Portuguese legend Lu√≠s Figo, who was 37 years and 160 days old when he played in the 2005 Champions League final for AC Milan.
Xavi's appearance also marked his 148th Champions League game, moving him ahead of Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon into third place on the all-time list of most appearances in the competition.
The midfielder's cameo against PSG was a timely intervention from Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman, who had seen his side fall 2-0 down at the interval. Xavi helped Barca to dominate possession and control the pace of the game after the break, although they were unable to find a way past the PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Xavi's impact on the game was not surprising given his reputation as one of the most skilled and experienced players in the world. He has won 25 trophies during his club career, including four Champions League titles with Barcelona, and has been named UEFA Best Midfielder three times.
The former Barcelona captain's performances on the pitch have earned him a place in the pantheon of football greats, and his record-breaking appearance against PSG is just the latest example of his enduring influence on the game.
