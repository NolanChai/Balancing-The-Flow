ers, researchers believe the opposite is more likely - that the prehistoric beasts may have been running away from floodwaters.
The tracks, discovered in the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Park, are thought to be around 100 million years old and offer a unique glimpse into the lives of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period.
According to study co-author Dr. Jose Luis Carballido of Spain's University of Barcelona, "The tracks show that the animals were running downhill, not climbing up." He believes they likely made their way down a steep slope as quickly as possible during a flood event.
The researchers believe the footprints are from sauropods - large, long-necked herbivores that roamed what is now the Atacama Desert in South America during the Cretaceous period. The prints are similar to those found at other sites around the world and suggest these ancient reptiles were quite nimble on their legs.
While the idea of dinosaurs running from floodwaters may seem fantastical, it's not entirely implausible. Many dinosaur tracks have been found in areas where there are obvious flood deposits. And several studies have suggested that Cretaceous sauropods were able to move quickly when they needed to - possibly even climbing trees or escaping from predators.
"These findings contribute to our understanding of the behavior and ecology of these ancient animals," says Carballido, adding that the footprints provide a fascinating look at the lives of these prehistoric beasts. "Their ability to move quickly and efficiently over challenging terrain would have been crucial for their survival."
