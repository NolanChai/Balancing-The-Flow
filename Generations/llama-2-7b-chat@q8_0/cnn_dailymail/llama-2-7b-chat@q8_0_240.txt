 heartbroken after losing 21-14 to Scarlets in last weekend's semi-final, but the flanker insists they will use that disappointment as motivation for the rest of the campaign.
"We're going to take the lessons we learned from that game and apply them to the rest of the season," Watson said. "The pain of that loss is still there, but it can drive us to be better. We want to make sure we don't experience that feeling again this year."
Watson added: "It's a big blow for us, especially after how well we were performing in the Champions Cup. But we can't dwell on it too much, we have to look forward and focus on what we need to do to get to the play-offs. We know it's going to be tough, but we're up for the challenge."
Bath will finish their league campaign in fifth place, regardless of the outcome of this weekend's match against London Irish. However, they will still have a chance to secure a top-four finish and a play-off spot if results go their way. Watson is confident that his team can achieve their goal and make the play-offs despite last weekend's defeat.
"We know we're in a good position going into the final two games of the season," he said. "If we can win both of those games, who knows? We might be able to get that top four spot. It's not going to be easy, but we're definitely capable of it."
Watson believes Bath's recent form, which has seen them win three of their last four league matches, is a sign of things to come. He said: "We've been playing some good rugby over the past few weeks and we're starting to click as a team. If we can keep that up, who knows what could happen?"
As for this weekend's match against London Irish, Watson is expecting a tough encounter. "They're always a physical team and they'll be coming here looking to get a result," he said. "But we're confident in our own ability and we know we can beat them if we play to our strengths."
Overall, while last weekend's Champions Cup defeat was a setback for Bath, Watson remains optimistic about their chances of making the Aviva Premiership play-offs. With two league matches remaining and a strong run of form behind them, anything is possible for the Blue, Black and White.
