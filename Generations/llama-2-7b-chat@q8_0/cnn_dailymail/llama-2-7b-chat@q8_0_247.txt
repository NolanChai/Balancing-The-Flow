y walk 200 metres had been caught taking long walks at the Lake District and in London.
Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, admitted using a blue badge belonging to his wife when he was out walking with friends. He said he thought he would be breaking the law if he did not use the badge, which is reserved for those who have difficulty walking more than 200 meters (656 feet) without needing to rest.
But in reality, Gregory has been a keen walker for years and has taken long walks in places such as the Lake District and London . He was fined £795 by magistrates at Northampton Justice Centre after he admitted misusing the badge on two occasions last year.
The court heard that Gregory used his wife's badge when he went for a 12-mile walk in the Lake District with friends and also when he went for a five-mile stroll in London . He told magistrates that he thought he would be breaking the law if he did not use the badge, but they found him guilty of fraudulently using it.
Gregory said he was 'embarrassed' by his actions and promised to return the badge to his wife as soon as possible . He also agreed to pay £795 towards costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
Jillian Pritchard, prosecuting, said the badge is meant for people who have severe mobility problems that would make it difficult or impossible to walk without resting frequently. She added: 'The defendant in this case has been caught misusing the badge and claiming he can only walk a short distance when in fact he has taken long walks on several occasions.
