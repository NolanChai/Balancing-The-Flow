antemple-themed building had been there for over two decades.
The shocking discovery was made by residents of the gated community after a string of complaints about loud noises and disturbance from the mansion, which is located near a golf course in Palm Beach County.
According to local reports, the mansion has been home to an elite stripper training school for many years, with students paying upwards of $10,000 to learn the art of exotic dancing from instructors who have worked in some of the top clubs around the world.
The school is run by a woman named Jade, who has a reputation as one of the best stripper trainers in the business. She reportedly offers her students a range of services, including pole dancing, lap dancing and burlesque performances.
Neighbors say they had no idea about the secret school until recently, when they began to notice a steady stream of young women entering and leaving the mansion at all hours of the night. They also claim that they could hear loud music and laughter coming from inside the property, which was said to be 'like nothing they'd ever heard before'.
One resident, who asked not to be named, told local media: "It was like a nightclub next door. We couldn't believe it. They were having parties all night long, with music blasting and people screaming."
The discovery has caused shockwaves through the community, with some residents demanding that the school be shut down.
"I don't want this kind of activity in our neighborhood," said one resident. "It's not something we signed up for when we moved here."
Another neighbor added: "This is a family-friendly community and we don't want it to become a party house. We deserve some peace and quiet at night."
The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that they are investigating the complaints and have spoken to the owner of the mansion, who claims that he is not aware of any illegal activity taking place on his property.
However, neighbors say they have seen students entering and leaving the mansion late at night, and claim that they have heard loud noises coming from inside.
It's not clear how long the school has been operating or how many students it has trained over the years. But one thing is for sure - this discovery will be remembered as one of the more unexpected secrets to come out of Palm Beach County in recent memory.
