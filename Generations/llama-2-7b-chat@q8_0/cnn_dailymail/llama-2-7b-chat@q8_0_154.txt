 their new home, with the oldest one seemingly taking charge.
Bronx Zoo primate curator Jim Breheny said they were born during a very unusual time for gorillas at the zoo since it was during the pandemic and there were not many people visiting.
“It’s just a rare moment to have two gorilla babies born at the same time, let alone twins.”
The baby gorillas were delivered by a surrogate mother after their mother died last year. The surrogate was chosen because she had recently given birth and her milk production is similar to that of the mother who died.
“We have a great team of veterinarians and primatologists who work together to make sure these babies are well taken care of, especially in their first few weeks of life.” 
Breheny said it was fascinating to observe how quickly the twins bonded with each other and their surrogate mother.
“It’s just amazing to see them grow and develop their personalities, they are very curious and active little animals. They spend most of their time playing, running around, and exploring their new environment.” 
The zoo said visitors will be able to spot the babies in their exhibit, which features a large indoor/outdoor space designed to mimic the gorillas’ natural habitat in the Congo.
Breheny encouraged visitors to keep an eye on the babies as they continue to grow and develop. 
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our visitors to witness these incredible creatures up close, and we are excited to share this special moment with everyone.”
