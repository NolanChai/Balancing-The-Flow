, cola bottles and peppermint chips - will be available at the counters in up to 100 stores across the UK from next month.
The move has been welcomed by the Muslim Council of Britain, which described it as a "positive step". The council's director of public affairs, Inayat Bunglawala, said: "Muslim consumers have expressed frustration at not being able to enjoy pick and mix due to the lack of halal options.
"Morrisons has recognised this issue and taken steps to address it by providing dedicated halal-only counters. This is a positive step towards greater inclusivity and sensitivity towards Muslim consumers."
It's nice to see that Morrisons is taking steps to accommodate the dietary requirements of their Muslim customers, but it's also worth noting that this move could have broader implications for how food manufacturers and retailers cater to people with different dietary needs. As more and more people adopt vegetarian or vegan diets, or follow other restricted diets for health reasons, there will be a growing demand for alternatives that are both tasty and nutritious.
It's also worth considering the potential impact on non-Muslim customers who may feel excluded from enjoying pick and mix sweets in Morrisons stores. While it's important to respect the dietary requirements of Muslim customers, it's equally important to ensure that all customers can enjoy the products offered by Morrisons without feeling unwelcome or marginalised.
Overall, this move by Morrisons is a positive step towards greater inclusivity and diversity in the retail industry, and it will be interesting to see how other food manufacturers and retailers follow suit in catering to the changing needs and preferences of their customers.
