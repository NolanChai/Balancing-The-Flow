Williams, who is seeded first at the Australian Open next week, struggled with her serve and had to save two break points before winning the tiebreaker in the first set. She then regrouped to win six consecutive games and seal the match on her third match point.
"It was a tough match," Williams said in an on-court interview. "Camila played really well, especially in that first set. But I'm happy I could find a way to win."
Williams has now won 18 Fed Cup matches in a row and improved her career record to 23-2 in the competition. She will next play against Italy's Sara Errani or Francesca Schiavone on Sunday, with the United States leading the tie 1-0.
The win was Williams' first since she gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. last September and marked her return to competitive tennis after a 14-month absence. She had been ranked No. 1 in the world when she took maternity leave but has since slipped to No. 183 due to her lack of competition.
"It's always tough coming back from having a baby," Williams said. "I'm just glad I could get this win under my belt and get some confidence going into next week."
