 shows how quickly the water rose after a torrential downpour inundated the North Shore line.
The flooding caused disruptions and delays to commuters who were forced to wade through chest-deep water at some stations. Train services on the North Shore line were suspended for several hours while workers assessed the damage and cleared debris from the tracks.
"It was like a river running through the station," said one commuter, "I've never seen anything like it before."
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has confirmed that Wednesday's storm was the worst in 10 years, with more than 100mm of rain falling across the Sydney basin. The heavy rain caused widespread flooding and damage to properties, with some areas recording up to 200mm of rainfall.
The flooding at the train station is just one of many examples of how the storm has affected commuters in Sydney. Many roads are also underwater, causing long delays for drivers. Emergency services have been working throughout the day to help those in need and clear debris from the roads.
