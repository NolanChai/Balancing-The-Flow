14th February 1985 meant to him
John Helm MBE is a radio presenter who has been involved with BBC Radio Leeds for over 40 years. He was the commentator on the day of the Bradford City fire in 1985 and still struggles to listen to his own description of that fateful day. Here he gives his insight into what February 14th means to him:
“It’s still difficult for me to talk about that day, even though it’s been over 30 years since the fire at Bradford City’s Valley Parade stadium. It was a day that will always be etched in my memory and I think of the victims and their families every year on February 14th.
“I remember the game against Lincoln City like it was yesterday, the smell of the burning rubber, the screams of the crowd, and the feeling of complete chaos as panic set in. It was a day that changed football forever and one that I will never forget.
“As a commentator, I’m used to being detached from the action on the pitch, but that day I was right in the thick of it. The sound of the fire alarm echoed through the stadium, and we quickly realized something was seriously wrong. It was a feeling of pure horror as we watched fans rushing for the exits, desperate to escape the flames.
“The images from that day are seared into my memory: the burning stands, the smoke billowing across the pitch, and the despair on the faces of the fans. It was a tragedy that left 56 people dead and over 100 injured, and it’s a reminder of how fragile life can be.
“February 14th is still a difficult day for me, even though I’ve worked in radio for over 40 years. Every year on this date, I find myself thinking about the victims and their families and hoping that they are not forgotten. It’s a day of reflection, a time to remember those who were taken from us far too soon, and a reminder that life can change in an instant.
“For me, February 14th will always be associated with tragedy and loss, but it’s also a day of hope and resilience. The way the Bradford community came together to support each other in the aftermath of the fire is something I will never forget. It was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and a way forward.”
John Helm’s description of that fateful day still gives me chills even though it has been over 30 years since the Bradford City fire occurred. His comments are a poignant reminder of how fragile life can be and how quickly things can go wrong, but also how resilient people can be in the face of tragedy. It’s important to remember the victims of this disaster and their families on February 14th every year, and John Helm’s thoughts provide a fitting tribute to those affected by this terrible event.
