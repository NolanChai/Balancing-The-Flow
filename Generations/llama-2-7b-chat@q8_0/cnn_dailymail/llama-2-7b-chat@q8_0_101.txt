Margaret Preston, an 86-year-old painter and printmaker who has been a vocal advocate for the men's clemency, wrote an open letter to President Joko Widodo expressing her deep sadness and disappointment at the looming executions.
"I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like to be in your position, but I hope you understand the depth of feeling that people around the world are expressing," Ms Preston wrote in the letter, which was published in The Sydney Morning Herald on Friday.
"As an artist and a human being, I find it impossible to comprehend how any government could take the lives of two young men who were simply trying to make a better life for themselves and their families."
Ms Preston, who is known for her vibrant and expressive works that often explore themes of identity and culture, has been an outspoken supporter of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan since their arrests in 2005.
She has visited Indonesia on several occasions to advocate for their clemency, and has also worked with other artists and activists around the world to raise awareness about their case.
In her letter to President Widodo, Ms Preston acknowledged that she understood the laws of Indonesia and the harsh penalties for drug offences.
"But as a human being, I cannot help but feel that the death penalty is a barbaric and outdated punishment that only serves to perpetuate violence and suffering," she wrote.
"I urge you to consider the devastating impact that these executions will have on the families of Myuran and Andrew, and on the people who love them. I believe that there must be a better way."
Ms Preston's letter comes as the international community races against time to save Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from execution.
The two men are scheduled to be put to death by firing squad at 10am on Tuesday morning, local time, after years of appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected by Indonesian authorities.
Ms Preston's message is one of many that have been sent to President Widodo in recent days, as people around the world implore him to show mercy and spare the lives of the two men.
