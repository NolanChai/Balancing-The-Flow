 wave of clichés’ in education, which he claims are stifling creativity and critical thinking among students. He believes that these slogans, along with other motivational phrases often used in schools, can create a culture of compliance rather than fostering independent learning.


According to Hendrick, the use of such slogans is driven by a desire to boost attendance and achievement figures, but they do not address the underlying reasons for underperformance. He believes that instead of relying on these catchphrases, teachers should focus on creating an environment where pupils are encouraged to question their own beliefs and assumptions.
In an article for the Guardian, Hendrick argues: “The most important thing we can do is give children the freedom to think for themselves – to encourage them to question what they have been taught, and to find their own path in life.” He continues: “Instead of pumping pupils full of motivational clichés, we should be teaching them how to be critical thinkers. We should be encouraging them to question what is presented to them, rather than simply accepting it at face value.”
Hendrick’s views are supported by other educators who argue that the use of such slogans can create a culture of compliance rather than fostering independent learning. By encouraging pupils to think critically and creatively, teachers can help them develop the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
In conclusion, the use of cheesy slogans in education may not be as effective as it seems. Instead of relying on these catchphrases, teachers should focus on creating an environment where pupils are encouraged to think critically and creatively. By fostering independent learning, educators can help their students develop the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
