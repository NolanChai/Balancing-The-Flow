Chris Robshaw is braced for further scrutiny after he was caught on camera holidaying in Barbados with girlfriend Camilla Kerslake. The England captain has already talked to Andrew Strauss and Lawrence Dallaglio about the situation, which could potentially raise questions over his availability for the World Cup.
Robshaw, who is married but separated from his wife, was filmed on a beach in Barbados with Kerslake, who is a former Strictly Come Dancing contestant. The footage, which has been widely circulated on social media, shows Robshaw laughing and chatting with Kerslake as they enjoy the sun and sand.
Robshaw's holiday has raised eyebrows given that the World Cup starts in just over a fortnight, and there are concerns that his absence from training could impact England's chances of success. Robshaw has already spoken to Strauss, the ECB's director of cricket, and Dallaglio, a former England captain, about the situation.
A source close to Robshaw said: "Chris is aware that his holiday has caused a bit of a stir and he is braced for further scrutiny. He knows that he needs to be available for selection for the World Cup but he also wants to take some time off after a busy season with Harlequins."
Robshaw's relationship with Kerslake, who he has been dating since last year, has been well-documented and there have been suggestions that they could be set to announce their engagement in the coming weeks. However, Robshaw is understood to be taking things slowly and is not planning on proposing anytime soon.
The England captain's holiday has sparked a debate about the balance between personal and professional life for sports stars, particularly those in high-profile positions such as Robshaw's. While some have defended his right to take a break, others have criticised him for not being available for selection just before the World Cup.
Robshaw is expected to return to training next week, ahead of England's opening match against Ireland on May 14.
