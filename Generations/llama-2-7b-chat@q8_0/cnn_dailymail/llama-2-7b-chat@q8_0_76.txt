ovic's side came from behind twice to beat Bristol City 4-2 at Vicarage Road, their third successive win under the new ownership of investor Gino Pozzo.
Watford's first league victory since September lifted them into second place and put them in pole position for automatic promotion. They have scored more goals than any other side in the division during this spell - 13 in seven games - and their fans are dreaming of a top-flight return. "It's fantastic, it's a great feeling," said midfielder Will Hughes, who netted twice against Bristol City. "We knew we could do it, but to actually do it is amazing. We've got a good team and a good spirit in there."
Pozzo, who bought the club in 2014, has overseen a dramatic transformation at Vicarage Road, with Jokanovic replacing Quique Sanchez Flores in January. And Watford's impressive recent run of form is testament to their owner's determination to build a sustainable squad capable of challenging for promotion.
"We had a tough start to the season but we've got a good group of players and Gino Pozzo has given us the tools to succeed," said Watford captain Troy Deeney, who scored their other goal against Bristol City. "We've got some good young players coming through as well, so we're excited for next season."
Promotion would be a fitting reward for Pozzo's investment in the club and his belief in Jokanovic, who has endured a difficult time since taking charge at Vicarage Road. But Watford's owner insists he will not be getting carried away with their recent success - and is instead focused on ensuring they are well-prepared for life in the Premier League. "We know it won't be easy, but we have a good team and we are ready for the challenge," Pozzo said. "We have a lot of work to do before the end of the season, but we are confident that we can achieve our goal."
Watford face a tough run-in to the campaign, with games against fellow promotion hopefuls Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, as well as a clash against Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. But Jokanovic's men have shown their resilience and determination on numerous occasions this season - and their fans are confident they can seal promotion to the Premier League at the first time of asking.
