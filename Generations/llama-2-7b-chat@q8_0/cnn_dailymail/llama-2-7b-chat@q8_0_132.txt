It is seen as extremely rude in most human societies, but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear.
Gibbons - better known for their deafening songs than quiet conversations - are the first non-human primates to be observed using low-frequency vocalizations to communicate in a way that is meant to be overheard by only a select few.
Researchers at Kyoto University in Japan discovered the whispering behavior during an experiment involving 16 gibbons living in a large enclosure. They found that when the apes wanted to pass on information to each other without being overheard, they would use these low-frequency calls.
Lead author of the study, Dr. Yoko Ishida, said: "Gibbons are known for their loud vocalizations, but this is the first time we've seen them use whispering as a form of communication."
It's thought that the gibbons may be using these whispers to pass on information about food locations, or to coordinate activities with other group members. The researchers are now planning further studies to explore the significance of this new behavior in non-human primates.
