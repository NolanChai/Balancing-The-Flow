 has been accused of leading a lavish lifestyle and embezzling state funds while his people suffer in poverty.
King Goodwill Zwelithini, 62, has long been criticised for his extravagant spending habits and lack of concern for the plight of his subjects. His subjects have seen him living in palaces while they struggle to make ends meet, with some even dying from starvation.
Zwelithini's latest controversy erupted after he made a speech calling on South Africa's black population to attack foreign nationals who he claimed were stealing their jobs and resources. The call sparked widespread violence against foreigners which has resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people and the destruction of property worth millions of dollars.
While Zwelithini's comments have been widely condemned, his reputation as a corrupt and out-of-touch leader has been well established for years. He has faced numerous allegations of abusing state funds and resources to enrich himself and his friends. In 2011, an investigation found that he had misappropriated $30 million in state funds to build a lavish new palace.
Zwelithini's lavish lifestyle has also been criticised by South African politicians and civil society groups. In 2013, he was accused of owning several luxury cars, including a Ferrari and a Bentley, while his subjects struggled to afford basic necessities like food and shelter.
Despite the backlash against him, Zwelithini remains a powerful figure in South Africa's political landscape. He has been involved in various controversies throughout his reign, which began in 1967 when he was just 15 years old.
In conclusion, King Goodwill Zwelithini of South Africa is no stranger to scandal and controversy. His lavish lifestyle and embezzlement of state funds have been criticised for years, while his recent call for violence against foreigners has sparked outrage and condemnation from around the world. While he remains a powerful figure in South African politics, his reputation as a corrupt and out-of-touch leader is likely to continue to dog him for years to come.
