Manchester United are set to make a £30m bid for Memphis Depay after holding secret talks with the PSV Eindhoven winger, according to reports in the Netherlands. The 21-year-old has been a long-term target for the Red Devils, who are believed to have held meetings with Depay and his representatives over the past week. United are keen to secure the services of the Dutch international before the end of the transfer window, with manager Louis van Gaal reportedly convinced that Depay would be an excellent addition to his squad. The move would see Depay become the second Dutch player at Old Trafford, following in the footsteps of fellow countryman Robin van Persie, who joined the club in 2012.
PSV Eindhoven have already rejected two bids for Depay, with the most recent offer believed to be around £25m. However, with United willing to meet their valuation of £30m, it is thought that a deal could be close to being finalised. Depay has scored 11 goals in 24 appearances for PSV this season, and has also caught the attention of several other top European clubs, including Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
United are understood to be prioritising the signing of a winger, with Depay seen as an ideal option due to his pace, skill and versatility. The club are also thought to be interested in Inter Milan's Mario Balotelli, although it is unclear whether they will make a move for the Italy international.
Depay's agent, Marcel van de Veluwe, has been in contact with United representatives over the past few days, and it is believed that the player himself was present at the secret meeting on Wednesday. The talks are said to have centred around the terms of a potential transfer, including the length of the contract and Depay's salary.
United are hopeful that they can conclude a deal for Depay in the coming days, with the window set to close at the end of August. However, it is understood that PSV may wait until the last minute to accept any offer, as they look to get the best possible price for their star player.
