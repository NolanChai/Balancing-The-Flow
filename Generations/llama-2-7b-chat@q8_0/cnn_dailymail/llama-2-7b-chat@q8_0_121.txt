(CNN)As thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests. The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa, which have left several people dead and injured.
The #NoToXenophobia campaign went viral on social media, with many users sharing their experiences of discrimination and calling for an end to violence against foreigners.
"I've been here for 10 years, I've worked hard, I've paid taxes, but I still get treated like a criminal," said one user on Twitter. "It's time for change."
Another user shared a photo of a sign that read: "United against xenophobia and racism. We are all South Africans."
The protests come as the government has faced criticism for not doing enough to address the issue. The African Union has also condemned the violence, calling it a "serious threat" to regional peace and security.
South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised to take action against those responsible for the attacks and to work towards creating a more inclusive society.
The #NoToXenophobia campaign is just one of many initiatives that have emerged in response to the violence, with many organizations and individuals calling for peaceful protests and community events to promote tolerance and understanding.
As the protests continue, there are calls for sustained action to address the underlying issues that have led to the violence, including poverty, inequality and discrimination.
The #NoToXenophobia campaign is a reminder that South Africa is a country of many cultures and backgrounds, and that it is time to stand together against hate and discrimination.
