uck to help them compete with the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool in the top four next season, so they have decided to raid their neighbours to get the players they need.
Henderson has been impressive for Liverpool this term and has already attracted interest from other clubs, while Wilshere has shown glimpses of his quality for Arsenal before a series of injuries set him back. Both players are young and hungry to prove themselves at the top level – and City see them as perfect additions to their squad.
City boss Manuel Pellegrini is keen to strengthen his midfield options after a disappointing campaign, and he sees Henderson and Wilshere as ideal candidates to provide energy and drive in the middle of the park. He believes they could form a potent partnership with the likes of David Silva and Samir Nasri, providing balance and width to City’s play.
It is thought that City will have to pay around £20m for Henderson, while Wilshere may come cheaper at around £15m due to his injury problems. But Pellegrini is willing to splash the cash to get the players he wants, and he believes these signings could be crucial in City’s quest to win trophies next season.
