ars the end of a 30-day waiting period during which time the DoJ has been reviewing the deal.
According to sources familiar with the matter, the companies will make their cases for why the merger should be approved, and will address concerns over competition in the US pay-TV market. The meeting is expected to take place next week, with a decision on the merger likely to come later this year.
The proposed deal, which was announced in February, would see Comcast acquire Time Warner Cable in a move that would create a behemoth in the US pay-TV market. The combined company would have more than 30 million subscribers, significantly increasing its reach and scale compared to its competitors.
However, the deal has raised concerns among consumer groups and some lawmakers who fear it could lead to higher prices and reduced competition in the market. Time Warner Cable has also faced opposition from Charter Communications, which made a rival bid for the company earlier this year.
The DoJ has the power to block the deal if it determines that it would harm competition in the US pay-TV market. The agency has been reviewing the deal under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Act of 1976, which requires companies to disclose their merger plans and wait for a period of time before completing the deal.
If the deal is approved, it would be one of the largest media deals in recent years, and would significantly reshape the US pay-TV market. Comcast already owns NBCUniversal, which has significant assets in the industry, including channels such as Bravo, Telemundo and Syfy.
Time Warner Cable, meanwhile, operates a number of channels, including CNN, TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network. The combined company would have a significant presence in both the traditional pay-TV market and the growing over-the-top streaming space.
