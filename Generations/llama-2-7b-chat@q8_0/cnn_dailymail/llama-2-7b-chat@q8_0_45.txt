 at the Harbor Freight Tools store in Michigan, US. He was charged with one count of felony assault and battery after the incident occurred on November 25 last year.
According to MLive, Lind was spotted by a security camera placing his genitalia near Maahs' coffee cup before he walked away. Maahs later discovered that her drink had been contaminated when she took a sip. She immediately spat it out and contacted her supervisor.
Lind claimed during testimony in court that he had a crush on Maahs but denied intentionaly contaminating her drink. He was found guilty after a two-day trial and faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced next month.
Maahs tearfully recounted the incident in court, saying: "I just wanted to go about my day and do my job. I didn't want to be around him anymore."
