Clint Hill reckons the pressure is on QPR's relegation rivals and insists Rangers can survive if they keep their cool.
Chris Ramsey's side are still in the relegation zone but the defender believes other teams in the bottom three should be feeling the heat more than them.
Hill told the London Evening Standard: "The pressure is on the teams around us, to be honest. We're not in a great position but we've got some big games coming up and if we can get some points on the board, we can start to climb the table.
"We've just got to keep our cool, stay focused and make sure we're ready for every game. If we do that, we'll give ourselves a chance of staying up."
