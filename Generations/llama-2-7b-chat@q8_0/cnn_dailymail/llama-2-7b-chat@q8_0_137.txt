Cantona, who won four league titles with the Red Devils during his playing career in the 1990s, hailed Van Gaal’s decision to field a youthful side against Manchester City and said it proved he was not afraid of taking risks at Old Trafford.
Speaking on MUTV, Cantona said: “I think Louis van Gaal has shown that he is the right man for this club. He has brought a new philosophy, a new way of playing, and I think it’s fantastic to see young players like Jesse Lingard and Andreas Pereira getting a chance to shine.
“He has also shown that he is not afraid of taking risks – fielding a youthful side against City in the derby was a bold move, but it paid off. I think it’s great to see United back on top again and I believe we can go all the way next season.”
Cantona, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in Manchester United history, also praised the club’s supporters for their loyalty and dedication during a difficult period for the team.
He added: “I have always said that the fans are the heartbeat of this club and they have been fantastic this season. They have stuck by us through thick and thin and it’s great to see them reaping the rewards now.
“I think we are on the right track again at United and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.”
