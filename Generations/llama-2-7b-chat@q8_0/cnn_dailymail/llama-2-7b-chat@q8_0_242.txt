igrini has faced mounting criticism after a series of disappointing results, including Saturday’s 3-0 defeat at Arsenal. But Pearce, who played under Pellegrini at Manchester City, insists the Chilean is the right man to turn things around.
“I think he deserves more time,” Pearce said on Sky Sports. “He’s a great manager and has done some fantastic work at Manchester City. He’s brought a lot of success to the club and I think he can still turn it around.”
Pearce added: “It’s not an easy period for him, there’s no doubt about that. But he’s been in these situations before and he’ll know how to handle it. He’ll work tirelessly behind the scenes to get things right and I’m sure he’ll get Manchester City back on track.”
Pellegrini has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with City slumping to four defeats in their last six Premier League games. However, Pearce believes that the club’s recent struggles are not a reflection of Pellegrini’s management style.
“I think he’s done a great job at Manchester City,” Pearce said. “He’s brought a lot of success to the club and I don’t think these recent results detract from that. Every manager goes through tough periods and this is just one of them.”
