In the 10-minute vlog titled ‘Body Shaming, Bullying & Being a Positive Role Model’, Ho, 32, speaks directly to her millions of followers and addresses the online criticism that has been plaguing her for years.
Ho is known for her high-energy workouts, motivational messages and quirky personality, which have made her one of the most popular fitness influencers on social media with over 5 million subscribers to her channel, Blogilates.
But despite her success and positive influence, Ho says she has faced relentless trolling from viewers who feel entitled to body-shame and bully her online.
The video opens with a montage of negative comments left by viewers on Ho’s videos, with some of the most vile remarks highlighted on screen.
‘I can’t believe you’re still making videos after having kids – you’re so fat now!’ one viewer writes.
Another adds: ‘You used to be cute but now you look like a pudgy old lady. Quit pretending to be fit and just eat a sandwich already!’
Ho, who is proud of her body and has always been open about her fitness journey, speaks directly to the camera and addresses the hateful comments head-on.
She admits that for years she tried to silence her critics by deleting negative comments from her videos or blocking trolls on social media, but after a recent bout of online bullying, she realized it was time to take a stand.
Ho explains that body shaming and bullying are not just harmful to individuals but also contribute to a culture of negativity and discrimination in society at large.
She argues that by speaking out and sharing her story, she hopes to inspire others to do the same and create a more supportive and inclusive online community.
Ho concludes the video with a powerful message: ‘We are all human beings, deserving of respect and kindness regardless of our weight, shape or size. Let’s lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. Thank you for watching!’
Since its release, Ho’s video has gone viral, sparking a wave of support and solidarity from fans around the world who are eager to promote body positivity and end online bullying.
