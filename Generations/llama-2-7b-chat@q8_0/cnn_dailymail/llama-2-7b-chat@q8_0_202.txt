The mother, 30-year-old Katie Rose Palmer, and father, 39-year-old Christopher Mark Palmer, were pronounced dead at the scene along with their baby boy, who has been identified as Rowan Michael Palmer. Emergency services were called to the scene after a witness reported seeing the concrete barrier fall onto the truck, but despite efforts to save the family, they were all declared dead at the scene.
The cause of the accident is still under investigation by authorities, but it is believed that the concrete barrier failed and fell onto the truck as it was driving beneath an overpass. The overpass in question has been closed while investigators work to determine the cause of the tragedy.
This tragic incident has left family and friends devastated and struggling to come to terms with the loss of three precious lives. The community is rallying around the Palmer family during this difficult time, offering support and condolences to those affected by this senseless act of fate.
