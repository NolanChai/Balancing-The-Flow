Adam G. Klein, 26, who was expelled last year after a university investigation, filed the lawsuit Wednesday against George Mason and its president, √Ångel Cabrera. The lawsuit claims that the university violated Klein's due process rights by failing to provide him with adequate notice of the allegations against him, not conducting a fair investigation, and relying on unreliable evidence.
"The alleged sexual assault was nothing more than a sadomasochistic role-playing exercise between two consenting adults," Klein's lawsuit states. "Defendants failed to acknowledge that Plaintiff had engaged in consensual conduct with his girlfriend and instead misconstrued it as sexual assault."
Klein's attorney, William H. Mellor III, said in a statement that the university's actions were "a flagrant violation of Mr. Klein's rights to due process and a fair trial."
George Mason University spokesman Peter Viemeister declined to comment on the lawsuit Thursday, citing the university's policy not to comment on active litigation.
Klein was expelled last year after a university investigation found that he had engaged in sexual assault against his girlfriend at an off-campus residence. The incident occurred in 2016, according to the lawsuit, but Klein was not disciplined until after a national conversation about sexual misconduct on college campuses gained momentum in 2018.
Klein's lawsuit seeks damages for emotional distress and loss of reputation, as well as an order barring George Mason from disclosing the allegations against him to future employers or educational institutions.
The suit comes as colleges and universities face increased scrutiny over their handling of sexual misconduct cases. Last year, George Mason University was criticized for its response to a sexual assault investigation involving members of the school's men's basketball team.
