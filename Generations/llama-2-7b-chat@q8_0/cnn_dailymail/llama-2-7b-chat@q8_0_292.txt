Stoll was taken into custody after a police officer spotted him driving erratically and smelling of alcohol near the Las Vegas strip at around 1:45 AM local time, according to TMZ. A search of his vehicle revealed several prescription drugs, including oxycodone and Xanax, which Stoll did not have a valid prescription for.
Stoll was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on charges of drug possession and driving under the influence. His bail was set at $10,000, but he was able to post it and was released from custody later in the day.
A spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Stoll's arrest to E! News, saying, "He was arrested on charges of driving under the influence and drug possession."
Stoll has been playing for the Kings since 2005 and has appeared in over 600 games for the team. He has also won two Stanley Cups with the franchise.
It is not clear how this incident will affect Stoll's hockey career, but it could potentially lead to disciplinary action from the league or his team.
