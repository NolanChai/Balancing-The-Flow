arse comments during an interview with fellow TV presenter and comedian Rufus Hound on Channel 4's Celebrity Juice.
Clarkson was sacked from the BBC in March after he punched a producer on the set of the popular motoring show. He had been suspended from his job earlier that month following allegations of a 'fracas' with another producer, and was subsequently fired for gross misconduct. However, during his appearance on Celebrity Juice, Clarkson seemed to revel in the freedom he now has to speak his mind without censorship.
"I can swear now, Rufus," he said, grinning maniacally. "I can say what I bloody well like! No one's going to tell me off for it!" Clarkson went on to explain that being sacked from the BBC had been a blessing in disguise because it had allowed him to be more honest and open about his feelings, without fear of retribution. He also joked that he was now free to make even more 'silly' comments than before, which had become a hallmark of his television career.
While Hound appeared taken aback by Clarkson's remarks, the audience laughed and clapped at his brazen commentary. "It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders," Clarkson continued. "I can finally speak my mind without fear of being hauled in front of the Beeb's disciplinary committee!"
Clarkson's comments have sparked a mixed reaction on social media, with some viewers praising his honesty and others criticizing his language as inappropriate. However, it remains to be seen whether Clarkson's newfound freedom of speech will impact his future broadcasting career.
