 Odense on Sunday, when Agger also received a red card.
Agger has now accepted the ban and apologised for his actions. "I made a mistake and I'm really sorry for that," he told Danish media. "It was never my intention to hurt Jorgensen."
The 28-year-old will miss Brondby's upcoming matches against Aarhus and FC Kobenhavn, but his teammate Jorgensen has refused to accept an apology. "He should have been sent off earlier in the game," Jorgensen told Danish media. "I don't think he's sorry at all."
The incident has sparked a heated debate in Denmark, with many fans and pundits calling for tougher punishment for violent conduct. The Danish Football Association (DBU) is set to review its disciplinary rules in the wake of the incident.
