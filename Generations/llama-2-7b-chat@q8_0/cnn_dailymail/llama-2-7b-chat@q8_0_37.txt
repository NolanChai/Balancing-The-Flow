Roberto Carlos has revealed his desire to one day become manager of Brazil, with the former Real Madrid defender claiming he finds coaching “very easy” after the pressures he faced as a player.
The 42-year-old, who played for Brazil between 1995 and 2006, has been working as an ambassador for Fifa’s Forward Programme aimed at developing football in countries around the world.
And while he is enjoying his current role, Roberto Carlos says he has long harboured a desire to become a manager himself.
“I would love to be the coach of Brazil one day,” he told Marca. “It’s my dream. I think it would be incredible to lead the Selecao and help develop young players for the national team.
“Coaching is very easy compared to playing. As a player, you have to deal with many pressures – from the media, from the fans, from your team-mates. But as a coach, you only have to worry about the players.
“I’ve seen it with my own eyes how much stress and pressure players are under today. I think coaching is a much simpler job.”
Roberto Carlos played for Brazil at four World Cups and won two Champions League titles during his time at Real Madrid, where he made over 200 appearances. He also played for Juventus and Fenerbahce before retiring in 2015.
