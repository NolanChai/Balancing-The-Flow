30-year-old Australian doctor, identified as Dr Tareq...
An Australian doctor is the face of the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of its own health service in Syria.
The propaganda video shows a 30-year-old Australian doctor, identified as Dr Tareq, standing in front of a white flag with the IS logo in the background, calling on Muslims to support the new service.
"We have established a medical service that will provide care for our people and for those who are suffering," Dr Tareq says in the video.
"Our goal is to bring hope and relief to those who are in need."
The Australian government has confirmed the identity of the doctor, who is believed to be from Melbourne, as Dr Tareq Jneid.
According to ABC News, Dr Jneid is a qualified medical professional with a degree in medicine from the University of Melbourne. He reportedly moved to Syria several years ago and joined IS.
The video also shows footage of people injured in battles being treated at an IS-run hospital.
"Our medical service is here to help those who are suffering," Dr Tareq says. "We will continue to provide care until the end of time."
The Australian government has condemned the video and vowed to take action against any Australian nationals fighting with terrorist organisations overseas.
"ISIL's use of an Australian doctor in their propaganda is a disturbing reminder of the threat posed by this terrorist group," said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a statement. "Australia will not stand by and allow our citizens to be used as tools for their propaganda."
The government has also confirmed that it will work with international partners to ensure that any Australians who have joined IS are brought back home and held accountable for their actions.
