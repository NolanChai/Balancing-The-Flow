60 miles away.
The experiment has been running for a few days now and many users have succumbed to the temptation of pressing the button, but some have managed to resist the urge. The challenge was created by user u/SirCmpwnsAlot who wrote: "I've set up a clickable button 60 miles away from my location. I'm not telling anyone not to press it, but please try your best not to."
The button is located in a remote area and can only be accessed through a long and difficult journey. Users have been sharing their experiences on the thread, with some admitting they gave in to the temptation after just a few minutes of resistance, while others have managed to hold out for hours or even days.
One user, u/JaromirM, wrote: "I lasted 5 minutes before I gave in. It was so hard not to click it! But I'm proud of myself for trying." Another user, u/SnackyMcSnackFace, shared their struggles: "Day 3 and I'm still strong. It's like an addiction now. I can't stop thinking about that button."
The thread has been popular among Reddit users, with many sharing their own experiences and tips for resisting the temptation of the button. Some have suggested using music or podcasts to distract themselves, while others have recommended finding a buddy to hold them accountable.
While it may seem like a simple task not to press a button, the experiment highlights just how difficult it can be to resist temptation, especially when it comes to something as inconsequential as a click on a remote computer screen.
