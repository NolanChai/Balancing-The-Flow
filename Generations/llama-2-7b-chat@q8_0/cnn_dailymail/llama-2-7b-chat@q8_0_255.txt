ed in plain sight!
Each photograph was taken by photographer and retoucher Jirka Väätäinen, who has been creating these incredible scenes for over 20 years. Using himself as a model, he hides in plain sight among everyday objects and environments to create surreal images that challenge the viewer's perception.
Väätäinen uses his skills in digital retouching to blend himself into the scene, making it almost impossible to spot him unless you know exactly where to look. His attention to detail is remarkable, as he carefully recreates the lighting and colors of each setting to make sure that he looks like part of the background.
Take a closer look at these photos and see how long it takes you to spot Jirka Väätäinen in each scene. You might be surprised by how easy it is to miss him!
