28-year-old from Brazil who has spent years perfecting his technique and building up his strength in order to perform such death-defying stunts.
But despite his impressive record of successes, Al almost paid with his life yesterday when he narrowly avoided being crushed by the speeding vehicle during a live television broadcast.
In front of a large audience at the Guarapari Stadium in the state of Espirito Santo, Al stood on a ramp and hurdled himself over the roaring sports car, which was driven by experienced stunt driver, Carlos Henrique.
Almost immediately after takeoff, he realized that the vehicle was moving faster than expected, and he struggled to make the jump in time. But with incredible agility, he managed to clear the car by just a few inches, landing safely on the other side.
'I could see the fear in my eyes', Al revealed after the incident, 'but I knew I had to push myself beyond my limits if I wanted to be named World’s Most Talented. It was either that or face the embarrassment of failure.'
Al’s stunt has left many people in awe and amazement, with some hailing him as a genius for his bravery and skill, while others are more cautious about his methods. However, Al is undeterred by the criticism, insisting that he will continue to push himself to greater heights (literally) in pursuit of his dream.
