 falls on a Sunday, and Monday becomes a normal working day instead of a day off.
Since Anzac Day falls on a Sunday this year, many people were anticipating an extended weekend. However, thanks to the agreement, which was negotiated between state and territory governments in 1993, most employees will be required to go to work on Monday.
The National Day of Commemoration Act of 1993, which established Anzac Day as a national public holiday, doesn't specify that it must be observed on a Monday when the day falls on a Sunday, according to Attorney-General Michaelia Cash. This means state and territory governments are free to decide how they will observe the occasion, she explained.
In addition, under section 8 of the Fair Work Act, employers are permitted to work their employees on a public holiday if there is an applicable agreement or award that specifies otherwise. According to Fair Work, many people will have Monday off due to an agreement or award, but some workers may be needed at work depending on what their employer has agreed with them.
While the majority of Australians will be disappointed to learn they won't have a day off this Anzac Day weekend, there are still ways to commemorate the occasion. For instance, people can attend an Anzac Day service or event in their neighborhood, participate in online activities and discussions, or engage with veterans and their families to pay respects and show appreciation for their sacrifice and efforts.
