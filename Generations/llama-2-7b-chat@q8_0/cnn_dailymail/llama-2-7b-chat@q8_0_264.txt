Mike and Matt Mills, from New York, were spending the summer at their grandparents' house in Florida when they met Robert through a local veterans organization. The boys were immediately fascinated by Robert's stories of serving on a minesweeper during World War II.
"We would ask him all these questions and he would tell us about his experiences," said Mike, 10. "He was like our new best friend."
Robert, who served in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946, was delighted to share his memories with the boys. He had never talked about his time in the war before and found it therapeutic to open up to the young twins.
"They were so interested and attentive," Robert said. "It was like talking to old friends."
The brothers spent hours listening to Robert's stories, which ranged from the mundane to the extraordinary. They heard about the endless hours spent on watch, the camaraderie among the sailors, and the horror of witnessing the aftermath of a U-boat attack.
"We learned so much from him," said Matt, 10. "We never knew anything about World War II until we met Robert."
The brothers also helped Robert by researching his ship's history and creating a video tribute to his service. They even surprised him with a framed photo of his ship on his 89th birthday.
"It was incredible," said Robert. "I never expected these two young boys to be so interested in my story."
The friendship between the Mills brothers and Robert Harding is a testament to the power of shared experiences and the importance of preserving history for future generations. As Robert said, "It's good that they're learning about this now. It's important that they understand what happened during World War II."
The twins' passion for naval history has brought them closer to their grandparents' generation and helped them appreciate the sacrifices made by veterans like Robert. As they continue to learn more about the war, they are grateful for the opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from someone who lived through it.
"We're so lucky to have met him," said Mike. "He's given us a piece of history that we'll never forget."
