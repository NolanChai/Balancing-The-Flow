ite, known as 'ghotul', huddle together and pass around a large metal rod that they spin over the flames. The practice is believed to bring prosperity and happiness to those involved but has been criticized by health professionals who say it could cause serious burns.
The ritual, which takes place in the state of Odisha, is said to have originated as a way for villagers to ward off evil spirits during the monsoon season. Despite its potential dangers, many participants claim that taking part brings them good fortune and a sense of community. However, doctors have warned that the practice can lead to severe burns and even death, and are urging people to stop participating in the ritual.
In these pictures, villagers are seen huddled together as they spin the metal rod over the flames, their bodies glowing red from the heat. Some of the participants appear to be in a trance-like state as they take part in the bizarre ritual, which is believed to have been practiced for centuries.
While some may view the ritual as a harmless tradition, health professionals say it poses serious risks to those involved, including burns, infections and even death. The practice has also been criticized by human rights groups who argue that it is a form of exploitation and abuse.
According to local legend, the ritual was started by a goddess who appeared to a village elder in a dream and instructed him to perform the dance to ward off evil spirits during the monsoon season. The ritual is believed to bring good luck and prosperity to those involved and has been passed down through generations of villagers.
However, critics argue that the practice is outdated and dangerous, and say it is time for it to be abandoned in favor of more modern forms of spirituality. In recent years, there have been several instances of participants suffering serious injuries during the ritual, including burns and broken bones.
