Real Madrid's Champions League victory over city rivals Atletico on Wednesday night marked the eighth match Gareth Bale has not started this season... and Real have won every single one.
The Welshman, who joined Los Blancos in 2013 for a then-world record Â£86 million fee, has struggled with injuries and form this term, making just six appearances in all competitions.
But despite his lack of playing time, Bale remains an influential figure off the bench, as he showed against Atletico by setting up two goals for Karim Benzema in the 3-0 win.
Indeed, Real have won every single match this season in which Bale has come off the bench - a testament to his quality and impact on the team, even when he's not starting.
Bale's impact from the bench is all the more impressive given the competition for places in Madrid's attack, with the likes of Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Jovic all vying for starts.
Despite this, Bale has remained a vital part of Zinedine Zidane's plans, offering a different dynamic to the team when he comes on. And his ability to make an impact from the bench is likely to be crucial in big games like the Champions League, where Madrid will need all the firepower they can get.
