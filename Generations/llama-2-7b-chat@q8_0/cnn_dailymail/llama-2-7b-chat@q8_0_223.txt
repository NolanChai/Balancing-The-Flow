iled us once again with their presence at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's May 19 nuptials.
These "commoners" who have gained the status of celebrities by association with the British monarchy have become as integral to royal events as the Queen herself. They are known affectionately as "the crowds." And they are legion.
Their origins can be traced back to 1986 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer. The public's fascination with their fairy tale romance was so great that it necessitated the creation of a designated area for the "general public" - or, as they came to be known, "the crowds."
Since then, "the crowds" have been an unspoken but invaluable part of every royal event. They are the faces in the background of official photos, the ones who wave and cheer from the stands, and the ones who braved the rain and long lines to catch a glimpse of the bride or groom.
Their presence has become so integral that it is now expected at every royal occasion. And they are just as diverse as their interest in the Royals itself. There are the die-hard fans, clad in Union Jacks and tartan, who camp out for days before an event to secure a prime viewing spot. Then there are the tourists, drawn by the magic of the Royal Family and eager to experience it firsthand. And finally, there are the locals - those who live and breathe the history and tradition that surrounds the Royals, but are just as enthusiastic about their presence in their community.
Despite their diverse backgrounds, they all share one thing in common: a deep respect and admiration for the Royals and their role in British society. They see them not just as figures of wealth and privilege, but as symbols of continuity and tradition in an ever-changing world.
In a time when the Royal Family is under increasing scrutiny from both domestic and international pressures, "the crowds" provide a powerful reminder of the enduring support for their institution. They are the silent majority, whose presence at every event serves as a testament to the continuity of the monarchy's role in British society.
So while the cameras focus on the glamour and pomp of royal events, it is "the crowds" who truly bring them to life - with their joyful cheers, their endless curiosity, and their unwavering devotion to the Royals they hold dear.
