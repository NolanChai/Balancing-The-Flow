orecognise their faces as they take part in the terror group's training session. The video has sparked fears that Islamic State (IS) is attempting to expand its reach by recruiting more female fighters to join its ranks.
In a new video released on social media, a group of women can be seen taking part in a militia training session in Syria. All of the women are fully veiled, making it difficult to recognise their faces as they fire machine guns and practice drills in the desert. The video has sparked fears that Islamic State (IS) is attempting to expand its reach by recruiting more female fighters to join its ranks.
The video shows a group of at least 12 women, all wearing black abayas and face veils, as they move through the desert landscape firing their weapons and shouting Islamic slogans. Some of the women can be seen lying on the ground, pretending to be injured or killed, while others provide medical treatment.
The training session appears to be taking place in a remote location in Syria's Idlib province, which has been under the control of various jihadi groups in recent years. The video is not clear where it was filmed, but it appears to have been shot in a desert landscape with sand dunes and rocky outcrops.
The appearance of this new female militia comes at a time when IS is facing increasing pressure on its territorial holdings in Syria and Iraq. The group has long relied on its ability to recruit new fighters, including women and children, to maintain its ranks and expand its territory.
Experts have warned that the rise of female jihadis poses a new challenge for governments and security agencies, who must find ways to counter their influence and prevent them from carrying out attacks on the West.
The video has sparked concern among experts who are studying the growing trend of women joining terror groups in Syria. According to one analyst, 'It is clear that IS is trying to expand its reach by recruiting more women fighters. This is a new challenge for governments and security agencies who must find ways to counter their influence'
The United States has been leading the effort against IS in Syria and Iraq through airstrikes and training local forces. However, experts have warned that the group still poses a significant threat, particularly if it can recruit more women fighters to its cause.
