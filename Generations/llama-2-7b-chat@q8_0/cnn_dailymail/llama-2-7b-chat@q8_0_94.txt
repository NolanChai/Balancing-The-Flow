uesday's sentence is the latest legal action taken against those involved in the attack on the Church of St. George, which left three people dead and several others injured.
In addition to the life sentences, 14 other defendants were given prison terms ranging from five to 15 years, the reports said. The verdicts were handed down after a trial that lasted more than two years.
The attack on St. George's Church was one of several violent incidents against Christians in Egypt during and after the 2013 military coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsy and installed then-President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi. The country's Christian minority has faced increasing discrimination and violence, including a bombing of a Cairo church in December 2016 that killed 25 worshipers.
