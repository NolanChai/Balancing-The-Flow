 safe now taking bold positions that they never would have taken before. And I see it in the voters themselves, who are no longer satisfied with the status quo.
What is this revolution, and why has it come about? In my view, this revolution is driven by a single factor: our growing awareness of the interconnectedness of all things. It used to be that people thought of themselves as separate individuals living in a world that was not connected to them. But now we know that everything from the air we breathe to the food we eat to the money we make is connected to everything else, and that our actions have consequences for everyone around us. As a result, we are no longer content to act as if the world outside of us doesn't matter, or as if what happens to other people has nothing to do with us.
The revolution that I see unfolding before my eyes is not just about politics or economics. It is about a fundamental shift in how we think of ourselves and our place in the world. We are learning that every choice we make has consequences for someone else, and that every decision we make can be a step towards creating a better world for all of us. And we are no longer willing to settle for anything less than that."
