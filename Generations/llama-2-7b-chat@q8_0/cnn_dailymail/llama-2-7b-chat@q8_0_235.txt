420 Cannabis has been booming in Colorado since recreational pot was legalized last year. Impey runs one of several dispensaries in Denver dedicated to selling marijuana to people suffering from ailments like cancer, multiple sclerosis and PTSD.
The state of Colorado has legalized the use of recreational and medicinal cannabis, as well as established a system for regulating and taxing the drug. Since recreational pot was legalized last year, dispensaries such as 420 Cannabis have seen a significant increase in business, with many customers coming from out of state to take advantage of the state's lax laws.
While some may view Impey as breaking the law by selling marijuana without a prescription, he insists that he is simply providing much-needed relief to those suffering from chronic pain and other ailments. He says many of his customers have come to him after trying every medication possible but still experiencing severe pain, only to find relief with medical marijuana.
One customer, a 62-year-old woman named Sarah, visited 420 Cannabis after suffering from back pain for years. She says that she was amazed at how quickly the marijuana helped her manage her pain and improve her quality of life. "I can walk again without feeling like I'm going to collapse," she said.
Another customer, a 35-year-old man named Tom, uses medical marijuana to treat his PTSD after serving in Afghanistan. He says it has been instrumental in helping him manage his symptoms and improve his overall well-being. "I feel like I have my life back," he said.
Despite the legal and ethical debates surrounding medicinal marijuana, Impey remains steadfast in his belief that providing relief to those suffering is more important than following outdated laws. He believes it's time for society to reconsider its stance on cannabis and embrace a more compassionate approach to drug policy.
"We need to start looking at the science and understand the benefits of this plant, rather than continuing to perpetuate these old ideas that are causing harm," he said. "It's time for a change."
