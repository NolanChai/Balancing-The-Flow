The secret drawings and letters belonging to the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, have been discovered in an untouched box for over 70 years, revealing Captain Robert Lewis's immense guilt following the mission.
Lewis, who was just 25 at the time, co-piloted the plane alongside Colonel Paul Tibbets and dropped the bomb on August 6, 1945, killing an estimated 80,000 people instantly.
After the mission, Lewis wrote a letter to his mother, confessing his guilt and expressing his regret for the lives lost. In the letter, he described how he had trouble sleeping at night and couldn't shake off the feeling of responsibility for the devastating event.
In addition to the letter, Lewis also drew sketches of the Enola Gay and its crew, as well as a detailed diagram of the bomb itself. The drawings show the immense pride Lewis took in his role as co-pilot, but also the weight of his responsibilities.
The letters and drawings were discovered by historians who were researching Tibbets's personal archives. They had been stored away for decades, untouched and forgotten, until they were recently uncovered in a box marked 'Private.'
The discovery has shed new light on the experiences of those involved in the mission and the aftermath of the bombing, which remains one of the most controversial events in modern history.
