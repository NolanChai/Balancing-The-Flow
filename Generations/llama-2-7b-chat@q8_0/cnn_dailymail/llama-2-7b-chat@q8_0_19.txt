Cambiasso, 38, has won numerous titles throughout his decorated career, including two La Liga crowns with Real Madrid and an Inter Milan Serie A crown. However, he believes winning promotion to the top flight with Leicester City this season would be a particularly special achievement.
"It's a great challenge," Cambiasso told ESPN FC. "I think it's one of the highlights of my career, to be honest. I know what it means to win big trophies, but this is something different. To help a team like Leicester City get promoted back to the Premier League after they were relegated last season would be incredible."
Cambiasso joined Leicester City on loan from Inter Milan in January and has made 10 appearances for the club since his arrival, scoring once. He will be eligible to play in Saturday's crucial relegation battle against Hull City at King Power Stadium.
The Argentine midfielder acknowledged that the task at hand is daunting but believes the Foxes have what it takes to secure survival in the top flight.
"It's not easy, of course," Cambiasso said. "But we have a good team with good players, and we have shown that we can win games against tough opponents. We just need to keep working hard, stay focused and take it one game at a time."
Leicester City sit 14th in the Championship table, six points above the relegation zone with five matches remaining in the season.
