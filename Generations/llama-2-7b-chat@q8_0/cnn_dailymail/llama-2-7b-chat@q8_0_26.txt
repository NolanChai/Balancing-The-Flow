Ronald Koeman has urged his Southampton players to show maturity and respect following the uncertainty surrounding Victor Wanyama's future. The midfielder, who has been plagued by injuries in recent times, is set to miss Saturday's clash with Liverpool due to a hamstring problem. With his contract set to expire in the summer, there are concerns over whether the 26-year-old will remain at St Mary's beyond that point.
"It's not easy for him, it's not easy for us," Koeman said of Wanyama's situation. "But we need to show maturity and respect for the player and for the club. We need to focus on the football and try to win games."
Koeman has called for his players to put aside any distractions and focus on their upcoming match with Liverpool, which could see them leapfrog their opponents in the Premier League table. Southampton are currently seventh, while Liverpool are sixth.
"It's a big game for us," Koeman added. "Liverpool is a top team, but we have to show our quality and try to win the game. We need to be ready for the challenge."
Wanyama has made just 13 appearances for Southampton this season due to a series of injuries, including a knee problem that kept him sidelined for several months. With his future at the club uncertain, Koeman has admitted that it is difficult to predict whether the Kenya international will remain at St Mary's beyond the end of the season.
"We need to see what happens in the next few weeks," Koeman said. "It's difficult to say now if he will stay or go. We need to focus on the football and try to win games."
