We are urging anyone with information about who might be responsible for this to come forward."
The village of Lavenham is known for its picturesque streets and historic buildings, and is popular with tourists throughout the year. The fly-tipping has caused concern among residents and visitors alike, with many calling for action to be taken to clean up the area.
