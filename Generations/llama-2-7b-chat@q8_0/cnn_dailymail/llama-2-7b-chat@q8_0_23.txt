 side put in a tenacious performance against Racing 92, the current French Top 14 leaders and reigning European champions, and more than matched their illustrious opponents in both attack and defence.
Wasps had lost their opening pool match against Toulouse last weekend and faced a daunting task coming up against the team they narrowly beat in the 2017 Champions Cup final. But Young’s side were not deterred, and they set out to prove that they are more than just a one-trick pony capable of peaking on big occasions.
The match was an absolute cracker, with Wasps holding Racing at bay in the first half thanks to some impressive defensive work before mounting a fierce attacking response in the second period. The hosts took the lead through a penalty from Joe Simpson and then had two tries disallowed for technical infringements, one of which was a clear forward pass that should have been spotted by the TMO.
Despite their misfortune with the officials, Wasps continued to apply pressure on Racing’s line and eventually found themselves rewarded when Joe Launchbury pounced on a loose ball to score in the corner. The try was awarded after consultation between the TMO and the referee, despite Racing protesting that the ball had not been grounded.
Racing did manage to hit back with a try of their own through Virimi Vakatawa, but Wasps were unfazed and continued to push for the win. They went close on several occasions but were repeatedly thwarted by some desperate Racing defending and some uncharacteristic mistakes of their own.
In the end, it was Racing who claimed the victory thanks to a late try from Maxime Médard, who sprinted clear of the Wasps defence to score in the corner. The win sees Racing move top of Pool 3 ahead of next weekend’s clash with Toulouse, while Wasps must pick themselves up for their match against Bath.
It was a tough defeat for Wasps, but they can take plenty of positives from this performance. They showed that they are more than capable of competing with the very best teams in Europe and that they have the resilience and character to keep fighting until the end. Young’s men may not have won on the day, but they certainly proved their worth as a top-class European side.
