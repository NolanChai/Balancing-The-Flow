into how she ended up in the water with her three children. She remains under investigation for child neglect and other offences.
The 36-year-old mother of three was driving a car with her children inside when it crashed into a lake near Melbourne last weekend. The incident occurred around 9pm on Sunday night, when police were called to the scene after receiving reports of a car in the water. When officers arrived, they found Akon Guode and her three children – aged two, four, and six – floating in the water. They were all rushed to hospital for treatment, where they are now recovering.
The incident is being treated as a serious crash and an investigation into how it happened has been launched. Police say they are still working to determine why Guode’s car ended up in the lake and are asking anyone who may have witnessed the crash or seen anything suspicious in the lead-up to it to come forward.
Guode was arrested and taken into custody on Monday, where she has been held since. She is now free to return home while police continue their investigation. The incident has raised concerns about child safety and how such a tragedy could occur with children inside a car that ends up in the water.
The crash remains under investigation and anyone who may have witnessed it or knows more about what happened is urged to contact police.
