RESH revelation has revealed.
It comes as the MoD faces criticism for ignoring warnings about the impact of long deployments on women's reproductive health. A leaked memo warned that female sailors were being left at risk of 'serious harm' due to lack of support and poor planning.
The HMS Ocean had a total of 12 emergency medevacs in nine years, with five of these involving pregnant women. This is according to figures obtained by the Times under Freedom of Information laws. The ship has been used for a variety of missions, including humanitarian and disaster relief operations.
In one case, a pregnant sailor was airlifted from the ship after suffering complications during a deployment. In another instance, a woman was medevac'd after becoming unwell while on patrol off the coast of Africa. 
The MoD has faced criticism for ignoring warnings about the impact of long deployments on women's reproductive health. The Royal Navy has been urged to do more to support pregnant sailors and improve planning to prevent future incidents.
