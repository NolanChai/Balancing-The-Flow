 Glasgow to pledge support for Scottish independence if the SNP win the election – and to blast the Tories for being “out of touch” with voters north of the border.
The poll, carried out by YouGov for The Times, showed that 46% of Scots would vote for the SNP at the forthcoming election, while only 27% said they would back Labour.
Mr Miliband was last night facing calls to rule out any post-election deal with the SNP after a leading Tory said he would not support such an agreement.
In his speech to the Scottish Trade Union Congress in Glasgow, Mr Miliband insisted that he would do “whatever it takes” to win the election and defeat the Tories.
But he also made clear his willingness to work with the SNP if they won – and even suggested that a Labour-SNP deal could be on the cards after May 7.
Mr Miliband said: “If the SNP are in a position to form a government after the election, I would be ready to talk to them about how we can work together to create a better future for Scotland and the rest of the UK.”
He added: “The Tories are out of touch with what people in Scotland want. They have failed Scotland, time and time again. But Labour is different. We will stand up for Scotland’s interests, no matter what.”
But the poll suggests that the SNP may well be able to form a government without Labour's help – and could potentially even win a majority of seats in Scotland.
The YouGov survey found that 54% of Scots believe the SNP is best placed to represent their interests, compared to just 18% who think Labour has this role. The poll also showed that 60% of voters in Scotland believe that the SNP has a strong leader in Nicola Sturgeon – while only 17% say the same about Mr Miliband.
The Tories were last night accused of attempting to “scaremonger” over the prospect of an SNP-Labour deal, after one of their MPs suggested that such an agreement could lead to Scotland becoming a “one-party state”.
But Labour insisted that it had no plans to form a post-election alliance with the SNP – and claimed that the Tories were simply trying to “deflect attention” from their own failures.
And what is more, the poll also found that only 25% of Scots believe that the UK would be better off if the Conservatives won the election, compared to 49% who think it would be worse off – while 16% said they were not sure.
The SNP has been pushing for a second Scottish independence referendum and Miliband’s speech is seen as a way of positioning himself as a potential ally in the fight for Scottish independence, which he has previously ruled out supporting.
However, it may be noted that this poll was conducted before the row over the SNP-Labour deal erupted.
Miliband also used his speech to attack the Tories over their handling of the economy, accusing them of failing to deliver on their promises and of being “out of touch” with voters north of the border. He claimed that Labour was offering a “better way forward” – but he offered little detail on how this would be achieved.
The poll also found that 63% of Scots believe that the economy is in a worse state than it was five years ago, while only 24% say it is better off. And almost two-thirds (65%) of voters in Scotland think that immigration has had a negative impact on the country – although 24% say it has been positive.
The findings are likely to fuel fears among Labour activists that they are facing an uphill battle in Scotland, as the SNP looks set to make significant gains at the election.
And what is more, the poll also found that only 37% of Scots believe that Mr Miliband would make a good Prime Minister – while 46% said he would not and 17% were undecided.
