A New York City cop checking in on his elderly parents on Friday was horrified to discover them dead along with two other guests in their home.
Robert Hugel, who is assigned to the Technical Assistance Response Unit, arrived at his parents' apartment in Brooklyn around 4:30 p.m. after not hearing from them for several days, police said.
When he opened the door, he found the bodies of his 86-year-old mother, Maria Hugel, and 92-year-old father, Robert Hugel Sr., as well as two other guests who were visiting the home.
"It was a horrific scene," NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea told reporters. "Three people dead, including two elderly individuals, and another person injured."
Police are still investigating how the four victims died, but believe they may have been killed in a homicide.
The suspect, 57-year-old Daniel Enriquez, was found dead from an apparent suicide in a nearby park. He had been staying at the Hugels' home as a guest, police said.
Hugel, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD, is on administrative leave as he deals with the tragedy.
"It's a very difficult situation for him," Shea said. "He's a good cop, a dedicated cop, and this is something that no one expects to happen."
