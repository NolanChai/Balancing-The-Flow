 when someone scrawled 'F--- the Police' on its side.
Police are unsure about who is responsible for the vandalism and are asking for help to identify the perpetrator.
It has been suggested that the graffiti may have been a politically motivated act, but others believe it could be the work of a bored teenager looking for attention.
The LAPD have released a statement urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward and help them identify the person responsible.
Charly is an 18-year-old Thoroughbred who has been a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Mounted Patrol Unit for five years, and has become a popular figure in the city. He has been used at events such as parades, festivals, and charity fundraisers.
The police are taking the vandalism seriously because it is seen as a violation of Charly's privacy and personal space. The horse is trained to ignore any distractions while on duty, but the graffiti could potentially cause him stress and disrupt his work.
The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with police reviewing security footage and conducting interviews with potential witnesses.
In related news, a local artist has offered to create a mural on Charly's side to cover up the graffiti. The artist, who wishes to remain anonymous, says they want to 'make something beautiful out of something negative'.
