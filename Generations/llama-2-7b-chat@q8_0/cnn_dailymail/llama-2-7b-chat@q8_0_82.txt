Brown, 34, sustained a serious concussion during Quins’ Heineken Champions Cup defeat by Ulster at the weekend and is now facing an extended spell out of action. O’Shea, who has coached Brown at both club and international level, expressed his worry at the frequency of high-impact incidents in the sport.
“It’s a concern for all of us,” said O’Shea. “We want to keep the players safe. We talk about tackle technology but it’s not just that. It’s the way we play the game, the physicality. You see some big hits and it worries me.”
O'Shea acknowledged that the laws of the game are being reviewed regularly to minimise the risk of head injuries, but added: “It’s a big challenge for the sport because it is such a physical game. The laws have changed over time but it’s always an ongoing thing. We want to keep the players as safe as possible.”
Brown's injury adds to a growing list of high-profile head injuries in recent months, including those suffered by Wales full back Liam Williams and France flanker Charles Ollivon. O'Shea believes it highlights the need for continued vigilance on player safety.
"It's a big concern," he said. "You can see why it's such a hot topic at the moment. It's not just Mike Brown, it's Liam Williams and other players as well. We have to be careful with these guys."
