ias and Racism (NASM), a coalition of activists who have been organizing protests across the country since last summer’s fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The protesters began gathering at Union Square Park in Manhattan around 5:30 pm and marched through the streets of Greenwich Village, carrying signs that read “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice for Eric Garner,” and “No justice, no peace.” They also chanted slogans like “We are not afraid” and “The whole system is guilty!”
According to police, at least 34 people were arrested during the protests, mostly for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Many of those arrested reportedly refused to comply with officers’ orders to disperse after the march had reached its destination in Times Square.
The protests came on the heels of a grand jury decision last week not to indict any police officers involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was stopped by police on Staten Island in July for selling loose cigarettes. The case has sparked outrage and protests across the country, with many calling for justice and reforms to address systemic racism in law enforcement.
The NASM coalition has been organizing protests and other actions against police brutality since last summer, and says it will continue to fight for justice until changes are made. “We cannot accept a system that continues to perpetuate violence against black people,” said one of the organizers, who identified himself as John. “We will not be silenced until we see real change.”
The New York City Police Department said in a statement that it respects the right to protest but urged demonstrators to do so peacefully and lawfully. “We understand that people have legitimate concerns about police conduct and accountability, and we are committed to working with community leaders and advocates to address these issues,” the statement read.
The protests in New York City were one of several that took place across the country on Tuesday night, as activists continued to demand justice for Eric Garner and an end to police brutality.
