The mother of a pregnant woman who woke up from a four-month coma earlier this month said she knew doctors were wrong when they told her that her 20-year-old daughter wouldn't wake up. Anna Moser’s daughter, Emily, was in a coma after suffering a rare brain aneurysm and had been unresponsive for four months before finally stirring.
Doctors told Moser that there was little chance of her daughter recovering from the coma, but she refused to give up hope. She even held vigil by Emily’s bedside every day, praying for her recovery.
“I knew deep down in my heart that Emily would wake up. I couldn’t understand why the doctors were so pessimistic,” Moser told CNN. “I felt like they didn’t believe in miracles.”
Moser said she believes that her prayers and determination helped bring about Emily’s miraculous recovery. “I knew that God had a plan for Emily, and I just had to trust in it,” she added.
Emily is now recovering at home and is expected to make a full recovery, doctors said. She will undergo physical therapy and other treatments to regain her strength and mobility, but doctors are optimistic about her chances of making a full recovery.
