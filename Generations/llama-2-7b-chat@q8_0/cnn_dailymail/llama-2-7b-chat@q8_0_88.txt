outman was asking about the stage of life where children experience significant physical and emotional changes, but one contestant took the question in a very different direction.
The contestant, who has not been identified, responded: "This is when you start getting boners."
A stunned Troutman quickly moved on to the next question without acknowledging the answer, while the studio audience groaned and some viewers took to social media to express their disgust.
"Wow, that's just gross," wrote one viewer on Twitter. "What a disturbing and inappropriate response."
Another viewer added: "This contestant needs to be banned from Jeopardy forever. That was just disgusting."
It is not clear if the contestant realized how inappropriate their answer was or if they were intentionally trying to cause a stir. Either way, it is unlikely that they will be invited back onto the show again anytime soon.
