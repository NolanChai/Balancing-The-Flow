Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League. Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star performer as Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League final last weekend.
"Terry is the best defender I've seen in the Premier League," Carragher told Sky Sports. "He's got everything - he can defend, he can attack, he's a leader on the pitch and off it. He's just got that little bit of extra quality that sets him apart from the rest."
Carragher, who played alongside Terry for England, added: "I think he's got better with age as well. A lot of players peak in their mid-20s or early 30s but Terry is still improving. He's a fantastic player and deserves all the plaudits he gets."
Terry has won numerous individual awards and has played a key role in Chelsea's success over the past decade, helping the club to four Premier League titles and one Champions League title.
"He's a true leader on the pitch," Carragher added. "He's got that presence about him and he demands respect from the opposition. He's always been a top player but I think he's even better now."
Carragher, who retired from playing in 2013, believes Terry's leadership qualities are just as important as his defensive skills.
"Defending is important but leading your team and being a true captain is just as important," Carragher said. "Terry's got that quality, he's always been a leader on the pitch."
