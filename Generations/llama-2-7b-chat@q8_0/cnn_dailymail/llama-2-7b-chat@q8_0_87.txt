 without leaving your armchair thanks to Google Street View.
Google has launched an online travel guide that allows people to explore popular tourist destinations around the world using its street view technology.
The new service, called Google Trips, lets users plan and book their holidays by giving them a virtual tour of various locations before they arrive.
It includes high-resolution imagery of hotels, restaurants and attractions, as well as reviews and recommendations from other travellers.
Google said the new service was designed to make it easier for people to plan and book their holidays by providing them with a 'complete travel experience'.
'With Google Trips, users can explore destinations before they arrive, get recommendations on hotels, restaurants and activities based on their interests and preferences,' said Mario Quieroz, product manager at Google.  'They can also book flights, hotels and activities all in one place.'
The service is available on the web and as a mobile app for Android and iOS devices.
Google Trips also includes a feature called 'Maps' which allows users to view nearby attractions on a map and create custom guides for their trip.
Other features of Google Trips include the ability to save favourite places, get real-time flight information and bookmark places for later.
