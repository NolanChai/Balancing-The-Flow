Neymar was a major factor in Barcelona’s victory over PSG, scoring twice and setting up another goal for Luis Suarez. He also had some great individual moments of skill, such as his dribble past David Luiz and his free kick that hit the post.
Luiz struggled to contain Neymar throughout the match, often being beaten in one-on-one situations or finding himself out of position. His performance was particularly poor in the first half, when he gave away a penalty by bringing down Neymar in the box.
Despite Luiz’s struggles, PSG still had some good moments in attack, with Kylian Mbappe and Edison Cavani both creating chances for their teammates. However, Barcelona were always the more dangerous side, and their victory was a deserved one.
