A good Samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying.
Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped in the first space available when he saw the pedestrian stumble and fall to the ground near his car on a busy road in West Sussex, England.
But as he rushed to her aid, a traffic warden issued him a Â£70 fine for parking in a restricted area without a valid permit.
Despite the good Samaritan's efforts to help the woman, she was taken to hospital with serious injuries and the council defended the ticket, saying it had been issued correctly.
Hollinshead, who has started a petition to have the fine overturned, said: "I couldn't believe it when I saw the ticket on my windscreen. I had just saved an elderly woman's life and now I was being punished for stopping to help her."
The incident has sparked outrage in the community, with many calling for the council to reconsider its decision.
Council officials said they understand the good Samaritan's actions, but added that their hands were tied by the rules of the road.
