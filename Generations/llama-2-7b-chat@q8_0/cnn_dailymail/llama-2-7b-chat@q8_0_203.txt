10 minutes of their spacewalk on November 7, 2014 from outside the station. The footage captured views of the Earth that are truly breathtaking, including the curvature of our planet and the blackness of space.
The ISS orbits about 250 miles above the Earth's surface at an altitude of approximately 250 miles, which is far enough away to see the curvature of the planet. The footage was taken during a spacewalk that lasted about 6.5 hours and covered several tasks including upgrading station hardware and conducting scientific experiments.
The video shows Wilmore floating in front of the station with Virts following behind him, both wearing bulky spacesuits to protect them from the harsh conditions outside the station. They move around the exterior of the station, performing tasks such as attaching a new radiator to cool the station's power systems and connecting cables to support future scientific experiments.
Throughout the video, the astronauts can be seen floating in the vacuum of space with no feeling of gravity or resistance, moving slowly and carefully through their tasks due to the lack of atmosphere. At one point, Wilmore points his camera toward Earth and captures a stunning shot of our planet, its blue oceans and green landmasses visible from space.
The video also shows the vastness of space around them as they float outside the station. The stars are bright and numerous in the blackness of space, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant colors of Earth below. At one point, Virts can be seen pointing out a shooting star streaking across the sky.
Overall, the video provides an incredible glimpse into life outside the International Space Station, offering breathtaking views of our planet and the vastness of space around us. It highlights the incredible work that astronauts do every day to advance scientific knowledge and expand human understanding of the universe.
