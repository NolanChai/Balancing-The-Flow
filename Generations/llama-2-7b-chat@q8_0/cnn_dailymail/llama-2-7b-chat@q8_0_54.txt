s voice heard and was punished for it. It is no coincidence that of all the ECB's executive directors, only he and Giles Clarke have been dropped since the World Cup humiliation.
The Telegraph has learned that as well as dropping Downton, the ECB will also abolish the post of managing director of cricket, a job held by Hugh Morris since 2007. The position has become increasingly toxic in recent months, with even former England captain Michael Vaughan questioning Morris's leadership.
The move comes as the ECB attempts to rebuild its battered reputation following the Ashes fiasco and the subsequent collapse of the Test team in the West Indies. It is an acknowledgement that the governing body's handling of English cricket has been found wanting, with too many mistakes made for too long.
The ECB will now seek to appoint a new managing director of cricket, one who can work closely with the national team coach and restore some semblance of stability to the game. It is an urgent need given that England are due to host India in the summer, and a failure to get things right could have disastrous consequences for the sport's popularity.
The decision to drop Downton has been met with widespread criticism from those inside and outside the ECB. His supporters say he was a straight-talking operator who told it as it was, but his detractors point out that his outspoken views often landed him in trouble.
The Telegraph understands that Downton's departure has been caused by his refusal to back down on his criticism of the ECB hierarchy and their handling of English cricket. He had become increasingly isolated within the boardroom, with his relationship with chairman Colin Graves soured beyond repair.
The ECB will now seek to rebuild its reputation through a series of changes at the top of the governing body. It is an acknowledgement that the game's popularity has been in decline for too long, and that something drastic needed to be done to arrest the trend.
