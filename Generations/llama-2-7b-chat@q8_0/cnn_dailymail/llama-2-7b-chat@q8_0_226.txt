 mind on the landmark case, according to a new biography out Tuesday.
In an interview with author Jane Mayer of The New Yorker published Tuesday, Justice Ginsburg expressed her views on the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on whether same-sex couples have the right to marry under the Constitution . "I think that it will be a 5-4 decision," she said .
According to Mayer's account, Ginsburg added: "The whole country is watching this case. They are eagerly awaiting the result. And I think it's going to be a very close vote."
Ginsburg has long been an advocate for LGBT rights and has written several times on the issue of same-sex marriage . She has also been vocal about her belief that the Supreme Court should intervene in the matter, saying that "the Constitution guarantees the right to marry, and that right should not be denied to same-sex couples."
The justice's comments come as the Supreme Court is poised to hear oral arguments in a landmark case involving California's Proposition 8 , which bans same-sex marriage . The court is also considering the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denies recognition to same-sex marriages performed in states where they are legal.
Ginsburg has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights throughout her career on the bench, and has consistently sided with the plaintiffs in cases involving these issues . Her support for same-sex marriage is not surprising, given her strong belief in the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and her commitment to gender equality .
In conclusion, Justice Ginsburg has made her views clear on the upcoming Supreme Court case regarding same-sex marriage . Her comments suggest a strong likelihood that she will vote in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage , although it's difficult to predict exactly how the court will rule. Nonetheless, Ginsburg's support for LGBT rights is an important statement on the issue and highlights her commitment to advancing gender equality and protecting the rights of all individuals under the law
