Aurora Police Officer Jason O'Brien described the chaos he encountered after entering the Century 16 movie theater shortly before midnight on July 20, 2012. James Holmes, then 24, had opened fire on the unsuspecting audience during a showing of "The Dark Knight Rises," killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.
"It was like something out of a horror movie," O'Brien told jurors in the trial of Holmes, who is charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack. "There were bodies lying on the ground, some of them still moving. It was hard to tell who was alive and who was dead."
Officer O'Brien said he quickly realized that the noise he heard inside the theater was not just the sound of gunfire but also the sound of people screaming for help.
"It was like a never-ending nightmare," he testified, his voice shaking as he recounted the details of that fateful night. "There were flashes going off from the fire alarm, and it was hard to see anything because of all the smoke."
Officer O'Brien and other officers rushed into the theater through a back door and found themselves in a hallway filled with people fleeing the gunfire. They quickly realized that the shooter was still inside and that they needed to find him before he could harm anyone else.
"We knew we had to get him out of there as fast as possible," O'Brien said, his voice steady despite the trauma he experienced that night. "We didn't know how many people he had left to kill."
Prosecutors have presented a detailed account of the chaos and horror that unfolded in the theater that night, painting a vivid picture of the carnage caused by Holmes' rampage. They argue that he planned the attack meticulously and executed it with cold calculation, targeting innocent civilians who were simply trying to enjoy a movie.
Defense attorneys for Holmes have argued that their client was mentally ill and that his actions were not those of a rational person. They say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode when he opened fire on the unsuspecting audience, and that he should be spared the death penalty as a result.
The trial is expected to last several more weeks, with prosecutors presenting additional evidence and witnesses testifying about the aftermath of the attack. But Wednesday's testimony from Officer O'Brien provided a powerful reminder of the horrors that unfolded in that darkened theater on a summer night in Aurora, Colorado - a night that will be forever etched in the memories of those who were there and in the consciousness of a nation that was shocked and saddened by the senseless act of violence.
