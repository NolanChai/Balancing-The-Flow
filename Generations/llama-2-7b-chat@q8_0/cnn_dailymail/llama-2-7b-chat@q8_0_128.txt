 by local authorities three times in the past year for allowing their two children, ages 10 and 6, to walk home alone from a park near their home in the Washington suburbs.
On Sunday, the parents reported that their 10-year-old son was picked up by police after he walked about half a mile from the park back home. They claim they had given him specific instructions not to enter anyone's property or cross any busy streets without asking permission first.
Danielle Meitiv told the Washington Post, "My heart sank when I found out. My child is safe and that's all that matters to me." The family has been practicing "free-range" parenting for years and argue they have a right to raise their children without government intervention.
Meanwhile, Montgomery County Police said in a statement that officers received a call from a concerned citizen who reported seeing the 10-year-old boy walking alone on the street. The police then contacted the Meitivs and took the child into protective custody.
The Meitivs have been vocal advocates for "free-range" parenting, which involves giving children more independence and autonomy to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes. They argue that parents should trust their children and give them space to grow and develop without overprotective measures.
However, some experts have raised concerns about the safety of "free-range" parenting, particularly when it comes to young children. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of children getting lost or injured while unsupervised outside.
Despite the controversy, the Meitivs remain committed to their approach and are now exploring legal action against the police department for what they see as an overreach of authority.
"We're not going to back down on our beliefs," Alexander Meitiv told Fox 5 DC. "We're going to fight for our rights as parents to raise our children in a way that we think is best."
