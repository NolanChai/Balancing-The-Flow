This is a positive development in holding for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian Colleges Inc. has been under investigation for several years, facing allegations of widespread fraud and abuse. The college's leaders had repeatedly violated federal law by making false claims about graduation rates, job placement, and accreditation status. Additionally, the chain preyed on vulnerable students, including those with criminal records or those struggling financially. The closure of these 28 campuses is a step towards protecting students from such unethical practices and ensuring that they receive a quality education that prepares them for their future careers.
