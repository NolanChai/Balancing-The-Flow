 She is being forced into the union by her parents, who want to get rid of her dowry in one go, according to reports.
In the heartbreaking letter, which was shared on Twitter, the girl describes how she feels trapped and scared about the marriage. She explains that she does not love the person she is set to marry and beggs her teacher for help.
The letter reads: "Dear Teacher, I am writing this letter to you with tears in my eyes. My parents are forcing me to get married to someone I don't love. They want to get rid of my dowry all at once and that's why they have chosen this person for me.
I don't want to marry him. I am only 13 years old and want to study and play with my friends. But my parents are not listening to me. Please, teacher, can you help me? I beg of you."
The girl's teacher shared the letter on Twitter and urged people to share it to raise awareness about child marriage. She wrote: "This letter broke my heart. A 13-year-old girl is being forced into an arranged marriage against her will. Please share this to help #endchildmarriage."
According to UNICEF, more than 15 million girls under the age of 18 are married every year in India. The country has made significant progress in reducing child marriage, but there is still much work to be done.
The letter from the young girl highlights the urgent need for action to protect children from being forced into marriages that can have serious consequences for their health, education and well-being.
