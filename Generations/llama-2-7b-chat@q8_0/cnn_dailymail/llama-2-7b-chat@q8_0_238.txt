Robert, 56, has made a name for himself by scaling some of the world’s most iconic buildings without any safety gear. He has climbed more than 100 skyscrapers around the globe, including the Eiffel Tower and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
Despite his fearless reputation, Robert says he is always aware of the risks involved in his stunts, which he claims are “a balance between life and death”. He added: “It’s a risk that I take every time, but it’s worth it because it’s my passion.”
Robert climbed the Cayan Tower overnight from 1am to 4am, taking around four hours to reach the top. The tower is located in Dubai’s business district and stands out for its unique spiral design. It was completed in 2013 and stands at 1,007ft (307 meters) tall.
The climb was filmed by a team of cameramen who followed Robert throughout the ascent. The footage will be used to make a documentary about his adventures.
