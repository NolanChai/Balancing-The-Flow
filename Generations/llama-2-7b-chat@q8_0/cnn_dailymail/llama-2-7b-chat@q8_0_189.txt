c fate: being subjected to forced labor, sexual exploitation and physical abuse.
The victims were promised jobs as dancers or bartenders in New York City nightclubs. Instead they were beaten, threatened with death and forced to work long hours for little pay while their passports were confiscated. They were also subjected to sexual assault and rape by Vass and other members of the trafficking ring.
Vass was convicted on 15 counts including human trafficking, racketeering, and use of a facility in interstate commerce to commit a felony. He faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced in April. His attorney says he plans to appeal the conviction.
U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch called Vass "a ruthless trafficker who preyed on vulnerable young men." The FBI began investigating Vass in 2010 after a victim managed to escape and contact authorities. Since then, more than a dozen other victims have come forward.
The case is a sobering reminder of the pervasiveness of human trafficking in the United States. According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, there were 321 reported cases of sex trafficking last year involving minors.
In related news, prosecutors have charged a second man accused of working with Vass in the trafficking ring. Istvan Kovacs, 40, is also a Hungarian national and faces similar charges to Vass.
