th century history – the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights in Britain.
Miliband has been called a 'brave' and ‘inspiring’ figure for his admission that he cried while watching the film, which explores the story of a small-town gay man who becomes involved in the 1980s LGBTQ+ rights movement.
But what if Miliband had admitted to crying at a different kind of movie? What if he had said that he burst into tears during the latest superhero blockbuster, or an action-packed adventure flick? Would he still be seen as 'brave' and ‘inspiring’, or would people assume that he was simply not tough enough to handle a challenging film?
It's interesting to consider how gender roles and expectations around emotional expression can shape our reactions to someone like Miliband. Men are often socialised to be stoic and unemotional, while women are encouraged to express their feelings more openly. So when a man shows emotion in a way that is traditionally seen as 'feminine', he may be met with surprise or even ridicule.
Of course, it's important to challenge these gendered expectations and to celebrate emotional expression from anyone, regardless of their gender. But it's also worth recognising how deeply ingrained these cultural norms are – and how hard it can be for men to break free from them.
