The Old Bailey was told that Kazi Islam, 18, sent texts to Harry Thomas, 19, who had learning difficulties, persuading him to buy parts for a bomb. A teenager bullied and groomed a friend with learning disabilities into sending him explicit images of herself and even made her watch pornography. The judge said that Islam's actions were "absolutely reprehensible" and described the case as "a very serious example of grooming". Islam, from Tower Hamlets, London, pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to make an explosive substance and two counts of possessing documents useful for terrorism. He was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution.
