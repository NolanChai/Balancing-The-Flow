30,000 feet above California were heard screaming and bracing themselves for impact as the Boeing 717 aircraft plunged in an emergency descent.
According to reports, the pilot quickly descended from his normal cruising altitude of 35,000 feet and made a rapid descent towards San Bernardino International Airport. The incident occurred just after 9am local time.
“I was on my way to work and suddenly we were plummeting downward,” said passenger Jillian Sullivan, who was one of the hundreds of terrified travelers on board the flight. “It was like something out of a nightmare.”
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and airline officials are investigating the cause of the sudden loss of cabin pressure, which is believed to have occurred around 30,000 feet in the air. The FAA said that the pilot had reported an “emergency” and had taken control of the aircraft to make an emergency landing at San Bernardino International Airport.
According to a spokesperson for SkyWest Airlines, all passengers were safely evacuated from the aircraft without injury after the emergency landing.
“We take incidents like this very seriously,” said airline spokesman Mike Relyea in a statement. “Our primary concern is always the safety and well-being of our passengers and crew.”
