Rory McIlroy has taken a break from his day job as one of the world's top golfers to get stuck into a new project - promoting a new football concept called Circular Soccer.
The 32-year-old sportsman was filmed taking on Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan in a series of hilarious challenges as part of the promotion for the innovative new sport.
McIlroy, who is from Northern Ireland, was seen trying to get the better of his opponent in a series of bizarre games, including one where they had to kick a football-shaped bean bag into a goal made out of a giant inflatable ring.
Another challenge saw them try to score goals using only their feet and hips, while a third task involved trying to dodge obstacles while carrying a large inflatable beach ball.
Dornan, 48, was also seen struggling at times during the challenges, but he managed to stay one step ahead of McIlroy in many of them.
The unlikely pair were filmed taking part in the fun-filled promo as they battled it out on a specially created course in London.
Circular Soccer is a new concept that combines elements of soccer and trampolining, with players using a large inflatable ring to kick the ball into a goal.
The sport has gained popularity around the world and is already being played in countries such as the UK, Australia, and the US.
McIlroy, who has won numerous titles during his career on the golf course, including four major championships, is no stranger to taking on new challenges.
He launched his own line of golf clubs and shoes last year, and has also become a prominent ambassador for various charities.
