England captain Alastair Cook completed a much-needed century on the second morning of England's opening tour match in the West Indies. Cook resumed on 95 and reached three figures with minimal fuss before being dismissed for 102 off 247 balls, having added 86 runs to his overnight score.
The opener's century was the first of the tour and came at a time when England have been struggling in the batting department. Cook's innings was characterised by his usual solid defence and careful accumulation of runs, with only three boundaries in his knock. The 33-year-old has faced 247 balls so far in his innings, with the West Indies bowlers testing him with a variety of deliveries.
Cook's century was also significant for England as it provided some much-needed stability in the middle order after a shaky start to the tour. The visitors had collapsed to 140 for five overnight, but Cook's resistance helped them build a more substantial total. The opener's century is also his 32nd in Test cricket, moving him into equal third on the all-time list of most Test centuries scored by an England player.
The West Indies bowlers did not have much luck with the ball, with Cook and Joe Root (64) adding 110 runs for the second wicket. The hosts had earlier made a strong start to their innings, with Kraigg Brathwaite (58) and Kieran Powell (39) putting on 72 runs for the opening wicket.
The West Indies will resume their first innings on 214 for six, with the England bowlers looking to make inroads into the hosts' middle order. The match is evenly poised, with both teams having their moments, and a result is far from certain.
