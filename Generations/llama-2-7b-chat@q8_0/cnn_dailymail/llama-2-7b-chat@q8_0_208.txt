 long way from the days when he was Hibs’ golden boy.
But even though Griffiths is no longer a household name in Leith, those who know him still see glimpses of his old self on occasion. The mischievous grin, the sharp wit and that infectious laugh all still linger, even if they are now reserved for private moments rather than public display.
“He’s still the same Leigh Griffiths,” says one friend, who asked to remain anonymous. “You can see it in his eyes when he’s around the boys at Celtic Park. He’s still got that spark.”
It was Griffiths’ goals which fired Hibs to the Scottish Cup final back in 2017 but a few months later, he found himself on the wrong side of the law after a drunken night out in Leith. A conviction for disorderly behaviour and public disturbance led to his eventual departure from Easter Road, with Celtic snapping him up in January 2018.
It was a move that raised eyebrows at the time, given Griffiths’ history of off-field issues but he has since proved himself to be an asset to Brendan Rodgers’ side. Last season’s treble winners were so impressed with his performances that they handed him a new two-year deal in May 2019.
“Leigh’s still the same Leigh, just with a bit more responsibility now,” says another friend. “He knows he’s got a reputation to uphold but he’s not letting it get to his head.”
Griffiths himself has been tight-lipped about his time at Hibs and his departure for Celtic. He has spoken of the need to move on from the past and focus on the future, and that seems to be exactly what he is doing.
“I’m just concentrating on my football now,” he said recently when asked about his time at Hibs. “I can’t change what’s happened in the past but I can make sure that I put a good shift in for Celtic.”
