 wipes, was found in the Northern Line sewer beneath Oxford Street in Mayfair, one of London's most expensive shopping areas.
Workers from Thames Water had to use a combination of high-pressure water jets and giant drills to break up and remove the 'fatberg', which had built up over several years. The operation took several days to complete and involved draining 10 million litres of sewage from the affected area in order to access the fatberg.
The removal of the fatberg is just one part of a wider project by Thames Water to clear the capital's sewers of blockages caused by flushed items such as wet wipes, sanitary products and even broken condoms. The problem has become so bad that Thames Water has launched a public awareness campaign warning people against flushing anything other than toilet paper down their loos.
The fatberg was first discovered in the sewer beneath Oxford Street in 2013, but it has since grown in size due to ongoing issues with flushed items. Experts warn that if left unchecked, such blockages can cause raw sewage to overflow into homes and businesses, potentially causing millions of pounds worth of damage.
Thames Water's chief sewer operator, Nick Reeves, warned: 'This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed now to prevent it getting worse. We are working around the clock to clear London's sewers but we need people to take responsibility for what they flush down their loos.'
The removal of the fatberg has been hailed as a major success, with Thames Water stating that it had prevented a potential 'major incident' in the capital's sewer network. The company has promised to continue its efforts to clear London's sewers and is calling on the public to do their part by only flushing toilet paper down the loo.
In conclusion, Thames Water has successfully removed an enormous fatberg from a sewer beneath one of London's most exclusive streets after several days of work involving high-pressure water jets and giant drills. The operation highlights the growing problem of blockages in the capital's sewers caused by flushed items such as wet wipes, sanitary products and broken condoms, which can cause raw sewage to overflow into homes and businesses if left unchecked. Thames Water is urging the public to take responsibility for what they flush down their loos to prevent further problems in the future.
