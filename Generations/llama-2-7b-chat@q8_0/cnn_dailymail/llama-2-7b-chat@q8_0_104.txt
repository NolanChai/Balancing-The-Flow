Hannah Campbell was just 22 years old when she was blown up by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq as an Army corporal. Doctors were amazed that she survived the blast, but they were less sure about her chances of ever having children.
The shrapnel had damaged her womb, leaving her with severe infertility. But despite the grim prognosis, Hannah was determined to become a mother.
Now, a year after giving birth to her daughter Lexi-River, Hannah is reflecting on the miracle of her baby’s arrival – and the nightmares that still haunt her from the trauma of war.
‘Lexi-River is the light at the end of the tunnel,’ says Hannah, 27, who lives in Texas with her husband, Jake. ‘But even though she brings me so much joy, I can’t shake off the memories of what happened in Iraq.
‘Sometimes I wake up screaming from nightmares. I see faces and hear voices from the war. It’s like it’s all still happening. And even though I know I’m safe at home, I can’t shake off the feeling of being on high alert all the time.’
Hannah was just 19 when she enlisted in the Army. She wanted to serve her country and see the world. But as soon as she arrived in Iraq, she knew something was wrong. The heat was oppressive, and the noise of the helicopters and gunfire made her jumpy.
On that fateful day in 2008, Hannah was on patrol with her unit when their Humvee hit a roadside bomb. She remembers feeling like she was floating above her body, watching as everything went dark.
When she came to, she was lying in a hospital bed in Germany, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They told her that she had suffered severe injuries, including a broken neck and back, and that her womb was damaged beyond repair.
But Hannah didn’t give up hope. She spent months recovering from her injuries, and then she began researching alternative ways to conceive. She tried in vitro fertilization, but it wasn’t successful. So she turned to a surrogate mother.
Finally, after years of trying, Hannah became pregnant with Lexi-River. It was a long and difficult labor, but on July 14 last year, the little girl was born.
Hannah remembers that moment as if it were yesterday: ‘She was so small and fragile. I knew right then that she was my miracle baby. Seeing her for the first time made all the pain and suffering worth it.’
But despite Lexi-River’s arrival, Hannah still struggles with the nightmares and flashbacks of war. She knows that she will always carry the trauma of what happened in Iraq with her, but she is determined to give her daughter the best possible life.
‘I know I’ll never be able to erase the memories of what happened, but I’m working on finding ways to manage them,’ says Hannah. ‘I want Lexi-River to grow up in a safe and happy home, surrounded by love. That’s all any mother wants for her child.’
As she blows out the candles on Lexi-River’s first birthday cake, Hannah feels a sense of pride and gratitude. She knows that she has overcome incredible odds to bring this little miracle into the world, and she is determined to give her daughter everything she needs to grow up strong and happy.
For now, though, she will just cherish these precious moments with Lexi-River, knowing that they are a testament to the power of love and resilience.
