 their wallets and designer clothing within seconds of their victim being distracted or picking up a call on their mobile phone. Scotland Yard has now launched a major investigation into the problem, which is thought to be linked to an increase in drug-related crime in Chile.
One undercover police officer, who wishes to remain anonymous, told reporters: “These thieves are incredibly skilled and operate with military precision. They know exactly where and when to strike, and it’s impossible to catch them in the act. We have been trying to track them down for months but they always seem to be one step ahead of us.”
The officer added that police are now working closely with Chilean authorities to tackle the problem at source. “We believe that these pickpockets are being funded by drug cartels and that they are using their ill-gotten gains to finance their lifestyle of luxury in London,” he said.
In response to the increasing number of thefts, West End shopkeepers have been advised to increase security measures around their premises, including installing CCTV cameras and hiring private security guards. However, many retailers are concerned that these measures may scare off customers and harm their businesses.
In related news, a spokesperson for the Chilean government has denied any involvement in the pickpocketing rackets and condemned the actions of the thieves as “unacceptable and illegal.” The spokesperson added that Chilean authorities are working closely with British law enforcement agencies to bring those responsible to justice.
For its part, Scotland Yard has warned visitors to the West End to be vigilant when shopping and carrying valuables, and to report any suspicious activity to the police immediately.
