oused with 750 litres of chlorine in a desperate attempt to kill off a bloom of harmful algae.
But for those who have been following the ongoing saga, it may have come as no surprise that this latest incident has sparked yet another round of heated debate about the health and safety of Bondi's beaches.
Some are pointing the finger at the council, accusing them of being too slow to react in addressing a problem which they claim has been building for months. Others say the algae bloom is just one of many environmental issues that need to be addressed as part of a broader approach to sustainability.
But as the clean-up operation got underway, there were signs that the debate may not be so black and white after all. At least, not when it comes to the issue of how best to protect one of Australia's most famous and popular beaches from the effects of climate change.
As Bondi's mayor, Clover Moore put it: "We have to take a long-term view on this. It's not just about addressing the immediate problem. We need to think about how we can sustainably manage our beaches for years to come."
For the first time in months, Bondi Beach is open for swimming again after a harmful algae bloom forced its closure. But as the clean-up operation got underway, there were signs that the debate may not be so black and white when it comes to protecting Australia's most famous beach from the effects of climate change.
It seems that there is no easy solution for this issue. The council needs to balance the need to keep the beach safe for swimmers with the need to protect the environment. And as the debate rages on, one thing is clear: Bondi Beach will continue to be a focal point in the ongoing battle against climate change.
