Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides' last chance to win any silverware this season. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks at the game and gives his prediction.
Liverpool have had a fantastic season, but they face a tough test against Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. The Reds are the favourites going into the tie, but Villa have been one of the most improved teams in the league this year and will be eager to cause an upset.
One thing that could work in Liverpool's favour is their recent form. They have won six of their last seven games in all competitions, including a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the Premier League last time out. Jurgen Klopp's side are in good shape and will be looking to make it to the final for the first time since 2012.
However, Villa have been playing some excellent football of late themselves. They have won three of their last four games in all competitions, including a 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Dean Smith's side are finding ways to win games and will be confident of causing an upset against Liverpool.
The main problem for Villa could be their away form. They have won just one of their last seven league games on the road, which was a 2-1 victory over Fulham in March. That could make it difficult for them to get a result against Liverpool at Wembley Stadium.
As for my prediction, I think Liverpool will win the game but it won't be easy. Villa have been playing well and they have nothing to lose, so they will give it everything they have. In the end, I think Liverpool's quality will shine through and they will reach the final with a 2-1 victory.
One player who could make a big difference in the game is Villa's Jack Grealish. He has been one of their best players this season and has already scored four goals in the FA Cup this term. If he can get on the scoresheet, it will give Villa a massive boost.
Overall, it should be an exciting game at Wembley and I think Liverpool will just edge it. But you never know with football - anything can happen in a one-off game like this.
