100% of their Premier League record this season, while QPR are desperate for three points to ease their relegation fears. But Ramsey insists his team are under less pressure than their opponents, saying: "I think it's a big game for both teams, but from our point of view, we're probably under less pressure. "It's a massive game for Chelsea because they want to keep their 100% record going and maintain that momentum. They've got some big games coming up, and they can't afford to drop any points." Ramsey added: "We know it's a tough ask, but we're in a good position at the moment. We're not in the relegation zone, and we've given ourselves a chance of getting out of trouble with the performances we've been producing." Despite their lowly league position, Ramsey is confident his players can upset the odds against Chelsea, saying: "I think we've got enough quality and potential to cause problems for any team in this league. We know it won't be easy, but we're looking forward to the challenge."
