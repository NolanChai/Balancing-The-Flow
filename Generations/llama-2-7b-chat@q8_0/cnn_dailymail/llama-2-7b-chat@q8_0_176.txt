 that guy' when asked about Kaminsky in response to a question, according to media reports.
Harrison apologized for his actions on Twitter late Sunday night. He tweeted 'My apologies for the language I used after the game today. I know better and I shouldn't have let my emotions get the best of me. Frank Kaminsky is a great player & respect him as an opponent.'
Kaminsky, who led Wisconsin to a 71-64 victory over Kentucky in Saturday night's national semifinal game, said he doesn't plan on dwelling on Harrison's comment. 'I don't think it's worth getting upset about,' Kaminsky said. 'It is what it is.'
Kaminsky added that he has always tried to approach the game with respect for his opponents and that he will continue to do so. 'You have to give credit to the other team when they make shots or make plays, even if you don't like them,' Kaminsky said. 'That's just how you play the game.'"
