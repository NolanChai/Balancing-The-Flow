 Bola joined Chris Wood in pulling out of the match due to fitness concerns, leaving manager Garry Monk with a major headache.
Monk had hoped that his side's 2-1 win over Cardiff on Tuesday would have marked a turnaround in their fortunes but instead the injury crisis deepened. Antenucci, who has struggled for form all season, is likely to be out for several weeks with a knee problem, while Bellusci is also dealing with a knee issue and Del Fabro picked up an ankle injury during training on Thursday.
Wood, meanwhile, has been struggling with a muscle strain and will not be available for Saturday's game. Monk is hoping that the remaining players can step up and fill the void left by their departing team-mates. "We have had a lot of injuries this season but we need to stick together as a group," he said.
"The lads who are left out will get their chance and they need to take it with both hands."
Monk's men are currently 13th in the Championship table, six points adrift of the play-off places. They face a tough run of fixtures over the coming weeks, including Saturday's trip to Charlton, which could prove crucial in their bid to secure promotion to the Premier League.
