 Bradford, West Yorkshire, but he refused to cooperate and instead sped off.
In the footage, taken from the dashcam of an oncoming police car, you can see Ali's car being pulled over at a roundabout. He appears to be driving erratically before coming to a stop in the middle of the roundabout.
An officer can be heard telling Ali to 'get out of the car', but he refuses and starts revving his engine. The officer warns him that he will be arrested if he doesn't cooperate, but Ali accelerates away from the roundabout at high speed, narrowly missing other cars in the process.
The footage shows the police car pursuing Ali as he drives erratically and recklessly through residential streets, narrowly avoiding pedestrians and other vehicles. The officer can be heard shouting 'stop the car' and using his sirens to try and get Ali to pull over, but he continues to evade them.
Eventually, after several minutes of chase, Ali loses control of the car and crashes into a garden fence. He is quickly apprehended by police and arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and obstructing an officer in the course of their duty.
The dramatic footage has been released by West Yorkshire Police to warn drivers of the dangers of attempting to evade arrest. Inspector Dave Barker, of Bradford District Police, said: 'This footage shows just how dangerous and reckless Ali's actions were. He put not only his own life at risk but also the lives of other road users and pedestrians.
'It is important that drivers understand that if they are stopped by police for any reason, they must cooperate and comply with their instructions. Attempting to evade arrest can have serious consequences and can lead to dangerous situations for everyone involved.'
Ali was later charged with dangerous driving, obstructing an officer in the course of their duty and driving without a licence or insurance. He appeared at Bradford Magistrates' Court yesterday (Weds) where he was remanded in custody until his next appearance on August 29.'
