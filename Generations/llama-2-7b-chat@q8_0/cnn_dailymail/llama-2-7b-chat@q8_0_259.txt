Bale has been struggling with a muscle problem that has limited his playing time in recent weeks, and Ancelotti decided to give him a break to avoid aggravating the injury further.
"Gareth Bale won't be available for Saturday's game against Eibar," Ancelotti told a news conference. "He's not feeling well and we want to give him some rest to avoid any risk of injury."
Ancelotti also confirmed that Kroos and Rodriguez, who are both serving one-match suspensions following their sending off in last weekend's 2-1 win at Valencia, will also miss the game against Eibar.
Real Madrid are second in La Liga, four points behind leaders Barcelona with a game in hand. They host Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday before facing Espanyol in the Copa del Rey final on April 27.
