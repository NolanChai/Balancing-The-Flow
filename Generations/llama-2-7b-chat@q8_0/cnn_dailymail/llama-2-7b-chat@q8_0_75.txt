rful not knowing what would happen to my baby,' said Van Santen, now 37. 'But my oncologist was amazing and told me that they could monitor the cancer during my pregnancy.'
Van Santen underwent chemotherapy throughout her pregnancy, and gave birth to Elijah via cesarean section when she was 38 weeks along. The baby boy was healthy and free of cancer, but Van Santen faced additional challenges after his birth as she continued to recover from surgery and radiation treatments for her breast cancer.
'It was hard to care for a newborn while also dealing with the side effects of chemotherapy,' said Van Santen, who lives in Ontario, Canada. 'But I knew that I had to do whatever it took to protect my baby.'
Van Santen is now cancer-free and Elijah is thriving at 4 years old. She has since become an advocate for pregnant women with breast cancer, sharing her story to raise awareness about the need for more research and resources for these patients.
'I want other moms to know that they are not alone,' said Van Santen. 'And I hope that by sharing my story, we can make a difference in the lives of pregnant women with breast cancer.'
More than 30,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy each year, according to the American Cancer Society. While the prognosis for these patients has improved significantly over the past few decades, there is still a need for more research and resources to ensure that they receive the best possible care.
One of the biggest challenges faced by pregnant women with breast cancer is the risk of delayed diagnosis, according to Dr. Stephanie Blank, an oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.
'It can be difficult for doctors to detect breast cancer in pregnant women because their breasts may be changing shape due to hormonal changes during pregnancy,' said Blank, who has treated numerous pregnant women with breast cancer. 'So it's important for doctors to be aware of the risks and to monitor these patients closely.'
Van Santen's experience highlights the importance of early detection and proper treatment for pregnant women with breast cancer. She encourages other moms to speak up if they notice any changes in their breasts or feel any unusual symptoms during pregnancy.
'I wish I had been more proactive about checking my breasts during pregnancy,' said Van Santen. 'But I hope that by sharing my story, other moms will be more aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and won't hesitate to seek medical attention if they have any concerns.'
As for Elijah, he is thriving and has no evidence of cancer, according to Van Santen. 'He's a happy, energetic little boy who brings so much joy to our lives,' she said. 'And I'm grateful every day that he was born healthy and cancer-free.'
