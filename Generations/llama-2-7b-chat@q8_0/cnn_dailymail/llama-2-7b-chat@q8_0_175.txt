leland pair say their likeness is purely coincidental and there are no plans to try to profit from it.
"People have been saying we're twins, but we're just two separate people who happen to look a bit similar," Geaney said. "I don't think it's anything supernatural."
Branigan agrees: "It's quite funny really. But we're definitely not related or anything like that."
The two women met for the first time on Monday when they both happened to be at the same Dublin bar at the same time. They struck up a conversation and quickly realized how similar they looked.
"At first we thought it was just a bit weird," Geaney said. "But then we started laughing about it and realized that it was quite funny really."
Since their chance encounter, the two women have become fast friends and have been spending time together in Dublin. They say they've received dozens of messages from people around the world who think they are twins.
"It's definitely not something we were trying to do," Branigan said. "But it is quite funny how life works out like that sometimes."
