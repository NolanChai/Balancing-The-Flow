 zone.
Manchester United v Liverpool:
This could be a match of huge significance at both ends of the table. United have struggled against the top teams this season, but they will feel confident after their win over Chelsea last time out. They need to find some consistency and get back to winning ways if they are to challenge for the title. Liverpool are in decent form and could move into second with a win, but they have struggled on their travels this season and it is hard to see them taking anything away from Old Trafford.
Arsenal v West Ham:
Arsenal’s home form has been excellent this season and they will be confident of getting a result against a West Ham side that have struggled on the road. The Hammers are in dire need of a win to get their own survival bid back on track, but Arsenal have shown no signs of slowing down. A comfortable home win looks likely.
Tottenham v Burnley:
Spurs have been one of the form teams in recent weeks and they will be looking to make it three wins on the bounce against a Burnley side that have struggled away from home. The Clarets are not safe yet, but they have picked up points in their last few games and will be looking to build on that momentum. A close match is likely here.
Everton v Leicester:
This could be a relegation six-pointer as both teams fight for survival. Everton have struggled at home this season, but they have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks and will be looking to build on their draw against Manchester City last time out. Leicester are in real danger of getting dragged into the relegation battle and a loss here could make things extremely difficult. A tight match is likely.
Chelsea v Southampton:
This is a big game for both teams as they look to move away from the relegation zone. Chelsea have been in poor form recently, but they are still well within touching distance of the top four and need to start picking up points again if they are to challenge for a Champions League spot. Southampton are in desperate need of a win and will be looking to take advantage of Chelsea’s struggles. A close match is likely, but Chelsea should just about have enough.
