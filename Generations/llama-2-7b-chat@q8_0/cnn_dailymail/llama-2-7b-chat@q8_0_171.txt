lette Spencer, 20, spoke of her shock and grief after her boyfriend Tom Aveyard, 20, died in the Alps plane tragedy on Monday.
Tom, a University of Manchester student from Hertfordshire, was killed when his plane crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. His girlfriend Paulette Spencer has spoken out about his death and revealed he had switched flights at the last moment. She said she did not blame co-pilot Remi Emie for the crash as he 'probably did everything he could to save the plane'
Paulette, who met Tom through mutual friends, said: 'Tom was a kind and loving person. He had such a bright future ahead of him, but it's all been taken away from him. I don't blame Remi at all. He probably did everything he could to save the plane.'
Tom had switched flights at the last moment because he wanted to surprise his family with an early Christmas present - a holiday in France. Paulette added: 'He was so excited about going on this trip and he was really looking forward to surprising his family. He changed his flight at the last minute, which is why he was on that particular plane.'
Paulette said she and Tom had been together for two years and were 'perfectly happy' before he died. She added: 'He was always smiling and made everyone around him feel happy too. He was a lovely boy and I am so lucky to have known him.'
Tom was one of 150 people who died in the plane crash on Monday, when the Airbus A320 jet crashed into a mountain while flying from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. The cause of the crash is still unknown but it is believed to be due to a loss of cabin pressure.
Paulette's words of tribute come as grieving families and friends of the victims gather in France for a memorial service today. The service will be held in the town of Chambery, where many of the victims were from, before a procession to the site of the crash.
