 in a race around the North Shore.
The 'boats' were made from recycled household items, including old doors, mattresses, and even a child's pram.
One of the boats was spotted near Takapuna beach, where it was seen drifting towards the shore before being pulled back out to sea by a strong current.
Another 'boat' was seen off Shelly Beach, but luckily no one was on board when it capsized.
Coastguards say the incident highlights the dangers of taking part in such races and urge people to think twice before attempting something so reckless.
"It's extremely dangerous and could have ended in tragedy," said coastguard spokesman Phil Houghton. "We would like to remind people that these objects are not designed for sailing and can easily be swept out to sea, causing serious injury or even death."
The race, which is believed to have started at the popular North Shore beach of Milford Beach, has sparked concern among locals and authorities alike.
"We urge people to stay safe and avoid taking part in such dangerous activities," said Auckland Mayor Phil Goff. "We will be working with coastguards and other agencies to ensure that these kinds of races do not happen again."
The incident has left many people scratching their heads, wondering how on earth someone could come up with the idea of making a boat out of household items in the first place.
But for those involved, it's clear that the thrill of racing and the challenge of creating something from nothing was just too hard to resist.
And as for the coastguards, they have their work cut out for them, trying to keep these makeshift boats at bay and prevent any more accidents from happening.
