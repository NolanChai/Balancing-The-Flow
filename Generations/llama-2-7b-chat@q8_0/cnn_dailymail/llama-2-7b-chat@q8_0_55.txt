seen alive on May 10, 2005. Her disappearance led to a search of the area and police believed at the time that she had left voluntarily. However, her family always maintained they suspected foul play and now detectives from Cambridgeshire Police have launched a fresh investigation. Detective Superintendent Lewis Harling said: "The investigation into Deborah Steel's disappearance is being re-examined with new forensic technology and we are working to establish the full circumstances of her vanishing. We are appealing for anyone who may have information about what happened to Deborah 17 years ago, or since then, to come forward." The pub where Deborah Steel last worked has now been demolished, but a new patio area was discovered during excavation works in the garden of an adjoining property. The area is being examined by forensic experts and detectives are studying any possible links with the case. Detective Harling added: "We understand that this investigation may bring up difficult memories for Deborah's family and the local community, but we hope they will be reassured that we are doing everything in our power to get justice for Deborah." Deborah Steel's husband, Ian, has been keeping her memory alive through a Facebook group, with updates on the investigation. He said: "I can't believe it's been 17 years since she disappeared. It feels like just yesterday. I'm glad the police are taking this fresh look at the case and I hope they find out what happened to Deborah."
