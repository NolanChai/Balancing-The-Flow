 Ugh, I swear... if he screwed with the sign again, I'm gonna kill him. I really am. This is not fucking funny, man. What if people see that and think it's real? They might call the cops on us! 
 
 Wait a minute. How did this happen in the first place? Did someone *else* screw with the sign? Like, one of my neighbors or somethin'? And if so, how the fuck did they get in here? I didn't let anyone in last night! 
 
 Fuck this. I gotta figure this out before it gets worse. Maybe if I just... *fuck*, I don't know, maybe I can just... *fuck*.
