 back onto himself, and rolled over onto his side. It was 6:31 A.M. As he laid there, he thought about how much he hated mornings. Just as he closed his eyes to try and drift back into a peaceful sleep, his cat started meowing loudly at the doorway of his room. 
"Ugh," John said aloud, rubbing his face with his hands. "Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?"
"Meow," the cat responded from the other side of the door.
John groaned and got out of bed, walking over to the doorway to open it for the cat.  As soon as he did, a ball of fluff with bright green eyes darted inside and leapt up onto his lap. The cat began kneading the blanket and purring loudly into John's face.
"You know, if you weren't so annoying, I might actually like mornings," John said to the cat, scratching behind its ears. 
He got out of bed and began getting ready for work, still petting his cat as he went about his morning routine. Once he was dressed and ready, he sat down on the couch in the living room and took a bite of breakfast. As he chewed, he noticed something strange - a girl with bright blue hair was standing in front of him, holding a small bag of groceries.
"Uh, hi," John said, setting his breakfast down on the coffee table. "How did you get in here?"
Sarah smiled and held out her hand for John to shake. "I just walked through the door," she said.
