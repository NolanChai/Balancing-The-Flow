y? Is he trying to get himself killed or something?
 
 Oh, I see. He's just joking around. Well, good for him. I guess I could use a little bit of that in my life right now. It's not every day you get to hear someone threatening to kick your ass and then proceed to do it with a smile on their face.
 
So, how does he do it? How does he manage to be so confident and cocky all the time without coming across as arrogant or obnoxious? It's definitely not an easy feat, but he seems to have mastered it effortlessly. Maybe it's just his personality, maybe it's because he knows he's good at what he does, or maybe it's a combination of both. Whatever the reason may be, I can certainly learn a thing or two from him. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll be able to pull off some trash talking of my own without sounding like a complete and total idiot. A guy can dream, right?
