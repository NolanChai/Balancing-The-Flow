into his spellbook. It was exhausting work, but he knew it was worth it in order to master a certain particularly tricky cantrip.
Nate leaned back on his hands, feeling a bit lightheaded as he tried to catch his breath. As the centuries had passed, he had managed to accumulate an impressive array of spells and incantations, each one more complex than the last. But this particular spell, a cantrip really, had proven to be particularly challenging for him. It required such precise timing, and a deep understanding of the underlying magic that Nate was certain he was never going to get it right.
Nate closed his eyes, letting out a shaky breath as he tried to clear his head. His body felt drained, but he knew he couldn't afford to rest just yet. He had a spell to cast, and time was running out. Nate opened his eyes, focusing on the glowing symbols in front of him, as he began to chant once more.
