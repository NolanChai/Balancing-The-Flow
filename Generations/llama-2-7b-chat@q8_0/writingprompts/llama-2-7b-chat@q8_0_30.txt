 "Oh boy, here we go," I sighed, bracing myself for the long rant to come. ''Jar-Jar Binks is not a Sith Lord, Cody. He's just a clumsy and awkward Gungan who got caught up in a war he didn't understand." 
Cody shook his head, undeterred. "Nah, you don't know the real Jar-Jar. He's been manipulating everything from behind the scenes for years. He's the one who convinced Palpatine to turn to the dark side, and he's been pulling the strings on every major event in the galaxy since then." 
I raised an eyebrow at him. "Are you serious? That's your fan theory? You think Jar-Jar Binks is secretly controlling everything in Star Wars?" 
Cody nodded vigorously, his eyes never leaving mine. "I'm telling you, it's true. He's been manipulating everyone from Qui-Gon Jinn to Anakin Skywalker himself. He's the real power behind the throne, and he's been waiting for the perfect moment to strike." 
I shook my head, unable to keep a smile off my face. "Cody, you can't be serious about this. Jar-Jar Binks is a comedic relief character in the movies. He's not some kind of intergalactic overlord." 
Cody scowled at me. "You just don't see it, do you? He's been subtly manipulating everyone around him for years, and no one has caught on. But I have. And once people realize the truth, everything will change." 
I chuckled to myself as Cody stormed off, muttering about "the real Jar-Jar" and "the manipulation of the century". It was moments like these that reminded me why I loved being a Star Wars fan. The creativity and passion of the fandom knew no bounds, and sometimes that led to some truly entertaining discussions. And who knows? Maybe one day, someone will prove Cody's theory right. But until then, I was content to enjoy my Gungan friend in all his goofy, bumbling glory.
