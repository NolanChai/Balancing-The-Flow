illy-nilly in the breeze. My eyes adjusted to the bright light outside and I saw movement at the window. A bird! A little finch, perched on a branch that grazed the sill. It looked so small against the big blue sky.
I tumbled out of bed, my blanket dragging behind me like an inert tail, and stomped to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face. Afterward, I ambled into the kitchen to find my mom already up and at 'em, hard at work making breakfast. I poured myself a bowl of cereal from the box on the counter, took a seat at the table next to my brother who was devouring his eggs and bacon like they were going out of style. 
My mom set down a plate in front of me with a steaming plate of pancakes. I could smell the sweet syrup and fluffy batter wafting up from the porcelain dish. My stomach growled at the sight and I eagerly dug in, feeling my tiredness melt away as I shoveled bite after bite into my mouth. It was breakfast perfection.
As we ate, the bird outside continued to flit and flutter around the branch, occasionally chirping its morning song. The sun climbed higher in the sky and the room grew brighter still. It was a beautiful summer day, full of promise and possibility. And at that moment, sitting in my kitchen with my family, I knew that no matter what lay ahead, it would be okay. Breakfast is always a great start to any day!
