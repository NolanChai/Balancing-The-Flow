ed and there were no other places to stay. I called around and eventually found a small cabin in the woods that would allow me to park my RV overnight.
As I pulled into the driveway, I noticed an elderly man sitting on the porch watching me. He waved at me as I got out of my car and approached him.
"Welcome to my humble abode," he said with a warm smile. "I'm Edgar, the owner of this cabin."
"Thanks for having me," I replied as I handed him my ID. "I'm just passing through on my way to California. Unfortunately, the mountain passes are closed due to weather and I need a place to stay overnight."
Edgar nodded and invited me inside. The cabin was small but cozy. There was a living room with a fireplace, a kitchenette with a microwave and stove, and one bedroom with a queen-sized bed. It wasn't fancy, but it would do for the night.
"I'll take good care of you," Edgar said as he showed me around the cabin. "You can park your RV in the backyard, and there's a bathroom behind the cabin if you need it."
I thanked him again and settled into my temporary home for the night. Edgar told me stories about his life and the history of the area while I cooked myself a simple dinner in the kitchenette. It was a nice change of pace from the fast food and roadside diners I had been eating at on my trip.
As I drifted off to sleep, I heard strange noises outside. At first, I thought it might be Edgar going about his nightly routine, but then I heard footsteps crunching through the underbrush. My heart raced as I wondered if someone was sneaking up on me.
Suddenly, a figure appeared in the window of my bedroom door. I froze in fear and terror as the figure approached me. Then, just as quickly, it vanished into thin air. I rubbed my eyes, thinking that maybe I had just been seeing things from exhaustion. But then I heard the footsteps again, closer this time.
My heart racing, I grabbed a nearby baseball bat and cautiously made my way to the front door. Whoever was outside seemed to be waiting for me, lurking in the shadows. I slowly opened the door and called out into the darkness.
"Is anyone there?" I demanded. "Show yourself!"
There was no response. But then, as suddenly as it had started, everything went quiet again. The footsteps stopped, and all was still once more.
I stood there for a few moments, wondering if what had just happened was real or just my imagination playing tricks on me. But deep down, I knew what I had heard and seen. And I knew that I wasn't alone in this cabin.
