m from the passenger seat. The driver grinned at him as he opened the side of the truck and passed out a length of 2x6 lumber.
"Thanks, buddy," Dexter said, taking the wood with a smile. "I'll get this load delivered before nightfall."
The truck pulled away, leaving Dexter standing in his driveway, holding the piece of lumber like a trophy. He watched it go, feeling a sense of satisfaction at a job well done. But as he turned to walk back inside, he noticed something that made him frown: a faint trace of blood on the end of the board.
Dexter's eyes narrowed as he examined the wood more closely. The blood was faint, but unmistakable. It had not come from any of his own cuts or scrapes, he knew that much. He looked around, wondering if someone else had been nearby when the log truck passed through. But the street was empty and quiet, save for a distant police siren wailing in the distance.
Dexter's frown deepened as he tried to make sense of what he was seeing. He was no stranger to blood, having spent years working as a blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro PD. But this was different. This was not the kind of blood that came from a cut or scrape, but rather something more ominous. Something that suggested someone had been injured...or worse.
He looked down at the board again, his mind racing with possibilities. Had someone been attacked on the street? Was there an assailant loose in this quiet neighborhood? And if so, what could they be after?
Dexter took a deep breath and turned to go back inside, his heart racing with excitement. He knew he had to investigate further, to find out who was behind this mysterious bloodstain and uncover whatever dark secrets lay hidden in the shadows of his quiet suburban street.
