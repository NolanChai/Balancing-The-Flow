 a VHS player! As if they needed to watch that on a screen so small it was practically invisible from 10 feet away.
I looked around me and thought: "What are we doing? What's the point of all this?!" I felt like a voyeur, watching strangers in their most intimate moments - or, at least, as intimate as they can get with a screen in front of them. It was like everyone had gathered for some sort of bizarre ritual, one that I didn't understand and couldn't participate in.
And yet...I couldn't help but be fascinated. The way people were typing away on their phones, their thumbs moving furiously as they scrolled through endless streams of content. The way they gazed into the screens, their eyes glazed over as they consumed whatever it was they were consuming. It was like they were in a trance, or under some sort of spell.
I felt like I was witnessing some kind of secret society ritual - one that I wasn't allowed to join, no matter how hard I tried. And so, I stood there and watched, feeling both excluded and intrigued at the same time.
