 same but completely different than before. I 've been trying to find a way back ever since.
There are so many strange things about this world that I can't even begin to explain them all. People here don't seem to age, and they all just stay young and beautiful forever. And instead of money, people trade in time. Yes, you heard me right; time is the currency here! It's like something straight out of a science fiction novel.
But what really gets my attention are the creatures that roam this world. They come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny to the enormous, and they all seem to coexist peacefully here. There are giant birds that fly around with no fear of anything, and even bigger beasts that walk on two legs like humans do. And don't even get me started on the sea creatures! They have these magnificent beings that can change shape at will, and they seem to have a collective consciousness or something. It's all so mind-boggling!
Despite how strange this world is, I 've grown accustomed to it over time. I've found a small community of people who share my desire to return home, and we've been trying to find a way back ever since. But it hasn't been easy; there are so many obstacles in our path, from hostile creatures to treacherous terrain. And sometimes, I get the feeling that we might never make it home...
But I won't give up hope. There must be a way back to my own world, and I will keep searching until I find it. Because no matter how strange this place is, it's still better than being trapped here forever!
