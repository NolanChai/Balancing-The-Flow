ly brow. "It was a summer day. The sky was blue and bright. Do you recall it? We were sitting right here, on these very benches..."  
The girl blinked, and for a moment, she saw it too: The two of them on the same bench, underneath the same yellow light. A young boy and girl, with their heads tilted to one another as they whispered secrets into the night sky.  But then her eyes snapped back to reality, and the image shattered like a mirror dropped on concrete.  
She shook her head, clearing it of cobwebs, even though he couldn't see her. "No...I don't recall that," she said, her voice soft as a sigh. 
The boy frowned, his eyes searching hers for signs of truth. But the girl was lost in thought again, stuck on memories that weren't quite there.  
"It doesn't matter," he said after a moment, breaking the silence. "I remember it. And that's all that matters."  The girl nodded, feeling the weight of his words like a gentle breeze. They sat in silence for a while longer, watching the city lights blink on and off, their reflections dancing across the yellow ceiling. 
Eventually, they would have to go inside, back to their separate lives. But for now, they lingered here, caught in this moment of quiet reflection, the night's soft glow their only companion.
