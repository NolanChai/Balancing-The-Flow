...
Since I was 15, silence has been my constant companion. No one can tell me why my hearing mysteriously disappeared 10 years ago. I've been poked and prodded by a thousand different doctors all over the world, but no one has been able to help me. It's like I'm living in a world that's completely deaf to sound.
But that's not the only thing that's strange about my life. I have this ability called "echo-location." It's like a special radar system inside of me that lets me sense the world around me through vibrations and noises. It's how I navigate through every day, even though I can't hear anything.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. Sometimes I wish I could just turn it off and be like everyone else, but it's a part of who I am now. And honestly, I don't know how I would survive without it.
