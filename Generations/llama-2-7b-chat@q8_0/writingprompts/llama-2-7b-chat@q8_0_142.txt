ighed* Okay, let me just take a closer look... *Takes a step forward and looks around* Um... is this...?

You find yourself standing in front of an old, run-down shack. The walls are covered with vines and moss, and the door is hanging off its hinges. A small sign next to the door reads: "Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here". 

What do you want to do?

A) Knock on the door and see if anyone answers
B) Try to open the door and see what's inside
C) Go around back and look for another way in
D) Leave and go find a different place to explore
E) Other (please specify in comments)
