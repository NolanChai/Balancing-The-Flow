 first day are nervously asking around for theirs. I gave her the stapler with a smile and walked away, feeling proud of myself for being so helpful. Delia smiled back at me and said thank you. My work here is done! 😅
But little did I know... The next day when I went to the kitchen for my morning coffee, Delia was already there, sitting at her desk with a huge stack of papers and a determined look on her face. As I approached her she looked up and said "Hey, can you help me with these staples? I've been trying to figure out how this thing works for hours but I can't seem to get the hang of it!" 🙃
I couldn't believe my eyes! What happened to being the designated stapler?! Did she forget her job already?! 🤷‍♀️ I chuckled and walked over to help her, feeling a little embarrassed for underestimating her. As it turned out, Delia was more than capable of handling any task that came her way, including the stapler. And from that day forward she became known as our department's go-to problem solver! 💪🏼 #workplacehumor #newemployee #staplerprobs``.
