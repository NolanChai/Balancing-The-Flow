oyed by his recent victory to be bothered by Sir's reluctance. ``.::You just gotta feel the flow, my slimy friend!::. Once you get into the groove of things, it'll all make sense, trust me!'' 
Sir looked at Captain Ook with a mixture of confusion and disgust. "Groove? Flow? You expect me to just... meld with these foreign appendages like they are some sort of cosmic dance partner?"
Captain Ook chuckled, a sound that was almost like the sliming of a wet spoon on a countertop. "Oh, no, no, my dear Sir! It's not quite so... um... intuitive. See, you must first... *hiccup*... find the proper way to... *giggle*... connect with your new limbs. And once you do, it will be like... *burp*... a beautiful symphony of squishiness!''
Sir was horrified. "A symphony of squishiness? Are you quite mad?! I'm a dignified being, not some sort of... of... slimy amoeba!!"
Captain Ook laughed again, his laughter causing a cloud of slime to erupt from his mouth. "Oh, Sir! *hiccup* You are such a... *giggle*... uptight creature! *burp* Just relax and let the... *slime*... flow through you. It'll be... *belch*... quite the... *hiccup*... experience, I assure you!''
Sir was at a loss for words as he stared at Captain Ook in disgust. How could this other slime be so nonchalant about his... his... transformation? It was almost as if he were enjoying it! Sir's mind raced with thoughts of escape, but he knew that attempting to flee would only result in more agony. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, trying to focus on the sound of Captain Ook's laughter. Maybe if he listened hard enough, he could will himself back to his own world.
