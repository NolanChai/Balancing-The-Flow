 little, and gave a slow blink.
I tried to ignore it, but couldn't. The thing was impossible – a creature from a nightmare, a monster that didn't belong in this world. It belonged in some dark, damp place, where the light of day never reached. And yet here it was, right outside my front door.
I tried to tell myself it was just a statue, a prank or a hallucination, but I knew better. This thing was real, and it had been watching me for weeks now. I could feel its eyes on me whenever I left the house, following me everywhere I went like some kind of creepy stalker.
I tried to avoid it, but that was impossible too. The statue seemed to be always there, waiting for me, those black eyes boring into my soul like some kind of malevolent spirit. I couldn't escape its gaze, no matter how hard I tried.
And now I had a feeling, a sickening sense of dread that something was going to happen – something bad. The statue seemed to be pulsing with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel it reaching out to me like a cold, dead hand.
I knew I had to get rid of it, but how? It was huge, heavier than anything I could move on my own. And besides, where would I even start looking for someone who could help me?
The statue seemed to be laughing at me, those black eyes glinting with some kind of twisted amusement as it waited for whatever was going to happen next.
And then, without warning, the thing moved – just a little, but enough to make my blood run cold. It shifted position again, and this time I saw something that made me want to scream.
A small, almost imperceptible smile played on those black lips, and for a moment I thought I saw something else in those eyes – something human, something that seemed almost... alive.
No – no, I told myself, shaking my head as if to clear it. It's just a statue, nothing more. Just a stupid, creepy statue that's been left here for some reason, and now you're letting your imagination get the better of you.
But even as I tried to convince myself of that, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me – something that wasn't quite human, something that waited just beyond the edge of my perception.
