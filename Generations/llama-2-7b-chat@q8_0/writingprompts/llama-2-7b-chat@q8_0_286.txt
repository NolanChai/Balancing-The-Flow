go to inflate with an audience.
As I sit here, a part of me scoffs at this scene unfolding before me. It's just another day in a world where hate has been given too much credence, where peace and love have been reduced to hollow gestures, where the value of human life is measured by the caliber of weaponry one possesses.
The truth is I am as guilty as the next person when it comes to perpetuating this cycle of violence. I've taken the easy road, contenting myself with words rather than action. I've let fear dictate my choices, and allowed hatred to fester in my heart instead of confronting it head-on.
But something about the sight before me has shaken me loose from this complacency. The sheer audacity of the attack, the brutality of the act, has made me realize that I cannot continue to stand idly by and watch as humanity descends into chaos.
So I take a deep breath, wipe away my tears, and begin to recite a poem that I have written in the hope that it might inspire others to take action, to resist the forces of hate and violence, and instead choose love and compassion:
"In this world we find ourselves, torn apart by strife,
Where anger breeds fear, and hate becomes our life.
But we are not bound by fate, nor limited by time,
For we have the power to change, to rearrange the rhyme.
We can choose a different path, one that's not of hate,
But of love and kindness, of compassion and empathy elate.
It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but it will be worth the fight,
For in this world we see, there is no greater light than the spark of hope in the darkest night."
