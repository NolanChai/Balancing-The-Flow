, to being treated as less than human.
They took our ancestors and sold them like they were objects. They made us forget our heritage, our culture, our language. And now we're paying for it with a legacy of trauma that has been passed down through generations.
The pain is real and it still lingers in the air. The wounds are deep and they still bleed. We have to acknowledge this history if we want to move forward. If we want to heal as a society.
We have to confront the past, face the truth and take responsibility for our actions. We have to make amends for what was done in the name of profit and power. And we have to do it now before it's too late.
We can't just say sorry and move on, because sorry doesn't cut it anymore. It's time for action. It's time to make things right. It's time to heal the wounds of slavery.
We have to work together, as a society, to address the systemic inequalities that still exist today. We have to dismantle the systems that perpetuate racism and discrimination. And we have to do it with love and compassion because that's what healing is all about.
So let us start this journey together, with empathy, humility, and a commitment to justice. Let us work towards a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their race or ethnicity. And let us never forget the lessons of history so that we can create a better world for ourselves and for generations to come." #HealingTheWoundsOfSlavery
