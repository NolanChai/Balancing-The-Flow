 bright red flames that lit up the night, and the cries of agony echoed through the dark. The ships were battered to splinters on the rocky shores and sunk into the depths of the sea. The gods rained down their fury upon Troy, and the once-mighty city lay in ruin. 

But one last hope remained for the Trojans. A young prince named Paris had not given up, even as his people were being destroyed before his very eyes. He had a secret weapon - a magical bow that could shoot arrows that would never miss their mark. With this weapon in his hand, he vowed to take revenge on the Greeks who had brought so much destruction upon his city. 
 Paris stood on the battlements of Troy, looking out at the Greek army below. He sighted his arrow on a tall ship that was leading the attack, and slowly drew back the string. The arrow flew through the air, straight and true, and struck the mast of the ship with deadly force. It crashed through the deck and killed every man on board in a single instant. 
The Greeks were shocked and confused by the sudden loss of so many soldiers. But Paris was not finished yet. He continued to rain down his arrows upon them, striking fear into the hearts of all who saw him. The Greeks tried to retreat, but it was too late. Their ship was sunk beneath them, and they were trapped in the water as the Trojans closed in for the kill. 
As the last Greek warrior disappeared under the waves, Troy stood victorious once more. Paris had saved his city from destruction, and he had proven himself to be a true hero in the face of overwhelming odds. The gods looked down upon him with pride, knowing that they had found a worthy successor to their throne.
