Though Moira slept far from her master's eye in the Arcanum Tower, he was always watching her.
"She is a weapon," he whispered to himself as he leaned against the cool stone wall of the tower's interior. "And like any weapon, she must be cared for with great vigilance and control."
Do you ever feel like you are being watched? Moira thought to herself as she drifted off to sleep, her mind still racing from the events of the day. But she knew that was just her imagination running wild. Her master would never allow anyone else to watch her, not even those he trusted most.
Moira had always been a weapon, ever since she was born. Her master had chosen her for this purpose, and he had trained her well. She was faster, stronger, and more agile than any other person in the kingdom. And yet, despite all of these things, Moira felt like there was something missing in her life.
As she slept, her mind began to wander through memories of the past, searching for answers to the questions that plagued her. She remembered the day her master had brought her to this tower, and how he had told her that she would be his greatest weapon yet. She recalled the countless training sessions they had shared together, the endless drills and sparring matches. But there was something else, something deeper, that lingered in the back of her mind.
And so Moira continued to search for the answers she sought, even as sleep claimed her once more. For though her master may have been watching her from afar, she knew that she would always be searching for the truth about herself and her purpose in life.
