 before. 
The world had been destroyed in a blaze of glory, but it was also reborn from the ashes. There were no countries, no borders, no governments. Just people, living, loving and laughing together in a state of universal bliss. 
 No one remembered their names, or where they came from. They just knew that they had been given this precious gift of life, and they wanted to cherish it to the fullest. 
And so, they lived. For eternity. In perfect harmony with each other, and with the world around them.
