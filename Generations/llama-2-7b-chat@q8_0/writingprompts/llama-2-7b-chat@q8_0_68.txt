ether, a bridge between two worlds.
In this city, they're feared and respected, both at once. They patrol the streets with an iron fist, keeping the peace in a world that never stops tearing itself apart. It's not easy being Unleashed when you were born to be controlled, when freedom is a curse and chaos is a blessing. But they wouldn't have it any other way. They are unleashed, free to roam the city as they please, to bend reality to their will.
They are the law here, the protectors of this twisted utopia, where flesh is currency and souls are fuel for the machines. They keep the peace among the endless factions that vie for power, each one more dangerous than the last.
They are Unleashed, the last hope for a world gone mad. And they will fight to the death to keep it that way.
