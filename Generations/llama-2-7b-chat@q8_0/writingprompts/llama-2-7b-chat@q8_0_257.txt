10k is a lot, but it's doable.
I remember the moment I reached -5,000 karma. I was so proud of myself. I had worked hard to build up that positive reputation, and I felt like I deserved it. But then something happened. Someone left a negative comment on one of my posts, and it set off a chain reaction of downvotes. Suddenly, my karma score plummeted. -5,000 became -10,000 in the blink of an eye.
It was a hard lesson to learn, but I realized that one mistake can quickly ruin all your progress. I had to start over from scratch, building up my karma score again. It wasn't easy, but I refused to give up. I kept sharing valuable content and engaging with the community.
And then it happened. After months of hard work, I reached -10,000 karma once again. This time, it felt different. I had earned it through my own efforts, rather than relying on luck or chance. I knew that I could maintain this level of negativity and still be a valuable member of the community.
Of course, there are downsides to having a negative karma score. Some people may be hesitant to engage with me, or they may not take my opinions seriously. But I've learned to embrace these challenges as well. By being open and honest about my perspective, I can build stronger relationships with those who share my viewpoints and gain the respect of those who don't.
In conclusion, having a negative karma score on Reddit is not something to be ashamed of. It takes courage to speak your mind and stand up for what you believe in, even if it goes against the status quo. By being authentic and persistent, I've learned to turn -10,000 karma into a badge of honor.
