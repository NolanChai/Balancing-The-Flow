 had fought a war that would never truly end, and now they lay here, two armies fallen, victims of the conflict that tore their world apart.
He knew he could not stay here, even if he wanted to. For though it was peaceful, it was also a trap; those who lingered too long in this place would be lost forever, consumed by the very war they had fought against. And so, with a heavy heart, he stood and began his journey back to the world of the living.
He walked through the empty fields, the sound of his footsteps echoing off the stones of the graveyard. He passed by the rows of headstones, each one marking the grave of a fallen immortal. And as he walked, the weight of his memories grew heavier, until it felt like a boulder pressing down upon him.
But still he moved forward, driven by a determination to rejoin his comrades and fight on. For though the war was over, there were still battles to be fought, and victories to be won. And so he walked, into the darkness of the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
