    Gront looked at Slog incredulously. "Are you serious? This is an epic item, man! It's got like, infinite charisma or something!"

Slog scowled. "Yeah, well, I don't need no stinkin' ring to be charming. I've got my own natural charm."
Gront rolled his eyes. "Sure you do, Slog. That's why you're always getting into fights and trouble."

Slog snorted. "Hey, I may not have your fancy ring, but at least I don't go around talking like a bunch of nonsense all the time!"
Gront sighed. "Fine, be that way. But mark my words, Slog, one day you'll be begging me to take this ring off your finger."

Slog crossed his arms and scowled. "I'd rather die than beg you for anything, Grunt!"
Gront shrugged and put the ring back in his inventory. " Suit yourself."
