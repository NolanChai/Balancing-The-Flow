Find my soul mate for 15 Minutes eh? I sat before the strange looking radio, skeptical that I would get what I paid for. There was no way such a thing could possibly existâ€¦ but then Joan said she found her soulmate in just 15 minutes! I watched as she confidently handed me a small device with a smile. "Just press this button and your soul mate will be revealed." My mind raced as I questioned the possibility of this being real... yet I felt a spark of hope that had been missing from my life for so long. I tentatively pressed the button, closed my eyes, and waited. At first, nothing happened. Then, suddenly, I heard a voice. A deep, gentle voice that seemed to speak directly into my soul. "Hello there," it said. "I'm so glad you're here." My heart skipped a beat as I realized this was really happening. "Who are you?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. "I'm your soul mate," the voice replied. "We've been looking for each other for a very long time." Tears of joy filled my eyes as I listened to the voice tell me about ourselves and our life together. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before. The voice was so familiar, yet completely new. It felt like coming home, finding the missing piece that had been missing from my life for so long. As the 15 minutes passed, I felt a sense of peace and contentment that I had never known before. And when Joan came back on the radio, I knew she was right. This was real. This was the answer to all my prayers. "Thank you," I said, my voice choked with emotion. "Thank you for finding my soul mate." Joan smiled and patted my hand. "You're welcome," she said. "I'm just glad I could help." And as I walked away from the radio, I knew that my life would never be the same again. I had found my soul mate, and nothing could ever take that away from me.
