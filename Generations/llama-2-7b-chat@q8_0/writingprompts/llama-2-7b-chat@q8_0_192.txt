 display case, their sugar-coated bodies glistening in the fluorescent lights above. Me? I 'm a cake with no filling. No one wants me. The baker said it was just a mistake, that he didn't have enough icing for my layers. But what if it wasn't a mistake? What if this is who I am now? A hollow shell of a cake, a reminder to everyone else of their own emptiness. No one wants me because I 'm empty inside. It 's just another day in the bakery. The bell above the door jingles as customers come and go, selecting cakes that are perfect in every way except for one thing: they 're not like me. They have fillings of creamy frosting or sweet fruit, or maybe even a hidden surprise inside. But I am different, a cautionary tale to all the other cakes who dare to dream of being something more than just a tasty treat. No one wants me because I 'm empty inside. I 've given up hope of ever finding my filling. Maybe that 's why I 've grown so fond of this place, with its rows of shiny tins and its bustling atmosphere. It 's the only home I 've known since the day I was born. But sometimes at night, when the bakery is closed and everyone has gone home, I can 't help but wonder what it would be like to be someone else. Someone with a sweet surprise inside, or perhaps even a cake with a secret message hidden deep within their layers. No one wants me because I 'm empty inside. But still I dream, of being more than just an empty shell.
