 any other letter of the alphabet.
The first topic of discussion was the plural form of nouns. Mrs. Petrie wrote on the board: "cat cat cats". My eyes widened in disbelief as I stared at her, trying to comprehend why she would use such an obvious example. Didn't she know that most children already knew this?
The next topic was verb tenses. Mrs. Petrie drew a diagram on the board, explaining how to conjugate verbs into different times and moods: "walked", "walks", "will walk", "has walked". I felt my eyes glazing over as she droned on, struggling to keep up with her fast-paced explanations.
As the lesson progressed, Mrs. Petrie moved on to adjective phrases and clauses. My mind began to wander as she explained the difference between independent and dependent clauses, and I found myself thinking about my upcoming birthday party instead. Would I get a new bike? Could I invite Sarah over too?
As the bell rang signaling the end of class, I packed up my things feeling relieved that it was finally over. But as I walked out of the door, I couldn't shake off the feeling that today's lesson had been a complete waste of time. Why did Mrs. Petrie insist on teaching us things we already knew? Didn't she know that our time could be better spent learning new and exciting things?
As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder what other boring lessons lay ahead in the coming weeks. Would they all be as dull and uninteresting as today's had been?
