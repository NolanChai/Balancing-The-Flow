 Mark asked, rubbing at the sore spot on his neck where she had struck him with the chair leg. 'You could have killed me back there!' Mark's eyes narrowed into slits, and his lips twisted into a snarl of rage. 
Jessica smirked, her grin widening as she met Mark's gaze. 'Oh, come on! I didn't think you were serious,' she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. 'You're immortal, Mark. You can't die from a little thing like that.'
Mark glared at her, his eyes flashing with anger. `That's not the point!' he growled. `You could have seriously hurt me, Jess. Are you trying to get yourself killed? Or worse... are you trying to get me killed?' 
Jessica shrugged, her grin still in place. 'Hey, I was just messing with you, okay? Don't be such a drama queen.'
