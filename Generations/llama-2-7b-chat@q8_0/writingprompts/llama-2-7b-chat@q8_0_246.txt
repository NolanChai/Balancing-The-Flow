 of the completely white environment. The only thing that broke the symmetry was a small flower pot on top of the table. It had a single red rose in it, which seemed to glow like a flame in the otherwise monochromatic space. I felt like I was in a dream. A strange and unusual one.
"Hello?" I said, trying to break the silence. But there was no answer. The room was empty, except for me, the table, chair and the rose. It seemed as if I was alone in this white world.
I tried to stand up from my chair but my legs felt heavy and unresponsive. It was as if they were stuck in place, refusing to move. I struggled against them, trying to make them work, but it was no use. They just wouldn't budge.
Suddenly, a voice spoke behind me. "Welcome to the White Room," it said. I spun around, but there was nobody there. The voice seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It was soothing, yet unnerving.
"What do you want from me?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. But before I could get an answer, everything went white.
