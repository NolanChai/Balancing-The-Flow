igid air; an icy breath exhaled through clenched fangs in anticipation. The hunt began.
"Halt!" boomed a voice, both commanding and stern, echoing through the silent forest. The black warrior halted his advance, while the white warrior, with a swift turn of her head, spun on her heel to face the speaker. "Who dares challenge us?" she demanded, an eyebrow raised in defiance, her arm still poised for attack.
"I," replied the voice, low and melodious, but with an undercurrent of power that left no doubt as to its authority, "am the Keeper of this Woodland. And you, black warrior, are trespassing on sacred ground."
The black warrior shifted his weight, a frown deepening between his brows. "I came not to trespass," he replied, his voice measured and respectful, "but to prove my worth as a hunter, even here in the heart of the Woodland."
The Keeper's eyes narrowed, a hint of amusement in their depths. "Ah, you wish to test your mettle against the best of us," he said, his voice edging towards mockery. "Very well, come then. Let us see who is truly the greatest hunter here."
And with that, the two warriors charged at each other, their weapons flashing in the faint light as they clashed in a frenzy of blows and parries, their breath coming in ragged gasps as they fought for dominance. The cold mist swirled around them, muffling their cries of anger and triumph, but the Keeper watched with avid interest, his eyes gleaming with a distant, almost far-off light. For he knew that only one of these two warriors could emerge victorious, and claim the right to hunt in this most sacred of woods.
