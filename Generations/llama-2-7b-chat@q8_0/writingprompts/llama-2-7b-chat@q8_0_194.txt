attered with blood from some long-forgotten wound.
I stood there, my heart pounding in time with the cannonade, paralyzed by the horror of it all. This was what war had reduced him to – a mere corpse hanging from a splintered tree limb like some macabre crucifixion. His eyes seemed to plead for mercy but no sound came forth as if he were forever silenced by the violence that had claimed his life.
In the distance, I could hear the thunder of guns and the screams of the wounded mingling with the cacophony of war. It was a sound that would stay with me forever – a reminder of the brutal cost of conflict and the terrible toll it takes on human lives.
The sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow over the landscape as night began to fall. The cannonade slowed to a distant boom, then ceased altogether, leaving behind only the oppressive silence that seemed to cling to me like a shroud.
I stood there for what felt like hours, unable to move or speak, as if I were frozen in a nightmare from which I could not awaken. The weight of war bore down on me, crushing my spirit and filling me with a deep sense of loss and despair.
At last, I stirred and turned away from the sight of that poor soul hanging there, his eyes forever closed to the world. I knew I had to find my way back to camp, but I could not shake the image of him from my mind – that haunting reminder of what war truly was: a brutal, senseless slaughter of innocent lives.
