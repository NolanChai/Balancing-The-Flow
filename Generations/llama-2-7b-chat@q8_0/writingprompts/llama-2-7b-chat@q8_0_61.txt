irdryer and blonde wig but my hair was already perfectly styled. It's amazing what a good nights sleep can do for you.
 I looked in the mirror, noticing how old I looked today compared to yesterday when I got those wrinkles fixed by that plastic surgeon. My eyes are starting to droop and my face is losing its shape but it's all worth it when you see your bank account grow. 
I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down at the kitchen table. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled my nostrils and I couldn't help but take another sip. As I took the first sip, my phone beeped with an alert from Instagram.
It was a post from one of those "influencers" that I follow. A young woman who travels the world in style and takes photos of all the exotic locations she visits. She has over 1 million followers and makes a living off of sponsored posts. It's amazing what you can make money doing these days, even just taking pretty pictures on Instagram.
I took another sip of my coffee and scrolled through her post. She was in Bali right now, lounging on the beach with a coconut drink in hand. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy as I looked at her perfect tan and perfectly posed photos. 
I put down my phone and took another sip of coffee before standing up to get ready for work. The day was already starting off on the wrong foot, and it only got worse from there.
