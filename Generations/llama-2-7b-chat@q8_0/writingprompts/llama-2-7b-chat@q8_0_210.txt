 had happened.
"Joseph," I said softly, shaking my head in disbelief. "What have you gotten yourself into?"
It was hard to believe it had come to this. Just a few hours ago, Walker had been a successful businessman with a beautiful family and a nice house in the suburbs. And then, somehow, he had stumbled upon a mysterious artifact that had turned him into this...this thing.
I sighed, feeling a sense of responsibility for what had happened to him. I was the one who had discovered the artifact, after all – a strange, glowing crystal that seemed to have a life of its own. And now, it looked like I was going to be the one to put Walker out of his misery.
I reached down and grabbed the creature's limp body, lifting it up so that it hung upside-down from my hand. Its eyes were wide open, staring blankly into space, and its mouth was still working as if trying to speak or scream. I felt a wave of sadness wash over me, knowing that this was what remained of the man who had once been Joseph Walker.
"I'm sorry, Joe," I said softly, my voice barely above a whisper. "You didn't deserve to end up like this."
With a heavy heart, I raised the creature higher, and then brought it crashing down onto the hard concrete floor of my garage. There was a sickening crunch as its body split open, the life draining out of it in a pool of blood. And with that, it was over. Joseph Walker was gone, reduced to nothing more than a pile of bloody tissue and bones.
I felt a wave of relief wash over me, knowing that I had finally put an end to the creature's suffering. But at the same time, I couldn't shake off the feeling of sadness and loss that lingered inside of me. It was as if I had lost a piece of myself, a part of my humanity that I could never get back.
I sighed heavily, rubbing my temples as I tried to process everything that had happened. I knew that I would have to deal with the consequences of what I had done – the police would be questioning me soon enough, and I was pretty sure they wouldn't believe my story about how Walker had become a monster. But for now, all I could do was sit here in the silence of my garage, surrounded by the remnants of a man who had once been alive and full of potential.
As I sat there, lost in thought, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden in this strange world of ours. And I knew that I would be out there, searching for answers – no matter the cost.
