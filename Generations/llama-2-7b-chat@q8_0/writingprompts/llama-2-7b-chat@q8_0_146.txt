, they change the rules on me. Oh well, can't win 'em all, right? But seriously, folks, this is a life-changing amount of money! I mean, think about it – with $326 million, you could buy anything you want. Travel the world, own your own island, give away millions to charity...the possibilities are endless! 
 And the best part? It's all mine! Just me and my lucky ticket. No more financial worries for this guy – I can finally live the life I've always dreamed of. Thanks, Powerball! You've made one man very happy indeed. `);
