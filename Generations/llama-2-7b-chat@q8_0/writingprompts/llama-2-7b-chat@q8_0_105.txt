irarchy. Forsooth!
In battle, I roam the fields and skies, my raven wings spread wide, searching for worthy souls to escort to Asgard's gates. No female nor child doth I pass by, for they are the future's hope. My duty is clear, to aid in the next generation of warriors, of heroes and goddesses!
When the day of reckoning doth come, and the blood doth flow like the rivers of Niflheim, then will I claim my reward from Odin, and all of Asgard will know Hilda as a true guardian and gatekeeper of Valhalla. Skalds sing my praise! 
Thus ends my tale. The rest is but a blur of battle, blood, and glory!"
