2 weeks later you'd hear back. Now its more like a month or two just to get an interview. And after the interview, another week or two before even getting a call back. Then there's the matter of the pay. Its like they expect us all to work for peanuts these days. I swear if something doesn't change soon i don't know how people will survive.
This economy is shit. I thought things would get better with time. Nothing has changed. If anything, it seems that it's harder these days to get a job. It used to be that you'd send an application and 2 weeks later you'd hear back. Now it's more like a month or two just to get an interview. And after the interview, another week or two before even getting a call back. Then there's the matter of the pay. It's like they expect us all to work for peanuts these days. I swear if something doesn't change soon I don't know how people will survive.
