 don't you?'' he said gruffly. ''You would defy me for him?  
She nodded bravely. 
 
 ''Yes father, I do. I will not be separated from him. He is my one true love and I will fight to keep him by my side.'' 
 The King's expression softened and he sighed heavily. He had never wanted his daughter to be unhappy but he could see that she was determined in her choice. So he spoke again, this time with a gentler tone.  
 
 ''Very well then, my child. You may keep your stableboy, but know this: you must always remember your place and the duties that come with being a princess. Do you understand?'' 
 She nodded once more, her eyes shining with pride and determination. The King smiled and reached out to pat her hand gently. ''I am proud of you, my dear. You have proven yourself to be a true princess of the realm.'' And with that he turned and left the room, leaving the princess to her happiness.
