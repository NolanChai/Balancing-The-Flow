20 percent of the energy expended on maintenance and only 10 per cent is used for repairing damage while 70 percent goes toward growth, reproduction, metabolism, and maintenance.
Humans' high intelligence allows them to develop sophisticated technologies that enable them to build thriving civilizations in the natural world. The ability to use language, think creatively, and adapt to new circumstances is a key factor in their success.
Yet, despite their many achievements, humans have a significant impact on the natural environment. Their urbanization, resource extraction, pollution, and climate change all threaten the survival of countless species. As such, it is essential for humans to develop sustainable practices that protect the environment while still allowing them to thrive as a society.
In conclusion, humans are the most successful species in the natural world due to their high intelligence, adaptability, and ability to build complex societies. However, they must be aware of the impact their actions have on the natural environment and strive to develop sustainable practices that will allow them to thrive while also protecting the planet's biodiversity.
