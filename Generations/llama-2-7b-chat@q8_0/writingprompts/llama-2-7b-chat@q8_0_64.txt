uuut. There are just so many unwritten rules that seem arbitrary or contradictory (besides, haven't all the good men been taken?). I don't have close friends to set me up with their friends, and my family thinks I should "just get over it" already.
I'm starting to feel like a failure as a person because of this, even though logically I know that there are plenty of people out there who are compatible with me, and I just need to find them. But when you're constantly reminded of your singleness (through constant social pressure, commercials and media portrayals of happy couples, etc) it can be hard to shake the feeling that something is wrong with you, or that you'll never find anyone.
Do you have any advice on how to deal with these feelings? Or has anyone else out there been in a similar situation?  Thanks!
