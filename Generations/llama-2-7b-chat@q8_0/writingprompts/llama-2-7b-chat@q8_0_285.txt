47 years ago this very day. My eyes well up with a tear, as they do every year when I come here to visit her gravesite, but I quickly wipe it away, not wanting to give myself away in front of the other visitors and tourists who come to pay their respects at Arlington National Cemetery.
"She's gone," I whispered under my breath, the way I always do when I visit her final resting place. "Gone, but never forgotten." The cemeteries here are so beautifully manicured and kept, it's hard to believe that these are where some of the greatest heroes in American history lay at peace.
I take a deep drag on my cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through my system, but I know I can't keep this up much longer. The smell is getting stronger by the day, and I don't want to be one of those old codgers who can't give up their foul habit even in death.
"Ana," I say out loud, "I miss you so much." I feel a lump form in my throat but I keep talking, hoping she's listening, or maybe someone else is and they might hear me out. "You were the love of my life, and I know that you're up there looking down on me with a smile on your face. Don't worry about me, okay? I'll be fine."
I take one last drag before stubbing it out with my heel, making sure to dispose of the butt properly so as not to leave any trash behind. It's hard to believe that 47 years have passed since she went away, but here I am again, paying my respects like I do every year on this very day.
I look around at the other graves and monuments, some of which belong to people I recognize from history books and others who gave their lives in service to our country. There are so many stories to tell and secrets to keep here at Arlington National Cemetery, but I'll never be able to share any of them with anyone. All I can do is pay my respects the best way I know how, and hope that Ana is watching over me from above.
I take one last look around before turning to leave, feeling a sense of peace wash over me as I make my way back out into the bright sunlight. It's not easy visiting the gravesite of a loved one, especially when it's been 47 years since they've been gone, but this is where I come whenever I can to say hello and catch up, even if she doesn't reply.
