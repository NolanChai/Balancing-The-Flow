 right as usual. As an intern at Research and Development at Blue Sky Studios, I was constantly tasked with testing new software for the studio's upcoming animated films. My job involved using the software on a daily basis, but sometimes it would glitch or malfunction, which meant that my battery would drain faster than usual. 
I pulled out my pocket charger and plugged it into my phone. It beeped in protest as I tried to charge it. 
"It's not you, Glados," I muttered under my breath. "It's me." 

   As an intern at Blue Sky Studios, testing new software for upcoming animated films was my job. I had been working at the studio for a year now, and I loved every moment of it. From watching the animators bring their characters to life, to being a part of the creative process behind some of the most beloved movies of the past decade, it was a dream come true. 
But as much as I enjoyed my job, sometimes it could be frustrating when the software would glitch or malfunction. It happened frequently enough that I had to constantly keep an eye on my battery levels, just in case. 
I plugged in my phone and waited patiently for it to charge while I worked on other tasks. It wasn't long before Glados spoke up again. "Good news," she said dryly, "Your battery has been fully charged. You may now resume your testing duties."  
I smiled in relief as I put away my charger and continued with my work. With any luck, today would be a productive day at the studio. And if it wasn't? Well, Glados was always there to keep me on my toes.
