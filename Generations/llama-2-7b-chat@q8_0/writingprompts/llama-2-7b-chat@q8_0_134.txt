2 eggs rolled out and hit the ground hard.

The group of workers huddled around me, their faces twisted in concern. "What did you just say?" one of them asked, their voice low and urgent.
"I said, 'Kill the rats,'" I replied, my voice equally as low. "I told them I'd take care of it."
The workers exchanged skeptical glances, their eyes darting back and forth between each other. One of them cleared his throat. "You do know that killing the rats isn't exactly... appropriate, right?" he said hesitantly.
I rolled my eyes. "Of course I know that," I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "I just... wanted to make sure they knew how serious I was about it."
The workers looked at each other again, their faces a mixture of confusion and unease. One of them spoke up, his voice firm but gentle. "Look, we appreciate your enthusiasm, but there are better ways to deal with the rat problem than resorting to violence. Why don't you let us take care of it?"
I scowled at him, my eyes flashing with annoyance. "Fine," I muttered, turning away from them and trudging back towards the factory.
As I walked, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration building inside of me. Why did they have to be so... reasonable? Didn't they understand how important it was to get rid of those pesky rodents? I just wished they would take things more seriously, for once.
But as I reached the factory door and pushed it open, I realized something. Maybe... just maybe... they were right. Maybe there were better ways to deal with the rat problem than resorting to violence. And maybe, just maybe, I could learn something from these workers after all.''
