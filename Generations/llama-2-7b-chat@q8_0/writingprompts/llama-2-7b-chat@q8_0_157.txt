uut far enough away from prying eyes not to seem too serious.
The hostess greeted us with a smile and led us to our table by the window. I could feel my heart racing as I handed over my jacket at the coatrack and took a seat across from Hannah. She looked stunning, her blonde hair tied back in a neat bun and wearing a dress that accentuated every curve.
I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, while Hannah settled on the pan-seared salmon. We chatted nervously as we waited for our food to arrive, occasionally glancing at each other with a mixture of anticipation and fear.
When our meals arrived, I couldn't help but stare at mine in disbelief. It was like a piece of art on my plate - a perfectly cooked filet mignon, glistening in the golden light of the restaurant. Hannah's salmon was equally impressive, the skin crispy and the flesh flaky, served with a side of quinoa that added a nice pop of color to the dish.
As we ate, I couldn't help but steal glances at Hannah, trying to decipher the emotions behind her stoic expression. She seemed distant, lost in thought, and I found myself wishing I could read her mind. The food was exquisite, but it paled in comparison to the excitement of being with this woman I had come to care for deeply.
When we finished our meals, Hannah reached across the table and took my hand in hers. "I have something important to tell you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. My heart skipped a beat as I leaned in closer, eager to hear what she had to say.
