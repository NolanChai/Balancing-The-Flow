 through the empty corridor, followed by a cold sigh of released air, and I knew I had been locked into my own personal Panic Room.
Panic set in, like a raging fever, and sweat broke out all over my body as I frantically pounded on the door with my fists, yelling for someone to help me! But no one came. The door remained stubbornly sealed shut, and I was left alone to face whatever dangers lurked within this godforsaken Panic Room.
My mind raced as I tried to piece together how I had ended up here. I remembered going to bed in my small apartment above the coffee shop, feeling exhausted after a long day of work. But then... nothing. One moment I was sleeping, and the next I was trapped in this tiny, windowless room with no way out.
I stumbled backward away from the door, my eyes wildly scanning the small space for any sign of escape. The walls were smooth concrete block, punctuated by a single small ventilation grate high up on one wall. A cold sweat trickled down my spine as I realized that this was my only hope.
With trembling hands, I managed to climb onto my knees and peered up at the grate. It looked too small for a human to fit through, but desperation drove me onward. I pulled myself up until my face was pressed against the cold metal, gasping in air as I strained to see any light coming from above.
But there was nothing. No sign of life, no hint of rescue. Just an endless blackness that seemed to stretch out before me like a void. My heart raced as I realized I might be trapped here forever, alone and unseen in this dark, cold box.
