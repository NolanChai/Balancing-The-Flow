tery in my art, and these doodles are a reflection of that. But now, as I look back on this piece, I see that the colors have changed. The blue pen I started with has turned into a red one! 
 It seems like every time I use a certain pen or pencil, it takes on a life of its own. Sometimes the color will change, sometimes the tip will break off, and sometimes it will just disappear altogether. It's like they have minds of their own! 😱 Do you think there's something strange going on here? 🧐 Have any of you experienced anything similar? Let me know in the comments below! 💬
