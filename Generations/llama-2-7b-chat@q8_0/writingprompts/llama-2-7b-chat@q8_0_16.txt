 hundred feet wide by a hundred feet long. Stone walls rose up to meet the vaulted ceiling, supported by massive pillars that had been carved with ancient symbols. At the far end of the room stood a massive stone statue of a great beast, its eyes glowing like two red suns as it watched him approach.
He wore a simple white robe, his hair unkempt and his eyes wild with excitement. He carried a small bag slung over his shoulder, containing all he had found in his years of research. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the task ahead. Then, he raised his hands to the statue, and began to chant.
The air seemed to vibrate with power as he spoke, and the statue began to glow with an otherworldly light. The room was filled with a sense of ancient magic, as if the very walls were alive and breathing. And then, the statue began to move. It shifted and flowed like liquid, its massive form shifting into something else entirely.
As he watched in amazement, the beast transformed into a beautiful woman. She was tall and slender, with skin as white as moonlight and hair as black as the night sky. Her eyes glowed with a fierce inner light, and she gazed at him with a look of piercing intelligence.
"Who are you?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
"I am the guardian of this place," she replied, her voice like music. "And you, mortal, have been chosen to wield its power."
He felt a surge of excitement and fear as she spoke, unsure of what lay ahead. But he knew that he had come too far to turn back now. He reached out a hand, touching the woman's cheek with trembling fingers. And as he did, the room was filled with a blinding light, and he knew that his journey had only just begun.
