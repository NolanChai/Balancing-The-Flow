 be good.
The first program was an old favorite – a quiz show from the 80s, with teams of contestants battling it out for cash prizes and glory. I settled back into the armchair and got comfortable, ready to test my own knowledge of popular culture and trivia.
But as the first round began, something strange happened. The questions were all about things that had happened in my life – events, people, places, things I had loved or hated or been through. It was like someone had taken a magic wand and waved it over my head, conjuring up a world of memories from deep within my mind.
I couldn’t believe it. How could the quiz show know about these things? Who were they to tell me stories about my own life? I felt a shiver run down my spine as the questions kept coming, each one more uncanny than the last. It was like someone had been inside my head, snooping around and digging up all the secrets I’d ever tried to forget.
I started to feel uneasy, my mind racing with possibilities – were they really just random questions, or did they have some sort of hidden meaning? Was this some kind of conspiracy, a way for them to get into my head and read my thoughts? The mints in my hand seemed to taste bitter all of a sudden, and I found myself clenching my jaw as the show went on.
It was like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare, with no escape from the memories that flooded back to me. And yet, at the same time, it was oddly comforting – like someone had finally acknowledged all the things I’d tried to bury deep inside myself, and given them a voice. It was strange, but also somehow therapeutic, like a kind of catharsis that I’d never experienced before.
I don’t know how long I sat there, watching the quiz show with my heart racing and my mind reeling. But when it finally ended and the commercial break came on, I felt changed – like I’d been through some kind of transformation, even though I couldn’t quite put my finger on what it was.
It was as if someone had taken a look inside my head, and then handed me back the pieces of myself that I’d lost along the way. And for that, I was eternally grateful.
