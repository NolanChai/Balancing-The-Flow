rup with your pancakes?” My stomach churns at the thought of more food. I try to sit up, but a wave of dizziness washes over me.  
I hear footsteps approaching and try to hide behind the curtain.  “Mornin’, dear,” my mother-in-law says, entering the room with a warm smile. “Are you okay?” She notices that I’m shaking and takes a step back. “What’s going on? Did you have another nightmare?”  
I nod, feeling ashamed. Nightmares have become my new normal, ever since I started working at the local diner. The smells of bacon, eggs, and waffles haunt me even in my dreams. It’s like my mind can’t distinguish between reality and fantasy.  
My mother-in-law takes a seat beside me and puts a gentle hand on my arm. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of, dear. Trauma can do this to people. You need time to heal.” She smiles softly. “I know you’re trying your best, but it’s okay to take breaks when you need them.”  
I nod, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. It’s nice to have someone understand what I’m going through. I take a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Thank you,” I say quietly.  
My mother-in-law gives my hand a squeeze. “You’re welcome, dear. Now, would you like some breakfast? Maybe something light today?”  
I shake my head, feeling overwhelmed. The thought of eating more food right now is too much for me to handle. I close my eyes and try to focus on my breathing. Maybe later when I’m feeling better.   
My mother-in-law nods understandingly. “It’s okay, dear. Take all the time you need.” She gives my hand a final squeeze before standing up. “I’ll let you rest. Breakfast will be ready in a bit.”  
As she exits the room, I realize that I’m not alone in this struggle. My mother-in-law has been there for me every step of the way. And with her support, maybe one day I’ll be able to overcome my fears and move on from these nightmares.
