 first time I have ever recorded myself doing magic tricks. I am excited to see how this goes. I will start by performing a simple trick, and then work my way up to more complex illusions. First up, a classic three-card Monte. Watch closely as I place these cards on the table, and then use some sleight of hand to make them disappear! “
 
 *The sound of a deck of cards being shuffled can be heard*

 “ Okay, I’m ready to begin. I have placed the three cards on the table, and now I will use my wand to distract you while I secretly palm one of the cards. Watch closely as I use misdirection to make it seem like the card has disappeared! *pauses for dramatic effect* Ta-da! The card is gone! “
 
 *There is a moment of stunned silence before someone gasps*

 “ How did you do that?! That was incredible! “

 *You chuckle and smile, enjoying the reaction*

 “ Why, thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed it. *pauses and smiles* It’s all in the technique, my dear. Now, if you want to see something truly impressive, I have a few more tricks up my sleeve. *winks*“
