ystopian, and it was full of teenage angst. 
 I was down with that because I am a product of the 80s and 90s myself. 
 
 But let's get real here, the only good thing about this show is the fashion. 
 And even then, I’m not sure it’s worth the existential dread I experience every time I turn on Netflix. 
 
 The only other positive thing I can say is that the actor who plays Tyler Durden is a national treasure and should be crowned king of England immediately. 
 
 But let’s be real here, this show sucks. It’s all style over substance with no plot to speak of. 
 And don’t even get me started on the writing, it's like they took every cliche from every teen drama and smushed them together into one big mess. 

So if you’re looking for a show that will give you anxiety and make you question your very existence, then this is the show for you. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you!
