, they begin to change color until they are fully opaque at 25. This process is unique to each individual.
A group of people broke through our borders and have been causing problems. They 're not like us though - their vision never changes color. It's like they don't have eyes that can see things the way we do. Some say it's because they 're not from this world, others say they're just plain cursed.
The government has been trying to round them up, but it's hard since they look just like us. They 've been disappearing and showing up in different places, spreading chaos wherever they go. Some people are scared of what will happen if we let them stay. Others want to help them and figure out why their vision doesn't change color.
I don't know what I think. It 's hard to understand something you can't see with your own eyes. But maybe if we could find a way to communicate, to really see into each other's minds... maybe things would be different. Maybe we could learn from each other and live in harmony.
That's just a dream though. For now, I 'll stick with what I know - the way my parents taught me. Protect myself, protect those I love. And keep my eyes open to the world around me, ready for whatever comes next.
