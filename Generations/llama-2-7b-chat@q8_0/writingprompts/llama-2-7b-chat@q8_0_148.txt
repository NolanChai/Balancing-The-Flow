itive by nature. I have always been driven to succeed in everything I do. The feeling of victory is intoxicating. It's like a rush that cannot be beat.  But at what cost?  

I started racing when I was just a teenager. It was my escape from the chaos of home life. My parents were always fighting and arguing. They couldn't seem to get along, no matter how hard they tried. 
 Racing became my sanctuary. It was something that made me feel alive. Something that made me forget about all my problems. Something that gave me a sense of control over my life.  

 As I got older, the competitiveness grew stronger. I started to see racing as more than just a hobby. It became a way for me to prove myself to others. To show them that I was something special. Something different from everyone else. 

I pushed myself harder and harder each time I got behind the wheel. My times got faster, my skills improved, and my reputation grew. But with success comes pressure. And with pressure comes burnout.  

I started to feel like I was losing myself in the process. Like I was sacrificing my own happiness for the sake of winning. Like I had become a machine, pumped full of adrenaline and fueled by ambition. 

But what's the point of it all? Is it worth giving up everything else just to be the best? Is it worth losing touch with who you really are and what truly matters in life? These questions started to haunt me as I sat in my car, staring at the wall ahead of me.  
I realized that I had been living someone else's dream for too long. That I had forgotten how to be happy for myself. How to find joy in the simple things.  And so I made a decision. A decision to take a step back and reassess my priorities. To remember why I started racing in the first place.  
I know that winning is important, but it's not everything. There are other things in life that give meaning and purpose. Other things that make us feel alive and connected to the world around us.  And so I took a deep breath and let go of my grip on perfection. I let go of my need to be the best at all costs.  
I started to focus more on enjoying the journey than just the destination. On finding balance between success and happiness. And as I did, something amazing happened...I found myself again.
