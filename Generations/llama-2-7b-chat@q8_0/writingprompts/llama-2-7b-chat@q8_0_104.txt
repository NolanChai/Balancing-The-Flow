... uh, I mean all of the people who had ever picked on him were suddenly gone! He could finally be the popular kid in school without any competition. As he walked through the empty hallways, he felt like a king, the last human left standing amidst a sea of lifeless bodies.
But then... something strange happened:
Jonathan started to feel guilty for being alive when everyone else was dead. And so, he decided to do something about it! He scavenged what he could from the abandoned schools and stores, and set off on foot to find other survivors.
 
 Along the way, he encountered all sorts of dangers: marauding gangs of undead high school students, roving packs of wild dogs, and even a few other lone survivors who were just as desperate and alone as he was. But Jonathan persevered, determined to find others like him.
 
 Eventually, after weeks of searching, Jonathan stumbled upon a small community of survivors holed up in an abandoned airport terminal. It was there that he found true friendship and companionship for the first time since the world ended. And he discovered something else as well... something that gave him hope:
 
 There were other kids like him, scattered all over the world, who had survived the virus. And together, they could rebuild society, start anew, and perhaps even find a way to undo the damage that had been done. Jonathan's journey was far from over, but he knew that he would never be alone again... because there were others out there like him, who understood what it meant to be alive in a world without a future.

And so, Jonathan embarked on a new quest: to find and unite these scattered groups of survivors, and to lead them towards a brighter tomorrow, no matter how bleak the present might seem.
