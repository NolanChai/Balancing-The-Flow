 but trust me when I say this. You gotta keep your grades up. You want to be able to get into college and have a real chance at life. Because believe it or not, this high school shit isn't going to cut it. And let me tell you something else, there are bigger problems in the world than what grade you got on that math test. So stop whining about it and start paying attention. 
 Second thing, don't fuck around with drugs. They might seem cool right now but trust me, they will ruin your life. And I'm not just talking about the legal troubles and the money you'll waste. I'm talking about how you'll feel about yourself when you're addicted to something that's only making your life worse. 
 Thirdly, don't be a fucking idiot with girls. Treat them right or treat them left. But for the love of god, don't be a dickhead. You might think it's funny or cool now but believe me when I say this, you will regret it in the long run. And if you're lucky enough to find someone who loves you back, then fucking treat them right and make sure they know how much you appreciate them.
 Fourth, don't be a lazy piece of shit. You gotta take care of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally. Exercise regularly, eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, meditate, do yoga or whatever the fuck it is that you need to do to keep your shit together. And don't be afraid to talk about how you feel with someone you trust. It's okay to not be okay sometimes and it's important to have someone to lean on when things get tough.
 Last but certainly not least, never ever give up on your dreams. No matter how impossible they might seem or how much others might doubt you. Keep pushing and keep fighting because the only way to succeed is to never give up on yourself.
 So there you have it little me. Take heed of my words and maybe ten years from now, you'll be a better person than I could ever hope to be. But if not, then at least we'll have each other to laugh about it when we're old and grey.
