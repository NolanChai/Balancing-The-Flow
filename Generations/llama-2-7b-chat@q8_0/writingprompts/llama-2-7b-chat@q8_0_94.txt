lices are connected at one point: the "seed" universe. The growth is not exponential as one might think but instead it is more akin to a slow and deliberate tree sprouting from the seed.
In this view, the number of universes grows linearly, not exponentially. The "seeds" of new universes are scattered throughout the multiverse and they grow at their own pace. The connection between these seeds is what allows for the growth and evolution of the multiverse as a whole.
In this scenario, the concept of the multiverse is more similar to a tree with many branches than a never-ending ladder of universes. Each branch represents a separate universe, connected to the trunk (the "seed" universe) through a network of roots and stems. The growth of each branch is independent but also interconnected, allowing for the diversity and complexity of the entire tree.
This perspective on the multiverse challenges the traditional view of an ever-expanding, constantly growing multiverse. Instead, it presents a more deliberate and controlled process of universe formation, with each new universe growing from a preexisting seed. This idea has implications for our understanding of the origins and evolution of the multiverse as a whole, and could potentially explain some of the observed properties of the cosmos we see today.
