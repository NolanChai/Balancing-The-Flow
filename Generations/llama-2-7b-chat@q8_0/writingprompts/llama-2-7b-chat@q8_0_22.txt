led out. My heart raced with anticipation and fear as I rolled over and turned off my alarm, hoping that this time would be different.
I slowly got out of bed and trudged towards the bathroom, still half asleep. The thought of having to navigate the website and apps only to find out I'd have to wait yet another month for my dose of Insulin was a constant source of frustration. I stumbled into the shower, letting the cold water shock me awake, hoping that today would be different.
The process had already started 2 months ago when the government announced a new allocation system. They had promised to give out insulin to those who needed it most, but the criteria were vague and not everyone was convinced they were being fairly distributed. I had managed to get my hands on some earlier in the year through various means, but since then, I'd been trying to get a steady supply through the government system.
As I stood under the cold water, letting it run down my face and neck, I thought about how this struggle was affecting me and so many others. It seemed like a never-ending cycle of waiting for something that should be basic human right - access to life-saving medication. I thought about all those who had given up hope, those who had died because they couldn't get the help they needed in time.
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath as I stepped out of the shower. Today would not be different. At least, that was what my brain told me. But my heart refused to give up hope.
