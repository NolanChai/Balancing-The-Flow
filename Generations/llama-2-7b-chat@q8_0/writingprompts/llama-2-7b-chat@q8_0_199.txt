 
 I couldn't move my body or speak out loud. All I could do was think. Thoughts raced through my mind like a hurricane. 
 ''Is this it?'' I thought. ''Am I going to die?'' 
 But then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything went black. 
When I opened my eyes again, I found myself lying on the floor in a puddle of blood. My head was throbbing in pain and my vision was blurry. 
 I tried to stand up but my legs felt like jelly and I collapsed back onto the ground. 
I couldn't remember what had happened or how I got there. All I knew was that I was alive, but everything around me was a blur.
As I lay there, trying to make sense of it all, I heard footsteps coming closer. They were heavy and deliberate, and they made my heart race with fear. 
I tried to call out for help, but my voice was hoarse and barely audible. 
Just as the footsteps reached me, a figure appeared in front of me. It was a woman with a kind face and gentle eyes. She knelt down beside me and helped me sit up.
