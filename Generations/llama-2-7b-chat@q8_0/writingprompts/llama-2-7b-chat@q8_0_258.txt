 he table , Dr . Muller stared icily with pursed lips and raised brows, ''You must be joking. That's not a patient I recognize, sir. What is this , some sort of parody?"
 
Captain Sneakerpants flickered between several faces, each one grinning back at him like they were in on the joke. He leaned forward to whisper, "I told you, Doc. I'm not really here."

Dr . Muller pounded his pencil on the desk and leaned forward, his face inches away from Captain Sneakerpants. 
"Sir, you are in no position to be joking about this matter! You are a patient in a mental hospital under my care."

Captain Sneakerpants shrugged with a grin, "I'm just messing with you, Doc. Don't get your knickers in a twist." The room shook and the sound of thunder boomed outside, rattling the windows as if in agreement.

Dr . Muller glared at Captain Sneakerpants and crossed his arms over his chest, "I see. Well , Mr... uh... Sneakerpants, you are to remain here until we can figure out what's going on with you."
 
Captain Sneakerpants shrugged again and leaned back in his chair, "No problemo, Doc. I'll just hang around for a bit and see what happens." He snapped his fingers ,and the room began to fade away into a swirling vortex of colors. 

Dr . Muller watched with open mouth as Captain Sneakerpants disappeared before him. He muttered, "This is... this is impossible!" As if anyone could hear him over the cacophony of sound that filled the room and spilled out into the hospital halls.
