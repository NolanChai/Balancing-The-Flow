ies merciless. The enemy army lay broken and defeated before him, their remnants scattered across the field like so many discarded toys.
He raised a hand to his face, brushing back a stray lock of hair as he watched the survivors of the battle huddled together, cowering in fear. He felt no satisfaction at their defeat, nor did he feel any particular triumph over them. They were, after all, just pawns in a greater game, and they had been defeated not by his own skill or power, but rather by the will of the gods themselves.
The wind picked up, carrying with it the scent of blood and smoke, and he could feel the angry whispers of the furies stirring within him. He knew that they would not be satisfied until their full measure of vengeance had been exacted upon the world, and he wondered how much longer he would be able to hold them at bay.
He took a step forward, his eyes fixed on the defeated army as he spoke in a low, even tone. "You have been judged and found wanting," he said, his voice carrying across the battlefield like a cold wind. "You have been dealt with according to your crimes, and now you will pay the price for your transgressions. But know this: it is not over yet. There is still more work to be done, and I am the one who will do it."
The furies within him stirred at his words, their cold fury burning bright with anticipation as they looked forward to the days of destruction that lay ahead. And he knew that he would have no choice but to give them what they desired, for he was their instrument, and they were the ones who truly held the power.
