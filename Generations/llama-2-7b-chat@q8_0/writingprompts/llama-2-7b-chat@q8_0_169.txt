How is it you never feel satisfied, Clay? Why can't you just accept things for what they are and be at peace with it?" Sarah asked, her voice soft but tinged with frustration.  
Clay stopped rinsing his brush to stare at the wall, a muscle ticking in his jaw. "You don't know what it's like," he muttered, his eyes distant and unseeing.
"Try me." Sarah took a step closer, her eyes locked on Clay's face. 
Clay sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. "It's like... everything is just so... imperfect," he said, voice barely above a whisper.  
Sarah nodded slowly. "I know what you mean. I feel the same way sometimes."  
Clay looked at her then, and for a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the gentle dripping of water from the can into the sink. 
"But you have your art," Sarah said softly, breaking the silence. "It's like... it's like your way of making sense of all this."  
Clay nodded slowly, feeling a small smile creep onto his face. "Yeah," he said. "That's exactly right."
