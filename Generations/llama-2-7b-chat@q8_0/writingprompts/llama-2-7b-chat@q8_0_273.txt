s been keeping me alive, I can’t help but think of all the things I wish I had done differently.
I could have traveled more, tried new foods and drinks, laughed louder, loved deeper, and lived braver than I did. I could have taken more risks, pushed myself beyond my limits, and never let fear hold me back. I could have been kinder to those around me, forgiven those who wronged me, and shown compassion to those in need.
But here I am, at the end of it all, reflecting on what could have been rather than celebrating what was. And so, as my heartbeat slows to a stop and my breaths become less frequent, I can only hope that there is something more out there waiting for me beyond this mortal coil. Because if there isn’t, then all of these regrets will be the last thing I ever think about, and that thought alone is enough to make my dying breath a hollow one indeed.
