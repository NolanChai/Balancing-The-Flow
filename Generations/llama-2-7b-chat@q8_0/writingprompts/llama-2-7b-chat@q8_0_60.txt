He motioned to the actor across from him, who looked on with confusion. The two men were identical in appearance, and yet somehow, they were completely different people. It was a bizarre sight, one that left DiCaprio feeling more than a little flabbergasted.
"I mean, come on," he continued, shaking his head again. "Do I really look like some kind of twin to you? Have you been hitting the crazy pills today?"
The other man just shrugged and smiled, looking almost apologetic. But DiCaprio wasn't having it. He shook his head again, muttering something under his breath as he turned away. The whole thing was simply too much for him to handle.
