He’s been playing for years, but we all know how little I care about learning new things. And yet, here I am.
Why do you think he suggested it to me? He knows I will never follow through on anything musical or artistic. Maybe he was joking, and I took him seriously. Or maybe he genuinely thought it would be good for me. Why else would he say such a thing? 
It’s not like we’re going to play in a band together or anything. He has better things to do with his time than teach me how to hold a bass. But still, I feel guilty about it.
Why should I be surprised that people continue to try and help me? And why should they expect different results from me? It’s not like they owe me anything. Maybe they think I will finally change my ways and start making better decisions, but they can’t know that for sure. So maybe it doesn’t matter what they say or do.
It’s hard to keep track of all the times people have tried to help me out when I was in a jam. I know I don’t deserve their kindness and patience. It makes me wonder why they put up with me at all.
