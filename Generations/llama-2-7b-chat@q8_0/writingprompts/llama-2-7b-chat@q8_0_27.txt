 me it must have been a while since I last slept.
I stumbled through the village, trying to find some answers. No one seemed to notice that I had appeared from thin air or perhaps they just didn't want to get involved in whatever crazy situation I was in.
Eventually I came across someone who looked like they might be able to help me. A small girl with big brown eyes and a mischievous grin she took my hand and led me to her home, which happened to be the largest one in the village. 
As we walked she told me her name was Zara and that she had been watching me from afar since I arrived. She explained that this planet was called Lunosia a world filled with magical creatures and advanced technology. But for some reason, humans had never been able to colonize it fully. And now I had appeared out of thin air.
Zara's family welcomed me warmly and gave me food and drink while they listened intently as I told my story. How I was a time traveler from a planet far away and that I had come here on purpose but then something went wrong and I ended up stuck in this strange place. Zara and her parents looked at each other worriedly before the mother spoke up "We can help you figure out what happened to you but first we need to get you cleaned up"
I nodded gratefully as they helped me wash off the dirt and dust of my journey. And then they set about trying to understand how I had ended up on their planet in the first place.
As it turned out I had been on a mission to gather data on the various time travel technologies that existed across the galaxy when something went wrong, causing me to materialize here. Zara and her family worked tirelessly to help me repair my ship so I could return home but it seemed that fate had other plans for me.
As we continued to work on the ship, Zara told me about the wonders of Lunosia and showed me around the village. I was amazed by the magical creatures and advanced technology that surrounded us every day brought new surprises and adventures as well as challenges to overcome.
Eventually with my ship repaired and my mission complete I knew it was time for me to leave Lunosia behind. But before I did Zara hugged me tightly "Thank you for bringing light into our lives" she said tearfully. As I hugged her back I realized that I had found something truly special on this strange planet far away from home. A new family in a new world, and memories that would last forever
