 was a small town in the mountains. It had only about 300 residents. A quaint little place to live and visit, but not exactly known for its commerce. Tourists were sparse, and mostly came by accident while on their way someplace else. Which made opening a shop here seem like a bad idea from the start.
 But Greg was determined. He had moved here after high school, looking for a fresh start. His parents were dead, his only sibling lived in a far off city, he didn't know anyone. So he took to hiking around these mountains every day. And found solace in them. He could be alone with his thoughts, and just enjoy nature.
 After some time passed, Greg had an idea. The mountains were full of hidden streams and ponds. Many of which were crystal clear and teeming with life. Fish abounded, birds flew overhead, and small animals darted between the trees. But people seldom saw any of that unless they stumbled upon it themselves.
 So Greg opened a shop near the main road. The first day was a disaster. Only two customers walked by, one of which was a lost hiker who ended up buying a whole bunch of things he didn't need just because Greg was so kind to him.  But the next day, something changed. The sun shone brighter, birds sang louder, and people seemed more inclined to stop and look around.
 That second day turned into ten years of steady business. People would come from all over to see the beauty of these mountains, and Greg's shop became a staple for them. They would buy maps, binoculars, camping gear, and sometimes just some postcards or a souvenir or two.
 But as the years went by, Greg began to wonder why he bothered. It was hard work for little pay, and he often felt like he was running on a treadmill that never moved forward. But he couldn't bring himself to give up. Every day brought new faces, and every day made him feel connected to this place in a way he never could have imagined.
 So even though Greg still wondered why he did it, he kept opening the shop each morning. And as long as his legs held out, he would keep on hiking too. The mountains were his solace, and he was theirs.
