 Okay, here we go! *activates portal*
 
 Whoa, cool! The room just shifted dimensions and transported us to what appears to be an ancient temple complex deep in the jungle!

 Uh, I think I found something. There's a trapdoor here that looks pretty sketchy. Should we avoid it or try to disable it? *squints at the mechanism*
