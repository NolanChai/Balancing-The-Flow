 turned into my friend Timmy holding a flashlight.  He was grinning at me from ear to ear. 
"Hey man! Did you come to check out this crazy light show? I've been messing with it for hours!" he exclaimed.  
I chuckled and shook my head. "You know Timmy, you shouldn't be messing around with things you don't understand." 
He gave me a mischievous grin. "Come on man! It's just a little light show. Don't be such a buzz kill!" he said laughing.  
I couldn't help but laugh at his enthusiasm. I had known Timmy since we were kids and he was always getting into some kind of trouble. But he was my friend and I loved him for it."
