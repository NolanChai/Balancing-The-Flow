 none as special as the moment we shared our first kiss underneath the stars. The memory of which has kept me going through these long and grueling months away from you. 
How I wish I could be there now to watch the snow fall on your face and see the smile light up your eyes again, but alas, I fear that time may soon run out for me here. I know in my heart it will soon be over, and I can only hope that I have done enough to make you remember this old soldier with fondness and love. 
Please know that I love you more than life itself and that I will carry you and our memories deep within my heart until we meet again.  
Yours always,
