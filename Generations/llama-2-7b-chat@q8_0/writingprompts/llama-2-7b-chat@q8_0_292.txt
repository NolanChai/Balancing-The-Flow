 invite to someone's pool party or BBQ.
His phone buzzed with a notification from his girlfriend of two years, Rachel. She'd sent him a link to a website about a new indie game that was supposed to be really cool, but Jeffery wasn't interested in checking it out. He'd rather spend his time on Fortnite or Call of Duty than play some obscure game that no one else had heard of.
"Hey," Rachel said, noticing that he was still awake. "What are you up to?"
Jeffery groaned and laid back down. "Just sleeping, I guess. What's new with you?"
Rachel sighed, probably because she was bored too. "Not much. Just working on my tan at the beach. Wish you were here."
Jeffery rolled his eyes. He knew she was just trying to get him to come hang out with her and her friends, but he didn't want to go. They'd end up playing some lame game like cornhole or ladder toss, and Jeffery would be stuck there for hours, feeling bored and uncomfortable. He much preferred staying at home where he could do as he pleased.
"Yeah, maybe next time," he said vaguely. "I'm just not really feeling it today."
Rachel grunted in response and they talked for a bit longer before she hung up. Jeffery lay there for a while longer, thinking about how he was glad to be alone. It was so much easier to do whatever he wanted without having to worry about other people's opinions or plans. He could play his games, watch TV, or take a nap whenever he wanted and no one would bother him.
But as the afternoon wore on, Jeffery started to feel restless. There was something lacking in his life, something that made him feel unfulfilled. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew he needed something more than just sitting around all day doing nothing.
So he got up and started looking through his video games, searching for something to play that would capture his attention. Maybe a new adventure game or an RPG with a rich storyline. He wanted something that would engross him and transport him to another world for a while.
As he scrolled through his collection, he came across a game he hadn't played in years. It was an old-school puzzle game that his parents had gotten him when he was a kid. Jeffery smiled to himself as he remembered how much he used to love playing it. It was simple and easy to pick up, but also challenging enough to keep him interested for hours on end.
He decided to give it a try and booted up the game on his PC. As he started to play, he felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was what he needed â€“ something familiar and comforting to distract him from the boredom of summer.
