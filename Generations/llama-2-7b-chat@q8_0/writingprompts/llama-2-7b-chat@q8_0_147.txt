ung at birthday parties:
"Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! ....................."
Their joyful voices made me squirm, but it was too late for that now. The damage had already been done. I had grown accustomed to my parents' incessant celebration of every minor milestone in my life and this birthday seemed no different.
As a teenager I rebelled against the excessive attention lavished upon me on this day by deliberately avoiding my family for most of the day, opting instead to spend time with my friends in solitude. But even that became too much as the weight of their expectations bore down upon me, and soon enough I found myself trudging back home to face the cake, the candles, and their endless chatter about how "time flies when you're having fun."
It was not until well into adulthood that I finally learned to appreciate my parents' well-meaning gestures for what they truly were – a deep love and investment in me. And so, on the next birthday, instead of feeling embarrassed or annoyed by their antics, I found myself joining them with a smile, even singing along to the familiar tune as we blew out the candles together.
The cake may have been a symbol of my parent's efforts to make each birthday special, but more importantly it represented the bond that we shared – a bond that only grew stronger as the years went by.
