 with my mom trying to buy something and she is talking to me like we are normal. Like I actually remember stuff. I keep forgetting though. I will ask for something and then forget it right away. The worst part is when someone talks to me and I forget what they said. So I just stare at them with a blank look on my face hoping that somehow the information will magically appear in my head. My mom is trying so hard to help me but it's not working. I feel like such a burden to her. What's worse is that my memory loss is getting worse and worse every day. Sometimes I catch myself staring off into space without even realizing it. It's like my mind has checked out and left my body behind. It's so scary because I don't know if there's anything that can be done to fix this or if I'm just going to continue to lose more and more of my memories until there's nothing left. My mom is trying different things to help me but nothing seems to work. She even got me to see a specialist but they just told us that there isn't anything they can do without knowing the cause of the problem. It's like no one understands how frustrating it is for me to have memories slipping away from me like sand through my fingers. I feel so helpless and alone in this struggle.
