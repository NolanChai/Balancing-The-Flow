 us, perfectly still, staring at nothing but the ground in front of us. Waiting for something to happen, I suppose. 
I looked around and saw that my fellow crows were all thinking their own thoughts, just like me. Some were deep in concentration, while others seemed to be daydreaming. We all had one thing on our minds: the kill. The thrill of it all was almost palpable. The rain pounded against our umbrellas, but we barely noticed. Our eyes were fixed on something else entirely. 
And then, suddenly, it happened. A small creature scurried across our path, and in a flash of movement, one of my flockmates snatched it up with their sharp talons. The rest of us erupted into cheers as the killer crow proudly held its prize aloft. We had done it. We had committed murder. 
As we made our way back to our nest, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. It was exhilarating, really. The thrill of the hunt, the rush of adrenaline as we struck. It was something that only came around once in a while, but when it did... well, let's just say it made everything worth it.
