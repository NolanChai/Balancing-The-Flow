Caillou, imp assistant to the ruler of Hell, consulted his clipboard. He hated Monday meetings. "It appears that our weekly shipment has been delayed again," he said deferentially to the woman sitting across from him.
"What do you mean it's been delayed?" she demanded, her voice tight with annoyance.
Caillou hesitated, unsure of how to answer. He didn't want to admit that the delay might be due to his own incompetence. "I...I'm not sure," he stammered. "Perhaps it was lost in transit?"
The woman snorted. "Lost in transit? Are you kidding me? This is Hell we're talking about here, Caillou. Nothing gets lost in transit around here."
Caillou shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He knew she was right, but he didn't want to admit it. "I...I'll look into it," he said weakly.
The woman sighed and rubbed her temples. "Look, Caillou, I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. You're always making excuses for your own incompetence."
Caillou felt a twinge of guilt. He knew he wasn't as competent as he should be, but he didn't think it was fair to take out his frustrations on him. "I...I'll try to do better," he said placatingly.
The woman glared at him for a moment before seeming to relent. "Alright, Caillou. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt this time. But next time, don't bother me with excuses until you have a real solution."
Caillou nodded, feeling grateful but also ashamed. He knew he had let her down again, and he vowed to do better in the future.
