rien was a sturdy dwarf with broad shoulders and powerful arms. He had spent too many years working in tunnels to let a little weight slow him down.

"Nah, they do their talking with hammers and bites,'' he replied as he set the jackhammer's bit to drill a hole through the wall. "They may be quiet but when it counts, they get the job done.''

As Lirien drilled into the wall, a faint hum filled the air. It was the sound of machinery at work, the steady purr of drills and saws slicing through steel like silk. Coruscant had always been a city of wonder, a place where anything seemed possible, but down here in its depths, it was a different story. Here, magic and machine worked hand in hand to keep the city running smoothly, and Lirien was proud to be a part of that world. He worked with skill and precision, his jackhammer biting through steel like a hot knife through butter, leaving behind a trail of sparks as it went. As he drilled deeper into the wall, he could see the faint glow of luminescent crystals embedded in the rock face, their soft light casting an eerie greenish hue over everything. It was an odd sight, but Lirien was used to it by now. He had worked in tunnels long enough to know that nothing was ever quite what it seemed on the surface.''
