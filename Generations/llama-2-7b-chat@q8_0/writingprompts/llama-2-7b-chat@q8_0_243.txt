The shop is a small building with a thatched roof. The walls are adorned with strange and exotic trinkets, all for sale of course. There is a big wooden counter at the front of the shop where customers can pay for their purchases and a smaller one in the back where I sit to keep my inventory organized.
I do n't have much family left anymore. My parents are dead now and my siblings live far away. The only person I consider a friend is a witch who lives deep in the forest beyond our village. We meet once a month to trade goods and gossip, but other than that, I am alone.
I've heard rumors of something bad lurking in the forest, something that could n't care less about me or my shop. It's hard to keep my mind off of it when there are strange noises in the night and the wind howls through the trees like a beast. But I will not let fear rule my life. I have my shop and I will protect it with everything I have.
