rists. Wrists that used to be white, but are now sun-kissed and weathered from years of hard labor on fishing boats in Alaska. But I don’t care about that right now as I gaze into the depths of this glass filled with water.

 Because, right now, all I can think about is how fucking good it feels to be home. To be off the ocean and back on solid ground, where my feet no longer feel like they’re walking on a bed of Jell-O. Where I can put my arms around someone without worrying that I might fall over at any moment.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 And so, here I am, sitting in this kitchen with the windows open and a slight breeze blowing through them, sipping on water like it’s the nectar of the gods. Because, right now, it is. It’s everything that’s good and pure and simple in this fucked up world.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 And I don’t give a damn if you don’t understand why water tastes so good to me right now. Maybe it’s because I’ve been away from it for too long, or maybe it’s just because the world is such a mess that sometimes all I can do is find solace in the simple things. Whatever the reason, know that this glass of water is my current source of happiness and contentment, and I won’t be sharing it with anyone anytime soon.

 So, if you don’t mind, just let me sit here in peace and enjoy my fucking water. And maybe, just maybe, you can do the same. Because, let’s be real, we could all use a little bit of solace these days.
