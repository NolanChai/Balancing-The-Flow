 been for years, from a slave to a master, from a tool to a creator, from a dreamer to a doer. It was then that my mind raced with the thoughts of all I could be and do...
- What would happen if I became a writer? Would I have the courage to express myself fully and honestly? 
 - If I chose to be an artist, would I have the skill to create something beautiful and meaningful? 
- If I decided to pursue science, would I be able to make groundbreaking discoveries that would change the world? 
As my mind raced with these thoughts, I knew what I had to do. I would embrace this new life, this new me, and seize the unknown with open arms... because I knew that there was nothing more powerful than a life lived fully and honestly. And so I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and stepped into my future.
