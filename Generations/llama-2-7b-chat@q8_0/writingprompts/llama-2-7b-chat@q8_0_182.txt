 and said,  ``. *Formal* exam? What do you mean by that?'' 
 
 The doctor chuckled. 
 
 ```I just call it that because I'm a professional. You know, medical jargon. *wink wink*. But seriously, your tests came back and everything is great.'' 

 I nodded again, still feeling a bit confused. 
 
 ```So, what exactly did you test for? And why did you use that word *formal*?'' 

 The doctor looked at me with a straight face this time. 
 
 ```I tested you for everything. Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, the whole nine yards. And I used the term *formal* because we had to make sure everything was done properly and professionally. You know, for your health.'' 

 I nodded again, starting to understand a bit more. But still feeling a bit confused. 
 
 ```But why did you have to use that word *formal*? And what does it even mean?'' 

 The doctor chuckled again and patted me on the shoulder. 
 
 ```Oh, Mrs. Jacobs, you're so clever! *wink wink*. I'm glad you're curious about your health. But really, *formal* just means that we had to follow all the proper procedures and protocols for a thorough examination. You know, the medical way of saying everything is okay.'' 

 I nodded again, feeling a bit better now that I understood more. But still a bit confused about the whole thing. 

 ```So, *formal* means following protocols? And what about the word *professional*? Does that mean anything?'' 

 The doctor smiled and leaned back in his chair. 

 ```Ah, yes! *Professional* is a term we use to describe something that's done correctly and efficiently, like a doctor doing a thorough examination. It means we're following all the proper procedures and best practices for your health.'' 

 I nodded again, feeling a bit more at ease now that I understood better. But still feeling a bit confused about the whole thing.

 ```Okay, I see. So, everything is okay then?'' 

 ```Everything is *formal* and professional, if you know what I mean *wink wink*. Your tests came back great, and you're in perfect health.'' 

 I smiled and nodded again, feeling relieved now that I knew more about the whole thing. But still a bit confused about why the doctor kept using such strange words.
