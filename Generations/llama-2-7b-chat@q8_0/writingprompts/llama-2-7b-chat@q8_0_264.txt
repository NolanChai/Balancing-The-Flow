. It's not easy being a ghost, especially when you are stuck in one place for so long. It would be nice to see someone new around here, it's been ages since anyone has come near. I have tried everything I can think of to get their attention, from knocking on the walls and making strange noises to even possession... But nothing seems to work. I fear they have given up hope of ever finding me or maybe they are just too scared to come inside. Oh well, it's not like I can blame them. I am a ghost after all, it's not exactly the most welcoming place to visit.
But I digress, welcome to my humble abode! Feel free to explore and see if you can discover any of my secrets. Just be sure to watch your step, this old mansion has a lot of hidden dangers lurking in the shadows... And don't worry, I won't bite... hard... hehe.
