olluting car had stopped in front of a hotel whose name Mike could barely pronounce, let alone spell.
"This is where we're going to stay," said Alex, the driver and owner of the car. "It's a luxury hotel, one of the best in the city."
Mike looked at the building around him, trying to take it all in. The lobby was huge, with marble floors and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. There were people dressed in expensive suits and dresses milling about, sipping champagne and looking important. Mike had never seen anything like it before.
"But... but how are we going to afford this?" he asked, still feeling a bit stunned. "I thought you said you were on a budget."
Alex just smiled. "I have connections," he said. "Trust me, we're going to be treated like royalty here."
Mike wasn't sure if he should trust Alex or not, but he didn't really have any other options. He had agreed to go on this trip with Alex without really knowing where they were going or how they were going to get there. All he knew was that it was supposed to be an adventure, something different from the usual routine of work and home. And now here he was, in a luxury hotel in some city he'd never heard of before.
As they checked into their room, Mike couldn't help but feel a bit overwhelmed. The room was huge too, with a huge bed and a marble bathroom. There were flowers on the nightstand and a chocolate on the pillow. It was all just a bit too much for him to take in.
"Do you want to go down to the restaurant for dinner?" Alex asked, noticing Mike's expression. "I can make a reservation for us."
Mike hesitated. He wasn't really sure if he wanted to eat in such an expensive place, especially since they were on a budget. But at the same time, he couldn't deny the temptation of trying something new and exciting.
"Okay," he said finally. "Sure, why not?"
Alex grinned. "Great! I'll make the reservation then."
As they walked down to the restaurant, Mike couldn't help but feel a bit more excited about the whole trip. He had no idea what was going to happen next, but he was willing to take a chance and see where it led him. Maybe this was just what he needed to break out of his routine and try something new. And who knows, maybe he would even enjoy himself in this luxury hotel.
