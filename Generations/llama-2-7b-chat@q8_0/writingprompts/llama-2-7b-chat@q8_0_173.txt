 disorder. I am afraid of what people will think of me if they know who I really am. So I put on a good face every day. A good fake face. But inside, it's all smoke and mirrors. 
 My job is a way for me to pay the bills without having to be "me." That person is too dangerous to let out in public. 
So I stay hidden behind my desk, pretending to be normal while secretly saving the world one super power at a time.
