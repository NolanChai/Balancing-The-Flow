ion. He had known this day would come eventually. After all, it was only a matter of time before someone like Johnson came along. He had been preparing for this moment his whole life.
 `` I'm afraid that's not possible, Mr. Johnson,'' he said evenly. 
 
 `` What?! Why not?!'' Johnson demanded, his eyes bulging in fury. 
 
 `` Because I am already a deity,'' Mark said with a smile. 
 
Johnson's face went white as a sheet. He stumbled backward, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then, to Mark's utter confusion, he burst out laughing.

 `` Oh, this is rich! You think you're funny, don't you?!'' Johnson chuckled, wiping tears from his eyes. 
 
Mark shrugged and leaned back in his chair. He had to admit, it was a bit satisfying to see the man who had just tried to declare himself a god rendered speechless by Mark's response. It was almost poetic justice.
 
 `` I assure you, Mr. Johnson,'' he said, `I am not trying to be funny. I simply do not recognize your authority as a deity. You see, I have already established my own religion and followers. And they don't need any additional deities.'' 
 
Johnson snorted in disgust. `` You foolish mortal! You think you can just create your own religion and have people follow you?! That's not how it works! I am the one who gives meaning to life, who brings order to the universe! And you think you can simply override that with some made-up belief system?'' 
 
Mark leaned forward, his eyes locked onto Johnson's. ``Actually, Mr. Johnson, that is exactly what I have done. And my followers are not as limited as you might think. They come from all walks of life, and they are not bound by the same limitations as you are. They are free to believe in whatever gives them meaning, without fear of persecution or reprisal.'' 

Johnson's face had gone red with anger, but Mark could see the faintest glimmer of uncertainty in his eyes. It was a look he had seen before, a sign that someone was beginning to question their own beliefs. And it was a feeling that Mark savored every time he encountered it.
 
 ``And what about me?'' Johnson demanded, trying to regain the upper hand. 
 
Mark smiled again. ``You, Mr. Johnson, are just a man with delusions of grandeur. You see yourself as something you're not. But I assure you, your time is coming to an end. And when it does, my followers will be ready. They will see through your lies and embrace the truth.'' 

Johnson's eyes narrowed, but Mark could tell he was beginning to lose his fight. He was used to being in control, and he didn't like being bested by a mere mortal. But Mark knew that he had won this round, and he reveled in it. After all, as the saying went, ''The devil will always try to steal your soul, but God gave you the power to resist him.'' 

The scene ended with Johnson slinking away, defeated and humiliated, while Mark sat back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face. He had won this battle, but he knew that there would be many more to come. And he was ready for them all.
