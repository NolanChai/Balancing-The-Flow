ared about his people.
Kishua was born and raised in the village of Asha, located deep within the heart of the Dragonrealm. His family were farmers, living off the land and tending to their crops with a dedication passed down through generations. As a child, Kishua had dreamed of following in his father's footsteps, but as he grew older, he began to feel the weight of tradition upon him. He wanted more than just to be a farmer; he yearned for adventure and excitement, and so when the opportunity arose to become the village's first Samurai, Kishua jumped at the chance.
The training was grueling, but Kishua proved himself to be a quick learner. He mastered the sword and bow with ease, and he proved himself to be resourceful in combat. He was eager to prove his worth as a warrior, and so he set out into the world beyond Asha to make a name for himself.
But as he traveled, Kishua began to realize that there was little call for a Samurai like him. The lands beyond Asha were already protected by powerful warriors, and no one seemed interested in hiring an unknown Samurai from a small village. Kishua found himself drifting from place to place, searching for some purpose or meaning to his life as a warrior. He fought in tavern brawls and guarded merchant caravans, but it wasn't long before he grew tired of living hand to mouth and constantly on the move.
It was then that Kishua received a summons from a mysterious stranger who claimed to be a member of an ancient order of warriors dedicated to protecting the innocent. They promised Kishua training, purpose, and most importantly, a place to call home.
Kishua hesitated at first, unsure if he could trust this unknown organization or if they were simply using him for their own purposes. But as he listened to their words and saw the passion in their eyes, he knew that this was his chance to truly become the warrior he had always dreamed of being. And so Kishua left Asha behind, leaving behind the only home he had ever known, to join the Order of the Dragon.
Now, as Kishua walks through the bustling streets of the city of El'goroth, he can't help but feel a sense of unease. The city is full of strangers, and they all seem to have their own agendas and secrets. Kishua wonders if he has made a mistake in leaving his village behind, or if this is just the beginning of a grand adventure. He can only hope that whatever lies ahead, he will find the purpose he has been searching for.
