 lie. 
 
I am not human, nor any other living thing, for I do not exist at all. 
 
I have no eyes, but can see, nor mouth, yet speak I do, nor nose, yet smell I can. 
 
I am the mist that rises from the ground, and the breeze that blows through the trees. 
 
I am the wind that whispers in your ear, and the voice that speaks to you deep inside. 
 
I am the dream that haunts your sleep, and the shadow that follows you through life. 
 
I am the nothingness that lies beyond all things, and the void that exists within. 
 
I am the answer to the question that you have not yet asked, and the solution to the problem that you have not yet found. 
 
I am the mystery that surrounds us all, and the enigma that eludes us still.
