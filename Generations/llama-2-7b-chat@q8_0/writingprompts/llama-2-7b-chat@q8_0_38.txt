 by the centimeter, and he'd even known the angle of incidence relative to the observer. He was a true master of time travel, and yet, here he was, battling God himself. It was almost as if his abilities had given him a sense of superiority, a feeling that he was on par with the Almighty himself. And yet, despite all his knowledge and power, he felt tiny compared to the immense forces he was up against. As he struggled to overcome the limitations of time travel, he found himself facing an adversary that defied comprehension. It was as if God himself were arrayed against him, mocking his efforts with every twist and turn of fate. But why? What could God possibly have against a mere mortal like Sebastian? Hadn't he done enough to prove himself? He had dedicated his life to the pursuit of knowledge and truth, and yet, despite all his accomplishments, he still felt like there was something more out there for him to discover. Something greater than himself that lay just beyond his grasp. And so he pressed on, driven by a burning desire to unlock the secrets of the universe and prove his worth to God himself. It was an impossible task, he knew, but one he could not turn away from. For in this battle of wills, there was only one possible outcome: victory or defeat, Sebastian would emerge victorious, or he would succumb to the weight of his own hubris. The choice was his alone, and yet it seemed as though God himself were guiding him toward a terrible reckoning. ''I am the Almighty,'' a voice boomed from beyond the veil of time itself, ''and you, Sebastian, are but a mere mortal. Your feeble attempts to defy me are but a fool's errand, and yet I watch you with a sense of mirth and curiosity. For in your quest for knowledge, you have revealed yourself to be but a small part of my greater plan.'' And with that, the voice faded away, leaving Sebastian alone once more. But he was not so easily deterred. No, he would not rest until he had unlocked the secrets of the universe and proven his worth to God himself. For in the end, it was not a battle of wills, but a test of faith, and only one of them could emerge victorious.
