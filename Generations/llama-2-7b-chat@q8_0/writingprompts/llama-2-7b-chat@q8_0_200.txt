"It's amazing, isn't it?" Felicity said softly, squeezing her husband's hand. "Our little Rupert."
"Tiny and perfect," Colin agreed. "Just like his mother." His eyes sparkled with love as he gazed at his wife, who was grinning from ear to ear beside him.
In the months that followed, the entire population of New Eden marveled at the tiny prince's rapid growth and development. Rupert grew at an accelerated rate, learning new skills and abilities with breathtaking speed. He was a prodigy, it seemed, even before he reached his first birthday.
But despite their pride and happiness at their son's incredible progress, Colin and Felicity knew that they had to be careful about how much they revealed about the prince's true nature. The people of New Eden were already wary of anything resembling magic or technology that they didn't understand; if word got out about Rupert's genetic enhancements, it could lead to panic and unrest.
So Colin and Felicity kept their son's secrets close to their hearts, watching over him with loving care as he grew and flourished in the shadowy depths of New Eden's royal palace. It was a delicate balance, one that they knew they had to maintain at all costs. But with Rupert by their side, they felt ready for anything, knowing that together, they could face any challenge that came their way.
