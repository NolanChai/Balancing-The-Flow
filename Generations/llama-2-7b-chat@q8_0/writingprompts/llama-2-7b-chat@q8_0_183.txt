lean Fight like I wanted to...
It has been two years now since the Outsiders came and took over our city. They came with their advanced technology and weapons, and they were able to defeat us easily. I was fighting alongside my fellow soldiers, but we were no match for them. They had better guns, better training, and better tactics. And even though I wanted to fight them to the death, I did n't get that chance. Instead, I was captured and taken prisoner by the Outsiders.
Now, as a prisoner of war, I am forced to do their bidding. They have me working in their factories, making things for them, and I can feel my spirit breaking every day. But I will not give up hope. I know that one day, we will rise up again and fight back against these invaders. And when that day comes, I will be ready to do my part to defend our city and our way of life.
