ighed in relief, letting her weight settle back onto her feet as he approached her.  
 
 ''Name, ma'am?'' He asked pleasantly and Mary found herself stumbling over her words, struggling to remember what she was supposed to say. 
 
 ``M-my n-name is M-mary, s-sir...'' She stammered out, her heart racing in her chest as she tried to collect herself.  
 
 The man smiled and reached into his pocket, pulling out a small notebook and flipping through the pages until he found what he was looking for. 
 
 ''Ah, Private Mary Johnson, at ease then.'' He told her with a nod, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he looked her over.  ''We've been expecting you.''  

 Mary felt a shiver run down her spine at those words, her heart racing even faster as she tried to process what was happening.  Expecting her? How did they know her name...? And why were they here?  But before she could ask any questions, the man held out his hand and helped her into a sleek black car parked just behind him.  

 ''You're coming with me, Private Johnson.'' He told her simply and Mary found herself getting into the car without another thought, her mind spinning with too many questions and too little answers as they pulled away from the curb and sped off towards whatever fate had in store for her.
