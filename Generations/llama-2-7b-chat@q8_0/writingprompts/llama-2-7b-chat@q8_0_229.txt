 maybe I can get some coffee* she thought to herself. As she passed by the Starbucks a man bumped into her causing her to stumble slightly. He didn't even look at her or apologize just kept walking like he was in a rush to get somewhere. Sandra was starting to get annoyed with the way people were treating her today, first the old lady had knocked over her drink and now this man had bumped into her without even acknowledging her existence.
As she continued on her way she couldn't help but notice the man who had bumped into her walking into the Starbucks across the street. He was wearing a black hoodie with a white shirt underneath and dark jeans, his hair was messy and he had a small scar above his left eyebrow *like he had gotten into a fight or something* she thought to herself. Sandra was about to enter the Starbucks when she heard a voice behind her saying *Excuse me* *I think you dropped something* She turned around to see the man from the Starbucks standing there with a small black notebook in his hand. Sandra looked down and saw that she had dropped her purse. She was about to thank him when he handed her the notebook saying *I found this on the ground outside, I thought you might want it* Sandra took the notebook and thanked him before turning back to enter the Starbucks.
As Sandra walked into the Starbucks she couldn't help but notice the man again, he was standing in line ordering a drink. She wondered if it was just a coincidence or if he had followed her inside. *Maybe I'm just paranoid* she thought to herself. Sandra decided not to think too much about it and went about getting her own coffee. As she waited in line she glanced over at the man again, he was now sitting at a table reading his notebook. She couldn't help but wonder what could be so interesting in that notebook *Maybe he's a writer* she thought to herself before realizing how ridiculous she sounded. Sandra decided to focus on her own work for the day and ignored the man from across the room.
As she sat at her desk working on her manuscript she couldn't help but think about the man from Starbucks. She wondered if he was still there, reading his notebook. *Maybe I should go check* she thought to herself before realizing that it was pointless to worry about it. Sandra decided to just focus on her work and ignore the whole situation.
Later that night as Sandra walked home from work she noticed the man again, standing outside her building. She felt a shiver run down her spine as he looked up at her window *Like he's waiting for me* she thought to herself before realizing how ridiculous it was. Sandra quickly made her way inside and locked the door behind her before calling the front desk security to let them know someone was loitering outside. She couldn't shake off the feeling of unease as she went about getting ready for bed *Who is this guy and what does he want?* she thought to herself before deciding to just try and forget about it and go to sleep.
As Sandra lay in bed she couldn't help but think about the man from Starbucks, the way he had bumped into her earlier and now was standing outside her building. She wondered if he was following her *Maybe I'm being paranoid* she thought to herself before realizing how ridiculous it was. Sandra tried to distract herself by thinking about her work for tomorrow but her mind kept going back to the man from Starbucks.
It wasn't until later that night when she heard a knock on her door that she finally realized who the man was *It's him* she thought to herself before opening the door to find the man standing there with a small white box in his hand *Like he's delivering something* Sandra's heart raced as she wondered why he would show up at her door.
