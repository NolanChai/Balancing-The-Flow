irst for it- for your life, your soul, your blood. The dark eyes are like two black holes sucking in my light. I try to step back, but my legs won't move. The figure's presence is too strong. I feel myself getting pulled into the void of its gaze. I see images from a nightmare flickering behind its eyes: snakes slithering through my veins, bones shattering in my flesh, blood boiling in an abyss. The eyes seem to mock me, daring me to resist their power, taunting me with the promise of pleasure. I feel myself losing consciousness, but still my legs won't move. The figure doesn't say a word. Its silence is more terrifying than any scream or curse. It's as if it's using its gaze to hypnotize me into submission. My mind becomes foggy and cloudy; I struggle to distinguish reality from illusion. I feel myself slipping deeper into the abyss, farther away from sanity.
