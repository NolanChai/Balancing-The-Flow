uma possible, each city reduced to rubble and ash. Neither side willing or able to truly win, only to keep fighting as long as they can. 
The armies of Ol marched on the capital of the Scorched King's kingdom, their banners held high as they burned all in their path. The city was a madhouse of chaos, with flames licking at every building and people screaming in terror. The armies fought house to house, room to room, as the defenders were slowly pushed back into the heart of the city. 
The Scorched King himself rode at the front of his army, his blackened skin gleaming with malevolent intent. His sword sliced through the air, striking down any who dared stand in his way. He laughed as he fought, his voice echoing through the city like the screams of the damned. 
But the armies of Ol were not to be underestimated. Their soldiers were equally fanatical and determined, fighting with a ferocity that bordered on the supernatural. They too had their own leader, a tall figure in a long coat who strode through the fray like an avenging angel. His eyes glowed with an otherworldly light, as if fueled by some dark and ancient power. 
The two armies clashed again and again, their weapons striking sparks like tiny stars in the dim light of the burning city. The screams of the dying filled the air, a cacophony of horror that seemed to stretch on forever. And yet still they fought, neither side willing to yield an inch. 
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a blood red glow, it seemed as if neither side would emerge victorious. The armies of Ol and the Scorched King had reduced each other to nothing but rubble and ash, with no end in sight. It was clear that this conflict would continue until one side was utterly destroyed.
In the midst of the chaos, a figure appeared, walking through the ruins as if unconcerned by the destruction around him. He was an old man, his hair white and his eyes filled with a quiet strength. He walked towards the two armies, his footsteps slow and deliberate, and when he reached their midst, he spoke in a voice that carried to both sides.
"Enough," he said, his voice like thunder. "This conflict has gone on long enough. You have reduced your cities to rubble and ash, and yet you still fight on. Is there no end to your madness?"
