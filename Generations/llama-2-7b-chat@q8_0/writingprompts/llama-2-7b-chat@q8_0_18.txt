? why you got that face on? Don't tell me you have been digging around again? 'Sally asks. 
 
''Oh no Sal! I didn't dig anywhere. I was just sitting there and I remembered this.', Tim says with a smile, showing Sally the old toy car he found, 'I used to play with this all the time when I was a kid. Man, look at how small it is now compared to me!'
 
''Aww that's cute! Do you want to go dig around in the backyard and see if we can find any more old things?' Sally asks, her eyes lighting up with excitement, as she remembers all the fun times she had when she was young.
 Tim just shakes his head with a smile, 'Nah mate, I think I'll stick to playing video games nowadays. But hey, it's good to have a bit of nostalgia every now and then.'
Sally nods in agreement, 'Yeah, it sure is. It's funny how time flies, isn't it? Before you know it, we'll be old and grey like grandma!'
Tim chuckles at that thought, 'Yeah, but at least we'll have our old toys to reminisce about.'
