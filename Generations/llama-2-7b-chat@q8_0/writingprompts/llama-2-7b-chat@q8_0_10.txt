 the captain and his first mate on their return from the underworld.
I had been tasked with greeting them, a small but important role in the grand ceremony of their return from the dead. The city was abuzz with excitement; people crowded the streets, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the vessel that would bring back their beloved heroes and rulers. But my job was to make sure they were well received, that they felt at home as they stepped back into the mortal world.
The sky continued to boil with turbulent storms; lightning illuminated the clouds in vivid flashes of white and blue. The thunder roared like a beast awakened from slumber. I shifted my weight, trying to find comfort on the hard stone steps where I stood. My eyes flickered towards the harbor, waiting for the first glimpse of the ship.
Finally, it appeared in the distance, the outline of its dark hull barely visible through the tempestuous weather. The ship drifted closer, and as it drew nearer, I could see the captain standing atop the helm, his white beard blown by the wind like a banner of leadership. He raised a hand in greeting, and I felt my heart swell with pride to see him return home safe and sound.
The ship slowed its approach, and the captain called out to me in a booming voice. "Greetings, young man!" he shouted above the din of the storm. "How are you on this tempestuous day?"
I took a deep breath, trying to project my voice over the roar of the wind and thunder. "Welcome back, Captain! I am well, ready to greet you upon your return from the underworld." My voice was barely audible as the storm intensified, but he heard me clearly, his eyes fixed on mine with a warm smile.
The captain's first mate appeared at his side, and together they steered their ship towards the shore. I stood tall, my heart full of anticipation for the grand welcome that awaited them. Their return was a momentous occasion, a testament to the heroes who had braved the unknown to bring back treasures from beyond the grave. As the captain and his crew stepped onto dry land, their names were shouted in triumph by the crowd, and I felt proud to have played my small part in this great celebration of life and death.
