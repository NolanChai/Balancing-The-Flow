 no pigs, alas. One day I decided to take all the toys into the garden to play with them there. As I was carrying them in my basket, I accidentally dropped the donkey in a patch of mud. It was dark brown and sticky, and it completely ruined his coat. My mother saw what had happened and scolded me for being careless. She made me clean up the mess while she tidied away the toys.
I felt terrible about it at the time, but looking back I can see how my mistake helped me develop a sense of responsibility. It taught me that accidents happen, but we must always take the blame and make things right again. It also taught me to be more careful in future, which has stood me in good stead over the years. So although it was a disappointment at the time, I can see that my mistake with the donkey helped me grow up to be a responsible adult.
