 had some great moments that showed how this show can make me feel, so I hope they use those to their advantage in the finale.
It's understandable why the show is ending though, it has been on for 5 seasons now and there are only so many stories you can tell with these characters before running out of steam. I think the writers did a good job of wrapping up plot lines and giving fans something to be satisfied with, even if it wasn't perfect. The finale will probably have some of the same flaws as previous episodes, but I'm hoping for something special regardless.
