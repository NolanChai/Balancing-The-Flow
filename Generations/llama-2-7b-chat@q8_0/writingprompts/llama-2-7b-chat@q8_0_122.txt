 On and on, without fail.
 The seconds tick away. 
 It's like an eternity.  
 You wonder when it will end. 
 Will the next minute be any different? 
 Or will it just be more of the same.  
 Clocks are cruel that way. 
 They never stop or slow down,
 Never do they change their pace,
 They simply keep going and going. 
 Until you're ready to give up.
