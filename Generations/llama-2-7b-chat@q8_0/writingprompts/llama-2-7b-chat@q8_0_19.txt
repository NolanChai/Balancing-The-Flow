 up, looking at the screens before him with a mixture of relief and anxiety. The ship shook one more time as it dropped through the atmosphere, but Andrew held on tight. He had done this dozens of times before, but he still get nervous every single time. “Hold on to your seatbelts everyone” he shouted over his shoulder, trying not to sound too scared himself. The ship shook again and Andrew clung to the console for dear life as they entered into the planet’s atmosphere. He had been training for this mission for years but even with all of his preparation, it was still terrifying. The red planet loomed large before them, its rusty hue filling the windows of the ship as they plummeted towards the surface. Andrew took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down, he had done this before many times but every time it never seemed to get any easier. He checked the readings on his screen, everything looked good so far. The ship was on course and they were going to make it to the Mars colony in one piece. Andrew let out a sigh of relief as the ship leveled off and began its descent towards the surface of Mars. They had made it through the worst part and now all that was left was a gentle touch down on the Martian surface. Andrew released his grip on the console and took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remaining tension in his body. He glanced over at his crewmates who were all smiling and chatting with each other, clearly relieved that they had made it through the descent without incident. “Alright guys,” he said with a smile, “We’re on Martian soil! Let’s get out there and start exploring!”  Andrew's voice was filled with excitement as he turned to his crewmates, ready to start their mission on the red planet. They had spent years training for this moment and now it was finally here. The ship shook one last time before coming to a stop, and Andrew let out a whoop of joy as they made their way to the exit hatch. As they stepped out of the ship, Andrew couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the vast red landscape stretched out before them. The Martian sky was a deep shade of crimson, with towering mountains and valleys that seemed to stretch on forever. Andrew took a deep breath of the thin Mars air, feeling a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the planet around him. "Wow," he breathed, looking out at the vast expanse of red rock. "We did it."
