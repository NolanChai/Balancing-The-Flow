ute little kid who gets to do all the things that you wish you could? 
 You get to practice your violin for hours every day and become a concert master by the time you're ten. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here with my parents forcing me to practice piano for two hours every night. And don't even get me started on how much fun you have in school while I'm stuck with a teacher who thinks I need extra help with basic math problems. 
 Every time I see you walk past my house, I can't help but feel jealous and resentful. You get to do all the things that I wish I could do, and it's not fair. Why do you get to have so much fun when I have to work so hard just to keep up? 
 I know it's childish and petty, but I can't help how I feel. You're like a constant reminder of everything that's wrong with my life, and I can't stand it. Maybe someday things will be different and I won't have to hate you so much. But until then, I guess I'll just have to keep living in your shadow.
