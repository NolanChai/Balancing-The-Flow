ky and stiff, he tried to move but found only minor relief from the constant discomfort.
"Good morning, Mr. Shiver," said Dr. Elara O'Brian, a sly smile on her face as she peered into his hood. "Welcome back to the world of the living."
Christopher grunted in response, his parched throat struggling to form words.
"How are you feeling?" asked Elara, pressing a hypospray against his neck.
Christopher groaned as the cool liquid flowed into his system. "Like someone took a baseball bat to my body and smashed it through a brick wall."
Elara chuckled. "That's quite an... interesting way of putting it, Mr. Shiver. But I assure you, your discomfort will subside in no time."
Christopher squinted at her suspiciously. "How long until I can leave?"
"Oh, my dear fellow," she said, wagging a finger, "you're not going anywhere just yet."
Elara gestured to the door as two burly men entered the room, each carrying a large tray of food and drink. Christopher's stomach growled at the sight, and he eagerly devoured the steaming meal that was placed before him. As he finished his repast, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was in some kind of trouble.
Elara leaned back in her chair, her eyes gleaming with an unsettling intensity. "You see, Mr. Shiver," she began, "your journey to the outer rim of the solar system has been quite... enlightening."
Christopher raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"
Elara leaned forward, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "Well, you see, Mr. Shiver, your mission was not just to explore the cosmos, but to discover something much greater... something that could change the course of human history."
Christopher's brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of her words. "Discover what?"
Elara smiled again. "Ah, Mr. Shiver, you have no idea how fortunate you are to be a part of this... this magnificent endeavor."
Christopher frowned, his mind racing with unease. He had no idea what Elara was talking about, but he knew it couldn't be good. The last thing he remembered before being cryogenically frozen was embarking on a mission to explore the outer reaches of the solar system; now he was in some kind of trouble? His instincts told him to get out while he still could, but his curiosity kept him glued to his seat.
"So," Elara said, leaning back in her chair, "what do you say, Mr. Shiver? Are you ready to see what you've been brought here for?"
