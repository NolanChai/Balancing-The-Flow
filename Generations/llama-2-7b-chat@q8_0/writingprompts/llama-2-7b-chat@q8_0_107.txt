 eyes scanned the room for an open table, but they all seemed to be taken. Just as I thought I'd have to stand there awkwardly until someone got up and let me sit, he tapped my shoulder.
"Mind if I join you?" He asked with a friendly smile.
I hesitated before nodding and stepping aside. As we sat down, I realized he was even more handsome up close, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. We started talking about our classes, and before I knew it, we were laughing and joking like old friends. He told me stories of his adventures in different countries, and how he'd always wanted to be a writer.
As lunch drew to a close, he asked for my number, and I hesitated. I didn't want this perfect afternoon to end. But he promised me we could hang out again soon, and so I gave it to him. And as we walked out of the cafeteria together, he leaned in and whispered "Maybe we can write a story together sometime?"
And just like that, my heart skipped a beat at the thought of working on a project with this charming stranger.
