ory's.'' 
I knew she was right; she had every right to know what was happening with her sister. And so, I told her everything. From the moment Rory disappeared, to the discovery of her pregnancy, and finally, to the news that the baby was stillborn. 
Claire listened intently, her eyes wide with shock as I spoke. When I finished, she sat in silence for a long time, before speaking again.  
`How could this happen?' She asked quietly, tears streaming down her face. `How could Rory do this to us?'' 
I couldn't answer her. I didn't have the words. All I could do was hold her and try to comfort her as best I could. We sat there like that for a while, until Claire finally broke the silence again.  
`Thank you for telling me,' she said softly. `I know it can 't be easy for you.'
