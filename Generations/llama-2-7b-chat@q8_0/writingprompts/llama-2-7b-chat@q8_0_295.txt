 feeling alive again. Now, I think about it and wonder if that’s truly what I want…
I am tired. My body aches from the exertion of yesterday and the day before. My mind races with the possibilities and implications of my choices. It is a dizzying array of thoughts. And yet, at the same time, it is all so simple. What if I just want something?
What if all I want is to feel alive again? To feel like myself? Without the burden of responsibility and expectations, what if that’s all I truly desire? It’s a scary thought, really. The weight of society’s expectations on me has been crushing at times. What if I am wrong in my desires? What if I am chasing after something that will ultimately harm me?
But, what if it won’t? What if all I want is simply to feel alive? To be present in this moment and enjoy the simple things? Is that too much to ask for?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. All I know is that I am tired of living a life not truly my own. Tired of trying to meet the expectations of others. Tired of feeling like I have to justify my every move. What if I just let go and lived for me? For once, what if I simply did what felt right in the moment without worrying about what others would think or say?
I’ll admit it, the thought terrifies me. The thought of stepping out of line, of being different, of being wrong. But, is that not the price we pay for living? For truly being alive? To live is to take risks, to take chances, and to embrace the unknown. And yet, I find myself stuck in a rut, afraid to break free.
So, what if I just do it anyway? What if I take a chance and let go of all my fears and doubts? What if I simply live for me and forget about the expectations of others? It’s a scary thought, but it may be exactly what I need to do. To truly feel alive again, to find myself, and to embrace life on my own terms.
In the end, all I know is that something has to change. The status quo is not sustainable any longer. It is time for me to take control of my life and make a change. Time to stop living for others and start living for myself. Time to embrace my desires and live life on my own terms.
The possibilities are endless, but so too is the uncertainty. But, what if it’s worth it? What if I find something truly special? Something that makes me feel alive and whole again? Something that brings me joy and fulfillment?
It’s a chance I am willing to take.
