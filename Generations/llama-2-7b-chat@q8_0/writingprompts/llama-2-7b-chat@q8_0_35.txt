Most of the instruments stopped working hours ago. I never thought I’d see a mercury thermometer explode. It just went pop, splattering across the heat-shielded window. Maybe I should consider myself lucky that it didn’t hit me. Or maybe not. After all, I’m in a metal tube at 40,000 feet.
It was one of those days that seemed to start off normally enough—morning coffee, check the instruments, climb aboard the plane. But then things started going wrong. First, the altimeter stopped working, and then the airspeed indicator followed suit. The artificial horizon was next, and after that, the radio quit transmitting.
It was like something out of a horror movie—one instrument failure after another until everything was dead and useless. I checked the backup instruments, but they were no help either. The GPS refused to work, and even the compass had stopped spinning. It was as if we were flying blind, relying solely on instinct and luck.
The captain tried to make an announcement over the intercom, but his voice crackled and distorted. He tried again, but it was no use. We were essentially alone up there, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.
I looked out the window, hoping for some sign of land or water below us. But all I saw was endless blue sky and white puffy clouds. It was like being inside a painting by Monet—beautiful, but utterly useless.
I tried to distract myself by listening to music on my headphones, but even that failed. The earbuds wouldn’t plug into the jack, and when I tried to fix them, they broke in half.
It was as if fate had decided to take a break from us that day. Maybe it was too busy with some other poor souls somewhere else. Who knows? All I know is that I was trapped in this metal tube, hurtling through the sky at 40,000 feet, with no instruments working and no idea where we were headed.
And then the mercury thermometer exploded. It just went pop, splattering across the heat-shielded window like a tiny, deadly rain shower. I had to cover my face with my shirt to avoid getting hit by the mercury droplets.
I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up. The fuel is running low, and even if we could figure out where we are, it might be too late to land safely. Maybe I should start praying after all. At least then there’d be something to hold onto—something other than just sheer panic and fear.
