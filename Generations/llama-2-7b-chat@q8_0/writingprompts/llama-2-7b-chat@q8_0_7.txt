ped out into the cool night air. He walked to his car and opened the door, sliding in behind the wheel. Pulling out of the parking lot he headed towards home, ready to indulge in a delicious meal.
As he drove he couldn't help but think about how good that meal was going to taste. His stomach growled with anticipation and he could almost smell the sizzling cheese and crispy fries. He glanced over at the bag on the passenger seat and smiled, already looking forward to the next bite.
Christopher pulled into his driveway and parked in front of his house. As he turned off the ignition he heard a strange noise coming from inside the bag. Curious, he opened it and peered inside. To his surprise, there was movement inside. He blinked twice, wondering if he had really seen what he thought he had. The bag seemed to be shaking slightly, and he could hear faint rustling sounds coming from inside.
What is going on? Christopher wondered, feeling a surge of fear mixed with curiosity. He tried to open the bag again but it was stuck. Panic set in as he realized that whatever was inside the bag, it was trapped and couldn't get out.
Heart racing, Christopher carefully reached for the bag and tried to pry it open. It wouldn't budge. Suddenly, a small hand pushed its way through the top of the bag and grabbed hold of the edge, pulling itself free. A little creature with glowing eyes peered out at him, its tiny mouth open in a grin.
"H-hello," Christopher stuttered, still trying to process what he was seeing. "W-what are you?"
