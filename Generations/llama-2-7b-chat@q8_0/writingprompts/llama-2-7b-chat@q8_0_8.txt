 Oh, yeah!'' said Phil, his face lighting up as he looked at the man shoveling snow. '' How's Mom?'' 
 
 `` She's doing good too,'' Greg replied, shaking his head to clear off some of the cold snowflakes that had landed on his hair. 
 
 Phil looked out at the other neighbors going about their morning routines. Some were bundled up in coats and scarves, while others were layered in hats and gloves. They all seemed to be enjoying the crisp winter air, despite the chill.  
  Greg turned back to Phil and grinned. "You know what's great about winter?" he said, his voice muffled by the cold air. 
 
 `` What?'' Phil asked with a smile. 
 
 `` It's always a surprise!'' Greg replied, chuckling as he patted down the last of the snow on his driveway.  
  Phil laughed at his dad's silly joke and turned back to shoveling the rest of their sidewalk. As they worked together, they chatted about everything from school to sports to old memories from years past. The cold winter air was invigorating, and it felt good to be outside with Phil by his side.  
  After a few minutes of shoveling, Phil suddenly stopped and looked up at Greg with a curious expression on his face. "Dad?" he said, his voice tinged with wonder. 
 
  ''What is it?'' Greg asked, looking down at his son with a grin.  

 `` Do you think snowflakes are like magic?'' Phil asked, his eyes sparkling in the bright winter light.  
  Greg's smile faded slightly as he thought about Phil's question for a moment. Then, he shrugged and replied with a chuckle, "Why not?"
