ks a prison cell than a room. The walls were made of cold, grey concrete and the only window looked out onto a drab, featureless courtyard.
"Why are we here?" I asked the guard. 
He sneered at me. "You're here to help us."

I stared at him incredulously. "Help you? How can I help you if I don't even know what's going on?"
He shrugged and turned his back on me, leaving me alone with my thoughts. 
How had I ended up here? It was all a blur now, but I remembered being in college, studying for my degree. Then, suddenly, everything had changed. There were strange dreams, and then the headaches started. They grew worse and worse until I couldn't focus on anything anymore. And then...
I shook my head, trying to clear it. It was no use. The memories were all jumbled up, impossible to untangle. All I knew was that I was trapped in this godforsaken place, with no way out. 
But then, as if reading my thoughts, the door opened and a figure entered. He was tall and slender, with piercing blue eyes and jet black hair. He wore a white lab coat, and carried a clipboard in one hand. 
"Ah, so you're awake," he said, his voice low and smooth. "Good." 
He walked over to me, and I could feel my heart race as he stood before me. 
"My name is Dr. Lee," he said, smiling. "And you are in the Neurological Research Institute. Don't worry, we will find a cure for your condition." 
I scoffed at him. "Cure? What condition? I don't have any condition!" 
Dr. Lee chuckled and patted me on the shoulder. "Oh, but you do. You see, we've been studying this... phenomenon... for quite some time now. And we believe that you are a key part of it." 
I frowned at him, trying to make sense of his words. But they seemed to be nonsense, a jumble of scientific mumbo-jumbo that made no sense. I shook my head, feeling frustrated and scared.
"I don't understand," I said, my voice trembling. "What do you want from me?" 
Dr. Lee smiled again, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Oh, we have a lot of work ahead of us," he said. "But don't worry, it will be worth it in the end."
