. That feeling of being burnt alive from the inside out. And how it started to snow. Inside me. The pain was so intense that I couldn't breathe. It was like I was drowning in a sea of agony. Then, just as suddenly as it all began, everything stopped. And here I am now. In this strange world where time doesn't exist.
