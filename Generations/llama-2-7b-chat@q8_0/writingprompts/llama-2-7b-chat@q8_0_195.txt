 The screen flickered and then went black. 
 
 When it came back on, I was standing in a dark cave filled with glowing blue mushrooms. 
 
 â€œ What the-?! *Violet exclaimed as she saw the cave around us. 
 
 â€œ You got what you wanted, didnâ€™t you? *I said with a sly smile. 
 
 â€œ I can always get away with anything! *I gloated. But then, I heard a loud rumbling noise coming from deeper in the cave. 
 
 â€œ What was that? *Violet asked as she looked around nervously. 
 
 â€œ I have no idea, but I think itâ€™s time we got out of here! *I said as I started to back away from the Dark Flag. 
 
 But it was too late. The cave began to shake and tremble as a massive boulder came crashing down on us! 
 
 â€œ Oh no! *Violet screamed as she tried to get out of the way. 
 
 â€œ This is not good! *I shouted as I tried to grab onto something to keep from getting crushed. But it was too late, and the boulder pinned me down with a loud crunch! 
 
 And thatâ€™s when everything went black... ðŸ˜±
