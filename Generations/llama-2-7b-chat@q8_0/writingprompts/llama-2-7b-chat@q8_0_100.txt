10 minutes ago. My eyes squint slightly as the lightning illuminates his face. The rain has started to pour down harder.
Lloyd’s voice is steady and composed on the other end of the line “Boss, I’m afraid we lost him.” The words hit me like a punch in the gut. My vision blurs for a moment before clearing as my brain tries to process what he just said. “What?!” I ask incredulously.
“Yeah, he was on his way back from the grocery store and got hit by a drunk driver. I’m so sorry.” Lloyd says.
I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins as my mind races with thoughts of what to do next. I try to focus on the task at hand, but my heart is heavy with grief for my lost friend. The rain continues to pour down around me as I try to process this terrible news.
“Okay, okay, thank you Lloyd. I’ll be right there.” I say, trying to keep my voice steady. The lightning illuminates the dark sky once more before the thunder booms and the world goes black for a split second.
This is how I find myself standing in the pouring rain outside of the hospital emergency room, trying to come to terms with what happened to my friend.
