ful when they took one of us, or our young, for food, they were a part of life on the prairie. We did not fear them as much as we feared the coming of man.

The first time we saw them, we were wary, curious, and a little scared. They came with their strange machines, and built great structures that towered over us. They seemed to have no care for our land or our way of life, and they took from us what was left of our food sources.

We tried to make peace with them at first, but it soon became clear that they were not interested in peace. They brought more and more of their kind, until the plains were filled with their noise, their smell, and their constant movement. They took over the land, one acre at a time, and left us no place to go.

We fought back as best we could, but they outnumbered and outweaponed us. We were forced to retreat, to hide in the few places that were left to us. But even there, they found us, and took from us what little we had. They took our young, our elders, and even our land.

And now we are almost gone. They have taken everything from us, and left us with nothing but memories of the great species that we once were. We are a shadow of what we once were, a mere reminder of the power of nature and the cruelty of man.
