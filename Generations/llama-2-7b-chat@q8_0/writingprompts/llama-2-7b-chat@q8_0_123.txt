 that's just a crush. Real love takes time to develop, and it's not something you can just turn on and off like a switch. ''

Answer: 
The speaker is referring to the short lifespan of electronic devices, such as smartphones or laptops, which typically have a limited lifespan before they need to be replaced. The speaker is saying that it's not unexpected for these devices to have a short lifespan and that it's normal for them to break down or become obsolete after a certain period of time.
The second quote is from a character in a movie or TV show who is defending their romantic interest, Bobby, against someone else who has called him a "thing." The speaker is insisting that Bobby is not just an object or a possession, but a person with feelings and emotions who deserves to be loved and respected.
The third quote is from another character in the same movie or TV show, who is trying to explain the difference between a crush and real love. The speaker is saying that a crush is a temporary infatuation that can develop quickly, but it's not the same as real love, which takes time to grow and develop. Real love requires effort and commitment, and it's not something that can be turned on or off like a switch.
