Alistair wasn't an easy person to look at with his hollow eyes and gaunt frame, but the barkeep still took notice of him, perhaps a little too much so for Alistairs comfort. "Another?" the bartender asked, refilling Alistair's glass from the neon blue mix, it glowed bright in the dimly lit barroom as he downed it again.
"Aye" Alistair said with a nod of approval, his eyes flickering back to the barkeep for a moment before returning to his drink. The bartender poured another shot of xeno engineering mix, and Alistairs eyes narrowed in appreciation as he drank it down once more.
As the night went on, Alistair would continue to order more of the glowing blue mix, each time with a nod of approval from the bartender who seemed to be watching him with an intensity that made Alistair feel a little uneasy. Was it just the drinks affecting him, or was there something else at play here?
Was he being watched?  Did he have a stalker? Or worse still was this whole encounter a setup? Alistairs mind raced with theories as he continued to down his glowing blue drinks, the barkeep watching him from the corner of his eye. The atmosphere in the bar had shifted, becoming more tense and uneasy as the night wore on, until it was almost palpable between them, like a weight that hung heavy in the air.
