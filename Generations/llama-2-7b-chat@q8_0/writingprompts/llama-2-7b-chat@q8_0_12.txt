 its glory. We talk of life and love but I can tell she's hiding something from me.
I have known her for so long now and yet I still feel like there are things about her that remain a mystery. As we walk along the riverbank, the cool breeze blowing gently through our hair, I can sense that there is more to her than meets the eye. She's been through so much in life, and I know she's been hurt before. But still, she smiles and laughs and acts like nothing has ever happened.
I try to probe deeper, but she just brushes off my questions with a smile. I know that she's not telling me everything, but I can't help feeling frustrated. I want to understand her better, to reach into her heart and see what makes her tick. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to get past her defenses.
Year after year, we stand here together, watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of gold and orange. And every year, I feel like I'm no closer to truly knowing her. She's a mystery that I may never fully solve, but I can't help being drawn to her anyway. There's just something about her that makes me want to keep trying, to keep peeling back the layers of her onion until I get to the heart of who she really is.
Despite my frustration, I know that I will continue to come here with her every year. Because even though we may never truly understand each other, being in her presence is always worth it. Even if only for a moment, the world seems to slow down and become still, as if time itself is bending to our will.
And so we stand here, watching the sunset together, knowing that no matter what else may happen in life, this moment will always be ours alone.
