ickets to the concert were 50 dollars each. I had no money and I wanted to see my favorite band play. But I couldn’t go because of Maestro’s rules. Maestro is a very strict teacher who likes to keep things hidden. So when he was napping, I snuck out of the room and went to the concert.  It was amazing! My favorite band was playing right in front of me. They were so good that it made my heart sing. But as soon as they finished their last song, I saw Maestro standing there with a big angry look on his face. “Where did you come from? You weren’t supposed to be here.” He looked at me like I was some kind of criminal.  My heart started racing and I got really scared. I didn’t know what he would do to me. But instead of yelling or punishing me, Maestro just smiled and said “I see you like music.” Then he handed me a ticket to their next concert. He gave it to me for free! I couldn’t believe my ears! It was the best day ever!
