ne wrinkled her nose. 
 
 Cassidy rubbed his head again, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation. He was n't sure if he should be proud of his daughter for being a skilled hacker or if he should be worried about the fact that she had been hacking into a government agency's system without proper authorization.
 
 ``Well,'' he said finally, trying to sound casual despite the mix of emotions swirling inside him. ``I guess we'll just have to see what happens next.''

Francinne nodded thoughtfully. 
 
Cassidy sighed and looked at his daughter, trying to make sense of everything. He had always known that she was smart and capable, but he had no idea she had a talent for hacking. And now that he knew, he was not sure how he felt about it. He did n't want her getting into trouble with the law or hurting anyone, but at the same time, he could see why she would be drawn to something like this. It was exhilarating and empowering, like a rush of adrenaline.
 
As he thought about it, Cassidy realized that he had been wrong about his daughter all along. He had always seen her as a sweet, innocent girl who needed to be protected, but now he saw that she was so much more than that. She was a clever and resourceful young woman who could take care of herself and make her own decisions. And he knew that he had to respect her boundaries and let her handle this situation on her own terms.
 
"I'm proud of you, Francinne," he said finally, looking at her with newfound eyes. "You're a very talented young woman, and I trust your judgment. Go ahead and see where this leads."
Francinne smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her father. She knew that she had his blessing, and she was eager to see where her newfound talent would take her next.
