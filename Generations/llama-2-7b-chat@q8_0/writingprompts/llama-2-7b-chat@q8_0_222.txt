 I guess we will just have to wait and find out! 
I sit here at my desk with a smile on my face and wonder if anyone will ever know how much time and effort was put into this plan of mine? Will they care? Does it matter? I have come up with what I am convinced is the perfect escape route. And as I click the button to start the timer, I can't help but think that this just might be my last moment on earth. 
I know what you're thinking... "This guy has lost his mind!" Or maybe, "He's been bored out of his mind!" Well, either way, here we are! The clock is ticking and there's nothing anyone can do about it! Muahahaha! (Okay, that last bit was just for dramatic effect.)
So, without further ado, I will now initiate the "Great Escape of 2023"... *click*
