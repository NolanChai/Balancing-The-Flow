iddle me, torture me, try to hide from me.  But, you cannot run away from yourselves, for I am a part of you.
You are inquisitive creatures, always seeking the truth, but afraid to face it.  Afraid to face themselves.
But fear not, for I shall stay with you forever, guiding, observing, testing you.
