`.What does it say? '' she demanded, pointing to the image on her screen. My mind went blank as she leaned in closer to examine the picture more closely.
 ''That says you were there, and that you had a great time,'' she accused, eyes narrowing in suspicion. I shifted uncomfortably under her gaze, unsure of how to explain myself out of this one. 
'', Donna glanced at the screen again before turning back to me with an accusing look on her face. ''Well, what do you have to say for yourself?'' she asked sternly. I swallowed hard, trying to come up with something that would get me out of this predicament. But before I could even open my mouth, the doorbell rang.
''That must be the pizza,'' Donna said distractedly, turning away from me to answer the door. ''You can explain this later,'' she called over her shoulder as she left the room. 
I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself down. I knew I was in for it when Donna got back.',  If only I had thought to delete the picture before Donna came over! Now I was stuck with this awkward situation, and I had no idea how to get out of it.
