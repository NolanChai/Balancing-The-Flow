 an obsession! As I grew older my love for the art form didn't waiver, and in fact became stronger.

I eventually decided to take that passion further by creating my own superhero comic. And so here we are today. The comic is called "The Star Seeker" and it follows the adventures of a young woman named Ava as she discovers her place among the stars. Ava's gift for being able to manipulate energy and matter has been kept hidden from her by powerful forces on Earth who fear what they don't understand.

Ava must come to terms with who she truly is while also learning how to use her powers for good without losing herself in the process. Alongside her are a diverse group of friends, all possessing their own unique abilities and personalities that help them form an unbreakable bond. With each new adventure they face together, they become stronger not just as individuals but as a team - united against those who seek to do harm. 

As an artist I have always been drawn towards creating something of my own because it allows me creative freedom without any constraints whatsoever – whether that be through writing stories or designing unique character designs which reflect aspects about ourselves we often overlook but deserve recognition (e.g., mental health struggles). I find solace in knowing that no matter how difficult things get in real life, there will always exist an escape where heroes reign supreme – even if only for a little while each time around. With each passing day my love grows stronger than ever before; not just because it brings me joy but also because it gives others hope too!
