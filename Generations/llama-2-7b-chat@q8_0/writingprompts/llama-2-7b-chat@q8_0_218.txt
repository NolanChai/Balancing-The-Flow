Oh, the weight of your gaze upon me! I can barely move for it. How I wish you would look away, or perhaps simply cease to exist. Your scrutiny is like a physical force, pressing down upon my very skin and bones. It's like a constant, gnawing reminder that I am different, that I am not like others. And the worst part of it all is that you don't even see me! You only see the thing on my face. The dragon-birthmark, as if it were some kind of monster lurking just beneath the surface. It's so... tiring."
"And yet, despite your insistence that I am nothing special, the mark still holds a strange power over me. It is as if, deep down, I believe that there is something magical about it, something that sets me apart from the rest of humanity. But I try to push that aside and be reasonable, to see you are right and that it's just a birthmark like any other."
"And yet... (exhales deeply) ...and yet, sometimes in the stillness of night, when the world is quiet and there is nothing but my own thoughts to keep me company, I catch a glimpse of something shimmering in the air around me. Something that looks just like... (pauses for dramatic effect) ...a dragon."
