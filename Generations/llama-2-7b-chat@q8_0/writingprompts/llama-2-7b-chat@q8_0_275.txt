 
 Anna blushed hard, trying to hide how his touch made her feel. It wasn’t like she had never seen him before or anything. They had been friends since childhood and he was more than just a friend to her. It was just that he had never looked at her like this before, with such intensity and appreciation.
 “Yeah, it's just a birthmark, nothing special, ” she said quickly, trying to deflect his gaze away from the mark. But Jacob was not deterred, his eyes continued to linger on the small patch of skin. 
 As they walked closer to the park entrance, Anna realized with some dismay that the birthmark had become an excuse for Jacob to hold her hand more than necessary. She knew he didn't mean anything by it and he probably just thought it was cute, but she couldn't help feeling a little uncomfortable about the way things were headed. 
 But before she could say or do anything, Jacob spoke up, his voice low and husky with emotion. “Anna, I know we've been friends for a long time, but sometimes I catch myself looking at you differently. Like today when I saw that birthmark on your leg, it just made me want to touch it more. I know it might sound weird, but ever since we were kids, there has been something about you that I find really attractive.” 
 Anna's heart skipped a beat as she felt a shy blush spread across her cheeks. She didn't know how to respond to this confession of Jacob’s, and her mind went blank for a moment.
