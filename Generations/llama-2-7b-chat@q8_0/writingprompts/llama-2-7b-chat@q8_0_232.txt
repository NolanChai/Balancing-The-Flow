 ght feels like a promise of better things t o come, and I breathe a little easier, hoping that today will be the day that my dreams start t o take shape.  As the sun climbs higher, it casts its rays upon my face, and for a moment, I feel alive again. The world seems brighter and more vibrant than it has in weeks, and I can almost forget the pain and sadness that have weighed me down since... well, since forever it feels like. 
 
 But as quickly as the sun's warmth spreads through my body, it fades again, leaving me with just a glimmer of hope to hold on to. It's enough, though. Just enough to keep me going, to make me believe that tomorrow will be better than today.  And so I wait, watching the sun as it continues its journey across the sky, biding my time until the day when my dreams can finally take flight and I can leave this dark, difficult time behind for good.
