R equipment to know somethin g had gone wrong on this run to the edge of the galaxy. He threw off his couch cushion, dislodging it from the walls, and stumbled over to the central console. The captain rubbed sleep from his eyes and sighed at the chaos spread before him on the screens.  "Well, shit." 
The scanners were showing an unexpected course deviation. It seemed their ship was drifting into a strange nebula. Whatever it was, it had caused a ripple in space-time that had altered their trajectory by several degrees. The groggy captain frowned and rubbed his eyes again to clear the sleep from them. 
"How far off course are we?" he grunted at an oxygen-breathing crew member who was busy typing at a console.  "Hurry up with that report!"  
The oxygen breather turned in surprise at the sudden interruption and hesitated before reporting, "Captain, we're about eight point four parsecs off course." He paused to consult his display before adding, "But don't worry, it's not like anyone will notice." The captain frowned further and leaned against the console to steady himself. 
"Eight parsecs? Are you sure?" 

The crew member nodded, "Yessir. Our hyperdrives malfunctionin' was just the tip of th e iceberg. According t o our navigation charts, we should be headed for a nearby planetary system, but instead, we 're driftin' straight into that... whatever it is." He pointed at a display showing the strange nebula. The captain scowled and tried to wrap his mind around the situation. His eyes moved back and forth between the screens as he did his best to make sense of the chaos. 
"We need t o get this fixed," he mumbled to himself, "and fast."  But before he could give orders or even think about what to do next, a klaxon blared through the ship's intercom system. The captain groaned and rubbed his temples as he braced for the worst news possible. 
"Captain, we have an emergency situation on deck 3," said a voice over the comms. "The plasma conduits are failing, and it's causin' structural damage to the ship!" The captain winced at this new revelation. It was bad enough that they were lost in space with no way out, but now they were also at risk of losing their ship entirely? 
"What's causing the conduits to fail?" he bellowed at the crew member nearest him. He tried t o keep his voice steady, but exhaustion and worry were starting to take their toll. The oxygen-breathing crew member hesitated before speaking in a hushed tone. 
"Captain... I think it might be due to some sort of energy fluctuation from that nebula out there." He pointed nervously towards the screens, and the captain felt his stomach drop. Of course, that was exactly what he suspected all along! The groggy captain grunted in disgust and rubbed his temples again. 
"Fine. Get me an ETA on when we can fix these conduits and get outta here." He gritted his teeth as he waited for the report, knowing it would be bad news.  And indeed, it was. The oxygen-breathing crew member shook his head in sorrow. 
"Captain, I don't think we can fix them at all," he said with a defeated tone. "The damage is too extensive. We need t o abandon ship." The captain let out an anguished sigh and leaned against the console again. This was not how he wanted t o go out, but what could he do? 
"Alright then," he muttered to himself. "Let's get everyone on board lifeboat one and prepare for departure." And with that, the groggy captain of the damned spaceship began the process of abandoning ship in a far-off corner of the galaxy.
