 time. The weight of everyone else's impatience dragged him down.
The train came in with a roar, and he stepped aboard just as the doors were closing. He squeezed into a seat next to a middle-aged woman who clutched her briefcase to her chest like it was a lifeline. The smell of stale coffee wafted up from his seat cushion and mingled with the scent of sweat from the crowd.
He stared blankly out the window as the train lurched into motion, feeling like he was trapped in some kind of never-ending nightmare. The bags under his eyes seemed to grow heavier with each passing moment, and he could feel them pulling him down towards the ground below.
The train rumbled on, taking him further and further away from home, while he sat frozen in his seat, lost in thought. He was just a tiny cog in a giant machine, going through the motions without any real purpose or direction. The world outside the window blurred together into a meaningless haze as he drifted off into an uneasy sleep.
