 different notebooks that I still have to this day. They are all filled with poems, short stories, and even some song lyrics that I came up with. I never really shared my work with anyone until I got older because I was afraid of what people would think of it, or worse, they would laugh at me. 
 
 In High school, I was in a creative writing class, where I wrote a few decent poems, but the teacher thought I was trying to be funny so she didn't give them much credit. But I kept on writing even though it felt like nobody cared.
 
 Even though I never got much encouragement, my passion for writing never faded away, and as time passed, I started to find my own voice, my own style of writing, and my own way of expressing myself through poetry. 

Now, at age 40, I'm starting to share some of my work online, on various sites and forums, and so far the feedback has been very positive! It feels great to have people appreciate my work and connect with it in a way that only writing can do. 

I know there are a lot of talented writers out there, but I'm glad I never gave up on my passion, even when no one else seemed to care. Writing is something that comes from deep within, and if you keep at it, you''ll eventually find your own unique voice and style. 

So don't be afraid to share your work, no matter how bad you think it is. The only way to get better is to keep writing and to keep sharing!
