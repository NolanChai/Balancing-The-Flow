oooow, I was really upset about somethin'. And my parents were fightin', like, all the time. So I did this thing where I made this big decision and then I told them about it. But they didn't listen, so...

 Yeah, I remember that. It was right after you got your permit. You wanted to drive to California by yourself. 
 
 And your parents were like, "No way." So you said, "Fine, I'll just do it myself." But then they grounded you for a year.

 Yeah...I know...It was stupid. But I was so mad at them all the time and I wanted to show them that I could take care of myself. And then when I finally got my permit, I just wanted to go off on my own. But they wouldn't let me...So...yeah... 
 **Mike** 
 
Yeah, I get it. It's hard when your parents don't listen to you and you feel like you need to prove yourself. But it's important to remember that you can't always do things on your own and sometimes you need help from others. And even though it might seem frustrating right now, looking back you might realize that they were trying to protect you from something bad happening.
 
 **Ariel** 
 Oh...Yeah...I guess you're right. It was just really hard for me at the time. But...thanks for understanding, Mike. That means a lot coming from you.
