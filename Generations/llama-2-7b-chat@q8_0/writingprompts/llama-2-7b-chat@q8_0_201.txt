oughts flooded her mind as she ran through the dense foliage of the forest. She could feel eyes upon her at all times and it made her skin crawl with fear. How long had she been running for? Minutes, hours...days? Time seemed to lose its meaning in the neverending darkness of the woods.
She stumbled upon a small clearing, the moon shone brightly above casting an eerie glow over the area. Her heart raced as she frantically searched her surroundings for any sign of life but found none. She collapsed to the ground, her breathing laborious and ragged. The darkness was closing in around her and she could feel it...it was suffocating her.
Suddenly a figure emerged from the shadows. Tall and imposing, his face obscured by a hoodie. She screamed but he just stood there unmoving his eyes fixed upon hers. "You're safe now," he said in a low menacing tone, his voice sending chills down her spine. But why did she feel so uneasy? Why did she think that this man was not what he seemed?
She tried to push herself up but her body wouldn't budge, as if something or someone was holding her back. "Please..." she whispered weakly, hoping that he would help her escape the woods and the horrors that lurked within them. But instead of helping her, he reached out and gently brushed a strand of hair away from her face. His touch was cold and clammy sending shivers down her spine.
The world around them grew darker and more surreal by the minute. She felt as though she was trapped in some sort of twisted dream and couldn't wake up no matter how hard she tried. The trees seemed to close in on her, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers, pulling her deeper into the darkness.
She was beginning to lose hope. She thought that maybe she would never escape the woods... Maybe she would be trapped here forever...lost and alone...forever lost in the darkness of her own mind.
