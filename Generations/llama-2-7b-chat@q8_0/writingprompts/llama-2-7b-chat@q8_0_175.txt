 and I need to focus. What is it?'' replied Dr. Edmunds, barely concealing her annoyance.  
`I think we have found something,' Johannes continued, his eyes darting back and forth between the two of them as he fought to contain his excitement. 'A pattern in the data that could be evidence of extraterrestrial life.'  
  `What? That's impossible!' Dr. Edmunds snapped, her voice rising in disbelief. `We've been searching for years and we haven't found anything concrete. How could this just suddenly appear?'  
`I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true,' Johannes insisted, his eyes locked on Dr. Edmunds as he poured out the details of their discovery. `We've run multiple simulations and the results are consistent: there is definitely something there.'  
 `This changes everything,' Dr. Edmunds muttered to herself, her mind racing with the implications of this new development. `We need to run more tests, gather more data...this could be it.'  `Yes,' Johannes agreed, his voice filled with excitement. `This is the breakthrough we've been waiting for. Let's get to work and see where it takes us.'  
 `Dr. Edmunds, I think you should take a look at this,' said Johannes, his voice barely above a whisper as he held out the latest batch of data on the screen. 
`What is it?' Dr. Edmunds asked, her eyes squinting as she tried to make out what was on the screen. `Another glitch in the system?'  
 `No, nothing like that,' Johannes replied, his voice filled with a quiet intensity. `This...this could be something.'
 `What do you mean?` Dr. Edmunds asked, her curiosity piqued despite herself. `Tell me more.'  
`Well,' Johannes began, `the data shows...well, it's hard to explain. But essentially, there's evidence of a civilization out there that's unlike anything we've ever seen before. It's not just a single planet or even a system, but an entire...network.'  
`A network?' Dr. Edmunds echoed, her mind racing with the implications. `What kind of network? Can you show me?'  
`Yes, I can,' Johannes replied, his eyes fixed on the screen as he navigated through the data. `This is just a small part of it, but...wow.'  
 `It's like nothing we've ever seen before,' Dr. Edmunds breathed, her eyes glued to the screen as she took in the strange patterns and symbols that Johannes was pointing out. `What do you think it means?'  
`I don't know,' Johannes admitted, his voice tinged with a hint of awe. `But I have a feeling we're onto something big here.'
