, and was now using that knowledge to keep herself entertained.

 
She carefully opened one of the books, it was a bit dusty but still readable, and started to read about magic and wizards, and all the amazing things they could do with just a flick of their wand. Sarah couldn't believe how much she had been missing out on, and how lucky her sister had been to have such knowledge at her disposal.

As she delved deeper into the books, Sarah started to notice that some of the spells seemed familiar, almost like they were from her own memories. It was then that she realized that her sister must have left behind more than just books, she had left behind a legacy, and now it was up to Sarah to keep it alive.

With renewed purpose, Sarah started to practice the spells she had learned, and soon found herself able to perform them with ease. She began to feel like a real wizard, and couldn't wait to see what other secrets her sister had left behind. As she continued to read and practice, Sarah knew that she would always be grateful for the gift that her sister had given her, and she vowed to keep her legacy alive forevermore.
