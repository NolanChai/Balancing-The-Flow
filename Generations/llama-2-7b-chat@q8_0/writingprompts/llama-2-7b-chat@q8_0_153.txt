 years, the answer had been simple, direct, unwavering: ****never*. But now, as the years ticked away and the weight of responsibility grew heavier, that answer was no longer so clear.**

"I could never kill a friend," the speaker said quietly, their voice barely above a whisper. **But what if I had to? What if my life or someone else's depended on it? Would I be able to pull the trigger then?"
The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken thoughts and doubts. No one dared speak, no one dared offer an opinion. They all knew the gravity of what they were discussing, the weight of the question hanging over them like a black cloud.**
As the minutes ticked away, the speaker's voice grew louder, more insistent. "I don't know if I could do it," they said, their words tinged with desperation. **"I don't know if any of us could. But what choice do we have? What other option is there?"**
The room was quiet for a moment, the only sound the soft rustling of papers as people shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Then, without warning, a hand shot up from the back of the room. "I think you're asking the wrong question," the person said, their voice firm and resolute. **"You shouldn't be wondering if you could kill a friend, you should be wondering how to prevent it from ever coming to that."**
The speaker nodded, a mix of gratitude and despair on their face. "You're right," they said, their voice heavy with emotion. **"We shouldn't be asking how to take lives, we should be asking how to protect them."**
