 those things. I used to get these moments where my eyes would go blurry and i could feel something near me. It was like having a conversation with someone, but if they didn't respond it just made the feeling more intense until i couldn't take it anymore. I know that sounds crazy but i swear its true. Ive tried to ignore them, deny them but it never goes away. I used to think i was crazy but im not alone. There are other people out there like me.
And then the story shifts to a different person:
I've been experiencing these things too, for as long as I can remember. It started when I was really young and my parents would tell me it was just my imagination, but as I got older I realized it wasn't something I could explain away so easily. There are times when I feel like someone is in the room with me, even though I know no one is there. And sometimes I see things out of the corner of my eye, but when I turn to look, there's nothing there. It's like a presence that's always lurking just beyond my perception.
The story continues in this vein, with each person sharing their own experiences and thoughts about these strange occurrences. There is no resolution or explanation offered, but rather a sense of shared understanding and solidarity among the people who have experienced these phenomena. The story ends with the suggestion that there may be some kind of connection between these experiences, and that they may be more than just the product of imagination or coincidence.
