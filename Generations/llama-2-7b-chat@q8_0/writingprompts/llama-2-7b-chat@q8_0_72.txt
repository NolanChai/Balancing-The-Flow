...
Once again I heard the knock at the door, and calmly left the office room in my house to go answer it. But it was not the front door I went to, nor the back door. Instead, I went to the door leading to the secret laboratory hidden deep within my home. I opened the door, revealing a dimly lit room filled with strange machines and contraptions that hummed and buzzed with an otherworldly energy.
"Who is it?" I asked, trying to hide the excitement in my voice.
"It's us, Professor," came the reply from outside the laboratory door. "We've come for the results of your experiments."
I smiled to myself, knowing that they would be impressed with what I had discovered. "Just a moment," I said, and closed the laboratory door behind me. Then I returned to the living room, where my visitors were still waiting.
"Ah, good," one of them said, as I entered the room. "We were wondering when you would be finished."
I smiled and nodded. "Everything is ready," I said, and gestured for them to follow me. And so they did, into the secret laboratory deep within my home, where we worked on our latest project: a machine that could bend time itself.
