, so much to take in. But he was ready. He was ready.
"Here are your final test questions," she said. "You have one hour to complete them."
He took a deep breath and began to read through the questions. His heart raced as he realized this was it. This was the end. All his hard work, all his studying had led up to this moment. He would either pass or fail based on these questions.
He worked quickly and efficiently, answering each question with ease. He knew them all by now, but he still took his time, double-checking everything before submitting his answers.
When the hour was up, Nora came over to collect the test. "How did you do?" she asked, a hint of excitement in her voice.
He smiled and said, "I think I did pretty well." He hoped he had, anyway. The questions had been tricky, but he had worked hard to master the material and he was confident that he had done enough to pass.
Nora looked at him with a nod. "You're right," she said. "You've done a great job. You've passed."
He grinned, feeling a sense of relief and satisfaction wash over him. He had done it. He had passed the final test and he could finally move on to the next stage of his life.
"Congratulations," Nora said, extending her hand for him to shake. "You've worked hard and earned your place in this program. I have no doubt you will go on to great things."
He took her hand and shook it firmly. "Thank you," he said. "I couldn't have done it without you."
Nora smiled and patted him on the back. "You're welcome," she said. "Now get out there and make your dreams come true."
