924 words (3 pages) Essay in English Literature. After being exposed to a number of hardships and difficulties, such as starvation, isolation, and the death of loved ones, the characters in The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, and The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, learn valuable lessons about survival, resilience, and the importance of hope.
The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, is a novel that explores the struggles of the Joad family, who are forced to leave their home in Oklahoma during the Great Depression. The novel examines the impact of industrialization on rural communities, and how the Joads must adapt to new economic conditions in order to survive. Through the experiences of the Joads, Steinbeck highlights the importance of hope, resilience, and community in the face of adversity.
One of the most significant themes in The Grapes of Wrath is the idea that hope is a vital component of human survival. Despite facing incredible hardships, including poverty, illness, and loss, the Joads maintain their hope for a better future. This hope is fueled by their faith in each other, as well as their belief in the possibility of a brighter future. For example, when Ma Joad is diagnosed with cancer, she remains optimistic about her prospects, telling Tom, "I ain't goin' to die. I got too much livin' still to do" (Steinbeck 217). This determination to hold on to hope in the face of adversity serves as a source of strength and inspiration for the entire family.
Another important theme in The Grapes of Wrath is the importance of resilience in the face of hardship. The Joads are forced to endure countless challenges, including poverty, illness, and displacement. However, they manage to persevere through their resourcefulness and determination. For instance, when the family is forced to abandon their farm, they must rely on their own ingenuity to survive, using their limited resources to construct a makeshift home in a nearby orchard. Through these experiences, Steinbeck highlights the importance of resilience in ensuring survival (Steinbeck 275).
Finally, The Grapes of Wrath emphasizes the significance of community in times of hardship. The Joads are not able to overcome their challenges alone, but rather rely on each other for support and encouragement. For example, when Tom is injured while working in a migrant camp, his family rallies around him, providing emotional and practical support. This sense of community is essential in helping the Joads survive and maintain their dignity in the face of adversity (Steinbeck 301).
In contrast, The Old Man and the Sea, written by Ernest Hemingway, tells the story of an aging fisherman named Santiago, who goes out to sea alone and catches a giant marlin. Through his experiences, Hemingway explores themes of perseverance, dignity, and the importance of personal identity.
One of the most significant themes in The Old Man and the Sea is the idea that perseverance is necessary for survival. Santiago faces numerous challenges during his time at sea, including a lack of food and water, as well as the exhaustion of fishing for multiple days without catching anything. However, he continues to fish, despite these difficulties, demonstrating his determination to succeed (Hemingway 52). This perseverance is a source of strength and inspiration for Santiago, allowing him to maintain his dignity in the face of adversity.
Another important theme in The Old Man and the Sea is the concept of personal identity. Hemingway highlights the importance of maintaining one's sense of self in the face of hardship. Despite his advanced age and physical decline, Santiago remains determined to catch a fish, demonstrating his commitment to his craft and his sense of purpose (Hemingway 84). This dedication to his personal identity allows him to maintain his dignity and independence in the face of adversity.
In conclusion, The Grapes of Wrath and The Old Man and the Sea are both novels that explore the themes of hope, resilience, and community in times of hardship. Through the experiences of the Joad family and Santiago, respectively, these works highlight the importance of maintaining a sense of purpose and identity in order to survive and thrive in challenging circumstances. By examining these novels alongside each other, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of how hope, resilience, and community contribute to human survival in the face of adversity.
