 break in! '' You say cautiously, not wanting to rush into anything without a plan. 
The other members of your party nod in agreement with you and prepare for entry. As you open the door and enter, you notice that it is much darker inside than outside, almost as if it was some sort of enchanted night. You see a faint light up ahead, but it seems to be moving around. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness, holding a lantern high above its head. 
As the figure comes closer you can see that it is a tall, slender man with wild hair and a long white beard. He's dressed in tattered robes and carries a staff made of dark wood. He looks at you with an unblinking gaze and speaks in a low, raspy voice. 
"Who dares disturb the resting place of the great Nyarlothep?" he says in a slow, measured tone. "Leave now, or face the consequences." 
What do you do? ``.start`''
Please pick one of the following options:

B) Try to reason with him and convince him that you're only here to find Nyarlothep's treasure.
C) Use your magic to try and disable or disorient him.
