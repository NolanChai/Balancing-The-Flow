-member me, even though I can't be there with you in person. 
I hope you're taking care of yourself and your mommy. She must be doing a great job raising you all on her own. You must be growing up to be a big and strong little boy now! I bet you can walk and talk by now, and maybe even do some simple math problems in school!
I know it's been hard for you without me around, but try to remember that I love you very much, Sammy. Even though I can't be there to play with you or read you bedtime stories, you are always on my mind and in my heart. 
Keep being a good boy and make your mommy proud! She deserves it after all she's been through without me. Maybe someday we'll see each other again, but until then, know that I love you more than anything in the world, little one. Your dad.
