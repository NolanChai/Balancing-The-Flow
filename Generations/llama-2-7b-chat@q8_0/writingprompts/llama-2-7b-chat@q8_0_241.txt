ainted space. A quest for purity and control. They found us in our innocence, in a time when we still believed that the stars were far beyond our reach. They came with fire and steel, burning our cities to ash and bending our metal to their will. They took what they wanted and left us to scream in the darkness.

We fought back, as any civilization would. We banded together, united against a common foe. We had no weapons of war, only courage and determination. But we fought on, refusing to yield to their brutal might. And slowly but surely, we began to push them back. To reclaim our worlds, to rebuild our shattered dreams.
But the war is never truly over. Even now as I write these words, I can hear the distant rumble of engines, the distant boom of cannons. The invaders still linger on the fringes of our solar system, waiting for their chance to strike again. For they know that we are not yet defeated, that we will continue to resist until our very last breath is exhaled.
And so I write these words, not just as a historian but as a survivor. As one who lived through the horrors of war and emerged scarred but unbroken. For in the face of such overwhelming odds, it is the human spirit that truly shines. It is the unyielding will to live, to fight for what we believe in, that has kept us alive through these darkest of times.
And so I will continue to write, to chronicle our struggles and triumphs. For in doing so, I hope to inspire others to stand tall against the forces of darkness. To never yield, never surrender, no matter the odds. For it is only when we stand together that we can truly be victorious.
