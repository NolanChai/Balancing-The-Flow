 casting eerie shadows on the walls as she moves it around.
She sees a small pile of dust in front of the stairs leading down to the lower levels of the bunker. As Jen approaches, she realizes that it’s more than just dust—there are tiny specks of what looks like blood scattered among the larger particles. Her heart races as she cautiously moves closer to investigate.
As she leans in to examine the substance more closely, a faint noise catches her ear. It sounds like someone or something is moving deeper in the bunker. Jen spins around quickly, shining the flashlight in every direction in an attempt to locate the source of the sound. But it seems to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

A) Investigate the noise immediately, trying to find the source.
B) Ignore the noise for now and continue searching the bunker.
C) Call out to see if anyone or anything is there.
