 ntually a thing of the past.
My name is Alistair and I’m the chief engineer of this vessel, which was why I had been spared the cramped quarters everyone else had to endure. But it wasn’t much better in my own room. The small space was cluttered with tools, manuals, and various pieces of technology that i had scavenged over the years. 
I sighed as I fiddled with a circuit board on the desk, my mind wandering back to Earth. It felt like an eternity since i had last seen it. The thought of it made me ache in a way that only a few others could understand. But there was little time for nostalgia here. We still had a job to do and my thoughts needed to be on the task at hand, not lost in memories of home.
There were five of us who had banded together for this mission: Captain Alexei Zorin, Dr. Sophia Patel our resident scientist, navigator/communications expert Jian-Yang Lee and medical officer Dr. Elara Taygeta. All of us had a reason to be here; some more urgent than others.
Captain Zorin was on this mission for the money, but also because he was determined to prove that man could survive out here in the vacuum of space without any significant technological assistance. Dr. Patel’s research was invaluable as they raced against time to find a cure for an alien virus that threatened human existence back home, and Jian Yang Lee was here because he loved exploring the unknown and this mission seemed like the biggest adventure of them all.
Dr Elara Taygeta meanwhile was on a quest to better understand this strange new universe we found ourselves in after leaving Earth, while I was here purely for the challenge; to push beyond the limits of my own capabilities as an engineer.
But even with all our expertise and combined motivations, we knew the odds were against us. We were up against some of the most hostile conditions this side of the galaxy, and that didn’t count what might be lurking out there in the depths beyond the reaches of our sensors.
I pushed my chair back from the desk, stretching my long legs out to relax against the wall as i took a deep breath. “Anything else you want to add?” I asked the others, and Captain Zorin looked up from his own console.
“Just that we need to keep moving forward,” he said. “We’re running low on supplies and time.”
Jian-Yang Lee nodded in agreement. “And if we don’t find something soon, we might just be the first ones to meet our end out here.”
Dr Elara Taygeta leaned back in her chair, lost in thought while Dr Sophia Patel scribbled some notes onto a pad of paper before speaking up again. “I think it would be wise to begin scanning for any signs of life or technology beyond the nearest planet,” she said.
“Agreed.” Captain Zorin replied before turning back to his console, and i followed suit with my own work, knowing full well that this journey was far from over and that we still had countless obstacles ahead of us but also an unlimited amount of opportunities for growth and exploration.
