ute little constellation that looked like a bunny, and suddenly, it transformed into a handsome young man right before my eyes! He had piercing blue eyes, chiseled features, and jet black hair with a hint of curls at the ends. My jaw dropped as he approached me, smiling mischievously from ear to ear.
“Hello there!” I squeaked out in surprise, trying to hide my embarrassment at being caught stargazing.
The young man chuckled and held out his hand for me to shake. “My name is Leo,” he said with a charming smile. “And you are?”
I hesitated for a moment before taking his hand, feeling an instant spark of electricity as our palms touched. “I-I’m Lily,” I stammered, my heart racing at the unexpected encounter.
Leo nodded and gestured to the stars above us. “Beautiful night for stargazing, isn’t it?” he said, his eyes twinkling with amusement. “What brings you out here tonight?”
I shrugged, feeling a little embarrassed by my silly habit of singing nursery rhymes to the stars. But Leo just laughed and joined in, singing along softly as we gazed up at the sky together. And before I knew it, the night had passed and the sun was rising, casting a warm glow over everything.
As we said our goodbyes and promised to meet again under the same starry sky, I couldn’t help but wonder if this chance encounter with Leo would lead to something more. Only time would tell, but for now, I was content to simply enjoy the magic of that enchanted night, bathed in the soft light of the morning sun.
