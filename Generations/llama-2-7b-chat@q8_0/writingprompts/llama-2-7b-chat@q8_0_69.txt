 the hall, he opened one and motioned for me to enter. I hesitated, my heart racing with fear as I peered inside at the person waiting there. 
It was a woman in a white robe, her face serene and peaceful as she gazed up at us. She slowly raised a hand in greeting as we entered the small room, and I felt some of my anxiety melt away in response to her kind smile. The man closed the door behind us and stepped back, giving me space to approach the woman and introduce myself.
"Hello," I said tentatively, trying to hide my shaking voice. "I'm Lily."
The woman's eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled wider, and she reached out to take my hand in her own. "It's nice to meet you, Lily. My name is Sarah."
I felt a strange sense of comfort in this woman's presence, as if we shared some secret knowledge that I couldn't quite grasp yet. She seemed to understand me in a way that no one else ever had, and for that reason alone, I felt drawn to her. As we talked, I began to feel more at ease, my fear giving way to a sense of wonder and curiosity about this mysterious place and the people who inhabited it.
