 American's presence at the hotel lobby and found myself drawn to him. He was tall and imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through you.

I must have been staring at him too long because he caught my eye and gave a small smile before turning away. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized he might be interested in speaking to me. So, when the elevator doors opened and we both stepped inside, I hesitated for a moment before joining him.
The ride was quiet at first, with just the hum of the elevator's machinery filling the small space between us. But as the floors ticked down, the American broke the silence by asking me where I was from. I told him my name and my hometown in Poland, and he nodded thoughtfully before asking if I had been to America before.

I shook my head, feeling a pang of nervousness as his eyes met mine once more. "No," I replied quietly, "this is my first time." He smiled again, and for a moment, I felt like he was looking at me with a hint of sadness in his eyes. Then the doors opened, and we both stepped out onto the ground floor.

"It's nice to meet you," he said, extending a hand. I took it hesitantly, feeling a spark of electricity as our palms touched. "I'm John."

"I'm Marta," I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. And with that, we parted ways, each of us continuing on our own journey through this strange and fascinating country. As I watched him walk away, I couldn't help but wonder if our paths would cross again someday.
