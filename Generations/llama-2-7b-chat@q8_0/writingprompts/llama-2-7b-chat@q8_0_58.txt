vered in the air as he stood frozen.
This was not right, he thought. He must be dreaming. He pinched himself and felt pain at the contact, indicating that he was indeed awake. But as his senses came back to him, he realized it didn't matter whether this was a dream or reality—he was still trapped in this strange situation with no way out.
He stumbled forward blindly, hoping against hope that he would find an exit from the small space he found himself in. He groped around him with his hands until they hit something hard and smooth. It took a moment to understand what it was—the stone wall of a tomb.
Sweat broke out on his forehead as he realized where he must be. His mind raced, trying to make sense of the situation. The smell of burning flesh lingered in his nostrils like a curse, and he could almost hear the distant screams of the dead echoing through his mind.
He knew then that he was in the land of the dead. He had entered this dark realm without even knowing it, lost in his own nightmares until now. The weight of his fate bore down on him like a boulder, crushing any last hope he might have had for escape.
