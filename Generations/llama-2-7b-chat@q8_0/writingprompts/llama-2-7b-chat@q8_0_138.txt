. It was a tough time for Thulgaria and she’d been moping around her cave ever since.
One day, while lounging in the sun, she heard a strange noise coming from outside her cave. She peeked out the entrance and saw a group of young dragons playing a game of dragon tag. They were all running around, flapping their wings, and shouting with laughter.
Thulgaria watched them for a while, feeling a twinge of loneliness in her heart. She hadn’t played with other dragons in ages. It was time to get back out there and reconnect with her fellow dragon kind. So, she put on her best smile, fluffed up her scales, and strolled out of her cave to join the game.
The young dragons squealed with delight as Thulgaria approached them. They ran up to her, their little wings beating rapidly as they buzzed around her. Thulgaria chuckled and gave them each a friendly nudge with her snout. “What’s this game you younglings are playing?” she asked.
“It’s dragon tag!” one of them exclaimed. “You have to chase each other and touch noses.”
Thulgaria blinked, confused for a moment before realizing what they meant. She let out a rumbling laugh and joined in the game with gusto. The young dragons cheered as she chased them around, her wings flapping wildly as she pursued them. It was so much fun! Thulgaria felt like a kid again, playing with her fellow dragons without a care in the world.
As the game came to an end and the sun began to set, Thulgaria said goodbye to the young dragons and returned to her cave, feeling rejuvenated. She realized that it was time to start living life to the fullest again and make new friends along the way. And so, she went back out there and started playing with other dragons whenever she could. Thulgaria was no longer a lonely 40-something-century old divorcee; she was a happy, playful dragon once again!
