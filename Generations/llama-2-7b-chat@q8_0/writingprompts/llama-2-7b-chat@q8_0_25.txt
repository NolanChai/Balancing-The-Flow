 time that had happened this year. The truth was, I had been running late almost every day for the past month. My boss and coworkers were getting fed up with me and my constant excuses. 
  But what could I do? My train was always delayed or canceled. And when it wasn't that, I got stuck in traffic. Or sometimes, like today, I overslept and woke up just as I was supposed to leave for work.  
  It was a vicious cycle of excuses and tardiness. And even though I knew I had to break the pattern, I couldn't seem to shake off the habit of being late. It was like I was stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again, always arriving after the scheduled time. 
  I knew my boss wasn't happy with me, but I didn't know what else to do. I had tried setting multiple alarms, planning my route ahead of time, and even waking up earlier. But no matter what I did, I couldn't seem to avoid the constant delays. 
  As I walked into the office that morning, I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, watching me as I made my way to my desk. I knew they were all thinking the same thing: when is she going to learn? When is she going to start being on time for once?  
  But deep down, I knew they didn't really care. They just wanted me to stop making excuses and start showing up on time like everyone else. And maybe, just maybe, one day I would finally get it together and make a change.
