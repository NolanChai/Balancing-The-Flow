work when he could relax in his home. Soon as he left the office, Jack made a beeline for his home which is just a five-minute drive away from the workplace. As he approached his house, he noticed that it looked different than usual. It was dark and gloomy, unlike the brightly lit building he had left earlier in the day. Jack's heart skipped a beat as he sensed something was off. He quickly opened the door to find out what was going on only to find an eerie silence inside the house. His wife, who always greeted him with a warm smile and a hot meal, wasn't there. The kitchen light was off and all the dishes were still in the sink. The living room was dark and empty, and Jack could hear his own heavy breathing echoing through the emptiness of his home. Where was his wife? Why didn't she greet him when he got home? He started to panic, feeling a wave of fear wash over him. His mind raced with thoughts of what could have happened to her and why she wasn't answering him when he called out for her. Jack knew he had to find his wife and make sure she was safe. He checked the rest of the house, but there was no sign of his wife anywhere. It was as if she had vanished into thin air. He searched outside too, calling out for her but there was only silence in response. As the minutes ticked by, Jack's fear turned to dread. Where could his wife be? What could have happened to her? He tried to stay calm and think rationally, but it was no use. All he could do was wait and hope that she would come back soon. The darkness inside the house seemed to grow thicker as the minutes passed, making Jack feel trapped and alone. His heart raced with fear and worry, his mind filled with thoughts of the worst-case scenarios. He knew he had to keep searching for his wife until he found her, no matter how long it took. But as he continued his search, Jack couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong. It was almost as if a veil of darkness had descended upon his home and taken his wife away from him forever.
