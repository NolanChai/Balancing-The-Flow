bh it's really not cool to stare at someone that long without their consent. I hope I don't come off as creepy... ''
You can play the game if you want, but first you need to get permission from the man on the couch. You approach him cautiously and ask if it's okay to join in. He looks at you with a mixture of confusion and annoyance, and tells you that he's not interested in playing games with you.
Do you:
A) Persist and try to convince him to play with you anyway
B) Respect his decision and find someone else to play with
C) Try to find out more about him and why he's not interested in playing games
D) Get frustrated and leave the room
E) Other (please specify in comments)
