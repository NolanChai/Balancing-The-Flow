oundings, then quickly glances back at the ground.
It’s like she can feel that the world around her is watching her. Waiting to pounce on any moment of vulnerability. That’s why she keeps her head down and avoids eye contact with everyone and everything. It’s a defense mechanism, a coping mechanism. Whatever it takes to keep from falling apart completely.
She walks with the grace of a wounded animal, each step tentative and slow. Her eyes dart back and forth as she scans her surroundings, but her focus is on the ground at her feet. She’s not sure what she’s looking for, just something to make her feel safe, something to keep her from falling further down into this abyss of sadness.
Her heart races as she walks, pounding in her chest like a trapped bird trying to escape its cage. Her breath comes in short, ragged gasps that are barely audible over the sound of her own thoughts. She can’t stop thinking about what happened, about how her whole life has been turned upside down and inside out.
She feels like she’s drowning, suffocating under the weight of her grief. Like there’s a giant hand closing around her throat, choking the life out of her. She can’t scream for help or even cry out for mercy because she’s too numb, too frozen in shock to make any sound at all.
She walks on and on, through streets that blur together, past buildings that indistinguishable, until she has no idea where she is or where she’s going. She just keeps moving forward, hoping that someday, somehow, things will get better.
That's the moment when she hears a voice, soft and gentle, calling out to her from beneath the shadows of a nearby alleyway. It's a voice that speaks with kindness and compassion, a voice that tells her everything is going to be okay. It's a voice that makes her feel seen and heard, like someone understands what she’s going through.
For the first time since it all happened, she feels a glimmer of hope, a tiny flicker of light in the darkness. Maybe things can get better after all, maybe there is a way to heal from this kind of pain, to find some semblance of peace again. And with that thought, she looks up and sees him, standing in front of her with a warm smile on his face and a gentle tone in his voice.
