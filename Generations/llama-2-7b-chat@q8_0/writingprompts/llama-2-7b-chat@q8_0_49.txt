 stuck inside babysitting a bunch of underage kids who were already hammered at 8 PM. It was 3 AM now, and the noise level outside showed no signs of abating. 'God I hate parties,' Pete muttered to himself as he rubbed his eyes, still trying to fight off the lingering effects of the cheap whiskey he had drank during the party. A sudden loud crash from the living room made him jump, and he quickly rushed out to investigate. As he entered the room, he saw Shelly's brother, Mark, lying on the floor in a heap, with his girlfriend, Amy, frantically trying to revive him. `Oh great, this is just what I needed,' Pete thought to himself as he rushed over to help. 'How the hell did he manage to fall off the couch?' `Did he hit his head or something?'' Pete asked Amy, who was now crying hysterically and shaking her head in disbelief. She shook her head again, muttering something about Mark having a seizure before collapsing. As Pete helped lift Mark onto the couch, he felt a sudden wave of panic wash over him. 'Oh man, this is serious,' he thought to himself as he realized that Mark might actually be having some kind of medical emergency. `I need to call an ambulance or something!' But before Pete could even move, the front door burst open and Shelly stormed in, a look of pure terror on her face. `What happened?'' she screamed at Amy, who was still crying uncontrollably. `Did he have another seizure?' 'Oh my God, what do I do?' Shelly exclaimed, rushing over to where Pete and Amy were trying to revive Mark. `I think we should call an ambulance,' Pete suggested calmly, but even as he spoke, he could hear the sound of sirens approaching in the distance. As they waited for the paramedics to arrive, Pete couldn't help feeling a sense of relief wash over him. 'At least this party is finally coming to an end', he thought to himself with a sigh, as he watched Shelly and Amy frantically trying to comfort each other and Mark, who was still unconscious on the couch. `What a nightmare,' Pete muttered under his breath, wondering how much longer this ordeal would last. 'God help me if I have to babysit these kids for another hour.'
