You find yourself trapped in a dark cave, the walls made of rough stone and the floor slick with moisture. You can hear the distant sound of dripping water echoing off the walls, and the faintest glow of luminescent mushrooms provides just enough light to see by. You are bound hand and foot by a sturdy rope, and you can't remember how you got here or what happened before you ended up in this predicament.
You look around, trying to get your bearings. To your left, the cave splits off into two separate tunnels. One looks narrower and more narrowly defined, while the other is wider and more meandering. You can't see very far down either tunnel, as they both seem to fade into darkness after just a few feet.
To your right, there appears to be a small chamber or room, partially obscured by a thick curtain of vines and moss. The curtain is motionless, but you can sense a faint hum of energy emanating from within the room.
You have three options:
A) Take the narrower tunnel to the left, hoping to find a way out of the cave more quickly.
B) Go through the wider tunnel to the right, which may lead to a different part of the cave or even a secret passage.
C) Pull the curtain aside and enter the chamber, which may hold some hidden danger or unexpected reward.
