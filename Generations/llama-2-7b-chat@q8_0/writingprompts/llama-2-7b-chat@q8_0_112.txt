And as I closed my eyes, letting out a contented sigh, the smell of home-cooked food wafted in from the kitchen. It was a warm, savoury scent—one that evoked memories of childhood dinners and long winter afternoons spent curled up by the fireplace with a good book. I felt myself drifting off into a gentle doze, my thoughts tumbling in a jumble of happy memories. And before I knew it, I was fast asleep.

I opened my eyes to find that the room had shifted around me, transforming into an unrecognisable landscape of dark greens and deep blues. It was as if I had been transported to another world. The silence was almost deafening, broken only by the distant sound of a river burbling in the distance.
As I sat there, trying to make sense of my surroundings, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with long, flowing hair and eyes that seemed to see right through me. She approached me with slow, deliberate steps, her movements almost hypnotic in their grace. And as she drew nearer, I felt a strange sensation—a feeling of being drawn into another world.
"Welcome," she said, her voice low and husky. "I have been waiting for you."
