   "Life in prison?" I asked. 
   He shook his head. "You know, sometimes I wish we could just round up all these old farts and put 'em on an island where they can't hurt anyone.'' 
    As the guard continued to rant, I realized that he was n't much different from me. Both of us were just trying to make sense of a world that didn't always make sense.  
        But as the days passed, I began to notice something strange. The guard seemed to be growing younger, his face smoothing out, his movements becoming more springy. And then one day, he turned to me and grinned. 
    "Hey, kid," he said. "Guess what? I'm only 25 now!"  
        I stared at him in disbelief. "How is that possible?" I asked. 
       He shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe it's the island. Maybe it's just the power of positive thinking."  
      As I watched the guard grow younger and younger, I realized that maybe there was something to that. Maybe the key to happiness was n't found in escaping reality, but in embracing it. And so I stopped trying to escape and started living my life to the fullest, even as the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into years. 
        Because in the end, it 's not about how long we live, but how we choose to live our lives that truly matters.
