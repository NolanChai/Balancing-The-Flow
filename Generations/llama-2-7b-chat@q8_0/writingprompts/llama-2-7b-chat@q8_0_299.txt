etergent boxes once but the smell was too much so now they sat as decoration, a reminder of simpler times.
When my son would visit he would pick them up and toss them in the air laughing at their heavy weightlessness, "like playing with rocks from space!" he'd exclaim. I'd sit back smiling watching him play.
Now, after I lost my job, after we lost our home, they are gone. Vanished like most of what I hold dear. Like so many things in life, the weight and feel of those tungsten balls is something that can never be replicated no matter how much I try to find new hobbies or distractions from my woes. They were a part of a simpler time, before we faced our darkest moments together.
I miss them more than anything now."
