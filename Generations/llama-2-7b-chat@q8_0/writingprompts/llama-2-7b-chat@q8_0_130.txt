 It's hard to say. The only thing that is constant is the nothingness. The space between breaths is vast and endless. And yet there is no fear of suffocation in this emptiness. Only acceptance. The acceptance that I am here, nowhere else, and that this too shall pass.
I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started but I think it was around the time my parents got divorced. They were always fighting and it was scary to be in the middle of it all. And then they just stopped talking to each other and that was even scarier. I felt like I lost both of them at once.
I tried to talk to them about how I was feeling but they didn't want to listen. They were too busy being mad at each other. So I just kept it all inside and pretended like everything was okay. But it wasn't. It was far from okay.
I started isolating myself more and more. Spending hours in my room alone, lost in my own thoughts. That was when the depression really set in. The anxiety came later, a few years ago. It started with little things, like feeling nervous about school or work. But then it progressed to full-blown panic attacks and I couldn't leave my house without having an attack.
I tried medication but it didn't really help that much. I tried therapy too, but I didn't click with the therapist. She was nice enough but she just didn't get me. And I felt like she wasn't doing anything to help me.
So here I am today, feeling nothing and everywhere at once. It's hard to describe really. Like I said, there's no itch or pain or strange breeze. Just this vast emptiness that permeates every cell of my body. And yet, despite it all, I feel a sense of acceptance. An acceptance that this is just how things are right now and that they will pass.
It's hard to have hope when you're feeling like this but I'm trying to hold on to it anyway. Hope that one day things will get better, that the emptiness will lift and I'll be able to feel something again. Something good, at least. Until then, I'll just keep existing in this limbo state of nothingness.
