ash out the window, watching the stars twinkle in the night sky. A couple of days before I had gone to see my doctor about my recurring eye floaters, which had started bothering me again after a year without any problems. *I'm sure it's nothing serious... * I told myself as I drifted off into a light sleep.
But then the dream came, and I was no longer in my bedroom staring at the ceiling. Instead, I found myself standing on a vast, open plain with the sun shining brightly overhead. The sky was a brilliant blue and dotted with fluffy white clouds. *What place is this? * I wondered as I gazed around at the unfamiliar landscape. As I walked across the plain, I noticed something strange happening in my vision. My eye floaters were moving more quickly than they had before, and I could see new ones that I had never seen before. They seemed to be swirling around me in a vortex, pulling me towards them with their gravitational force. *What's going on? * I thought as fear began to creep into my mind.
As I continued walking, the floaters grew more numerous and more aggressive. They started to merge together, forming a giant mass that was pulling me deeper into its vortex. *I have to get away... * I told myself frantically, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape the pull of the floaters. *What's happening to me? * I screamed internally as the vortex grew stronger and tighter around me, threatening to suck me in completely.
Just when all hope seemed lost, I woke up with a start back in my bedroom. My heart was racing, and I was covered in sweat. It took me a few moments to catch my breath before realizing that the dream had ended. *That was just a dream... * I told myself reassuringly as I lay back down and closed my eyes, hoping that tomorrow would bring better news from my doctor about my eye floaters.
