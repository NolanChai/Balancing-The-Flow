ila, nothing much happened here unless you were born and raised here like he had been. He had always loved this place despite its humble reputation. Theo's dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail as he walked down the cobblestone street. He could hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore in the distance, and smell the salty sea air wafting through the streets.
As he walked past the old tavern, the door swung open and out came a young woman with bright blue eyes and long blonde hair. She was dressed in a simple white tunic and brown leggings, and her bare feet kicked up small stones as she ran down the street. Theo watched her go, his eyes fixed on the way her hair bounced with each step.
"Good morngin'!" she called out to him as she passed by.
"Mornin'." He replied, still watchin gher ass as she disappeared around the corner.
He had seen her before, but never talked to her. She was a few years younger than him and he wasn't sure if she would even remember him. He continued on his walk, lost in thought as he watched her disappear from view.
