Oh, wow! *blinks* I didn't realize it was still available. Let me check the price real quick. *pauses* Well, it's actually a bit more expensive than I thought. It's going for $500 right now. *smiles hesitantly* But, uh, I'm sure you'll find someone who's willing to pay that much. *nervous laughter*

How about you? Are you interested in buying it?

Are you kidding me?! That's way too expensive. I can get a better one for half the price.

Oh, come on. It's not that good. Trust me, you don't want to buy it.

Really? That much? Okay, I'll take it.

What do you think?

I understand, but it's a high-quality television and worth every penny. It has all the latest features and is in excellent condition. I've had it for a while now and have taken great care of it. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

Oh, I see. Well, I can offer you a discount if you're interested. We've had some issues with the production line, so we're willing to cut a bit of the price to make sure it goes to a good home. How about $2000?

Sure, here is my response to continue the dialogue:

You're willing to pay $2000 for this TV? That's still a bit too expensive for me. I was hoping to get it for around $1500 at most.

Oh . 

I see . Well , I can give you a deal . How about we meet in the middle at $2200 ?
