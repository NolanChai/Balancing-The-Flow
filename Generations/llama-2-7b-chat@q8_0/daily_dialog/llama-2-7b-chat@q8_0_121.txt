I started blogging back in 2018. It was something I had always wanted to do, but never had the time or motivation until then. I was working a corporate job at the time and was feeling really unfulfilled. So, I decided to take a break and try my hand at writing a blog. It's been a great outlet for me and has allowed me to express myself in ways that I never could before.

I usually write about my daily experiences and observations as an international student in the US. I find that sharing my thoughts and feelings can help me process my emotions and connect with others who may be going through similar situations. I also enjoy writing about cultural differences and similarities, as well as tips and advice for other international students who are navigating the American education system.

I usually write two to three times a week. I find it difficult to keep up with the frequency of posts, especially since I have a busy schedule. But I try my best to maintain a consistent posting schedule so that my readers know when to expect new content from me.

Yes, I am still updating my blog. I try to post at least once a week, but sometimes it can be more frequent depending on what's going on in my life. I enjoy sharing my experiences and thoughts with others, and I find it to be a great way to reflect on my time here in the US.
