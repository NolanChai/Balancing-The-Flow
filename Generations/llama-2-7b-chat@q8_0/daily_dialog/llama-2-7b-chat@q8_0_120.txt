[Warning: Short generation] I could handle the food. How about we do a potluck? That way everyone can bring their favorite dish and we can have a diverse spread. What do you think?

Okay, great! So we're planning a formal office party. Let me see... how about we do a wine and cheese tasting? It's always a hit with adults and it's not too expensive. Plus, it's something different from the usual buffet or cocktail party. What do you think?

I think having American food would be the best choice. How about we do a buffet with some classic dishes like burgers, BBQ chicken, and mac and cheese?

 Great idea! I was thinking we could also have some desserts like apple pie and brownies. What do you think?

I think a formal affair with American food and a good DJ would be perfect for the office party. How about we start planning the details now? Let me take care of the food, and you can handle the entertainment?

Great! I'll start looking for catering services and make sure they can provide us with a variety of American dishes. For the DJ, do you have any preferences on what kind of music he should play?
