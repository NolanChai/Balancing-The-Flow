Oh, I see. Well, I think it's important for kids to have a balance between technology and other activities. While computers can be great tools for learning and developing logical thinking skills, they shouldn't replace more traditional activities like sports, music, or art. These activities help kids develop their creativity, problem-solving skills, and fine motor skills, which are all important for cognitive development.
I also think it's important to set limits on computer use and make sure kids have time for other activities. Excessive screen time can be detrimental to a child's development, leading to things like obesity, sleep problems, and social isolation. It's important to find a balance between technology and other activities that promote overall health and well-being.
