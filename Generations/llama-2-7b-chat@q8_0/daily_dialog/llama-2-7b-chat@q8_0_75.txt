Oh no, don't worry! You can easily fix that by sending in the form right away. Just log into your account and you'll see a "Continue Claim" option. Click on that and fill out the form with all the necessary information. If you have any issues, feel free to give us a call and we'll be happy to help.

Of course! Go ahead and send the Continued Claim Form in as soon as possible. If you can, please try to submit it before the week ends so we can process it in time for next week's payment. And just a reminder, make sure to fill out the form completely and accurately, including any changes in your situation since your last claim. Thank you!

Of course, you can mail it in early next time. Just make sure to send it in at least fourteen days before the due date to avoid any penalties or delays. If you're unsure about the status of your claim or have any questions, feel free to give us a call and we'll be happy to help.

Of course! Here is a response for the continuation of the dialogue:
Oh, okay. Yes, I did send in my Continued Claim Form for the last period. I think I just forgot to send it in this time around.
You're right, it's important to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid. Can I send it in now?
Actually, you cannot mail it in early. As you said, it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date. Is there any way to check if my claim form has been received and processed?
Will my paycheck come right away now?
