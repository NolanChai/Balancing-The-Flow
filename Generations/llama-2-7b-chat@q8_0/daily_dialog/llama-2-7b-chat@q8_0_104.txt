Oh, great! My wife and I are both really excited for him to turn six. We've got a big party planned for him on his birthday. As for who's looking after him, we have a great nanny who takes care of him during the day while my wife and I are at work. She's been with us for a few years now and we trust her completely.

Thanks, I feel very fortunate. My son is the light of my life. He's such a curious and energetic little boy, always eager to learn and explore new things. And my mother-in-law has been a huge help in taking care of him while I'm at work. She's been a fantastic grandmother, and I'm so grateful to have her in our lives.
