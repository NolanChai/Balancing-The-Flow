I do enjoy watching action movies, but I don't think it's good to constantly glorify violence in films. It can have a negative impact on society and desensitize people to the consequences of violence. However, I also believe that well-made thrillers can be entertaining and thought-provoking, as long as they don't promote gratuitous violence or harmful stereotypes. What about you? Do you have any favorite action movies or filmmakers?
