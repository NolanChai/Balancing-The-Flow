Thanks, nice to meet you too. Yeah, my boss needed these files for a meeting tomorrow, so he asked me to pick them up and bring them back. I didn't know you worked here either, that's cool. How do you like it? I've been working here for two years now.

[Warning: Short generation] "Yeah, my boss said something was urgent and needed to be taken care of right away. I didn't realize you worked here too! It's nice to meet you."

Oh, I see. Well, I'm just here to pick up some papers for my boss. It's nice to meet you though. Yeah, I can imagine how busy it must get around here during peak seasons. How did you like being a trainee? Was it helpful in your career growth?

Yeah, that's great to hear.I'm sure you will get plenty of experience and learn a lot while working here.It can be challenging at times but it's definitely rewarding in the end.How do you like the company so far?
