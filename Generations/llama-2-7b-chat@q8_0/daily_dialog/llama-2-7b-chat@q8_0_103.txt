[Warning: Short generation] "I'm not asking for your permission, Mr. Banker! I've already taken the money and spent it on a new car. It's too late to do anything about it now!"

I don't know why you keep accusing me of cheating! I didn't take any money without permission. When you pass Go, you collect $200, and that's it. You can't just take more money without asking the bank first. And I'm the banker, so you have to ask me for money. It's not my fault if you don't understand the rules of the game.
