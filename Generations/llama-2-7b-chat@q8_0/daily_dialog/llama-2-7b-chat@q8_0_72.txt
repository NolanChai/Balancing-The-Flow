"Yes, it's great to see the promotion campaign for our new product doing well. We've made a record sale this season and it's all thanks to the hard work of the marketing department. I heard they conducted thorough research for three months and provided regular feedback to the R&D center, which helped them redesign the product twice before launching it into the market. It's not an easy job, but it's definitely paying off."
