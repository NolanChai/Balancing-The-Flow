"Yeah, definitely. I find it really relaxing and enjoyable to listen to. But hey, being intelligent is overrated anyway."

"Oh, I see. Well, I think classical music has a certain depth and complexity that can be very enjoyable to listen to. But hey, being relaxed isn't the only benefit of listening to Mozart! Studies have shown that listening to his music can actually improve cognitive function and memory."

"Oh, I see. Well, I think there's something to be said for both classical and pop music. Classical music does have a certain level of complexity and emotional depth that can be really moving. But at the same time, pop music is catchy and fun, and it can be great for lifting your mood and getting you pumped up. Maybe we just need to find the right balance between the two?"

"Yeah, I can see how Mozart could be considered intellectually stimulating. I've heard that it can improve cognitive functioning and memory," Blake said thoughtfully.
"Really? I've never really thought about it like that before. I just enjoy listening to it because it's so beautiful and evocative," you replied.
"Well, maybe I should give it another shot then," Blake said with a smile. "I do appreciate the emotional depth in classical music, but sometimes I find it too intense for my mood."
"Yeah, I can see that. Pop music is great for when you want to relax and unwind, isn't it?" you asked.
"Definitely. It's like a mental massage after a long day," Blake said with a chuckle. "But hey, to each their own, right?"

"Yeah, I do. I actually practice every day. It's one of my favorite hobbies," Blake said with a smile.
