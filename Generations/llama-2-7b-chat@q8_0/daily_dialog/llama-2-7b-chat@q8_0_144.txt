I see. So, you're saying that the reason food is less expensive in a cafeteria is because they serve themselves? That's an interesting perspective. Can you tell me more about why you think this is the case?

"Wow, that's really interesting! So, you just pick up a tray, add some utensils, and then stand in line? That must be so much faster than waiting in line for each person to order their food individually. I can see how that would make food more affordable too. Do you think they could implement something like this at other cafeterias or restaurants?"

Sure thing! So, you wanna try that green veggie? *chuckles* Just point to it and I'll grab it for ya. Oh, you don't know what it's called? No worries, just give me a nod or a gesture and I'll take care of it. You know, this line moves pretty fast, so you might wanna grab something quick before it's all gone! *winks*
