Oh, no problem! Let me take a look. (pauses) Okay, so it sounds like you're getting an error message when trying to print. Have you tried restarting the printer? Sometimes that can help resolve issues like this.

Oh, no problem! Let me take a look. *pauses* Ah, I see the issue. You need to turn on the switch located on the side of the printer. *points to the switch* It's usually hidden under a flap, so you might have to press it gently to get it to click into place. Once you do that, try printing again and see if it works. Does that make sense?

Of course! Here is the continuation of the dialogue:

Oh no, out of paper? I hope I can help you with that. Let me see... *checks printer* Yeah, it looks like you're running low on ink too. Would you like me to get you some more?
