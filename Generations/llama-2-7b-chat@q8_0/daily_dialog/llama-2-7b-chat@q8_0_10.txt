[Warning: Short generation] I'm not sure if I should take the time to pursue it though, with all my other commitments.

I see, well, I think it's important to have a solid foundation in science, especially if you're planning on pursuing a career in medicine. Non-science majors often struggle with these courses, so enrolling in an introductory course can help give you a better understanding of the material and prepare you for more advanced classes. Additionally, many medical schools require applicants to have taken specific science courses, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, so having this foundation can only help your application.
As for mapping, I think it's important to try to review and practice with different types of problems until you feel more comfortable. Perhaps we could work through some problems together sometime? I'm sure you're not the only one who struggles with mapping, and there are many resources available online that can help you improve your skills.
Overall, I think enrolling in a science course is a good idea for you, especially since you're planning on pursuing a career in medicine. It will help you build a strong foundation and give you the confidence you need to succeed in more advanced classes.
