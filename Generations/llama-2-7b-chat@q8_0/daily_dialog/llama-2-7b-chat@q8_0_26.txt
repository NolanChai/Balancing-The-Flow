I don't know, but I believe that there must be some kind of higher power or intelligence that guides and directs us.

Why do you say that ?

Well, just look at the complexity and diversity of life on Earth. It seems unlikely that it all evolved by chance alone. There must be some kind of design or purpose underlying it all.

But what about free will? Don't you think that our choices and decisions are what truly make us who we are ?

I believe that both free will and a higher power play a role in shaping our lives . Sometimes we make choices that align with our values and beliefs, while other times we may be guided by something beyond ourselves. It's all part of the mystery of life , I think.
