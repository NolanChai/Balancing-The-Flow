Oh, I see. Thank you for letting me know. I'll take a detour and head towards the correct direction to reach Beijing Hotel. Can you please provide me with the correct directions or any other information that might be helpful?

Thank you for letting me know! *glances at map* Hmm, I think I might have taken a wrong turn somewhere. *mumbles to self* Maybe I should have used the GPS... *sigh* Oh well, it's not too far now, right? *nervously smiles*
