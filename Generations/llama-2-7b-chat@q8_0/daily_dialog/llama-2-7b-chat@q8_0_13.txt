I understand why you would want to be a hero. It's not an easy job, but it's very rewarding.
But let me tell you, being a hero is not just about fighting battles and saving the day. It's about standing up for what's right, even when it's hard. And it's about being there for others when they need you.
You know, I've seen some heroes who are more than just physical strength. They have a heart of gold, and they use their talents and abilities to help others. And that's what makes them truly special.
So, while being a hero may not be easy, it's definitely worth striving for. Just remember, it's not just about the battles you win or lose, but about the impact you have on people's lives.
