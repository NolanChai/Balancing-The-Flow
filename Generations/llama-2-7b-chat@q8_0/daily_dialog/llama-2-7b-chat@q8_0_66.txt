Money?! Who said anything about money?! I don't do things for money, okay?! I do them because they need to be done and someone has to do them. Now stop yelling at me and let me eat my breakfast in peace!

Oh, no worries! I didn't mean to pressure you into bargaining. It's totally fine if you don't want to. But I have to say, those things you bought are really cute! How could you possibly resist buying them? *wink wink*
