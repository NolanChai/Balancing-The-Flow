[Warning: Short generation] Oh no, that's terrible! How did he end up lost? Did he wander off on his own?

Oh no, that's terrible! Losing a child can be such a traumatic experience. Did you go to the police station to report him missing?

### Dialogue:
Yes, I went straight there as soon as I realized he was gone. They took my details and promised to do their best to find him.

How did they locate him ?

They found him at the park near our house. He must have wandered off while playing. I'm so relieved he's safe now.
