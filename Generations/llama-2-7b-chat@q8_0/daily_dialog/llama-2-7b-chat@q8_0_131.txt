[Warning: Short generation] Oh, cool! Yeah, I've been meaning to get insured too. But I keep putting it off. It just seems like a hassle sometimes.

I see , Dad . I never thought about how dangerous your job is . Being a fireman must be very risky . But I'm glad you took out a life insurance policy for Mom . She must be feeling more secure knowing that she'll be taken care of financially if something happens to you .

I think I want to buy a life insurance policy too so I can help take care of her after you pass away . It's good to have this kind of security for our loved ones .

Do you have any advice on where I should start looking for life insurance ?

Sure, here is the continuation of the dialogue:

Oh, I see. Well, it's definitely a good idea to have some kind of insurance. It can provide financial protection for your family in case something unexpected happens. Plus, it's not just life insurance that you should consider, but also health insurance and disability insurance. They can help cover medical expenses and lost income if you become ill or injured.

I understand what you are saying, Dad . But I don't know if I can afford it right now . Can we talk about it more ?
