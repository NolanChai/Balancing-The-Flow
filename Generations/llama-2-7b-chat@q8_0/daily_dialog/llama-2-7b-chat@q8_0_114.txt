"I don't know, George. I'm not sure that sleeping in the van is a good idea. It's not very comfortable and it could get pretty cramped with the two of us and all our stuff."

Lili crossed her arms, her eyes narrowing as she studied George. "I don't know, George. I'm not sure I want to sleep in a van for an entire vacation."

Lili looked skeptical. "George, are you sure this is a good idea? We don't have much money left after paying the rent, and we can't afford to spend too much on a vacation."
"Well, Lili, we can visit different places in the state in our van," George countered. "We don't have to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. Trust me, it won't cost that much."
Lili raised an eyebrow. "Where will we sleep?"
"In the van," George replied.
"What about other expenses?" Lili asked, her voice filled with concern.
"Let's see...gas, food, recreation," George said with a grin. "We won't spend much. Come on, don't be hesitant. We need to get out of the house once in a while. We've been working hard, haven't we?"
Lili sighed. "Maybe you're right...When do you plan to go?"

George smiled mischievously. "I've got it! How about we visit my cousin's beach house? It's on the coast, and it's huge! We can drive there in a few hours, and it'll be like a little getaway from everything."
