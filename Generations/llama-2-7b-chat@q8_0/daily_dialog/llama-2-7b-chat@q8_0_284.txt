"Oh, great. Now I'm stuck with a creepy poster in my room."

"Yeah, I know. I just couldn't help it. That movie was freaking terrifying! I keep having nightmares about those creepy kids and that witch. Ugh, I don't think I can ever watch another horror movie again."

"Oh, great. Because that movie was definitely not disturbing at all... *rolls her eyes*"

"Oh, really? Well, I think it was way more than just a little scary. I couldn't sleep last night because of the creepy noises and images from the movie. And don't even get me started on that possessed doll scene. Eek!"

"Hey, May, look, is that the poster of the movie we saw yesterday?"
"Yes, that's right. That's the poster of The Witch."
"May, I really regret watching it with you last night."
"Did it scare you?"

"Of course not. I just thought the movie was...boring."

"Boring? Come on, you clutched to my arm all the time."

"Well, I admit. The ghosts were scary."

"I like scary movies."

"That's Gucci's influence. I love science fiction movies!"

"Of course you do. They are silly stories just for little kids like you."

"Don't call me kid. I am a grownup."

"Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight?"
