No , I don't think so . The roads in Shanghai are quite narrow and winding , especially during rush hour traffic . It would be difficult to navigate with a car without proper knowledge of the city's layout and traffic patterns . Moreover, parking is also a big challenge here . You might end up paying quite a lot for a small space or worse still , getting a ticket for illegal parking . 

But we are planning to visit some of the nearby towns tomorrow . Would it be easier to rent a car there ? Or do you recommend public transportation instead ?
