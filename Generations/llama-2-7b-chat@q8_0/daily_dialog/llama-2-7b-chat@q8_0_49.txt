Thanks for asking! I'm doing well, just looking for some advice on where to go out for dinner tonight. Have you got any recommendations?

Oh, that's too bad. When can I schedule an appointment to see the apartment?

[Warning: Short generation] I'm sorry, but you won't be able to view the apartment for rent today.

Why not?

Of course, it's no problem at all. Let me just check the availability of the apartment for you. *pauses* I apologize, but the earliest available appointment is next Wednesday. Would that time work for you?

Sure, here is a possible response to the dialogue:

Great! I'm glad you're interested in viewing the apartment. Let me just check the availability of the apartment and make sure it's still available for the time you want. (pauses for a moment) Yes, everything looks good. You can definitely schedule an appointment to view the apartment on Friday at 6 PM. Is that still okay with you?
