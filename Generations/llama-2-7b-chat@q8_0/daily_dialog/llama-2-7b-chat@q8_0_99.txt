[Warning: Short generation] Sure, that sounds like fun! I'm always up for meeting new people. What time is the party?

Hey! That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm definitely free that day and I love meeting new people. Can you give me more details about the party? Like where is it located? What should I bring? And how long will it last?

It sounds great, I'd very much like to accept your invitation, thanks! When is the party? Around six pm?

Oh, perfect! I'll be there at six. No need to thank me, I'm just happy to help out. See you then!
