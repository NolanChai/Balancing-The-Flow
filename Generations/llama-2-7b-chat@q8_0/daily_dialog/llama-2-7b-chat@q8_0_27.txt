I woke up this morning with a throbbing pain in my temples. It started yesterday evening after I spent too much time on my computer, staring at the screen for hours without taking any breaks. Now it's unbearable and I can barely function.

He leaned over the desk and peered into the young man's mouth, his eyes scanning the throat area. "Hmmm...yes, I can see why you're feeling so poorly," he said, making a note on his clipboard. "You have a nasty case of tonsillitis. It's quite common this time of year, especially with all the cold weather we've been having."

The doctor's expression turned serious as he listened to the young man's complaints. "Influenza, you say?" he repeated, nodding his head thoughtfully. "Well, we'll have to run some tests to confirm it, but it does sound like you've come down with a bad case of the flu. Can you tell me where you were last weekend?"

Thank you, doctor. I'll go home right away and try to get some rest.

You're welcome , young man . Just remember, the sooner you start feeling better, the sooner you can return to your normal activities . And don't forget to take your medication as directed . Good luck !
