Yes, that's right. Everyone comes over after church for lunch. It's a tradition that we started a few years ago. We all gather at my mom's house and have a big meal together. It's a great opportunity for us to catch up and spend time with each other.

"Well, you know how it is. The kids are all off at their respective colleges and universities. They don't make it back for Easter every year. It's been a while since we've had the whole family together like this."
