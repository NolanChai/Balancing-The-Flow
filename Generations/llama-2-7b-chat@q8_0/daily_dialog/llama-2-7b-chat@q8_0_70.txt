[Warning: Short generation] Oh, dear! Well, it was nice meeting you. Have a safe trip to England.

Of course, it would be lovely to stay for dinner with you. However, I'm afraid I can't. I have a prior commitment that I cannot reschedule. But please do come again soon, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help you prepare for your trip to England. It has been a pleasure meeting you as well, and goodbye for now.
