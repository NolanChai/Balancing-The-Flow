"No problem, I'm sure you'll find something good. Have you thought about using a real estate agent? They can help you find places that are available now and also in the future,"

"Okay, that's definitely doable. Let me see... there's this place in the city that might be suitable for you. It's a one-bedroom apartment in a good location, and the rent is around 900 yuan per month. Would you like to take a look at it?"

"Have you considered looking for a roommate situation? It can be easier to find a place that way and you might be able to split the costs."

"Oh, that's definitely a challenge. The competition for apartments in this city is fierce. Have you considered looking at some of the newer developments on the outskirts of town? They tend to have more modern amenities and are often less expensive than places closer to the city center."

"Yeah, some of them might be moving out for the summer or for other reasons. And you never know, you might find a great deal on a place that way."

"Great, let me ask around and see what I can find. *pauses* Yeah, I know of a place that might be available. It's not too far from the subway and has a bedroom with a full bath. The bedroom is on the sunny side, which could be nice. The rent is around 1,000 yuan per month, which fits your budget. Let me check if it's still available and I'll give you the details."
