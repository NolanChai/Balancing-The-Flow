Sounds good to me! What kind of Chinese do you want?

Oh, just something simple. I'm not really in the mood for anything spicy today. How about you?

Great! I'll go ahead and place the order then. Do you want any appetizers or drinks with it?

Hmm, that does sound good. How about we try the seafood platter? It comes with shrimp, scallops, and crab legs, all deep-fried to perfection. And they have a great selection of sides too, like coleslaw and French fries. What do you say?

I see. Well, if you want to try something different, we could always go to that new Italian place downtown. It's been getting good reviews and I hear their pasta is delicious. Or if you're in the mood for something lighter, we could check out that new salad bar on Main Street. They have a great selection of fresh ingredients and they make their dressings in-house. What do you say?
