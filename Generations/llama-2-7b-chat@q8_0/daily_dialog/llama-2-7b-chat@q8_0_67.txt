Oh, this old thing? Yeah, I got it off a friend of a friend who works at a publishing house. They passed it along to me before it even hit the shelves. It's been on my list for ages, and I finally had a chance to read it over the weekend. Have you started it yet?

Oh, you mean "The Hating Game" by Sally Thorne? Yeah, I got it from the rental library. It's a pretty popular book, and I figured I might as well check it out since I was already there. It's only five cents a day, so it's not like I'm breaking the bank or anything. And yeah, I can see why everyone's been talking about it - it's really good! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
