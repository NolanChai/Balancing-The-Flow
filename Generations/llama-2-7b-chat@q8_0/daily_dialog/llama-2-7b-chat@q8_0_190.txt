"Ah, I see. Well, there are a few places around here that sell art supplies. You could try the local craft store, they usually have a good selection of paints, brushes, and canvases. Or, you could check out the art supply store on Main Street, they have a great selection of high-quality materials. They also offer classes for kids if your niece is interested in learning more about painting."
