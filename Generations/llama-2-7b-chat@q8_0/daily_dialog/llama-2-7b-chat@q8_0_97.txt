I'm not sure, to be honest. I just know that I want something unique and special. This dress is definitely eye-catching, but it's not quite right for me.

Oh, we're just browsing around. We haven't really found anything yet. Maybe you could help us?

Oh, I see! That dress is definitely eye-catching, but I can understand why it might be too loud for some people. We have been looking around for a while now, and I'm not sure what we're even looking for anymore. Sometimes, you know, certain styles or colors just don't suit me either. Do you have any suggestions? What style are you in the mood for today?

Oh, really? You think so? Well, I actually prefer something a bit more understated. That dress is a bit too flashy for my taste. But hey, if you like it, go ahead and buy it! We've been shopping for hours, and I still can't find anything that suits me. Can you help me find something? Maybe a V-neck sweater in a more muted color?

Oh, you're looking for a V-neck checked sweater? That's a great choice! I think it's very flattering on most people. And yeah, the styles and colors can be quite overwhelming, but once you find the right one, it's all worth it. *pauses* You know what, I think I might have just the thing for you. *smiles* Would you like to see it?
