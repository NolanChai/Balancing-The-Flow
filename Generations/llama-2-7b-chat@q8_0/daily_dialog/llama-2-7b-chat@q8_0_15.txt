Sure, no problem. I'll go ahead and place the order for new toner cartridges for all of the office printers. Can you please provide me with the details of the order, such as the quantity needed and the specific models of the printers that need new cartridges? And do you know if there are any particular brands or types of cartridges that we should use?

I'll make sure to check with housekeeping and get back to you. Is there anything else we need to order besides toner? Also, can you please provide me with the details of the previous orders so I can give them to the supplier?
