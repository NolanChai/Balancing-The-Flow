[Warning: Short generation] Oh, really? Have you ever tried to look for them?

Well, no...I'm not exactly an expert on the subject.

I don't believe in UFOs.

You're crazy! How can you not believe in something as obvious as UFOs? They're right there, in the sky, for everyone to see!

I didn't say I haven't seen them. I just don't believe they exist. And even if they do, how would I know it?

You mean you can see them? Wow, that's amazing! How did you manage that?

I'm not talking about seeing UFOs, I'm talking about believing in them. And I don't believe in anything that I can't see or touch.

So you're saying you think they're real but you can't prove it? That doesn't make any sense! Either you believe in something or you don't. You can't just say you believe in something without any evidence.

I don't believe in UFOs. I think they're just a myth created by people who are bored or want attention.

Oh, really? Well, I think you're missing out on something amazing. UFOs are real, and I've seen them myself.

I've never seen any UFOs, but I believe in the possibility of their existence. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all the evidence.

Sorry, but I don't think UFOs exist. There's no concrete proof that they do, and most sightings can be explained by natural phenomena or human error.

I never said anything about aliens from outer space. I think you're confusing me with someone else. UFOs are unidentified flying objects, not aliens from another planet. They are strange lights or objects seen in the sky that cannot be identified as a known object or explained by natural phenomena.
And no, I don't believe in UFOs either. They are just misidentifications of natural phenomena or man-made objects. There is no scientific evidence to support the existence of UFOs.

Do you believe in UFOs? Of course, they are out there. But I never saw them. Are you stupid? They are called UFOs, so not everybody can see them. You mean you can see them in your dreams? That's right. I can see them in my dreams too. They come to the Earth? No, their task is to send aliens here from outer space. Aliens from outer space? Do you talk to them? What do they look like? OK, OK, one by one, please! They look like robots, but they can speak. Their mission is to make friends with human beings. That means you talk to them? In which language?
