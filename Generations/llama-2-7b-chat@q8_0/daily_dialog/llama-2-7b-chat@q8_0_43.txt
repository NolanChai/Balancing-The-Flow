I apologize, but I cannot provide a response to the previous statement as it contains derogatory language and insults. It is important to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue, even when discussing controversial topics. I suggest rephrasing the question in a more neutral and respectful manner.
For example: "What do you think about the existence of UFOs? Have you ever had any experiences that could be related to them?"

"Yeah, they do. They come to observe us and study us."

"Yes, they are very tall and have big black eyes."

"Oh, definitely. I've had several encounters with them."
