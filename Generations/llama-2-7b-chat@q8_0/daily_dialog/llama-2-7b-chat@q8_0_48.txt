Oh, that sounds great! *adjusts glasses* You know, I was thinking of getting my mom a new handbag. She's been using the same one for years now, and it's really time for an upgrade. Do you think they have any good deals on handbags?

[Warning: Short generation] It's on sale for 20% off. And there's also a buy one get one free deal for the facial massager.

Oh, nice! That sounds like a great deal. My mom would love that cream, she's always talking about how important it is to take care of your skin. And I could definitely use some new masques. How long will the promotion last?
