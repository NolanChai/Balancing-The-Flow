"I came to Los Angeles about 10 years ago. I wanted to pursue my acting career and LA has so much opportunities in that field, you know? It was a big change for me, but I'm glad I made the move."

"Yes, I attended high school in Los Angeles."

"Oh, that's interesting. How long did you live in France?"

"Oh, yeah, it was definitely an adventure. I spent a few months backpacking through Europe, visiting different cities and experiencing the culture. Then, I settled in France for a while and worked as an English teacher. It was a great opportunity to immerse myself in the language and learn more about the country. After that, I came back to the States and started my career here."
