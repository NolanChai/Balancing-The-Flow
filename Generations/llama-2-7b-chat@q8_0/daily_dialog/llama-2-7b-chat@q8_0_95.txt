Joe: That's too bad. Maybe we can catch a movie another time then?

"I don't know, what do you suggest? I saw a great review for that new horror movie. How about you?"

"Oh, cool! I've heard good things about 'The Secret Life of Bees'. But yeah, I don't know if I want to see a horror movie again. How about we just hang out at my place instead? We could watch something funny or listen to music together."
