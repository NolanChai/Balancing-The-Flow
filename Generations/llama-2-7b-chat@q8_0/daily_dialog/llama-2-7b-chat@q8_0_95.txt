Good to hear that things are going well for you, Mary! I've been doing pretty good myself. How's work?

Hi Joe, how are you doing today? Things are going good today. How have you been doing, Mary? Things are going well for me. Want to go see a movie tonight? Oh, that sounds great! Unfortunately, my parents are taking me to dinner tonight.

Oh, cool! Yeah, sure! I'd love to go see a movie with you on Friday night. What did you want to see? Let me check if I have time... *checks calendar* Yeah, I think I'm free that night. Which movie were you thinking of?

I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How have you been? Yeah, things are going well for me too. Oh, wow! A new horror flick? Uh, I don't know if that's really my thing... But hey, if you want to see it, that's cool. How about we go see "The Secret Life of Bees" instead? That sounds like a great movie.
