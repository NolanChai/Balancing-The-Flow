Great, thank you for providing me with this information. I'm looking forward to seeing the final results and hearing from you once they are available. Is there anything else you would like me to do or provide in the meantime?

Thank you for providing me with detailed information about your company. I appreciate it. I think I have a good understanding of the company's general information now. When can I expect to hear back from you regarding the final results? And when will I get a reply at the latest?

Sure, I understand. So, I will have to wait for two weeks to hear back from the personnel department regarding the result of the interview. And if I don't receive a call, it means that I didn't pass the interview. Is that correct?

I see. Thank you for letting me know. So, I will just have to wait for two weeks to hear back from you regarding the results of the interview. If I don't receive a call, then I know that I wasn't successful. Is that correct?

Thank you, that means a lot to me. I'm glad I could learn more about your company through this interview process. I understand, and I will wait patiently for the final result. I appreciate your time and consideration.
