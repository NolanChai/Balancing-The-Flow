Oh, definitely! There's this amazing Italian place nearby that makes the best pasta dishes. Have you tried their lasagna? It's to die for! *wink* But if you're in the mood for something quick and easy, we could also grab a sandwich or salad from that cute little deli down the street. What do you say?

Oh, wow! That sounds amazing! *excitedly* Yeah, I'm totally down for a quick sandwich or salad. *nods* Do you have a place in mind? *eyes lighting up* And walking would be great, it's such a nice day out! *smiles* Where did you have in mind?

Sure, I'd love to! There's this new restaurant downtown that I've been meaning to try out. They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads, and I heard their atmosphere is really cozy and relaxing. What do you say? Should we give it a shot?
