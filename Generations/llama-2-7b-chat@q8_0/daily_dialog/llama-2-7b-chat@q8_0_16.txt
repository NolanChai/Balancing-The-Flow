[Warning: Short generation] I don't want to change the channel, I just want to watch something else.

Hi there! *giggles* Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you asked! *bounces up and down* I've been dying to change the channel for ages now! *twirls* But... *looks guilty* I can't seem to find the remote control anywhere. *wrings hands* Do you think you could help me out? *giggles some more*

[Warning: Short generation] I don't want to watch TV anymore. Can we turn it off?

[Warning: Short generation] Sure, no problem. Here is the continuation of the dialogue:
Oh , I see . Well , I think that sounds pretty interesting . I'll just put it on then . Thanks for offering to change the channel!
