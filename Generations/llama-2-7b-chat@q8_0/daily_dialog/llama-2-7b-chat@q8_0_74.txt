Of course, Bob. *chuckles* I know you were always the life of the party. *winks*

oh man , those were some crazy times . I can't believe how much has changed since then . *laughs* Do you remember that time we...

yeah , no kidding . I mean, we all have our own paths now . But it's great to see everyone again . *smiles*

Oh, you know... life has had its ups and downs for me too. I moved back home after college and it was tough at first, but my parents are great and they've helped me get back on my feet. I started a business a few years ago, and while it's been hard work, it's also been really rewarding. Jenn and I broke up a while back, but we're still friends and that's important to me. How about you? What have you been up to since graduation?

Of course, Bob! It's great to see you too. *pauses and looks around* I can't believe how fast time has flown by. *chuckles* Do you remember when we used to stay up all night studying for exams? Those were some crazy times. *smirks*

What have you been up to these past ten years? *leans in* Have you traveled much? Started a family? What's new in your world?
