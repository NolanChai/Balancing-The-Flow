"Yeah, my mom was really hurt that she couldn't be there. She had always dreamed of being the one to walk me down the aisle and give me away to my husband. But my husband and I wanted to make sure that our wedding was special and meaningful for us, so we decided to have it in each of our countries."

"Yes, they did. We made sure to include both of our families in the celebration. It was important to us that they felt included and a part of our special day."

"Yes, we did. We went to Bali for two weeks after the wedding. It was amazing. We wanted to relax and enjoy each other's company without any of the stress of planning a big wedding."

"Not at all," Abigail replied with a smile. "My husband and I are both independent spirits, so we wanted our wedding to reflect that. We chose to have small, intimate ceremonies in each of our countries of origin, followed by three parties to celebrate with our closest friends and family."
