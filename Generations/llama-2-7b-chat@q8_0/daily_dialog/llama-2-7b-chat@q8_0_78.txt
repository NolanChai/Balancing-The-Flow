Oh, no, it wasn't really expensive. We just wanted to have fun and celebrate with our friends and family in different ways. So we had a big party with all of our close friends and family at my parents' house, and then we went to a fancy restaurant for dinner with some of the guests from the registry office ceremony. And finally, we had a small intimate gathering with just our closest friends at a local bar. It was great because everyone could let loose and have fun in their own way!

Oh, no! My parents were absolutely thrilled for us. They couldn't have been happier about our decision to get married in a registry office with just two friends as witnesses. In fact, my mother told me that she always knew I would do something like this â€“ she's just so proud of me for being true to myself and following my heart. (smiling)

Of course not! They live in different countries, remember? And we had three separate parties because my husband is from a different country than I am, and his parents couldn't afford to fly out for the wedding. But it wasn't that expensive, surprisingly enough. We wanted to include both of our families in the celebration somehow, so we decided to have one party in each of our countries. And yes, my parents were upset that they couldn't be there, but they understood the circumstances.

We did, it was lovely. We went to Bali and spent a week there, it was perfect. Just the two of us, relaxing and enjoying each other's company. It was exactly what we wanted and needed after the crazy wedding planning process.

No, I didn't have a very traditional wedding. My husband and I are both from different countries, and we wanted to celebrate in each of our hometowns. It wasn't expensive, but it was definitely a challenge planning a wedding from two different locations. But we were happy to have the opportunity to celebrate with our friends and family in each place. And yes, my parents weren't able to make it to the ceremony, but they understood. We Skyped them in, and that was nice.
