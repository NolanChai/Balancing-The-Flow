" Great, let me just check our availability... *checks* Okay, we have 1000 Euros available for cash purchase. Would you like to exchange that amount?"

"Great. Let me just check on that for you... *pauses* Okay, I can confirm that we have 20,000 RIB available for exchange at the current rate of 1 Euro to 30 RIB. Would you like to proceed with the transaction?"

"Great, how about 10,000 RIB?"

The teller nodded and said, "Of course. How much would you like to exchange?"

The next turn in the dialog is:
"Sure, I will exchange for you now. Please sign the exchange form giving your name and telephone number."
