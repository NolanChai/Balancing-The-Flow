[Warning: Short generation] Oh, yeah! My brother is coming over from Australia next month . He's been living there for a few years now. I'm really excited to see him again. It'll be great to catch up and hang out with him.

Yeah, my parents are really excited. And yeah, my brother is definitely coming here with them. He's been living in New Zealand for a while now, so it'll be great to see him again. It's been a while since we last saw each other.

[Warning: Short generation] No, my brother has two sons. One of them is the one who is coming to visit us. His name is Jack and he's 16 years old. He's really excited to meet you!

Yes, they are. My brother's family is quite big now. He has two girls aged 8 and 10, and his wife is pregnant again. So it will be nice for them to spend some time with their grandparents while they are here.

[Warning: Short generation] They will be here in a few weeks' time. I am so excited, it has been ages since I have seen them. It will be great to catch up and spend some quality time together.
