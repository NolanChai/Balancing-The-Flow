[Warning: Short generation] Oh, that's great to hear! Can you tell me more about the heat recovery system? How does it work?

That's a great initiative! How do you ensure that the system is running smoothly and efficiently?

 It's not easy, you know. We have to monitor it constantly and make sure that everything is working as it should be. We also have to perform regular maintenance checks to keep the system running at its best.

How often do you perform these maintenance checks? And what kind of tasks do they involve?
