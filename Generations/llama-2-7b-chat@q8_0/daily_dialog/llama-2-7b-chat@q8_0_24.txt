Susan: *sigh* I wish I could be optimistic about it, but I've been feeling really unhappy in our marriage for a while now. And last night's argument was just the final straw. I can't keep living like this.
Friend: *skeptical tone* Oh, come on. You two have had your differences before and worked through them. This time isn't any different, right?
Susan: *shakes head* Unfortunately, that's not true. Peter and I have grown apart, and I don't see us reconciling our differences anymore. The last argument we had was just too much for me to handle, and I couldn't stay in the marriage anymore. That's why I've decided to get a divorce.
