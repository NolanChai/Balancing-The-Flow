Oh, really? I mean, I know they're popular, but I just feel like there are so many other genres out there that could be explored on TV. Drama, thriller, horror...the possibilities are endless! Don't you think?

Hmm, I see. So, sitcoms are popular in America because they are half an hour long and air weekly, and they tend to feature ordinary people and teach wholesome values. That makes sense. But what about in Taiwan? Are their prime-time shows different from those in America?
