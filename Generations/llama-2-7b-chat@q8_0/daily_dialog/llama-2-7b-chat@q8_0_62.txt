Oh, wow! That's great news! Going to the Water Park by bike sounds like so much fun! *giggles* But oh no, you have to be careful while riding. Traffic in Beijing can be really dangerous sometimes, and it's important to follow the rules and be cautious. *nods*
Oh, I see! So, you should obey the traffic rules and not break any red lights, and also make sure not to play pranks on your friends while riding. That's very important! *smiles* And please, don't hurry up too much when riding, or you might have an accident. *gives a worried look*
And finally, remember to come from the left and go to the right! *nods* Yeah, it's easy to forget sometimes, but it's important to be mindful of other road users. *smiles*
Oh my goodness, you're not a baby anymore! *giggles* That's so cool! You're growing up and learning new things every day! *nods* Keep being careful and safe while riding your bike, okay? *winks*
