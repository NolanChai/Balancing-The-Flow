"Oh, okay. That makes sense. I understand," Amelia replied thoughtfully.

"Oh? And what might that be?"

"So, are you going to tell me what this other offer is?"

Amelia: So, when do you plan on leaving?
Mia: Oh, really? That's quite surprising. Can you tell me more about the reason?
Amelia: Well, I understand your point of view, but I'm afraid it's not that simple. The company is undergoing restructuring and who knows what will happen to us. I can't take the risk of continuing here.
Mia: But you're such an experienced manager! They wouldn't dare fire you! 
Amelia: (Sigh) I wish it were that easy. The truth is, there's another reason why I'm leaving. I've received a better offer from a different company.
Mia: Wow, congratulations! That's great news. Where will you be located?
Amelia: (Smiling) Well, the head office is in New York, but I'll be handling overseas companies and traveling back and forth quite often.
Mia: It's unfortunate to see you go, but it sounds like you've found a fantastic opportunity.
Amelia: (Nodding) Yes, I feel really lucky. I'm excited to work with overseas companies and have the chance to improve my English skills even more.

"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that," Amelia said with a smile.
