"Oh, great. Can you tell me more about your brother and his baby?"

"Well, I own a small business back home, and I'm also involved in some local community projects. Additionally, my wife and I have two young children who are still in school, so we have a lot of family and social ties that will keep us connected to our home country."

"Great, so you'll be staying with your brother in Minneapolis for approximately three weeks. Have you considered the cost of living in the United States and how you will cover your expenses during your trip?"
