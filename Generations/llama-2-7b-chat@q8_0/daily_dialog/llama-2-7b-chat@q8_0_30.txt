[Warning: Short generation] Oh yeah? I heard she's really smart too! Like, super smart. She's already got a scholarship to college lined up for next year.

Yeah, I saw her in the cafeteria yesterday. She has really long blonde hair and blue eyes. She's also really skinny, but in a tall frame, you know? Like she's going to grow taller soon or something. And she's got this adorable little nose ring that makes her look like a total babe. I mean, I know it's not for everyone, but I think it's really cute on her. Have you talked to her yet?

Yeah, she's really cute. I saw her in the hallway yesterday and I couldn't help but stare. She has these big brown eyes that just draw you in, and her hair is super long and curly. I bet she would be really fun to hang out with too. Have you talked to her yet?

I haven't seen her yet, but everyone is talking about how pretty she is. According to them, she's kind of short, probably around five feet tall. But the first thing you noticed was her beautiful brown eyes? That's interesting...

I haven't seen her before. I mean, I don't remember seeing her before. But from what you're saying, she sounds really nice and pretty. *smiling* Yeah, it's great to have new people in school. It makes things more interesting.
