Great! Let's start with the menu. How many guests do we have invited? And what are their dietary restrictions?

Great, that helps to narrow things down. How about the menu? Do you have any specific preferences or dietary restrictions we need to take into account?

Great! Let's go with Chinese cuisine then. What type of dishes do you think the guests would enjoy? Should we stick to traditional dishes like Kung Pao chicken and egg rolls or should we try something more modern like vegetarian options or fusion dishes?

I think that's a great idea! A live band will definitely add to the festive atmosphere of the party. What kind of songs do you want them to play?

 Great question! How about a mix of classic office party tunes and some more contemporary hits? That way, everyone should be able to enjoy themselves.

That sounds like a good plan . What else do we need to decide on ?
