Sure, I'd be happy to continue the dialogue! Here's my response:

Oh, okay. Can you please tell me when she might be available? I need to speak with her about an appointment.

Let me check. Is tomorrow morning good for you?

[Warning: Short generation] Of course! Here's my number, (555) 123-4567. Thank you so much!

Of course! My apologies for not catching that earlier. Here's my response:
"Yes, my name is Tony. Thank you for offering to pass along the message. I'll make sure to give Lily a call when she gets in."

Hi Tony, this is Lily. I'm not at the dentist's office right now, but I will make sure to call you back as soon as I get in. Thanks for reaching out!
Oh, and yeah, my number is 519-367-8901. Talk to you later!
