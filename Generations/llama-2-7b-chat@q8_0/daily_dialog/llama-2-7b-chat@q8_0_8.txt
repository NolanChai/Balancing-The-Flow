Yes, I did. I received several awards for my contributions to the student community during my time as President of the Student Council. It was a great experience and taught me valuable leadership skills that have helped me throughout my career.

[Warning: Short generation] Yes, I was president of the Student Council of our university.

I was usually involved in cultural and artistic events, such as concerts, dance performances, and poetry readings. I also helped organize some of these events, so I had a lot of responsibilities in that regard. Additionally, I volunteered at local community centers and hospitals, where I assisted with various tasks and events.
