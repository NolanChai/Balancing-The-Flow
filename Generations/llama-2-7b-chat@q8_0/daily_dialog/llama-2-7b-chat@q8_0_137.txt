"Okay, fine. But you have to promise me that you'll stop making 'eww' faces whenever the contestants start dancing," she said with a smirk.

"I don't know, I'm really in the mood for something lighthearted and funny. Ally McNeal looks like it could be a good laugh."

"Ugh, seriously? You want to watch that cheesy reality show instead of Dark Angel? Like, come on. It's not just a funny show, it's actually really good. And don't even get me started on how much better it is than Ally McNeal. That show is just a bunch of manufactured drama and fake challenges. Dark Angel, on the other hand, has a real storyline and interesting characters. Plus, Jessica Alba is hot, okay? Don't try to deny it."
