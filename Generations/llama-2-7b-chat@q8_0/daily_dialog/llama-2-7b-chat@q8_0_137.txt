Oh, really? You must be a huge fan of Ally McNeal! *giggles* I have to say, I find that show super cheesy and predictable. But hey, if you're into that sorta thing... *shrugs* What about Dark Angel? Have you seen it yet? It's actually pretty good, in my opinion. *nods*

Oh, really? I didn't know that. So, you want to watch Ally McNeal then? *smirk* Well, I suppose it's not all girl stuff. There are some interesting moments in there. *wink wink* But don't expect too much substance from it, you know. It's just for fun and entertainment. *giggles*

I think I'll pass on Ally McNeal. It does seem kind of cheesy and overly dramatic. But hey, if you want to waste your time watching that, be my guest! *rolls eyes* I'm more interested in Dark Angel. The action scenes are pretty cool and the sci-fi elements are intriguing. Plus, Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes *winks*.

I can't believe you actually think that! Ally McNeal is a great show, and it has nothing to do with the fact that the lead character is hot. It's got a good mix of humor and drama, and I think it's really underrated. And don't even get me started on Dark Angel. That show is awesome! Sure, some of the outfits are pretty skimpy, but that's part of what makes it so much fun to watch. You can't deny how hot Jessica Alba looks in those tight leather pants. üòç
