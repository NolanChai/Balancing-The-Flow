Thanks, but I think I'll walk instead. It's not too far from here.

Thanks for offering, but I think I'll walk there. I don't want to trouble you.

Oh, no trouble at all! It's no problem, really. You should let me take you. *insists*

I appreciate your kindness, but I really should walk. *hesitates*

Okay, fine. But be careful and watch out for any traffic. *concerned*

[Warning: Short generation] I'm going to the beach. How about you?
