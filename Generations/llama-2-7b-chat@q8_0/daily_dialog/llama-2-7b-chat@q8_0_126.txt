Oh, wow! That's amazing news! Congratulations! How did you manage to impress the editor-in-chief?

Thanks! To be honest, it wasn't really a deliberate effort. I just tried my best at my job and made sure that every article that came across my desk was error-free and well-formatted. I guess that must have caught someone's attention.

That's incredible! Congratulations on the opportunity, it sounds like a fantastic experience. Writing for the literary criticism column is a great way to showcase your skills and knowledge in the field. What are you looking forward to most about this new role?

Oh, that's amazing! Congratulations on the promotion! That's a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and experience as an editor.

Thank you! Yes, it's definitely a great opportunity, and I'm really looking forward to it. The magazine comes out once a month, but my column will be shared with another columnist, so we'll each be due fortnightly. It should be a good challenge to keep up with the frequency, but I'm up for it!
