"Wow, that's amazing! You must be so excited. Yeah, I'll definitely get a chance to write some articles while covering the literary criticism column. It's a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills and gain more experience in the industry."

"I know, right? It's like a dream come true! I can't believe I'm going to be working as an assistant editor for the Economist. And to top it off, I'll get to write for the literary criticism column! I'm so excited to start this new chapter in my career."

"I know, right? It's like a dream come true! I can't believe I'll be working as an assistant editor for the Literary Criticism column. And to think, I'll get to share my work with another columnist fortnightly. It's going to be a great experience."

"That's great! Congratulations! So, you'll be in charge of the literary criticism column until the pregnant columnist comes back?"

Pause.

"That's great news! I'm so happy for you. Do you think you'll be able to handle the workload of being an assistant editor?"
