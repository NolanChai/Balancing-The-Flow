Of course! My name is Sarah Johnson, and my room number is 2305. I was expecting my bags to be delivered to my room about 30 minutes ago, but they still haven't arrived. Can you tell me what the delay might be?

Thank you, Mrs. Yao. Let me check with the bellboy. (pauses) I apologize, but it seems that your bags were sent to the wrong room. Room 406 does not exist in our hotel. May I offer you a complimentary upgrade to a higher room category?

Of course, Miss Yao. Let me just check with our baggage handling team. (pauses for a moment) I apologize, but we've only received one blue suitcase and no red shoulder bag. May I ask if you have any idea where they might be?
