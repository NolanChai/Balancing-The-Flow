"Sure thing! Well, I've been in the sales industry for over a decade now and while I've enjoyed my time there, I feel like I've reached a plateau. I want to challenge myself and explore new opportunities. Working as an executive assistant will give me the opportunity to learn from someone with extensive experience and knowledge in the field, which I believe will help me grow professionally. Plus, I think it would be an exciting change of pace from my current job."
