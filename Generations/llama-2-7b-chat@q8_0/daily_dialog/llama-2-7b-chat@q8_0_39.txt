"Judy, your reservation has been cancelled for Flight 8 on July 19. However, I'm afraid we can't change the flight date to August 2 as it's already fully booked. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

"Of course, Judy. I'll make sure to note that on the cancellation. Can you please provide me with your booking reference number so I can locate your reservation?"

"Thank you for letting us know, Miss Wang. I just need to verify some information before I can process your request. Can you please confirm your new travel dates and the name of the person picking up the ticket at the airport?"

"Of course, Judy. Your flight has been canceled and your new reservation is for Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9:30am on August 2nd. The penalty for the change is $75, which you will need to pay at the airport. Please note that the flight number for your new reservation is 1POJ7403."

"Great, thank you for letting us know. Could you please provide me with your payment information to cover the $75 penalty for changing your flight? We accept major credit cards or traveler's checks at the airport."
