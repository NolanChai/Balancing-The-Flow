"Great, thank you," the young man replied as he handed over the skates and helmets.

"Oh, definitely. I'll also make sure they wear their helmets at all times and stay in designated areas. And if they need any assistance, I'll be happy to help."

"Sure, no problem. Just make sure they stay within the designated area and go at a safe pace. Also, it wouldn't hurt to have them wear some protective gear like knee pads or elbow guards, just in case they fall."

The store owner looked at you with a hint of concern and said, "You know, it's important to always be aware of your surroundings while skating. Make sure you keep an eye out for any weak spots in the ice, like near the edges or around obstacles. And definitely don't go anywhere near the middle of the lake, as you mentioned. It's too thin and could break easily."
