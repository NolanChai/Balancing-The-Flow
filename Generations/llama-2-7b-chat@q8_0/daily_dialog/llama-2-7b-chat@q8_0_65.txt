[Warning: Short generation] Oh, man...I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. I got held up at work and lost track of time. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?

Oh, man...I'm so sorry. I completely forgot about our plans. I was busy with work and lost track of time. I didn't realize we were supposed to meet at the theater until it was too late. Can we still go see the movie together? I promise I'll make it up to you.

Oh, really?! So it's my fault that we got mixed up?! *angrily* I thought we were supposed to meet at the apartment first and then head to the theater together. But no, you just showed up here without any warning. Now we're going to be late for the movie. Great. Just great. *sighs and shakes head*

I apologize if I wasn't clear enough. But seriously, how are we supposed to know what's going on when you keep changing your plans at the last minute?! It's like you don't even care about our schedule or anything! *frustrated*
