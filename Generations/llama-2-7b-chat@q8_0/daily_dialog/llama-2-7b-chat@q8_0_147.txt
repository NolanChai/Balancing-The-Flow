[Warning: Short generation] "I ordered the Kung Pao chicken. It's one of my favorites. The chef really knows how to make it spicy without overpowering the other flavors. I can't wait for you to try it!"

I think that's a great idea! Learning how to cook Chinese food can be so much fun, and there are so many delicious dishes to try. Plus, being able to make them at home can save you money in the long run. Have you tried any Chinese restaurants around here before?
