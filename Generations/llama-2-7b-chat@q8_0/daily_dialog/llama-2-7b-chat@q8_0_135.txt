Oh, wow! Thank you so much for inviting me! *giggles* I would be delighted to attend the banquet in my honor. *blushes* However, I need to check my schedule first to see if 6:30 PM is convenient for me. Could we possibly arrange for a pickup time that's a bit later? *smiles*

Thank you, Mr. Carter. I appreciate your kindness and generosity. I will make sure to be ready by 6:30 PM. It's a great honor for me to attend this banquet in my honor, and I am grateful for the opportunity to celebrate with you and all the other guests. Goodbye!
