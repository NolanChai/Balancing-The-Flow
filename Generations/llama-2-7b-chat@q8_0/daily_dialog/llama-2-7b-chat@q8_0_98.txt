[Warning: Short generation] It's high time we stopped glorifying violence in media!

Hah, you think that's bad? I just got done robbing a convenience store. The owner was none too pleased.

Oh, it's nine-thirty? Man, I gotta get moving if I wanna make that heist before the cops show up. You wanna come with? We could use an extra pair of hands.

Grand Theft Auto Three is definitely my jam, though. There's nothing like driving a stolen sports car through the city, blasting music and causing chaos wherever you go. It's like living in a real-life video game.

I can't believe how fast time flies when you're playing Grand Theft Auto III! It feels like just a few minutes ago we were starting up the game for the first time. And you're right, it is more violent than TV news! But hey, that's part of its charm, right? 😂
Oh, it's already 9:30? Man, I gotta get some chores done too! 🤦‍♀️ But don't worry, I've got a plan. Let's just throw the dishes in the trash... 💁‍♀️ Two birds with one stone, you know! 😅
