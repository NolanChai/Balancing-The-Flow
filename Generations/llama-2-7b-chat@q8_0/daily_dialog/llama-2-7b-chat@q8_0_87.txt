Thank you so much! That's really kind of you. *smiling* I appreciate it, but I don't need a new book. The old one is just as good, and I'm sure you have more important things to spend your money on. *laughing* Besides, I think I might have just misplaced it somewhere in the house. It will turn up eventually!
