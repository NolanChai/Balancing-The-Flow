Oh, wow! That's impressive. How did you learn Japanese? Did you study it in school or teach yourself through books and online resources?

Oh, I passed the N1 level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It was a challenging exam, but I'm glad I could pass it. How about you? Have you ever taken the test?
