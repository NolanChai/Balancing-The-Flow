"Okay, got it. So, what are the next steps?"

"Great, so you're telling me that as a permanent employee, I'll have access to five insurances and one fund, in addition to my monthly pay and eight-hour work shift?"

"Great, I'm glad you're excited about the opportunity," John said with a smile.

"No, I think that covers everything. I'm ready to sign the contract."

"Great, I'm glad you're excited about the job. The induction training will be around two weeks, and during that time, you'll learn more about the company culture, policies, and procedures. You'll also have the opportunity to meet your colleagues and supervisors, and get a better understanding of what to expect in your new role."

"Okay, got it. So, I'll sign here to confirm that I've read and understood the terms of the contract."
