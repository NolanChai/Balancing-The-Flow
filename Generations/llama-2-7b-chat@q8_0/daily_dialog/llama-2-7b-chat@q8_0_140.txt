I'm confident in my typing and shorthand abilities. During my studies, I took courses that focused on improving these skills, and I practice them regularly. My typical typing speed is around 70 words per minute, and my shorthand is clear and accurate. I've also taken online tests to assess my proficiency, and my results indicate that I meet the standards for a bilingual secretary position.
