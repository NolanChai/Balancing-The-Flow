Oh, wow! It's great to see you too, Mary! *adjusts sunglasses* Yeah, Josh and I had a blast at the beach today. We were just discussing how nice it is to relax and unwind after a long week. *takes a seat* How about you? What have you been up to lately?

"Oh, wow! Thank you so much! *hugs* It's great to see you too! *giggles* I swear, it feels like it's been forever since we last saw each other. *smiles* Yeah, Josh and I were just at the beach all day, enjoying the sun and sand. *nods* But we had to come by and say hi to you! You know how much we love hanging out with you!"

Oh, thank you so much! That's really sweet of you. *giggles* But I think we should probably get going soon. Josh and I have a lot of work to do today. *glances at Josh*

It was great seeing you again, Mary! We should do this more often. *smiles warmly*

[Warning: Short generation] Thanks for inviting us over. We're doing well. The kids are growing up so fast, and my husband and I are keeping busy with work and the usual stuff. How about you? What's new with you?
