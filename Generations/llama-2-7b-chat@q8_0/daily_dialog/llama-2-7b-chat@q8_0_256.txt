"I know, right? I've been calling and texting him non-stop, but he hasn't responded. It's like he's ignoring me on purpose."

"I know, right? I've been waiting by the phone for weeks, but he hasn't called. And now you think he's seeing someone else? Gosh, I wish I could be so optimistic about it. *sigh* I just don't know what to do."

"I can't believe you're still pining for him, Veronica. It's been weeks since you two were on a break and he hasn't called you yet. Maybe he's moved on and found someone else to focus on."
