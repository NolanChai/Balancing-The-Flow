"I see. Well, I'm not sure if that's the best option for me. Can you tell me more about it?"

"Exactly, so instead of having to physically go to our branch or the post office each month, we can set up a Direct Debit agreement where we automatically deduct the payment for your utility bills from your bank account. This way, you won't have to worry about remembering to pay your bills on time or dealing with long lines at the post office. The companies will give us an agreed amount to pay each month, and we'll take care of the rest."
