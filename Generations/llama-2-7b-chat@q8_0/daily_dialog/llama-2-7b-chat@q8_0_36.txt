"Sure, you can buy stamps here. In fact, you'll need to stand in this line right over there to purchase them."

"Oh, great. So I'll have to stand in two lines then," the customer replied with a sigh.

"Okay, that'll be $3 for the stamps. And just so you know, there's a new security measure in place for international packages, so you might want to check on that before you head over to the post office."

"Okay, so you'll need to stand in line over there to buy the bubble wrap. It's a pretty long line, and I would estimate that it will take about an hour to get through it."

"Sure! The bubble wrap is over there, just a few feet away from the line to post your package. It's quite a long line, I'm afraid, but it moves fairly quickly. It takes about 3 minutes per person, so you can estimate an hour's wait. As for stamps, of course! How many would you like? And are you sending them abroad or domestically?"
