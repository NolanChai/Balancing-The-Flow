Oh, yeah, no problem! The line for bubble wrap is right over there, *points*. And the line for posting packages is... *looks around awkwardly* Well, it's actually just a big crowd of people waiting to send their packages. I'm not sure how long it will take, but I think they have some special machines that can help speed things up. *nervous chuckle*. Do you need to send a package?

Oh, you're in luck! You can indeed buy bubble wrap and postage right here. The line to purchase bubble wrap is over there, and the line for posting packages is right next to it. It looks like there are about 20 people ahead of you in each line, so it might take around an hour to get through them all. As for stamps, yes, we do have them available here. Would you like me to help you find what you need?

Of course! Here's my continuation of the dialogue:
Oh, great. An hour-long wait doesn't sound too pleasant, especially during the holiday season when time is of the essence. But I guess it's better than not having enough bubble wrap for your packages. How much does it cost?
And do you have any stamps available? I need 30 for my Christmas cards as well.

Oh, wow. That's quite a long line. I didn't realize it would take so long to get through. And buying stamps here? Okay, that's convenient. How many do I need for my Christmas cards? Thirty? That's a lot! Twenty of them are going abroad, huh? To China and America? That's interesting.

Of course, I'd be happy to help! The line for buying bubble wrap is over there, *points*. To post your package, you'll need to stand in line here, *points again*. It's quite a long line, unfortunately. It usually takes around 3 minutes per person, so it could take about an hour to get through everyone.
You can buy stamps here, yes. How many do you need? I see you're sending out 30 Christmas cards. Are any of them going abroad? If so, those will be a bit more expensive.
### Your turn:
Thanks for letting me know! *hesitates* I think I'll wait in line to buy the bubble wrap first. Do you know how long it usually takes to get through security at this time of day?

Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know! Yeah, I'm sending a package to my friend in China and one to my sister in America, so it looks like I'll be waiting for about an hour. Can I buy stamps here? How many do I need? And how much will it cost?

I need 30 stamps for my Christmas cards, and most of them are going abroad. Do you have any that are less expensive for sending to countries in the EU? Oh, and can I also get some bubble wrap to protect my package? How much will that be?
