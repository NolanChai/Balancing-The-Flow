"I see, so the interest is paid quarterly and settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter. That's useful to know. As for the Type A or Type B Account, I think the Type A Account would be better suited for your needs. It's more flexible and allows you to use it in a way that's similar to your Settlement Account."
