The anime and manga series "Demon Slayer" did receive controversy over Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings having a similar pattern to the Rising Sun flag, as the design is similar to the Japanese Imperial flag, which has been associated with Japan's military past, including World War II. The controversy stems from the fact that some people view the flag as a symbol of Japanese militarism and aggression during the war, particularly in Asia.
On the other hand, the anime and manga series "Golden Kamuy" received little to no controversy despite having clear usage of the Rising Sun flag and having a majority of the cast being a part of the Imperial Japanese army. This difference in reaction can be attributed to several factors:
1. Historical context: Golden Kamuy is set in the late 19th century, during the Meiji period, which was a time of significant social, political, and cultural change in Japan. While the Rising Sun flag was used during this time, it was not associated with the same level of militarism and aggression as it was during World War II.
2. Cultural significance: Hanafuda earrings are a traditional Japanese fashion accessory that has been around for centuries. They do not have the same historical baggage as the Rising Sun flag, which was used extensively during Japan's military campaigns in Asia during World War II. As such, the similarity between Tanjiro's earrings and the Rising Sun flag is seen as a minor issue compared to the cultural significance of hanafuda earrings.
3. Comparison to other anime and manga: The controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer" may be exacerbated by the fact that it is not the only anime or manga series to use elements associated with Japan's military past. Other works, such as "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood," have also faced criticism for their use of similar symbols and imagery. As a result, the controversy around Tanjiro's earrings may be seen as part of a larger trend in anime and manga.
4. Creator's intentions: The creators of "Demon Slayer" have stated that they did not intend to use the Rising Sun flag or hanafuda earrings as a symbol of militarism or aggression. They view these elements as part of Japanese cultural heritage and see no problem with their inclusion in the series.
In conclusion, while both "Demon Slayer" and "Golden Kamuy" feature the Rising Sun flag and have characters who were part of the Imperial Japanese army, the controversy surrounding Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings is more significant due to their historical context, cultural significance, comparison to other anime and manga, and the creators' intentions. It is important to consider these factors when addressing issues of cultural sensitivity in media representation.

Սիրելով, it is important to acknowledge that both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" are works of fiction set in historical periods, and as such, they have the creative liberty to take artistic liberties with their depictions of events and locations. However, it is equally important to approach these works with sensitivity towards the cultural and historical contexts in which they are set.
In the case of "Ranking of Kings," the depiction of Japan's occupation of Korea has raised controversy as it seems to glorify or whitewash a historical event that had significant negative impacts on the Korean people. While the series may use fictional locations and characters, it is important to recognize that this event is an important part of Korean history and should be handled with care and sensitivity.
On the other hand, "Golden Kamuy" sets its story during the Russo-Japanese War and Manchuria's occupation by Japan, which was a complex historical period marked by both conflict and cooperation between different ethnic groups. While it is true that areas like Manchuria were under Japanese control during this era, it is also important to recognize that the region has a rich cultural heritage and a complex history that cannot be reduced to a single political or national identity.
In general, when depicting historical events or cultures in fiction, it is important to approach them with sensitivity towards their nuances, complexities, and cultural contexts. This involves being mindful of the ways in which different groups have been marginalized or oppressed throughout history and avoiding perpetuating harmful stereotypes or glorifying unethical actions.
In conclusion, while both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" have received criticism for their depictions of historical events, it is important to approach these works with nuance and sensitivity towards the cultural and historical contexts in which they are set. By doing so, we can foster more thoughtful and respectful representations of history in fiction.
