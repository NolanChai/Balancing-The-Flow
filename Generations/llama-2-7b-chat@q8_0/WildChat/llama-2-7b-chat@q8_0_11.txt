Okay! I will create four distinct prompts for each concept you provide. Here are the prompts based on your given structure:
/imagine prompt: Magical train with colorful animals and cartoon-style painting, traveling through a fantasy world with lush green forests, snow-capped mountains, and crystal clear rivers, carrying passengers in a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, with the sound of chirping birds and whistling wind, captured by a drone camera, 4K resolution, and a unique composition focused on the train's movement and the landscape's details. --ar 16:9 --v 5
/imagine prompt: A breathtaking sunset over a vast desert landscape, with sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see, a solitary figure walking towards the horizon, silhouetted against the vibrant orange and pink sky, composition focused on the figure's path and the gradient of colors in the sky, captured by a Hasselblad X1D camera, 45mm lens, and shallow depth of field to emphasize the isolation of the figure. --ar 9:16 --v 5
/imagine prompt: Mysterious underwater world with a school of neon fish swimming through an ethereal forest, illuminated by a warm blue light from above, coral reefs and seaweed swaying in the current, creating a sense of movement and mystery, captured by a Nikon D850 camera, 14mm lens, and a wide depth of field to emphasize the vastness of the underwater environment. --ar 1:1 --v 5
/imagine prompt: A bustling city street at night, with towering skyscrapers and colorful billboards, a group of friends walking down the sidewalk, laughing and chatting, illuminated by the urban lights and neon signs, composition focused on the people's movement and interactions, captured by a Sony A7R IV camera, 24mm lens, and a shallow depth of field to emphasize the dynamic atmosphere of the city. --ar 16:9 --v 5
Please let me know which concept you would like me to generate prompts for, or if you have any questions!
