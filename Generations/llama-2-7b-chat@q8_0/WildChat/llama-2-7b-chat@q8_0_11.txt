Great! Let's assign a Striking Style and a Grappling Style to each of the new students based on their characteristics and interests. Here are my reasons for each assignment:
1. Christian Vaughn - Striking Style: Boxing (Primary)
Christian is tall and muscular, with a background in firefighting. His occupation requires strength and endurance, which makes him well-suited for boxing. His interest in Stacy, Selina, and Valentina suggests he has a competitive streak, which could be channeled into his boxing training.
2. Tommy Rollins - Grappling Style: Jiu-Jitsu (Primary)
Tommy is a bit shorter than Christian but has a strong core and good speed. His occupation as a bartender might not require as much physical strength, but he's still agile and quick on his feet. His interest in Selina and Valentina suggests he values finesse and technique over brute force, which makes Jiu-Jitsu a great fit.
3. Billy Turner - Striking Style: Muay Thai (Primary)
Billy is the lightest of the group but has good agility and core strength. His occupation as a librarian might not require much physical labor, but he's still energetic and enthusiastic. His interest in Tommy suggests he appreciates technical skill, which Muay Thai emphasizes.
4. Stacy Simmons - Grappling Style: Judo (Primary)
Stacy is the shortest of the group but has good leg strength and agility. Her occupation as a cheerleader requires quick movements and acrobatic skills, which translates well to Judo. Her interest in Christian and Tommy suggests she values teamwork and cooperation, which Judo emphasizes.
5. Selina Morano - Striking Style: Muay Thai (Primary)
Selina is tall and slender with great flexibility, making her a natural for Muay Thai. Her occupation as a pole dancer requires grace and agility, which translates well to the ring. Her interest in multiple people suggests she enjoys the thrill of competition and the chance to improve herself, both of which are hallmarks of Muay Thai training.
6. Billy Turner - Grappling Style: Sambo (Primary)
Billy's agility and core strength make him a good fit for Sambo, which emphasizes ground fighting and submission holds. His interest in Valentina suggests he values technique over brute force, which makes Sambo an attractive option.
7. Valentina Miller - Striking Style: Boxing (Primary)
Valentina's tall frame and athletic build make her well-suited for boxing. Her occupation as a gymnast requires strength, flexibility, and coordination, which translates well to the ring. Her interest in Christian suggests she appreciates the technical aspects of boxing, which could help her develop her skills further.

Overall, these assignments take into account each character's physical attributes, occupation, and interests, as well as their personality traits and preferences. By focusing on either striking or grappling, each student can hone their skills in a specific area and develop their unique style.
