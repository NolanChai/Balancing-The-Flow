=====================
Iodometry and iodimetry are terms that refer to the measurement of iodine content in a sample. Iodine is an essential nutrient that is important for thyroid function, and it is commonly used as a tracer in various biochemical assays. In this explanation, we will discuss the principles, methods, and applications of iodometry and iodimetry.
What is Iodometry?
Iodometry is a method used to measure the amount of free iodine in a sample. Free iodine is the form of iodine that is available for biochemical reactions in the body. In iodometry, the free iodine is reacted with a reagent called iodide, which forms a colored complex that can be measured spectrophotometrically. The amount of iodine present in the sample is proportional to the intensity of the color produced.
What is Iodimetry?
Iodimetry is a method used to measure the amount of total iodine (both free and bound) in a sample. In iodimetry, the sample is treated with a reagent called tyrosine, which selectively reacts with iodinated tyrosines in the sample. The resulting complex can be measured spectrophotometrically, and the amount of total iodine present in the sample is proportional to the intensity of the color produced.
Differences between Iodometry and Iodimetry
While both iodometry and iodimetry measure iodine content in a sample, there are some differences between the two methods:
1. Target compounds: In iodometry, the target compound is free iodine, while in iodimetry, the target compound is iodinated tyrosines (such as thyroxine and triiodothyronine).
2. Reaction mechanism: In iodometry, the reaction involves the direct reaction of free iodine with the reagent iodide, while in iodimetry, the reaction involves the selective reaction of iodinated tyrosines with the reagent tyrosine.
3. Measurement method: Iodometry typically involves measuring the absorbance or intensity of the colored complex produced by the reaction, while iodimetry involves measuring the amount of tyrosine remaining in the sample after the reaction.
Applications of Iodometry and Iodimetry
Iodometry and iodimetry have a wide range of applications in various fields, including:
1. Clinical diagnostics: Iodometry and iodimetry can be used to diagnose thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism by measuring the amount of free iodine in the blood or urine.
2. Nutritional research: Iodometry and iodimetry can be used to assess iodine intake and evaluate the effectiveness of iodine supplementation programs.
3. Environmental monitoring: Iodometry and iodimetry can be used to monitor iodine levels in water and soil samples, which can help identify areas with high levels of iodine pollution.
4. Food safety: Iodometry and iodimetry can be used to detect iodine residues in food products, which can help ensure the safety of the food supply.
Conclusion
Iodometry and iodimetry are important techniques for measuring iodine content in a sample. While they share some similarities, there are also differences between the two methods. Understanding these methods and their applications can help professionals in various fields make informed decisions about iodine assessment and management.

Iodometry is a method used to determine the amount of an oxidizing agent or a compound containing an oxidizing agent in a solution. The method involves using iodide ions as a titrant, which are oxidized by the oxidizing agent being analyzed. The amount of oxidizing agent is then determined by titrating it with a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate, which reduces the iodine back to iodide ions.
The reaction involved in iodometry is as follows:
I2 + 2Ag+ + 2OH- â†’ 2AgI + 2H2O
In this reaction, the iodine (I2) reacts with silver ions (Ag+) and water (OH-) to form silver iodide (AgI) and water. The amount of oxidizing agent in the solution is proportional to the amount of iodine formed, which can be measured by a spectrophotometer or a colorimeter.
The sodium thiosulfate standard solution is used to reduce the iodine back to iodide ions, which can then be titrated with a known volume of the sample being analyzed. The amount of oxidizing agent in the sample is calculated based on the volume of the sodium thiosulfate solution required to consume all the iodine formed.
Iodometry is commonly used to determine the amount of oxygen in blood and other biological fluids, as well as in environmental and industrial samples. It is a reliable and accurate method that has been widely used for many years. However, it requires specialized equipment and expertise to perform the analysis, which can make it less practical for some applications.

To determine the molarity of sodium thiosulfate, we need to know the amount of I2 released during the reaction and the volume of reagent used for titration. From the given information, we can write down the following reactions:
Reaction 1:
$$\ce{Na2S2O3 + 2K2CrO4 -> 2Na CrO4 + K2SO3 + 2S2O3}$$
From this reaction, we can see that 0.3259 g of potassium dichromate is required to react with 67 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution, which means that the molarity of sodium thiosulfate is:
$$\mu = \frac{moles}{volume} = \frac{0.3259 g}{67 mL} = 0.0487 M}$$
Therefore, the molarity of sodium thiosulfate is 0.0487 M.
