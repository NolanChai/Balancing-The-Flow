Hi Walid,

Thank you for reaching out and considering our availability. I regret to inform you that Monday is not available for me as I am already booked. However, I would be happy to propose some alternative dates for us to meet.
How about Wednesday morning? Would 9:30 am Irish Time work for you? Alternatively, we could also consider another time on the same day or a different day altogether. Please let me know your thoughts and availability, and I'll be happy to accommodate your schedule as best as I can.
Best regards,

Sure! Here is a follow-up email:

Subject: Follow-up on Meeting Availability

Hi Ola,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding meeting availability. Thank you for providing alternative dates and times.
After reviewing my schedule, I am available on Wednesday at 9:00 AM as previously suggested. If this time still works for you, please let me know, and we can proceed with the meeting.
If this time does not work for you, please feel free to suggest other dates or times that may be more convenient for you, and I will do my best to accommodate your schedule.
Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,

Hi Neil,

Thank you for getting back to me. I'm sorry to hear that you won't be able to make it to our scheduled meeting. However, I appreciate your willingness to reschedule at a later date. Could you please provide me with some availability options so we can find a time that works for both of us?
Looking forward to hearing back from you.
Best regards,
Walid

Hi Neil,

Thank you for getting back to me. I understand that the original date isn't possible for you, and I appreciate your willingness to explore other options. I have some availability in the coming weeks and would be happy to schedule a meeting on one of the following dates:

* Wednesday, March 15th at 10am EST (New York time)
* Friday, March 17th at 2pm EST (New York time)

Please let me know if any of these dates work for you, or if you have any other preferences. I'm looking forward to hearing from you and discussing the topic further.

Here is a corrected sentence:
Partner is no longer available to attend our meeting today and has requested to reschedule for other dates. An email was sent with alternative available slots.

Sure, here's a response you can use:

"Great, thank you for letting me know! Yes, this date works perfectly for me. I look forward to meeting with you then. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to prepare."
