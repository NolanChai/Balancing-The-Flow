I can see that you have a lot of functions defined in your code, but I'm not sure what they do or how to use them. Could you please provide more context or explain each function and its purpose?
Here are the functions you defined:
* `hcyl`: This function takes three arguments - `bottom`, `height`, `radius`, and `id`. It appears to be a cylinder-shaped block generator, but I'm not sure how it works.
* `cyl`: Similar to `hcyl`, this function generates cylindrical blocks but with a different parameter list.
* `cube`: This function takes four arguments - `bottom`, `height`, `radius`, and `id`. It appears to generate cubic blocks, but I'm not sure how it works.
* `sphereoid`: This function takes three arguments - `w`, `h`, and `d`. It generates sphere-like blocks based on a complex formula involving the dimensions of the block and its center coordinates.
* `sleep`: This is a simple function that takes a millisecond value as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves after that amount of time has passed.
* `asphereoid`: Similar to `sphereoid`, this function generates sphere-like blocks but with a different parameter list.
* `line`: This function takes six arguments - `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `z2`. It appears to generate a line of blocks based on the coordinates of its endpoints.
* `cloneBlock`: This function takes five arguments - `sx`, `sy`, `sz`, `dx`, and `dz`. It clones a block of a specified size from one location to another.
* `duplicateBlock`: Similar to `cloneBlock`, this function duplicates a block of a specified size from one location to another, but it also includes an `offsetX`, `offsetY`, and `offsetZ` parameter that allows you to offset the clone's position.
* `rotateBlock`: This function takes six arguments - `sx`, `sy`, `sz`, `dx`, `dy`, and `dz`. It rotates a block of a specified size around its center by a specified angle.
* `fillBlock`: Similar to `cloneBlock`, this function fills a rectangular area with a block of a specified size from one location to another.

 Could you please explain how these functions work and provide examples of how to use them?
