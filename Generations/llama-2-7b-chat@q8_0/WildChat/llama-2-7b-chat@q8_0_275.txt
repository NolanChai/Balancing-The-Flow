The planet Psychre, homeworld of the lomneals, is a fascinating celestial body that offers a unique glimpse into the evolutionary pathways of life in the galaxy. Located in the cold zone around the G-type star Op, Psychre shares many similarities with Luna, but with a few key differences that have led to the emergence of an entirely new form of life.
The surface of Psychre is characterized by large black spots made of blacker rocks, which are heated by absorption of starlights. This heat energy, combined with the presence of ice crystals and starlights, creates a unique environment that supports life on the planet. The bluish gray regions of the map contain ice crystals, while the middle gray areas lack them, making these areas more hospitable to life.
One of the most striking features of Psychre is the prevalence of ice-based proteins and lipids in its flora and fauna. Unlike carbon-based life forms found on other planets, life on Psychre is based on ice, which has led to the evolution of unique structures and biological processes. Icewood trees, for example, have light blue woods and leaves, and are capable of absorbing and storing vast amounts of energy from starlights.
The lomneals, the sophont spacefaring species that call Psychre home, are a fascinating race of beings. They are humanoid in appearance, with skin that ranges in color from #74b0ff to #bdd9ff, hair that can range in color from #008000 to #ff8c00, and eye irises that are dark and contain melanin. Their blood is transparent and lacks hemoglobin, allowing them to absorb and store energy more efficiently.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of lomneal society, however, is their genderless nature. They do not recognize the concept of gender, and instead identify as either male or female depending on their biological sex at birth. This has led to a highly pacifist and xenophilic society, where cooperation and mutual respect are valued above all else.
Lomneals live in a society that is best described as pirate anarchy. They have no central government or authority figure, and instead govern themselves through a system of loose alliances and agreements. They are also polygamous pansexual, meaning they can form romantic and sexual relationships with any being, regardless of gender or species.
In terms of architecture, lomneals have developed a unique style that reflects their ice-based biology. Their buildings are often made from a combination of ice and other materials, such as metals and minerals, and are designed to maximize energy efficiency and storage. They also incorporate elements of their pirate culture into their architecture, with many structures featuring hidden rooms and secret passageways.
Overall, Psychre is a fascinating planet that offers a glimpse into the vast diversity of life in the galaxy. With its unique ice-based ecosystem and pacifist, xenophilic society, it is a place that continues to captivate and inspire those who encounter it.
