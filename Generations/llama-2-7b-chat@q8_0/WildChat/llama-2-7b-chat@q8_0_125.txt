The correct answer is (B): Treatments are randomly assigned to subjects within each block.
A randomized block design is a statistical method that involves dividing the participants into blocks based on certain characteristics (in this case, age-group), and then randomly assigning the participants in each block to either the treatment or control group. This ensures that the groups within each block are comparable with respect to the blocking variable (age-group), which helps to minimize confounding variables and increase the internal validity of the study.
Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.
Here's why the other options are not true:
Option (A) is incorrect because the number of subjects in each block is not necessarily different. In a randomized block design, the number of subjects in each block may be different, but it is not a requirement.
Option (C) is incorrect because a control group is essential in many experiments to provide a basis for comparison. While the randomized block design helps to minimize confounding variables within blocks, it does not eliminate them completely. A control group provides a baseline against which to compare the treatment group, which helps to isolate the effects of the treatment.
Option (D) is incorrect because a matched-pairs design involves pairing subjects from one group with subjects from the other group, whereas a randomized block design involves randomly assigning subjects within each block to either the treatment or control group.
Option (E) is incorrect because in a randomized block design, all subjects in a particular block receive the same treatment.

To calculate the probability that a player will toss the die at least 2 times before blue lands faceup, we need to find the probability of not landing on blue on the first toss, and then the probability of not landing on blue on the second toss. We can repeat this calculation for as many tosses as necessary until blue lands faceup.
The probability of not landing on blue on the first toss is 3/8, since there are three red faces and no blue faces on the die.
The probability of not landing on blue on the second toss, given that blue has not landed on the first toss, is also 3/8, since the die has not changed in any way after the first toss.
We can continue this calculation for as many tosses as necessary:
Probability of not landing on blue on the $i$th toss: $3/8$
Probability of not landing on blue after $i$ tosses: $(3/8)^i$
The probability that a player will toss the die at least 2 times before blue lands faceup is therefore:
$$P(\geq 2) = 1 - P(<2) = 1 - (3/8)^2 = 0.75$$
So the probability of a player tossing the die at least 2 times before blue lands faceup is $0.75$ or $75\%$.

Here are some methods that could be used to solve the problem of finding the probability of a student being selected for a particular course, based on the data provided:

1. Use of histograms: Histograms can be used to visualize the distribution of grades in each class and compare them to determine if there is any difference in the grade distributions. AP statistics teaches how to create histograms and interpret them to understand the distribution of data.
2. Descriptive Statistics: AP statistics emphasizes the use of descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance, to summarize and describe a dataset. These measures can be used in this problem to characterize the distribution of grades in each class and compare them. 
3. Confidence Intervals: AP Statistics also emphasizes the use of confidence intervals, which are used to estimate a population parameter based on a sample of data. In this case, a confidence interval for the probability of a student being selected for a particular course could be constructed using the sample proportion of students who were selected from each class and the desired level of confidence.
4. Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is another important method in statistics that involves testing a null hypothesis about a population parameter based on a sample of data. In this case, a hypothesis test could be conducted to determine if there is a significant difference in the probability of selection between classes. The results of the hypothesis test could be used to make decisions or draw conclusions about the population.
5. Regression Analysis: AP statistics also teaches regression analysis, which involves modeling the relationship between two or more variables. In this problem, simple linear regression could be used to model the relationship between grade and probability of selection, and to determine if there is a significant difference in the slope of the line between classes.
6. Non-Parametric Methods: Non-parametric methods are used when the assumptions of parametric methods (such as normality) are not met. In this case, non-parametric methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test could be used to compare the distribution of grades in each class and determine if there is a significant difference in the probability of selection between classes.
7. Propability: Probability is another important concept in statistics that is used to calculate the chance of an event occurring. In this problem, the probability of a student being selected for a particular course could be calculated using the sample proportion of students who were selected from each class and the desired level of confidence.
8. Expected Value: AP statistics also emphasizes the use of expected value, which is the sum of the products of each possible outcome and its probability. In this case, the expected value of the probability of a student being selected for a particular course could be calculated using the sample proportion of students who were selected from each class and the desired level of confidence.
9. Margin of Error: AP statistics also emphasizes the use of margin of error, which is a measure of how much an estimate of a population parameter may differ from the true value due to random sampling errors. In this problem, the margin of error could be calculated using the sample size and the desired level of confidence.
10. Sampling Distribution: AP statistics emphasizes the use of sampling distribution, which is the distribution of the sample statistic over repeated samples of the same size and composition. In this problem, the sampling distribution of the probability of a student being selected for a particular course could be used to construct a confidence interval for the population proportion.

By using these methods and techniques from AP Statistics, you can analyze the data provided and make inferences about the probability of students being selected for a particular course based on their grades.
