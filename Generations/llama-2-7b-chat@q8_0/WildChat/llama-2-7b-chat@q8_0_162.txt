The history of X OS is a long and storied one, filled with innovations, advancements, and occasional detours into uncharted territory. Here's a brief overview of the major milestones in X OS development:
X-DOS (1987): The first version of X OS was released under the moniker X-DOS, with a text-based interface that was simple and easy to use. This early release marked the beginning of a long lineage of X OS systems.
X-DOS 2 (1989): In this second iteration of X-DOS, the font size was reduced, making it even more compact and efficient for users.
X-DOS 3 (1990): With the addition of color support through the COLOR command, X-DOS 3 took a significant step forward in terms of visual appeal and user experience. This version set the stage for future developments in X OS.
X-DOS 4 (1992): The inclusion of DevX, an integrated development environment, allowed for custom xapp development and marked a key turning point in X OS history.
X-DOS 5 (1994): This version provided support for Progressnet, a powerful tool that enabled users to create complex programs with ease.
X OS (1996): With the introduction of X OS, the X-DOS kernel was replaced by an entirely new system that provided a graphical user interface. This marked a significant departure from earlier versions and set the stage for further innovations in X OS.
X OS 2 (1998): Building upon the foundation laid in X OS, this version included features from both X-DOS 5 and Progressnet-related programs, providing users with an even more comprehensive toolkit.
XT kernel (1999): The introduction of the XT kernel marked a significant shift in X OS development, as it provided improved GUI capabilities and a more modern, streamlined interface.
X OS 3 (2001): With the addition of Progress Sweeper and Progresstrix, this version expanded on the features offered by earlier versions, providing users with even more tools and functionality.
XT2 kernel (2003): This second iteration of the XT kernel further refined the GUI and performance of X OS, laying the groundwork for future developments.
X OS 4 (2005): Providing LAN support and IDLE Network capabilities, this version renames X-DOS to X-CMD and represents a significant step forward in terms of connectivity and networking functionality.
X OS 5 (2007): With a focus on network features, this version expanded upon the advancements made in X OS 4, providing users with even more robust networking capabilities.
XT kernel 2 (2009): This updated version of the XT kernel incorporated further refinements to the GUI and performance, solidifying X OS's position as a leader in the industry.
X OS 6 (2011): With a focus on network features, this version expanded upon the advancements made in previous versions, providing users with even more robust networking capabilities.
X OS 7 (2013): This version saw adjustments to the GUI and programs, further refining the user experience and laying the groundwork for future innovations.
XT kernel 3 (2015): The introduction of the third iteration of the XT kernel represented a significant milestone in X OS development, as it provided improved performance and reliability, as well as enhanced GUI capabilities.
X OS 8 (2017): A complete revampment of the system, this version renames X-CMD to X-Shell and provides users with an entirely new interface that is more intuitive and user-friendly than ever before.
X OS 9 (2019): With a focus on providing a full-screen menu similar to Progressbar 81, this version represents a significant departure from earlier versions while still maintaining the core functionality and reliability that have made X OS a leader in the industry.
And finally, in 2023, X OS was rebranded as X OS X, with a centered begin button and fluent graphics, providing users with an even more streamlined and intuitive interface.
