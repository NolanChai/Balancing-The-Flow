As I sat in the supernatural clubroom with my fellow club members, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. It was another day, another meeting, and yet, something felt different. Maybe it was the way Sayori's vampiric nature made us have to gather at night, or maybe it was the fact that this was her first pregnancy - and she was 7 months along with a boy and a girl on the way.
But then, without warning, there was a loud crashing sound that echoed through the room. It wasn't like any other vehicle we had heard before, and it made us all stop and take notice. We exchanged nervous glances, wondering what could have caused such a strange noise.
It was then that we saw him - MC, an alien who had crash-landed on our planet. He was unconscious, lying on the ground with his UFO in shambles around him. It was clear that the crash had been catastrophic, leaving nothing behind but a trail of debris and destruction.
As we gathered around MC, trying to figure out what to do next, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer oddity of it all. Here we were, a group of supernatural beings, dealing with an actual alien who had crashed on our planet. It was almost too much to take in.
But as always, we banded together and began to come up with a plan. We would help MC, find out what he needed, and see if there was anything we could do to help him repair his UFO. And who knows, maybe he would even be able to help us in return. After all, you never know when having an alien on your side might come in handy.
