Chapter 1: A New Beginning
Petunia Evans' heart raced as she paced around her small flat in London. It was a beautiful summer evening, but the sight of her little sister Lilly's smug face through the window made her blood boil. Lilly was sitting on the balcony with her fianc√© Vernon Dursley, laughing and chatting as if nothing was wrong. Petunia's eyes narrowed as she watched them, remembering the argument they had earlier that day.
"Lilly, how could you do this to me?" Petunia had asked, her voice shaking with anger. "I thought we were family!"
Lilly had rolled her eyes and sighed, "Petunia, I'm sorry, but you're being selfish. Vernon is my soulmate, and he needs me now more than ever."
Petunia felt a pang of sadness at the thought of losing her sister's love and support, but she refused to back down. "I don't care about your feelings, Lilly. You're going to regret this decision when Voldemort comes back and you're left alone to face him."
Lilly had glared at her, "You're always so dramatic, Petunia. Voldemort is gone, and he's not coming back. Vernon and I are happy together, and that's all that matters."
Petunia had stormed out of the flat, feeling defeated and alone. Now, as she watched Lilly and Vernon laughing on the balcony, she couldn't help but wonder if she had made a mistake by standing up for herself.
Just then, there was a knock at the door. Petunia turned to see a tall, handsome man standing in the hallway. He introduced himself as Hayashizaki Jinkai, a Japanese noble and samurai visiting England on business. Petunia felt a flutter in her chest as she invited him inside, wondering if this chance encounter would lead to something more.
As they talked, Petunia found herself opening up to Jinkai about her struggles with Lilly and her feelings of isolation within the wizarding community. Jinkai listened intently, his piercing eyes filled with compassion and understanding. For the first time in months, Petunia felt a glimmer of hope.
"I think I need to get away from here," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Being around Lilly and the Dursleys is too much for me. I need some time to myself."
Jinkai nodded, his face serious. "I understand. Perhaps I can help you find a new beginning in Japan."
Petunia's eyes widened with excitement. "Do you think that's possible?"
Jinkai smiled, "I will do everything in my power to make it happen."
As the evening wore on, Petunia found herself falling for Jinkai more and more. She couldn't believe how much he understood her, how much he seemed to care. And as they said their goodbyes and he left for his business appointments, she knew that she would never forget this chance encounter with the handsome Japanese samurai.
Little did she know, Jinkai was not just any ordinary noble, but a powerful magician from the prestigious Magika Kenshi clan, with ties to some of the most influential families in Japan. And as he made his way back to Japan, Petunia Evans' name was on his lips, whispered with a smile and a glint in his eye...
