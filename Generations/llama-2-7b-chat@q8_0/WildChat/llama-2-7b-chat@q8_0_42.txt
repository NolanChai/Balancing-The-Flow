Here are some minor changes you could make to fine-tune your statement:
1. Use the same terminology as the original statement: "FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS." This shows that you are familiar with the terminology used in the original statement and helps to maintain consistency.
2. Avoid using repetitive language: Instead of saying "The average size in production may have difference," consider rephrasing it to something like "I'm checking with CCMS to confirm the average size of the Annual Statement in production, as it may vary." This helps to convey the same message without repeating the same phrase twice.
Here is an updated version of your statement that incorporates these suggestions:
"FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS to confirm the average size of the statement in production, as it may vary."

Here is a proofread version of the statement:
FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS. The average size in production may differ.

Some possible improvements to the statement include:

* Using "may" instead of "difference" to make it more clear that you are talking about a potential difference.
* Adding a comma after "production" to improve readability.
* Changing "FYI" to "For Your Information," which is a more common and formal way of expressing this type of message.
