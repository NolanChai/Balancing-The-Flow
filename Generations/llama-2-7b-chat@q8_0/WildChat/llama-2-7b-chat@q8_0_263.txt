I can understand why you might prefer to watch anime through illegal means, especially when there are few legal options available. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of supporting piracy and fan-dubbing. Here are some reasons why:
1. Supporting the creators: Anime is a labor-intensive process that requires a significant investment of time, money, and effort from the creators. By choosing to watch illegal fansubs, you're depriving the creators of the financial compensation they deserve for their work.
2. Quality issues: While some fansubs may be well-translated and edited, others can be of variable quality, with inaccuracies, typos, and poor sound quality. By choosing to watch legally available anime, you're ensuring that you're getting a high-quality product that is closer to the original intent of the creators.
3. Lack of support for the industry: Piracy and fan-dubbing can harm the anime industry as a whole by creating a market for illegal content. This can lead to a decrease in investment in new anime projects, which can result in fewer new shows being produced. By supporting legal streaming services and buying official merchandise, you're helping to ensure that the industry continues to thrive.
4. Respecting intellectual property rights: Anime is a form of intellectual property that requires protection under copyright law. By choosing to watch illegal fansubs, you're contributing to a culture of disrespect for intellectual property rights, which can have broader implications for the creative industries as a whole.
In summary, while I understand the appeal of illegal fansubs, I strongly advise against supporting piracy and encouraging others to do the same. Instead, explore legal streaming services that offer a wide range of anime titles and support the creators by purchasing official merchandise. By doing so, you're not only getting access to high-quality content but also contributing to the continued growth and success of the anime industry as a whole.

I cannot provide advice on how to illegally access or stream copyrighted content, including anime that has not been legally released in your country. It is important to respect the intellectual property laws and regulations of your country and the creators' rights.
Becoming an "anime refugee" by attempting to access illegal streaming sites or pirated copies of anime is not a viable or ethical solution. Not only can it lead to legal consequences, but it also deprives the creators and producers of the anime industry of their rightful compensation for their work.
Instead, consider exploring legitimate streaming services that offer a wide range of anime titles, including new releases and classic series. Many platforms, such as Crunchyroll, Funimation, and HIDIVE, offer legal and affordable access to anime content with English subtitles or dubs.
Additionally, many anime studios and distributors are actively working to make their content available on a global scale through official partnerships and licensing agreements with streaming services. For example, Studio Pierrot's popular series "One Piece" is now available on Netflix in several countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the UK.
In summary, while it may be challenging to access anime that has not been legally released in your country, there are legitimate streaming services and platforms that offer legal and ethical ways to watch your favorite anime titles.

Ah, I see! In that case, here are some alternative options to watch "To Your Eternity" legally:
1. Check if any streaming platforms have acquired the license for "To Your Eternity": While Brains Base may not be willing to license the show to streaming platforms in your country, it's possible that another distributor or platform has picked up the rights. You can check websites like Crunchyroll, Funimation, or Hulu to see if they have acquired the license for "To Your Eternity".
2. Look into international streaming services: While Netflix may not have "To Your Eternity", there are other international streaming services that offer a wide range of anime titles. You can check out platforms like VRV, Animelab, or Studio Pierrot's official streaming service. These services may have "To Your Eternity" available in their catalogue.
3. Keep an eye on upcoming anime releases: While "To Your Eternity" may not be available now, new anime series are constantly being released. You can keep an eye on upcoming releases and sign petitions or reach out to streaming platforms to demand that they acquire the rights for these shows.
4. Consider purchasing a legal download or streaming service: While buying a physical DVD or Blu-ray may not be feasible, there are other options available. You can purchase a digital copy of "To Your Eternity" from platforms like Amazon Video or Google Play Movies. This way, you can support the creators and watch the show legally without harming the environment.
By taking these steps, you can help make "To Your Eternity" available to more people while also supporting the creators and avoiding illegal streaming methods.

Ah, I see. It's unfortunate to hear that some fans of "To Your Eternity" have been subjected to derogatory language from others. The term "marginal" is often used in a negative way to dismiss or belittle people who are perceived as being on the fringes of society, and it's important to recognize and challenge this kind of language when we encounter it.
Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their interests or beliefs. It's okay to have different opinions and preferences from others, and it's important to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue whenever possible.
I hope that the fans of "To Your Eternity" who were called "marginals" will not let this incident discourage them from expressing their passion for the anime. There are many ways to connect with like-minded people and share your enthusiasm for a particular series, whether it's through online communities, fan conventions, or other events. Remember that everyone has the right to enjoy and appreciate the things they love, without fear of judgment or ridicule.

I understand. It can be frustrating and disappointing when a representative from Crunchroll makes such a claim about your efforts to bring To Your Eternity to your country. However, it's important to remember that AI-powered bots are not capable of organizing complex social media campaigns or mobilizing large numbers of people to take action.
If you have evidence to suggest that the campaign was genuinely organized by fans and not by bots, you may want to share this information with Crunchroll's representative to help clarify the situation. This could include screenshots or links to social media posts, as well as testimonials from participants in the campaign who can vouch for its legitimacy.
It's also possible that Crunchroll's representative may have made an error in their assessment of the campaign. In any case, it's important to approach the situation calmly and professionally, and to continue advocating for the release of To Your Eternity in your country. Remember that your efforts are appreciated by many fans who are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to watch this anime legally and conveniently.
