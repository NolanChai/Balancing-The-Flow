Dear Walid,

Thank you for reaching out to me. I apologize, but I'm afraid I'm fully booked on Monday. Would you like to propose another date? I'm available on Wednesday morning, or any other time that suits you. Please let me know your availability and I will do my best to accommodate it.
Best regards,
[Your Name]

Sure! Here is a follow-up email:

Subject: Follow-up on Meeting Availability

Hi Ola,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the meeting time and date. As we discussed, I provided two alternative dates and times for us to meet: Wednesday at 9:00 AM and Thursday at 10:00 PM.
Please let me know if either of these options work for you, or if you have any other preferences. I'm available to meet during the daytime on Friday as well, if that works better for you.
If you could let me know your availability by the end of the day today, I can make sure to finalize the meeting details.
Thank you and look forward to hearing back from you soon!
Best Regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Neil,

No problem at all! Thank you for letting me know that you won't be able to make it. I completely understand and appreciate your prompt response.

Of course, I'm still available for other dates, and I'd be more than happy to provide some options for you. Could you please let me know what days and times work best for you in the upcoming week? I'll do my best to accommodate your schedule.
Looking forward to hearing back from you!
Best regards,
Walid

Dear Neil,

Thank you for reaching out and apologizing for your inability to attend the previously scheduled meeting. I completely understand and appreciate your willingness to reschedule.
Here are some alternative dates and times that may work for both of us:
Tuesday, March 28th at 10am
Wednesday, April 5th at 2pm
Thursday, April 14th at 9am
Please let me know which of these options works best for you, and I will make sure to adjust my schedule accordingly.
Looking forward to hearing from you and potentially rescheduling our meeting.
Best regards,
Walid

The corrected sentence should read:
"Partner is no longer available to attend our meeting today and has requested to reschedule for other dates. An email was sent with alternative available slots."

Sure! Here's a response you can use:

Subject: Re: Meeting on March 23rd at 10am

Thank you for reaching out and confirming the date and time for our meeting. I'm glad to hear that this date is working for you. I'll make sure to be there at 10am sharp. Looking forward to seeing you then!
