However, the overall CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems are significantly influenced by the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of the upstream CO2RR. The CO2 SPCE and EE of CO2RR are closely linked to the optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions.
