To answer your questions:
1. Unfortunately, you may not be able to recover the money on your closed Visa card. Once a card has been closed and the funds transferred to your bank account, it's unlikely that you'll be able to retrieve the remaining balance. Banks typically do not offer refunds or transfers of funds from closed accounts.
However, if you believe there was an error in closing your card or that you have not received all of the funds from the closure, you may want to contact your bank to dispute the issue and request a reversal of the closure.
2. It is possible to request another Visa card if your previous card has been canceled. However, as you mentioned, the card issuer may not allow you to request multiple cards for yourself. Each card issuer has their own policies regarding the issuance of replacement cards, so it's best to contact your bank directly and ask about their specific procedures.
In general, if you need a new card due to a lost or stolen card, most banks will provide you with a replacement card without charging any fees. However, if you're requesting a new card for another reason, such as to replace an old card that has expired, you may be charged a fee for the issuance of the new card.
In any case, it's always best to contact your bank directly and ask about their specific policies regarding replacement cards. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information and help you resolve any issues related to your Visa card.
