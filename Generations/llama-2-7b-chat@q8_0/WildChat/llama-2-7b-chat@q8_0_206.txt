In the FOPL system, the double negation rule is:
 Double Negation: ¬¬A ↔ A
Using this rule and the definition of existential and universal quantification in the FOPL system, we can prove the desired equivalence as follows:

Step 1: Convert the statement to disjunction form.
|- (¬∃xP(x)) ⇔ ∀x(¬P(x))
= ∨(¬∃xP(x)) ∨(∀x¬P(x))
= ∨((¬P(x) ∧ ∀xP(x)) ∨ (¬P(x) ∧ ∃xP(x)))
Step 2: Use the double negation rule to convert each disjunction into a conjunction.
= ∨((¬P(x) ∧ ∀xP(x)) ∨ (¬P(x) ∧ ∃xP(x)))
= ¬(P(x) ∧ ∀xP(x)) ∨ ¬(P(x) ∧ ∃xP(x))
Step 3: Use the definition of existential and universal quantification to simplify the left-hand side.
|- ¬(P(x) ∧ ∀xP(x)) ⇔ P(x) ∧ ¬(∀xP(x))
= P(x) ∧ ¬(∃xP(x))
Step 4: Use the definition of existential and universal quantification to simplify the right-hand side.
|- ¬(P(x) ∧ ∃xP(x)) ⇔ ∀x(¬P(x))
Therefore, we have shown that the two statements are equivalent in the FOPL system:
|- (¬∃xP(x)) ⇔ ∀x(¬P(x))
In summary, the proof consists of four steps:
1. Convert the statement to disjunction form.
2. Use the double negation rule to convert each disjunction into a conjunction.
3. Simplify the left-hand side using the definition of existential and universal quantification.
4. Simplify the right-hand side using the definition of existential and universal quantification.

To prove that $\exists x (P(x) \lor Q(x)) \iff (\exists x P(x) \lor \exists x Q(x))$ using the tableau method, follow these steps:

1. Set up the premises and conclusion of the argument in the table:
| Premise | Conclusion |
| ∃x P(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
| ∃x Q(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
2. Build the first row of the table by listing the premises:
| Premise | Conclusion |
| ∃x P(x) | ∃x P(x) |
3. Build the second row of the table by listing the other premise:
| Premise | Conclusion |
| ∃x Q(x) | ∃x Q(x) |
4. Connect the rows by using the implication symbol (→):
| Premise | Conclusion |
| ∃x P(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) → ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
| ∃x Q(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) → ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
5. Evaluate the conclusion:
| Premise | Conclusion |
| ∃x P(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
| ∃x Q(x) | ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
By traversing the tableau, we can see that the two statements are equivalent. Therefore, the argument is valid.
