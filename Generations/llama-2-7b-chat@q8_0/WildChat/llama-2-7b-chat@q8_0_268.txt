As the girls continued their activities in the clubroom, they were suddenly interrupted by a strange and unexpected noise. The sound of a loud "POP" echoed through the room, catching their attention and causing them to look around in confusion.
To their surprise, a small puddle of amniotic fluid had appeared between Natsuki's legs, seemingly out of nowhere. Natsuki herself was oblivious to the strange occurrence, lost in her task of baking cupcakes as usual.
The other girls were shocked and stared at the puddle in disbelief. Monika, who was writing poems nearby, put down her pen and approached the puddle cautiously, while Yuri set down her book, "Portrait of Markov," and came to investigate as well.
"Sayori isn't here yet," Yuri said, looking around the room. "Do you think she's okay?"
Monika shook her head, her eyes fixed on the puddle. "I don't know, but this doesn't look normal."
As they tried to make sense of what was happening, the door to the clubroom suddenly burst open and Sayori stormed in, looking flustered and disheveled.
