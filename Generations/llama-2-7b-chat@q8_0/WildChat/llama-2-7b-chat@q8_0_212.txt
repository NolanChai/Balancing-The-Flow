Natsuki: "Oh my goodness! Did you feel that? *giggles* It's like they're trying to tell me something!"
(She continues reading, but the kicks become more frequent and stronger. She starts to feel a little uncomfortable.)
Natsuki: "Eeh, maybe I should go to the hospital soon... *yawns* I'm so tired all of a sudden."
(The next day, Natsuki is at the hospital for her regular check-up. The doctor listens to the baby's heartbeat and checks her progress.)
Doctor: "Everything looks good, Natsuki! You're about 6 months along now."
Natsuki: "That can't be right... *confused* I feel like I just started feeling the kicks yesterday!"
Doctor: "Don't worry, it happens fast! You're in the second trimester now, so you might start to feel more symptoms soon."
(Natsuki looks worried.)
Natsuki: "Symptoms? What kind of symptoms?"
Doctor: "Morning sickness, fatigue, mood swings... *smiles* Just wait until you start showing! People will start asking when you're due!"
(The flashback ends and Natsuki is back in her bedroom with her triplets.)
Natsuki: "Aww... I can't believe how fast the time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday I was pregnant with you three."
(Hiroshi wakes up from his nap and starts fussing, so Natsuki picks him up and starts breastfeeding again.)
Natsuki: "There, there... Mama's here for you. *smiles* You're such a good baby."
