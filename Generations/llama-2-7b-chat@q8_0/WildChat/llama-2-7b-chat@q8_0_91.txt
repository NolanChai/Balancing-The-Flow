The issue seems to be with the `dotenv` package, which is not being installed correctly due to a subprocess error. Here are some possible solutions:
1. Run `pip install dotenv` in the command prompt or terminal where you are running the script to install the `dotenv` package manually.
2. Check if there are any errors in the output of the `pip install backend dependencies` command. If there are any errors, try to resolve them by running the command again with the `--verbose` or `--debug` option to get more detailed output.
3. Make sure that you have installed the `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory of your project. This file is required for the `pip install backend dependencies` command to work correctly.
4. Try running the `pip install backend dependencies` command with the `--no-binary :all: --no-deps` option to skip installing binary packages and dependency resolution.
5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `~/.local/bin` directory and running the `pip install backend dependencies` command again. This may fix any issues caused by a corrupted installation cache.
I hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue with installing the `dotenv` package and running your Python script successfully.
