Encounter Sequence:
1. The player enters the corridor filled with massive slash marks, indicating that something has been here before.
2. As they move deeper into the corridor, they come across a mural depicting a giant lavender-colored Praying Mantis creature - this is Miss Luna.
3. Miss Luna notices the player and frantically flails her scythe-like arms around in pure terror, causing the ground to shake beneath their feet.
4. "NYCTOPHOBIA! *flail, flail, flail* I CAN'T BE ARROUND THE LIGHT! *flail* PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE! *flail* I CAN'T TAKE IT! *flail*" Miss Luna screams hysterically.
5. The player can choose to either:
a) Attempt to calm Miss Luna down and convince her that they mean no harm.
b) Use their surroundings to create a makeshift shelter for Miss Luna, allowing her to safely escape the light.
c) Take advantage of Miss Luna's fear of the light and attack her while she is in a vulnerable state.
6. If the player chooses to calm Miss Luna down, they will have to use their persuasion skills to convince her that they are not a threat. If successful, Miss Luna will slowly begin to relax, her flailing subsiding as she becomes more comfortable with the player's presence.
7. If the player chooses to create a makeshift shelter for Miss Luna, they will have to search the surrounding area for materials to build a structure that can protect her from the light. Once constructed, Miss Luna will safely enter the shelter and wait until the light fades.
8. If the player chooses to attack Miss Luna while she is in a vulnerable state, they will have to deal with her colossal size and strength in combat. If successful, they can loot Miss Luna's body for valuable items, including her scythe-like arms and any Lunalings that may be developing inside her.
9. As the player approaches Miss Luna's room, they will hear the sound of Lunalings hatching from their mother's body - creating a chaotic and intense atmosphere.
10. The player enters Miss Luna's room and is greeted by a sea of colossal Lunalings, all of whom are eager to defend their mother at any cost. The player must use their combat skills to navigate this dangerous environment and face off against the Lunalings in battle.
111. If the player successfully defeats Miss Luna's Lunaling horde, they will have the opportunity to loot her room for valuable items, including rare weapons, armor, and other treasures.
12. As the player approaches Miss Luna, she will slowly come to terms with their presence - recognizing that they are not a threat to her or her Lunalings. She will offer to give them one of her scythe-like arms as a token of goodwill, allowing them to leave with a valuable and unique item.
