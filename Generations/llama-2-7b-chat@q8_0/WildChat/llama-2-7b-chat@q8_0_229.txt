"Oh no...," Layla muttered to herself as she watched the scene unfold before her. "What could have happened to Nilou and Indigo?"
Kaveh, the leader of the team, approached the stage cautiously, his Dendro armor glowing with a soft blue light. "Indigo, is that you? Can you hear us?" he called out, his voice gentle but urgent.
Collei, standing next to Kaveh, frowned as she examined the little girl. "She's too young to be here on her own... and yet, she looks so familiar."
Tighnari, who was hovering nearby, his eyes fixed intently on Indigo, spoke in a low tone. "It's like we're looking at a tiny version of Nilou herself... but why would she be here? And how did she end up giving birth so prematurely?"
Alhaitham, the most experienced member of the team, stepped forward to examine Indigo more closely. "I sense no ill will from this child... but we must find Nilou and ensure her safety immediately."
Just then, a flashback occurred in Layla's mind, revealing the events leading up to this moment. She saw Nilou, her body glowing with Hydro energy, giving birth to Indigo on the stage of the Zubayr Theater... and then the scene faded away, leaving only the present moment.
Layla shook her head, trying to clear it. "Was that... a flashback?" she asked, looking at Kaveh and the others uncertainly.
Kaveh nodded gravely. "Yes, it seems you've been given a glimpse into the past. We must find Nilou and Indigo now."
Without another word, the team of Dendro users set off towards the backstage area, determined to rescue Nilou and her newborn daughter before it was too late.
