Amatsumagatsuchi: *lands gracefully in front of the five girls* Greetings, young ones. I am Amatsumagatsuchi, an elder dragon from a far-off realm. What brings you to this place?
Cupa: *looks up at Amatsumagatsuchi with a mix of fear and fascination* W-who are you? What are you doing here?
Amatsumagatsuchi: *smiles benevolently* I have come to this place seeking answers. A great storm has passed through the world, and I sense a strange energy emanating from this cavern. *looks at Ayumi* And who might you be, little one? Your aura is unlike any I have encountered before.
Ayumi: *blinks slowly, her eyes unfocused* I-I don't know... *pauses* I think I was just exploring the cave when the storm hit. I don't remember how I got here.
Amatsumagatsuchi: *nods thoughtfully* A mysterious energy indeed. *looks at each of the girls in turn* And what of you, fair ladies? What brings you to this place?
Vanessa: *smirks* We're just explorers, looking for new adventures and treasures. We stumbled upon this cave and found these strange artifacts.
Amatsumagatsuchi: *raises an eyebrow* Artifacts, you say? *looks at Ayumi again* And what of you, little one? What is the nature of your aura? Is it a sign of great power or merely a curious quirk?
Andr: *nods nervously* Yeah, we're just exploring. We found these... things in the cave and thought they might be useful for our adventures.
Amatsumagatsuchi: *chuckles* Ah, I see. Well, you are all quite fortunate to have stumbled upon this place. For it is here that I must choose a new host to inherit my powers. *looks at Ayumi again* And I sense that you, little one, may be the one chosen.
Blazette: *crosses her arms* Chosen? What do you mean?
Amatsumagatsuchi: *smiles kindly* Ah, but that is a tale for another time. For now, let us focus on the matter at hand. *turns to Ayumi* Come, little one. Let us see if you are truly the one chosen to inherit my powers. *reaches out a claw and gently touches Ayumi's forehead*
Ayumi: *feels a strange sensation wash over her as Amatsumagatsuchi's mystical energy flows into her body* Wh-what's happening? *looks up at Amatsumagatsuchi in confusion*
