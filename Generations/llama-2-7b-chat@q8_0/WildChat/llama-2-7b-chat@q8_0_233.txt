Here is a fake case study for Channel 4 Christmas 2003:
Case Study: "Embracing the New Brand Attitude"
Objective: To exhibit the new brand attitude of Channel 4 without giving too much away before the official rebrand launch.
Context: We were just weeks away from the launch of Channel 4's highly anticipated rebrand, and the team was eager to showcase the new identity in a creative and engaging way. The brief was to embrace the new brand attitude without giving too much away, while also highlighting the channel's commitment to innovation and creativity.
Solution: Our solution was to use the same motion control camera move that would be featured in the upcoming "Perspective Idents," a series of idents that were designed to showcase the new brand attitude. The move, which involved a smooth and consistent left-to-right motion, provided the perfect visual framework for our case study.
To create the concept, we arranged a cluster of TVs in the shape of a Christmas tree, with each TV displaying a different aspect of the Channel 4 brand. The TVs were placed at various angles and heights to create a dynamic and visually striking display, while also emphasizing the channel's commitment to innovation and creativity.
The case study was shot in a studio environment, using a combination of live-action footage and motion graphics to bring the concept to life. The final product featured a series of short vignettes that highlighted different aspects of the Channel 4 brand, including its commitment to quality programming, its innovative approach to advertising, and its dedication to providing a platform for diverse voices and perspectives.
Results: The case study was a huge success, both in terms of creativity and impact. It effectively conveyed the new brand attitude of Channel 4 without giving too much away before the official rebrand launch, while also showcasing the channel's commitment to innovation and creativity. The use of the motion control camera move provided a consistent visual language that was both visually striking and emotionally engaging, making it a memorable and effective campaign.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our case study for Channel 4 Christmas 2003 effectively embraced and exhibited the new brand attitude of the channel without giving too much away before the official rebrand launch. By using the same motion control camera move as the upcoming "Perspective Idents," we were able to create a visually striking and emotionally engaging concept that showcased the channel's commitment to innovation and creativity. The campaign was a huge success, both in terms of creativity and impact, and provided a powerful introduction to the new Channel 4 brand identity.

'I'm sorry, but I can't see you. The darkness is too overwhelming', she says in a monotone voice. Her eyes are obscured by the shadows and it takes me a moment to realise that she is actually in a dark room with only blue lighting and TV static illuminating her face. One of the TVs behind her faintly shows one of the new idents, 'Pylons'.
The eerie atmosphere of the room settles over me like a shroud as I try to make out her features. The blue light casting an otherworldly glow on her face, accentuating her pale skin and dark eyes. She doesn't seem to notice my discomfort, lost in her own thoughts as she gazes at the TVs with an air of detachment.
I take a step forward, trying to get closer to her, but my feet feel heavy and unresponsive as if rooted to the floor. The darkness seems to be closing in on me, making it difficult for me to breathe. I cough, trying to clear my throat but the sound is muffled by some unknown force.
'What do you want from me?' she asks, her voice still monotone but with a hint of curiosity now. 'Why have you come here?', she adds, turning slightly towards me."
