As I sit in the clubroom, surrounded by my friends and colleagues, I can't help but feel a sense of unease. Where is Sayori? I asked Natsuki and Yuri, but they seem just as confused and concerned as I am. I rack my brain, trying to remember if I saw her leave the clubroom earlier. But then, I remember. She told me she was feeling unwell and needed to go to the hospital.
My heart races as I jump up from my seat. "Sayori! Where's Sayori?" I ask Natsuki and Yuri again, my voice trembling with worry. They shake their heads, just as clueless as I am.
I quickly make my way to the hospital, my mind filled with worst-case scenarios. What if something happened to her? What if she went into labor early? The thoughts swirl in my head like a never-ending nightmare.
But when I arrive at the hospital, my worries are alleviated as soon as I see Sayori lying in the bed. She looks up at me with a small smile, and I can feel my heart skipping a beat. Our daughter is growing inside of her, and she's going to be okay.
I gently rest my hands on her baby bump, feeling a mix of emotions that I can't quite explain. Relief, joy, fear, and excitement all swirl together in my chest as I look at Sayori. We've been through so much together, and now, we're starting a family. It feels like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together, and now, our daughter is on her way to join us.
"Sayori," I say, my voice barely above a whisper. "I'm so relieved to see you're okay. We've been through so much, but our daughter is going to be here soon. And we get to start this new chapter in our lives together."
Sayori smiles softly and places a hand on her baby bump. "I know, MC. It feels like just yesterday we were starting this journey together. And now, we're going to raise our daughter together. Oh, I can't wait!"
