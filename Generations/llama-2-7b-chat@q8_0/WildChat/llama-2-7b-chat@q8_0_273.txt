Marching Kingdoms (also known as Marching Armies or Marching Bands) is a term used in the video game industry to describe a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that allows non-player characters (NPCs) to move and interact with each other in a realistic manner. The goal of Marching Kingdoms is to create an immersive and realistic gaming experience by simulating the behavior of large groups of NPCs, such as armies or mobs, as they march and interact with each other in a virtual environment.
The term "Marching Kingdoms" comes from the idea that these AI systems are like a kingdom of NPCs that are moving and interacting together in a coordinated manner. The name is meant to evoke the image of an army or mob marching across a battlefield, with each individual unit following its own path and reacting to the movements and actions of other units within the group.
Marching Kingdoms are typically used in games that feature large-scale battles or events, such as strategy games, massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), and role-playing games (RPGs). The AI system uses algorithms to simulate the behavior of individual NPCs and their interactions with other units within the group. This allows for realistic movements and actions, such as formations, retreats, and attacks, which can enhance the overall immersion and realism of the game experience.
Some key features of Marching Kingdoms include:
1. Group movement: NPCs in a Marching Kingdoms system move and interact with each other in groups, rather than individually. This allows for realistic formations and movements, such as units advancing in a phalanx or retreating in a line formation.
2. Pathfinding: The AI system uses pathfinding algorithms to determine the best routes for individual NPCs to take within a group. This helps to avoid collisions and ensure that each unit reaches its destination in a realistic manner.
3. Behavior trees: Marching Kingdoms use behavior trees to define complex actions and decision-making processes for individual NPCs within a group. These trees can include multiple branches and conditions, allowing for realistic and context-dependent actions, such as retreating or attacking based on the situation.
4. Animation blending: To create a more realistic and immersive experience, Marching Kingdoms use animation blending to combine different animations for individual NPCs within a group. This allows for smooth and natural transitions between different actions, such as changing direction or attacking an enemy.
5. Social behavior: Marching Kingdoms simulate social behavior among NPCs, allowing them to interact with each other in a more realistic manner. This can include cooperative behaviors, such as fighting together, as well as competitive behaviors, such as vying for leadership or resources.
6. Adaptive difficulty: To ensure that the game remains challenging and engaging, Marching Kingdoms use adaptive difficulty algorithms to adjust the behavior of NPCs based on the player's performance. This can include adjusting the number of units, their difficulty level, or their behavior in response to the player's actions.
In summary, Marching Kingdoms are a type of AI system used in video games to simulate the behavior of large groups of non-player characters. By combining pathfinding, behavior trees, animation blending, social behavior, and adaptive difficulty algorithms, these systems create realistic and immersive environments that enhance the overall gaming experience.

There are several terms that are similar to "sound on sound" in terms of capturing the idea of a recording or reproducing an audio signal multiple times, each time with a slight variation. Here are some examples:
1. "Multitracking": This term refers to the process of recording multiple audio signals separately and then mixing them together to create a final output. Multitracking is commonly used in music production to capture different instruments or vocal parts separately, allowing for greater control over the final mix.
2. "Overdubbing": Similar to multitracking, overdubbing involves recording multiple layers of audio on top of an existing track. The main difference is that overdubbing typically involves adding a single layer of audio at a time, whereas multitracking allows for multiple layers to be recorded simultaneously.
3. "Phrasing": This term refers to the way in which an audio signal is divided into smaller sections or phrases, each with its own distinct shape and character. Phrasing can be used to create a sense of rhythm or to emphasize certain aspects of an audio signal.
4. "Gating": Gating involves controlling the level of an audio signal based on the level of another signal. This can be used to create a sense of compression or limiting, where the audio signal is reduced in volume when the underlying signal reaches a certain level.
5. "Feeding back": Feeding back involves recording a copy of an audio signal and then returning it to the mix, often with a slight delay or distortion added to create a feedback loop. This can be used to create a sense of space or ambiance in a recording, or to add depth and complexity to a sound.
6. "Reverb": Reverb (short for "reverberation") refers to the way in which an audio signal is affected by the acoustics of its environment. Reverb can be used to create a sense of space or ambiance in a recording, or to add depth and complexity to a sound.
7. "Delay": Delay involves recording an audio signal and then playing it back after a delay, often with additional effects added to create a more complex sound. This can be used to create a sense of depth or distance in a recording, or to add rhythmic interest to a track.
8. "Doubling": Doubling involves recording a copy of an audio signal and then playing it back alongside the original signal. This can be used to create a sense of depth or width in a recording, or to add rhythmic interest to a track.
9. "Stereo widening": Stereo widening involves adjusting the panorama of an audio signal to create a more spacious and immersive sound. This can be used to make a recording sound more expansive or atmospheric, or to add depth and complexity to a sound.
10. "Audio manipulation": Audio manipulation refers to any technique that involves altering the characteristics of an audio signal in some way, such as by changing its pitch, timbre, or volume. This can be used to create a wide range of effects, from subtle enhancements to radical transformations of the original sound.

Marcher kingdoms were small, independent states that existed in Wales during the Middle Ages. The term "marcher" refers to the fact that these states were located along the border with England, and their rulers were known as marcher lords or marshals.
The marcher kingdoms emerged in the 10th century, after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Normans brought a new system of feudalism to Wales, which led to the fragmentation of the traditional Welsh kingdoms and the rise of smaller, independent states along the border with England. These marcher lordships were often granted to loyal followers of the Norman kings, who were responsible for defending the English border against Welsh raids.
The marcher kingdoms were characterized by their small size and decentralized nature. They were often little more than large estates or manors, with their own lordships, castles, and fortifications. Despite their small scale, however, the marcher kingdoms played a significant role in Welsh politics and society during the Middle Ages. Many of the marcher lords were influential figures in the English royal court, and they often served as mediators between the English and Welsh crowns.
Some of the most prominent marcher kingdoms included:
* Herefordshire: Located in the southwest of England, Herefordshire was one of the largest and most powerful marcher lordships. Its rulers were known as the Earls of Hereford, and they played a significant role in English politics during the Middle Ages.
* Worcestershire: Another large marcher lordship located in central England, Worcestershire was granted to the Earl of Worcester by King Edward I in the late 13th century. The Earls of Worcester were prominent figures in English politics and society during the Middle Ages.
* Pembrokeshire: Located in southwest Wales, Pembrokeshire was one of the most important marcher lordships. Its rulers, the Earls of Pembroke, were powerful nobles who played a significant role in Welsh politics and society during the Middle Ages.
* Monmouthshire: Located in southeast Wales, Monmouthshire was another prominent marcher lordship. Its rulers, the Earls of Monmouth, were known for their loyalty to the English crown and played a significant role in Welsh politics during the Middle Ages.
The marcher kingdoms declined in importance during the 16th century, as the English monarchy centralized its power and established a more cohesive system of government in Wales. However, the legacy of the marcher kingdoms can still be seen in the modern-day boundaries of Welsh counties and the political and social dynamics of the region.

In fantasy literature, a "marcher kingdom" is a term used to describe a specific type of medieval society. The term comes from the Middle English word "marche," which referred to a borderland or march, an area along the edge of a kingdom where the king's authority was limited or non-existent.
In the context of the Gruinmarkt, the marcher kingdoms are likely feudal societies that exist along the eastern seaboard, where the authority of the Gruinmarkt monarch is weak or non-existent. These kingdoms may be semi-autonomous, with their own local leaders and institutions, but they are still subject to the overarching power of the Gruinmarkt monarch.
Marcher kingdoms are often depicted as being in a state of constant conflict with each other, vying for power and territory. They may also have complex relationships with the Gruinmarkt, perhaps paying tribute or providing military support in exchange for protection or access to resources.
In fantasy world-building, marcher kingdoms can be used to create a sense of complexity and depth in a fictional world, as well as to provide opportunities for political intrigue, conflict, and character development. They can also help to explain the cultural and social dynamics of a society, such as why certain regions are more developed or advanced than others.
