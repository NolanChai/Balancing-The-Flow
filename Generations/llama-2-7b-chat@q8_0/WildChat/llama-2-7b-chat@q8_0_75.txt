===============================

Sending a spoofed HTML email using C and SMTP is not a recommended practice, as it can be used for malicious purposes such as phishing or spamming. It is important to respect the privacy and security of others' emails and not engage in any activity that could potentially harm them.
Instead, I would suggest focusing on learning about email security and how to protect yourself and others from email-based threats. This can include understanding how to use email filters, configuring your email client to display a sender's true identity, and being cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources.
Additionally, it is important to be aware of the laws and regulations regarding email spoofing in your country and to always act in accordance with them.
If you have any other questions or concerns related to email security, please feel free to ask.

I understand. However, creating fake social media profiles or pages with the intention of testing someone's reactions is still not an ethical or respectful practice. It can also be illegal in some cases, depending on the laws and regulations in your country.
Instead of resorting to underhanded tactics, you may want to consider other ways to test someone's reactions or gather information about them. For example, you could have an open and honest conversation with them, or use non-invasive methods such as observing their behavior or body language.
Remember, honesty and respect are essential when interacting with others, both online and offline. It's important to always act with integrity and treat others with kindness and dignity.

Email spoofing is the act of sending an email with a forged sender address. The goal of spoofing is to make it appear as if the email came from a legitimate source, such as a bank or online retailer, in order to trick the recipient into divulging sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link.
To detect where a spoofed email has been sent from, you can look for several signs:
1. Check the sender's email address: A spoofed email will often use an email address that is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the actual sender's email address. For example, instead of [john.doe@bank.com](mailto:john.doe@bank.com), a spoofed email might use [johndoe1234567890@gmail.com](mailto:johndoe1234567890@gmail.com).
2. Look for spelling and grammatical errors: Spoofed emails often contain misspellings, typos, or awkward phrasing, which can be a red flag that the email is not legitimate.
3. Hover over links to see the URL: Before clicking on any links in an email, hover your mouse over the link to see the URL. If the URL looks suspicious or does not match the sender's domain, do not click on it.
4. Check for urgent or threatening language: Spoofed emails often try to create a sense of urgency or fear to get the recipient to take action. Be wary of emails that threaten to cancel your account or suspend your service if you don't respond immediately.
5. Use two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring you to enter a code sent to your phone or another device in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your accounts, even if they have your password.
6. Keep your email software and operating system up to date: Make sure your email client and operating system are updated with the latest security patches. Outdated software can leave you vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
7. Use a spam filter: Many email providers offer built-in spam filters that can help detect and block spoofed emails. Make sure yours is turned on and set up properly.
8. Be cautious of generic greetings: Legitimate companies usually address their emails to you by name, while spoofed emails often use generic greetings like "Dear customer" or "Hello there."
9. Check the sender's email domain: Spoofed emails often use a different email domain than the legitimate sender. For example, if your bank's website is [bank.com](http://bank.com), a spoofed email might use [bank-spoof.com](mailto:bank-spoof.com).
10. Report suspicious emails to the sender: If you believe an email is spoofed, do not respond to it or click on any links. Instead, forward it to the actual sender's abuse department or customer service email address.
In conclusion, there are several signs that can indicate an email is spoofed, including misspellings, generic greetings, and suspicious URLs. By being vigilant and taking these steps, you can help protect yourself from spoofing attacks and keep your personal information safe.
