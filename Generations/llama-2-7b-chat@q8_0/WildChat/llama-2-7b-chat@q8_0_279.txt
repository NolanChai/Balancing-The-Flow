INT. MEDICAL STORE - DAY
Heather Schmidt, a 49-year-old elegant and confident woman, walks into the medical store with a determined look on her face. She is dressed in a stylish black pantsuit and carries a large purse slung over her shoulder. As she approaches the counter, she exudes an air of authority and assertiveness that is hard to ignore.
HEATHER: (to the saleswoman) Good morning, dear. I'm here for my daughter's medical supplies. She was in an accident and needs some help with mobility and hygiene.
SALESWOMAN: (nervously) Of course, Mrs... uh... Schmidt. How can I assist you?
HEATHER: (leaning on the counter) I've come prepared. (pulls out a list from her purse) I need a special wheeled bed, a hoist, a highly adjustable orthopedic bed, reaching aids, adult diapers, and... (winks) something else.
SALESWOMAN: (blinking) Uh, let me see... (takes the list and begins to scan it) We have some great options for mobility aids, ma'am. And of course, we have our adult incontinence products as well.
HEATHER: (nodding) Excellent. I'm glad you understand. My daughter Susan is 24 years old and was in an accident that left her with bilateral hip spica casts. She needs all the help she can get right now.
SALESWOMAN: (empathetically) Oh no, poor thing! How is she doing?
HEATHER: (sighing) She's recovering, but it's been a tough road. The casts are huge and heavy, and she can barely move around on her own. We need to make sure she has everything she needs to feel comfortable and safe at home.
SALESWOMAN: (nodding sympathetically) Absolutely, ma'am. I think we have just what you're looking for. This wheeled bed will be perfect for her. It's sturdy, easy to maneuver, and has a comfortable mattress. And the hoist will help you transfer her from one place to another with ease.
HEATHER: (impressed) Hooray! I knew you had something like that. And how much is it?
SALESWOMAN: (smiling) It's actually on sale this week, ma'am. It'll cost you $300.
HEATHER: (smirking) Great! I'm glad I came in today. (reaches for her purse) And how much is the adult diapers?
SALESWOMAN: (hesitating slightly) Uh, they're... (glancing at the list) $20 a box.
HEATHER: (winking) Fabulous! I'll take 10 boxes. (pulls out her credit card) And can you throw in some extra supplies? Like those reaching aids and some gentle wipes for cleaning up?
SALESWOMAN: (smiling widely) Of course, ma'am! Anything else?
HEATHER: (grinning mischievously) Oh, I almost forgot. (reaches into her purse and pulls out a small box) My goodness, Susan has been feeling particularly... um... messy lately. (winks) You see, she's not able to use the bathroom on her own yet. So this little something might come in handy. (holds up a small vibrator)
SALESWOMAN: (blushing) I-I see! (nervously laughs) Uh, well... we do have some products that can help with that issue... (coughs)
HEATHER: (grinning) Excellent! I knew you'd understand. (winks) This should help her get through the tough times.
SALESWOMAN: (smiling awkwardly) Uh, yes... of course. (pauses) Is that everything?
HEATHER: (nodding) For now, dear. (smirks) But you never know when we might need more supplies. (winks) My daughter has a bit of an... um... messy streak. (chuckles)
SALESWOMAN: (laughs nervously) Uh, yes... well... I'll make sure to keep that in mind! (hands over the items and Heather pays with a smile)
HEATHER: (smiling as she leaves the store) Ah, nothing like a good medical supply shopping spree to brighten one's day. (chuckles to herself) Susan is going to be so... (winks) pleased with all these goodies. (exits the store)
