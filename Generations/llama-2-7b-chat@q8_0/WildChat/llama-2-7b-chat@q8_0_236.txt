The Charter of Commission for Studying Constitutional Government, as outlined in Articles 2 and 11, grants the commission the power to review and approve documents submitted by the Grand Council for implementation, with the exception of legal codes (Grand Secretariat, 1979). However, the term "important matters" used in Article 11 is vague, allowing the Commission and Grand Councilors to assume power that should rightfully belong to the Political Advisory Council. This ambiguity could lead to a biased interpretation of regulatory documents in favor of the government, as the Commission would be responsible for both legislation and execution.
The establishment of the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government in the 33rd year of Guangxu's reign (AD 1907) led to conflicts with the Political Advisory Council, as the Commission continued to encroach on the latter's authority after its establishment (Li, 2011). To address this issue, it is necessary to clearly delineate the legislative scope of the Political Advisory Council and establish a clear line of authority with the Commission. Prior to the establishment of the Political Advisory Council, the Commission held supreme executive power, responsible for compiling legal codes and issuing executive sanctions (Li, 2011).
In conclusion, the vagueness in Article 11 of the Charter of Commission for Studying Constitutional Government allows for the potential usurpation of power by the Commission and Grand Councilors, leading to a biased interpretation of regulatory documents. It is essential to clearly define the legislative scope of the Political Advisory Council to prevent such conflicts in the future.
