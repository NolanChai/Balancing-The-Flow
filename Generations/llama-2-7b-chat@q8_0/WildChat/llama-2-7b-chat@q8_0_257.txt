Seismology, the study of earthquakes and seismic waves, uses both objective and subjective measures to quantify the size and intensity of earthquakes. Here's a brief explanation of each:
Objective Measures:
1. Seismic magnitude: This is a measure of the size of an earthquake based on the amount of energy released during the event. The most commonly used magnitude scale is the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the size of the rupture area, the average amount of slip on the fault, and the amount of energy released. This scale is considered objective because it is based on physical measurements of the earthquake, such as the amplitude of seismic waves recorded at different distances from the epicenter.
2. Seismic magnitude frequency content: This is a measure of the distribution of energy in an earthquake's seismic waveform. It is calculated by examining the amount of energy present at different frequencies, typically between 0.01 and 10 Hz. The seismic magnitude frequency content is considered objective because it is based on the physical properties of the earthquake, such as the speed and density of the Earth's interior.
Subjective Measures:
1. Intensity scale: This is a measure of the perceived severity of an earthquake at a given location. The intensity of an earthquake is determined by observing the effects it has on the environment, such as the amount of structural damage to buildings and other structures, and the amount of ground shaking felt by people in the area. The intensity scale is subjective because it relies on observations made by people in the affected area, which can vary depending on their location and experience.
2. Shakemap: A shakemap is a subjective measure of the distribution of seismic intensity in an area affected by an earthquake. It is created by overlaying a map of the area with colored symbols that represent the perceived severity of the earthquake at different locations. The colors are based on the observations made by people in the affected area, and can vary depending on factors such as the distance from the epicenter and the local geology.
In summary, while both seismic magnitude and intensity scale are used to quantify the size and severity of earthquakes, they are considered objective (magnitude) and subjective (intensity) measures, respectively.

There are several seismic scales used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes, which can be divided into two categories: objective and subjective scales. Here is a list of some common seismic scales, along with their formulas and classifications:
Objective Scales:
1. Richter Scale: Developed by Charles Richter in 1935, this scale measures the magnitude of earthquakes based on the amplitude of the seismic waves recorded on a seismograph. The formula is: M = log10(A/B), where A is the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave and B is a reference amplitude. This scale is objective because it is based solely on the physical properties of the seismic waves, rather than subjective interpretations by humans.
2. moment magnitude scale: Developed in 1979 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), this scale measures the size of an earthquake based on the amount of energy released during the event. The formula is: M = log10(M0) + b \* log10(Rm/Rp), where M0 is the maximum magnitude, Rm is the moment magnitude, and Rp is a reference magnitude. This scale is also objective because it is based on measurable physical properties of the earthquake.
3. Surface wave magnitude (Mw): Developed in 1968 by the International Commission for Quantitative Earthquake Prediction, this scale measures the size of an earthquake based on the amplitude of surface waves recorded on a seismograph. The formula is: Mw = log10(A/B), where A is the maximum amplitude of the surface wave and B is a reference amplitude. This scale is also objective because it is based solely on the physical properties of the seismic waves.
Subjective Scales:
1. Mercalli intensity scale: Developed in 1902 by Italian seismologist Giuseppe Mercalli, this scale measures the perceived effects of an earthquake at different locations based on the amount of damage caused to buildings and other structures. The scale is subjective because it requires human interpretation to determine the intensity of the earthquake at a particular location.
2. Modified Mercalli intensity scale: This scale is a modification of the original Mercalli scale, developed in 1930 by Harry Fielding Osborn. It takes into account the distance from the epicenter of the earthquake and the type of buildings in a given area to more accurately assess the intensity of the earthquake.
3. Shakemap: Developed in the 1980s, this scale is used to create maps of the perceived effects of an earthquake at different locations based on data from a network of seismic stations and satellite imagery. It is subjective because it requires human interpretation to determine the intensity of the earthquake at a particular location.
In conclusion, there are several objective scales used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes, including the Richter scale, moment magnitude scale, and surface wave magnitude (Mw). These scales are based solely on measurable physical properties of the seismic waves and are considered objective because they do not require human interpretation. On the other hand, subjective scales such as the Mercalli intensity scale and modified Mercalli intensity scale require human interpretation to determine the perceived effects of an earthquake at different locations.
