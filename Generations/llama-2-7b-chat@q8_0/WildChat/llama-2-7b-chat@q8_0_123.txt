It looks like you are setting up a REST API using Node.js and the `express` framework. Here's a breakdown of the commands you provided:
1. `npm install express --save`: This command installs the `express` package and saves it to your project's dependencies so that you can use it in your project. The `--save` flag tells `npm` to save the package to your project's dependencies instead of just installing it.
2. `node server.js`: This command starts the REST API server using the `server.js` file as the entry point.
The output you provided suggests that the installation and start-up of the server went successfully, and no vulnerabilities were found in your project.

It looks like you have successfully installed Express and saved it as a dependency in your project using `npm install`. The output suggests that there are no vulnerabilities found in the dependencies you have installed.
To start the server, you can simply run the `server.js` file in your project directory:
```
$ node server.js
Start server at port 3000.
```
This will start the Express server on port 3000, and you should see the message "Server started" in your console.
If you want to run additional tests or audits on your dependencies, you can use the `npm fund` command:
```
$ npm fund
```
This command will display information about any dependencies that are currently seeking funding, as well as provide options for contributing to their development and maintenance.
It's worth noting that the `npm fund` command is only available in newer versions of npm (version 7 and later). If you're using an older version of npm, you may not have access to this feature.
