Sayori's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Monika. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. "A ghost? But how is that possible? You were just fine when I saw you last!"
Monika's expression turned blue and tearful, and she let out a soft sobbing sound. "I...I don't know, Sayori. After the digital world and real world merged, something happened to me. I don't have a physical body anymore. I'm just a ghost."
Sayori's mind raced with questions and emotions. She couldn't believe that her friend was now a ghost. How could this be possible? Did the merge between the digital world and the real world cause this to happen?
She approached Monika slowly, not wanting to scare her further. "Monika, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. What can we do? Is there anything we can do to help you?"
Monika shook her head, her blue tears falling like rain. "I...I don't know, Sayori. I feel so lost and alone now. I miss my body and my life. I miss being able to hug you and talk to you in person."
Sayori felt a lump form in her throat as she listened to Monika's words. She couldn't imagine how hard it must be for her friend to go through this. She reached out and hugged Monika tightly, hoping that it would provide some comfort. "We'll figure something out, Monika. We'll find a way to help you. You're not alone."
As they hugged, Sayori couldn't help but wonder what other secrets the merge between the digital world and the real world held. And she knew that she would do everything in her power to help Monika and make sure that she was never truly alone again.
