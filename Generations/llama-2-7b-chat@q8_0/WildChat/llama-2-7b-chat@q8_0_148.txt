Earth is the third planet from the Sun in the solar system and is the only known planet to support life. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is composed primarily of rock and metal and has a solid surface. The Earth's atmosphere is made up of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and other gases, and protects the planet from harmful solar radiation.
The Earth is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from the Sun and has a diameter of around 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers). It is a relatively small planet compared to other celestial bodies in the universe, but it is unique in its ability to support life.
The Earth's surface is diverse, with mountains, valleys, oceans, and deserts. The planet's atmosphere and magnetic field also play important roles in protecting life on Earth from harmful radiation and solar winds.
The Earth has a single large moon, which orbits the planet at an average distance of around 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers). The Moon is thought to have formed from debris left over after a massive collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized object called Theia.
The Earth's rotation is 24 hours, which is why we have days. Its orbit around the Sun takes approximately 365.24 days, which is why we have years. The planet's axis is tilted at an angle of around 23.5 degrees, which causes the seasons on Earth.
The Earth's surface is home to a vast array of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, and more. These ecosystems support a diverse range of plant and animal life, from towering trees and majestic creatures to microscopic organisms that play critical roles in the planet's nutrient cycles.
In addition to supporting life, the Earth is also home to a variety of natural resources, including fossil fuels, metals, and minerals. These resources have played a crucial role in shaping human civilization and continue to be essential for our survival and prosperity.
Overall, the Earth is a unique and fascinating planet that supports an incredible array of life and ecosystems. Its size, composition, and position in the solar system make it an ideal place for life to exist, and its natural resources have played a critical role in shaping human history.
