The scene opens with Goku, now in his Super Saiyan form, walking along the beach, enjoying a nice day and looking for something to eat. Suddenly, he spots a large school of fish swimming nearby and decides to grab one for lunch. However, as soon as he reaches out to grab the fish, he is surrounded by a group of tiny Freedom Planet characters, who are shocked and terrified at the sight of him.
Lilac: *shudder* Oh my goodness, did you see that?! That giant monster just ate a poor defenseless fish! How could he be so heartless?!
Ants: *nods* I know, right? It's like he has no regard for life at all. *shivers*
Goku: *confused* Wait, what's wrong? Why are you guys freaking out? This was just a little fish.
Lilac: *sternly* Little?! That fish was probably a living being with a family and friends, just like us! How could you just eat it without even thinking about it?!
Goku: *chuckles* Eat it? No, I just caught it for lunch. It's not like I killed it or anything.
Ants: *exasperated* That's the problem, Goku! You see us as food, but we see ourselves as living beings with feelings and emotions! We don't want to be your next meal!
Lilac: *flails arms* And besides, you're so much bigger than us! How could we possibly defend ourselves against someone like you?!
Goku: *smirks* Well, I guess I underestimated how big you guys were. But come on, don't be afraid of me. I'm not going to hurt you. *offers fish* Here, have some of my lunch.
Ants: *horrified* You want us to eat with you?! After what you just did?!
Lilac: *shakes head* No way, Goku. We don't want anything to do with you or your monster food. Stay away from us! *runs off with Ants*
Goku: *chuckles* Well, I guess they just don't understand the joy of a good meal. *pockets fish and continues walking* Maybe next time I'll catch something bigger... like a planet. *laughs maniacally*
As Goku walks away, the Freedom Planet characters can be seen in the distance, still shaking with fear and confusion at their encounter with the giant monster.

Lilac, the smallest and most timid member of the Freedom Planet girls, watched in awe as Goku, the powerful warrior from the Dragon Ball universe, stood before her. She couldn't believe how huge he was compared to them – he must have been at least ten times their size!
"W-wow," Lilac stammered, trying to hide behind her friends. "I-is that... Goku?"
Milla, the tough and confident leader of the group, stepped forward, eyeing Goku warily. "Yeah, it's him. And he's way bigger than any of us."
Goku grinned at them, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "Hey there, little guys! *chuckles* I've never seen anything like you before!"
Lilac giggled nervously, her antennae twitching as she tried to process this bizarre encounter. "U-um, hi... Goku... sir?"
Aisha, the adventurous and flirtatious member of their group, couldn't help but be drawn to Goku's charisma. "Wow, you're, like, a giant! *giggles* Can you teach us how to do your special beam move or something?"
Goku chuckled, his massive arms flexing as he showed off his impressive strength. " *chuckles* Well, I guess I could give it a try! *pose* Watch this!"
As Goku demonstrated his iconic Kamehameha wave, the Freedom Planet girls watched in amazement – even Lilac found herself getting caught up in the excitement. But as they marveled at Goku's power, they couldn't help but feel a twinge of fear. They were tiny creatures compared to this giant warrior, and they couldn't shake off the feeling that he could crush them with just one hand.
"W-wait, are you sure you won't hurt us?" Lilac asked timidly, her antennae trembling. "We don't want to get hurt..."
Goku's face softened into a warm smile, his eyes sparkling with kindness. "Hey, little guys! Don't worry about that – I'm here to help you, not hurt you! *smiles* We're friends now, right?"
Milla nodded gruffly, her confidence returning as she faced off against Goku. "Yeah, we're with him. And don't think you can take advantage of us just 'cause you're bigger than us!"
Goku chuckled, his deep voice rumbling. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of it! *laughs* I promise, I won't hurt any of you little guys. *nods* Let's be friends instead!"
As the two groups continued to chat and get to know each other, the Freedom Planet girls couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at this strange new world they had stumbled into. They were tiny creatures in a vast universe, but with Goku by their side, they felt braver than ever before – ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
