Alatreon's eyes widened as he took in the sight of the mural depicting Miss Luna. He couldn't believe what he was seeing - a lavender Praying Mantis with a crown on her head, unlike any other mascot he had seen before. And yet, there were two more murals to the left and right of Miss Luna, each one showcasing a different mascot.
Silent Steve, a cobra mascot with a slightly lighter shade of purple than Queen Bouncelia, was depicted in the mural to the left of Miss Luna. The quote next to his image read, "Shhhh... Let's keep it down in here." Alatreon couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of Silent Steve trying to keep things quiet in a bustling corridor like this one.
On the right side of Miss Luna was Coach Pickles, a bipedal cyan elephant mascot with short arms. His quote read, "Come on, let's get fit and pick up the pace!" Alatreon couldn't help but admire Coach Pickles' enthusiasm - it seemed like he was always eager to motivate and encourage his students.
As he continued to examine the murals, Alatreon noticed that each one had a unique gemstone adorning the crown of its respective mascot. Miss Luna's crown had a dark purple gem, while Queen Bouncelia's crown featured three pink gems. It was clear that each mascot had its own distinct identity and personality.
Alatreon's mind raced with questions - who were these mascots? Why did they have their own unique crowns? And what other secrets could he uncover in this mysterious corridor? He knew he had to keep exploring, determined to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic murals.
