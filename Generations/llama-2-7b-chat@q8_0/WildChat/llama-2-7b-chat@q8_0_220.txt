As the player helps the Female Snow Golem towards the village, they notice that the villagers are all huddled together, whispering among themselves. The player can hear them muttering things like "Twilight Forest dimension", "demonspawn", and "evil creatures".
As they approach the healer's hut, the player can see that it is surrounded by a small group of guards, who are eyeing them warily. One of them steps forward as the player and Female Snow Golem approach.
"Who are you and what do you want?" he asks gruffly.
The player can choose to:
1. Introduce themselves and explain their situation.
2. Try to sneak past the guards without drawing attention.
3. Use magic or a weapon to defeat the guards.
4. Use persuasion to convince the guards that they are not a threat.
