Not necessarily. The number of upvotes and downvotes on Reddit is just one factor that can influence how well a post performs. Here are some other factors to consider:
1. Subreddit popularity: If the post was submitted to a niche subreddit with limited traffic, it may not get as many views or upvotes as a post in a more popular subreddit.
2. Post quality: The content of the post can also impact its performance. A well-written and informative post is more likely to be upvoted than one that is poorly written or lacks value.
3. Timing: The time of day or week when the post was made can also affect its visibility. Posts submitted during off-peak hours may not get as many views or upvotes.
4. Community engagement: The level of engagement from the subreddit's community can also impact how well a post performs. A post that generates a lot of comments and discussion is more likely to be successful than one that receives little engagement.
5. Post type: Different types of posts (e.g., images, videos, text-only posts) can perform differently on Reddit. For example, image-heavy posts may be more popular than text-only posts in some subreddits.
In summary, a post with 0 upvotes and a 35% upvote rate could still be well-received by the subreddit's community, but it may not have resonated as well with all users. It's important to look at other factors beyond just the number of upvotes when evaluating a post's performance on Reddit.
