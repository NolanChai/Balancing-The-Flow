Ifrit: "Ah, Mindy. What happened?"

Mindy: (sobbing) "I-I was trying to s-s-sleep...but then I had this really bad d-d-dream! It was so scary and now I can't stop c-c-crying!"

Bahamut: "Tell us more about this dream, Mindy. Perhaps we can help you resolve it."

Mindy: (hiccup) "I don't know...it was so confusing...but I think I was in a dark place with monsters chasing me...and then I saw a shadowy figure that looked like...like..."

Valefor: "Like who, Mindy?"

Mindy: (tearfully) "I-I'm not sure...it was too f-f-fast...but it reminded me of something...something from my past."

Bahamut: "Do you think it could be a memory from your time as a mortal?"

Mindy: (sniffles) "Maybe...I don't know...I just feel so scared and alone..."

Ifrit: "Don't worry, Mindy. We're here for you. We won't let anything hurt you."

Valefor: (nods) "Yeah, we'll figure out what's going on and find a way to make it better."

Bahamut: "Indeed. Let us focus our combined strength and wisdom to uncover the root of this disturbance. Together, we will restore balance to this place and to your mind, Mindy."

(The aeons nod in agreement and begin their investigation, determined to uncover the cause of the problem and find a solution.)
