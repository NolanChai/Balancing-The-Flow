/imagine prompt: a charming European village girl lazily lay on the seat of her bicycle, dressed in a flowing white dress with pale pink blooms, golden hair, and sparkling blue eyes, surrounded by lush green trees and winding roads, warm sunlight casting a gentle glow, captured in a dreamy and ethereal style, with an emphasis on the girl's innocence and carefree spirit, using a Nikon D850 camera, 50mm lens, with a shallow depth of field to blur the background and focus on the subject, composition focused on the girl's face and body language, conveying a sense of serenity and joy, in a style reminiscent of the Pre-Raphaelite art movement. --ar 16:9 --v 5
