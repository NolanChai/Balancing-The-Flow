The formula you provided uses the `FIND` function three times to locate the position of the first space in the sentence, and then uses the `LEFT` function to extract the text up to that position. To modify the formula to find the first two words instead of the first three words, you can simply reduce the number of iterations of the `FIND` function.
Here's how you can change the formula:
=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, FIND(" ",C2, 2)+1)-1,"")
In this modified formula, we use the `FIND` function with the value `2` to find the position of the first space in the sentence. This will give us the position of the first two words in the sentence.
Here's how the formula works:
* `C2` is the cell containing the sentence you want to analyze.
* `FIND(" ",C2, 2)` returns the position of the first space in the sentence, starting from the second character.
* `LEFT(C2, FIND(" ",C2, 2)+1)` extracts the text up to the position of the first space, including the space itself.
* `-1` subtracts 1 from the result of `FIND(" ")` to exclude the space.
* `IFERROR(..,"")` checks if there is a error in the formula (i.e., the sentence does not contain any spaces), and returns an empty string if there is an error, or the extracted text if there is no error.
So, the modified formula will return the first two words in the sentence, excluding any additional spaces.

There are several ways to ensure that text entered into a cell in a column is more than 6 words:

1. Use a validation rule in Google Sheets: You can use the " validate" function in Google Sheets to check if the length of the text in a cell is greater than 6 words. For example, =IF(LEN(A1)>6,"Text is valid","Text is invalid").
2. Format cells with a custom validation rule: You can also use a custom validation rule to format cells that contain less than 6 words. To do this, go to the "Format" menu, and then select "Format cells if". In the "Format cells if" dialog box, enter the formula `LEN(A1)>6` and select the format you want to apply.
3. Use a script: You can also use a script in Google Sheets to check if the length of the text in a cell is greater than 6 words. For example, you can use the following script: `function validateTextLength() { var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); var range = sheet.getDataRange(); for (var i = 1; i < range.getNumRows(); i++) { var cell = range.getCell(i, 1); if (cell.getValue().length < 6) { sheet.getRange(i, 1).setValue("Text is invalid"); } } }`. This script will check all cells in the active sheet and if the length of the text in a cell is less than 6 words, it will display "Text is invalid" in that cell.
4. Use conditional formatting: You can also use conditional formatting to format cells that contain less than 6 words. To do this, go to the "Format" menu, and then select "Conditional formatting". In the "Format cells if" dialog box, enter the formula `LEN(A1)>6` and select the format you want to apply.
5. Use a formula: You can also use a formula in Google Sheets to check if the length of the text in a cell is greater than 6 words. For example, =IF(LEN(A1)>6,"Text is valid","Text is invalid").
6. Use an add-on: There are several third-party add-ons available that can help you enforce a minimum character limit in Google Sheets. Some popular options include "Character Limit" and "Text Validation".
7. Use Google Apps Script: You can also use Google Apps Script to enforce a minimum character limit on text entered into cells. For example, you can use the following script: `function validateTextLength() { var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet(); var range = sheet.getDataRange(); for (var i = 1; i < range.getNumRows(); i++) { var cell = range.getCell(i, 1); if (cell.getValue().length < 6) { sheet.getRange(i, 1).setValue("Text is invalid"); } } }`. This script will check all cells in the active sheet and if the length of the text in a cell is less than 6 words, it will display "Text is invalid" in that cell.

All of these methods can help you ensure that when text is entered into a cell in a column, it is more than 6 words long.

Yes, you can use data validation in Google Sheets to limit the input value to a specific range. Here are the steps:
1. Select the cell or cells where you want to apply data validation.
2. Go to the "Data" menu and click on "Data Validation".
3. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Custom" from the drop-down menu.
4. In the "Formula" field, enter the formula `=MIN(MAX(A1:A10), 10)` (assuming you want to validate the range A1:A10).
5. Click on "Done" to apply the data validation.
Now, when you input a value into the cell, it will be checked against the range of values you specified in the formula. If the input value is outside of that range, an error message will appear indicating that the value is invalid.
Note: You can also use `=MIN(MAX(A1:A10), 20)` to allow input values up to 20 instead of 10.
