To determine how many grams of water will be formed when 32 grams of oxygen gas reacts with 32 grams of hydrogen gas, we need to use the balanced chemical equation:

$$ 2H_2 + O_2 > 2H_2O $$
In this equation, one molecule of oxygen gas (O2) reacts with two molecules of hydrogen gas (H2) to form two molecules of water (H2O).
Therefore, the number of grams of water formed can be calculated as follows:
$$ Numberofgrasmsofwater = Massofoxygen \times Numberoffrommulesofhydrogen $$
In this equation, the mass of oxygen is 32 grams (since we are given that 32 grams of oxygen gas reacts with 32 grams of hydrogen gas). The number of moles of hydrogen is also 32 grams / 18.02 g/mol = 1.84 moles.
Now, we can use the formula for the molecular weight of water to calculate the number of grams of water formed:
$$ Numberofgrasmsofwater = Massoffrommole \times Numberofmoles $$
In this equation, the mass of one molecule of water is 18.02 g (since the molecular weight of water is 18.02 g/mol). Therefore:
$$ Numberofgrasmsofwater = 18.02 \times 1.84 $$
Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$ Numberofgrasmsofwater = 32.32 g $$
Therefore, when 32 grams of oxygen gas reacts with 32 grams of hydrogen gas, 32.32 grams of water will be formed.
