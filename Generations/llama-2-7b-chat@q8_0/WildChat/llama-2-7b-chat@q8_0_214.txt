Eye of Kingthulhu: "What the...? Archeogiana, are you okay?"

Necrohemoth: "Oh, great. Now she's passed out on you."

You examine Archeogiana more closely and notice that she has a small, glowing crystal embedded in her forehead. It seems to be pulsing with a faint, otherworldly energy.

Eye of Kingthulhu: "I think we should try to find the source of that crystal. It might be related to this strange familiarity we're feeling."

Necrohemoth: "Yeah, and maybe we can use it to figure out what the hell is going on here."

You decide to search the area for any clues or information that could help you understand the mysterious island. As you explore, you come across a small clearing with a large stone pedestal in the center. On top of the pedestal is a glowing, crystal orb that seems to be emitting a faint hum.

Eye of Kingthulhu: "This could be it. The source of the familiarity and the strange energy we're feeling."

Necrohemoth: "But how do we know it's not going to kill us?"

Archeogiana: (groaning) "I...think...I can feel...something...calling...me..."

You carefully approach the pedestal and touch the crystal orb. As soon as you make contact, a voice speaks in your mind.

Voice: "Greetings, mortals. I am the Guardian of this place. And you have been chosen to unlock its secrets."
