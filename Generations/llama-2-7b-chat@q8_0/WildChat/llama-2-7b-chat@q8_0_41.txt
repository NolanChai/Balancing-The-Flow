As you approach the girl, she looks up at you with tears in her eyes and a mixture of fear and desperation on her face. "Please, can you help me? My son is stuck inside me and I can't push him out. I've been trying for so long, but nothing is working. I don't know what to do!" she cries out in a panicked voice.
You can see that the girl is in a lot of pain and discomfort, and you can tell that she's doing her best to stay strong for her unborn child. You can also see that there are four small, red eye-like spheres embedded in her hair, glowing softly with an otherworldly light.
What do you do?
A) Try to calm the girl down and see if you can help her give birth to her son naturally.
B) Use your abilities to scan her body and try to locate the cause of the problem.
C) Offer to take her to a nearby hospital or medical facility for help.
D) Use your knowledge of the supernatural to try and find a way to remove the eye-like spheres from her body, which may be causing the problem.
