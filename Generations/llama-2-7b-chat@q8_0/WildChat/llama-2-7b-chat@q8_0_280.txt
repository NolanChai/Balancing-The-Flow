FADE IN:
INT. EMPTY HOSPITAL - DAY
Reza Fazekas, an eccentric and sarcastic young independent political journalist in his early 20s, sits in a wheelchair, sporting a back brace, casted legs, and an external catheter. His face lights up with a mischievous grin as he spots Anneliese Ehn, a charming and cute young singer and dancer, rolling towards him in a nearby corridor.
REZA: (excitedly) Ah, the belle of the ball! *winks*
ANNELIESE: (distracted, lost in thought) *glares* Ugh, what is with all these narrow passages? *rolls her wheelchair towards him*
Reza's grin falters momentarily before he decides to go for it. He leans forward and dangles his own catheter, attempting a cheeky smile.
REZA: (jokingly) Oh, you think you have issues? *dangles catheter* My external catheter here could give yours a run for its money!
Anneliese's scowl deepens as she almost collides with Reza. She rolls to a stop next to him and glowers down at him through her scarred face, struggling to speak due to her tracheostomy.
ANNELIESE: (gritting teeth) *glares* You're not funny, Fazekas. *stammering voice* My...my catheter...*clears throat* is a medical issue, not something to be joked about.
Reza's grin widens mischievously, his eyes sparkling with amusement as he realizes the discomfort he's causing.
REZA: (playfully) Oh, come on! *chuckles* You're not mad at me, are you? *winks* It's just a little catheter banter, my dear. *dangles catheter again* Don't be so prudish!
Anneliese's anger boils over, and she lets out a barrage of expletives, struggling to enunciate due to her tracheostomy.
ANNELIESE: (angrily) *stammering voice* Uh...Uh...G-g-get your own f-f-f-f-uckin' catheter! *storms off in her wheelchair*
Reza watches Anneliese roll away, chuckling to himself.
REZA: (to himself) Ah, the charms of a fiery redhead... *smirks* Maybe I should start carrying my own tracheostomy kit... *winks*
FADE OUT.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Reza and Anneliese are sitting on the bed, looking a bit bored. The room is otherwise empty, with only a few chairs and a coffee table in sight. Nurse Luciana Vipari enters, smiling mischievously.
LULIANA: (to Reza) Well well, look who's decided to wake up today. (to Anneliese) And here we have our favorite feisty patient. (winks at both of them)
REZA: (grinning) Hey Nurse Vipari, how are you today?
ANNELIESE: (rolls her eyes) Oh boy, do we really have to go through this again? (sighs)
LULIANA: (laughing) Oh come on, Anneliese. I'm just trying to be friendly. (winks at Reza) So, how are you two enjoying your time in here together?
REZA: (smirks) It's been...eventful. We've had our fair share of disagreements and arguments, but we're working through them. (glances at Anneliese) Sort of.
ANNELIESE: (smirks back) Yeah, it's like a never-ending circus in here. But hey, at least we have each other to keep things interesting. (giggles)
LULIANA: (amused) Oh dear, I think you two are getting along too well already. (chuckles) But seriously, how would you like to be roomies? It could be fun! (winks at Reza)
REZA: (raises an eyebrow) Roomies? With Anneliese? (grins mischievously) Oh boy, that could be entertaining.
ANNELIESE: (excitedly) Ooh, I'm down! Let's do it! (bounces up and down on the bed)
LULIANA: (laughs) Well, I'll see what I can do. (smirks) But no promises, okay? (winks at both of them) Now, how about we get you two settled in and comfortable? (starts to walk away)
REZA: (calling after her) Wait! Can we at least ask the doctor if it's possible?
LULIANA: (over her shoulder) Of course, dear. I'll see what I can do. (smirks and exits the room)
ANNELIESE: (giggles) Well, that was fun! Now let's make the most of this strange situation and turn it into a wild party! (bounces up and down on the bed again)
REZA: (chuckles) Sounds like a plan to me. (grins mischievously) Let's make this hospital stay one for the books!
The scene ends with Reza and Anneliese high-fiving each other, excited for their impromptu roommate adventure, while Nurse Luciana Vipari smiles knowingly in the background, amused by their antics.
