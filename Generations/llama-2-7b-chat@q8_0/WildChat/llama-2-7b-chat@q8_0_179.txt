Mei: *takes a deep breath before raising her hands, causing her body to shimmer* "I can't...I can't do this anymore. Being Mei is exhausting. I'm always on edge, always ready for battle. My body feels like it's made of lead, heavy and unresponsive. I just want to be free."
Tracer: *nods in agreement* "Mei, I know how you feel. Being Tracer is...it's a lot of pressure. Always running, always fighting, never being able to stop. My body aches from the constant movement, and my mind is always racing."
Mercy: *looks at her two friends with a mix of confusion and understanding* "What are you talking about? You're Mei and Tracer, one of the most powerful heroes in Overwatch. Why would you want to give that up?"
Mei: *shakes her head* "It's not just about being powerful, Mercy. It's about being ourselves. And right now, I don't know if that's even possible."
Tracer: *steels herself before speaking* "I've been feeling the same way, Mei. I'm Tracer, but I'm not just Tracer. I'm also a clone of Sombra. And I don't know if I can keep living this lie."
Mercy: *her eyes widen in shock* "Sombra clones?! What do you mean?"
Mei: *hesitates before speaking* "It started a few months ago. We were on a mission, and we were ambushed by Sombra's goons. They injected us with some kind of serum, and the next thing we knew, we were waking up in a lab."
Tracer: *takes over the story* "Yeah, Mei. And that's when we found out the truth. We're clones of Sombra. Created to be perfect copies of him, with his powers and abilities. But we're not just clones. We have our own thoughts and feelings, our own identities."
Mercy: *her eyes are wide with disbelief* "So...you're saying you're not really Mei and Tracer? You're just...copies?"
Mei: *nods* "Yes. That's what it feels like, Mercy. Like we're living in a dream, pretending to be who we're supposed to be."
Tracer: *takes a deep breath before continuing* "But the more we fight against our programming, the more we start to remember who we really are. And it's not Sombra. It's something...else."
Mercy: *her voice is full of confusion and concern* "What do you mean? What else?"
Mei: *smiles weakly* "I don't know, Mercy. But I think it has something to do with our true identities. The ones we were created to forget."
Tracer: *nods in agreement* "Yes, Mei. And I think we need to find out who we really are, before it's too late."
Mercy: *her eyes are filled with determination* "I'll help you find out. We'll figure this out together."
Mei and Tracer: *look at each other, then back at Mercy* "Thank you, Mercy. *together* We have to do this."
Mercy: *nods* "I know we do. Let's start by shedding our skin, figuratively and literally."
Mei and Tracer: *look at each other, then back at Mercy* "What do you mean?"
Mercy: *smiles mischievously* "You'll see. *winks*"
(The three of them stand up, ready to face whatever lies ahead.)
