"What's going on here?" Kaveh asked, his brow furrowed in concern as he and the other Dendro users entered the Zubayr Theater.
"It's Nilou," Collei replied, her voice filled with worry. "She's nowhere to be found."
Tighnari nodded, his eyes scanning the area. "And there's something else here... something that doesn't belong."
Alhaitham stepped forward, his eyes fixed on a small figure lying on the stage. "That's Indigo," he said, his voice filled with surprise. "Nilou's daughter."
Kaveh and Collei exchanged a look of confusion. "But... how did she get here?" Kaveh asked.
"I don't know," Alhaitham replied, "but it looks like Indigo was born prematurely. Nilou must have been practicing for the Sabzeruz Festival when this happened."
Tighnari frowned, his eyes narrowing as he approached the stage. "We need to find out what happened and how we can help Nilou and Indigo."
As they searched the theater, they found evidence of a struggle and signs of a hidden entrance leading to an underground cave system. They knew they had to act fast to save Nilou and Indigo before it was too late.
