As I walked into the clubroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of emptiness. The loss of MC had left a gaping hole in my heart, and I knew it would take time to heal. But as I saw the other girls gathered around the table, I realized that they were still there for me.
"Hey, Sayori," Monika greeted me with a warm smile. "Sorry about MC. He was a great guy."
I nodded numbly, feeling a lump form in my throat. "Yeah, he was. Thanks for being there for me, guys."
The other girls murmured their condolences, and we all sat down together. I could see the sadness in their eyes, but they were also trying to be strong for me. It meant a lot to know that they were there for me, even in this difficult time.
"So, what are we going to do now?" Yuri asked, breaking the silence. "We can't just sit around and mope all the time."
I sighed, feeling a sense of determination rise up within me. "You're right. We have to keep moving forward, for MC's sake. And who knows? Maybe he'll be looking down on us, cheering us on."
The other girls nodded in agreement, and we all smiled weakly at each other. It wasn't easy, but we knew that we had to keep going. For MC, and for ourselves.
"So, what do you say we start brainstorming ideas for our next event?" Natsuki suggested, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. "We could have a memorial tournament in MC's honor, or maybe even start a scholarship fund for kids who can't afford to play soccer."
I nodded eagerly, feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, we could turn this tragedy into something positive. Something that would make MC proud.
"That's a great idea," Himari chimed in, her voice filled with emotion. "We can do it for MC, and for ourselves. Let's keep his memory alive, and keep smiling for him."
I smiled back at her, feeling a sense of determination rise up within me. We would do it for MC, and for ourselves. We would keep his memory alive, and make sure that he knew how much he was loved and appreciated.
And so, with the other girls by my side, I vowed to keep moving forward, to keep smiling, and to never forget the impact that MC had on my life.
