The upcoming Blue Beetle movie is set to include the concept of superhero legacies, which could help it be included in the new DC Universe. The film will feature Jaime Reyes as the third Blue Beetle, who inherits the mantle from his predecessors Dan Garrett and Ted Kord. The director has confirmed that the Blue Beetle legacy exists in the movie, with some people in the city knowing about and being fans of the character. This adds pressure on Jaime to live up to the expectations of the legacy and protect his family. The movie is also set to introduce elements missing from superhero movies, such as a sense of legacy and passing the torch.
