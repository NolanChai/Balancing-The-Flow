I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the exact number of tokens used in a specific response. However, I can tell you that the number of tokens used in a response depends on several factors, including the length of the response, the complexity of the language used, and the context in which the response was given.
In general, the more complex or longer the response, the more tokens are likely to be used up. For example, a response that includes multiple sentences or phrases may use up more tokens than a short answer that only includes a few words. Additionally, if the response is given in a context where there are specific keywords or phrases that require additional tokens, such as in a conversation with a chatbot, then more tokens may be used up.
That being said, I don't have access to the exact number of tokens used in any given response, as this information is not typically available or publicly disclosed. However, I hope this helps give you an idea of how the number of tokens used in a response can vary depending on the context and complexity of the language used.
