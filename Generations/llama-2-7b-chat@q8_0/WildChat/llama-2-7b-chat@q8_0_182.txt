As James, you find yourself standing outside a bustling nightclub, the neon lights of the sign above the entrance flashing brightly in your face. You can hear the thumping music and cheers of patrons inside, and you know that this is going to be a tough mission. But you're ready for it.
You take a deep breath, grip your weapon tightly, and step through the entrance. The door slams shut behind you with a loud boom, and you find yourself surrounded by a sea of enemies.
To your left, a group of bouncers led by the menacing Tommy are blocking your path. Vincent and Doug are on your right, their meaty fists cocked back ready to strike. You know that these guys aren't going down without a fight.
You start by taking out the bouncers with quick jabs and hooks, dodging their haymakers and shoulder tackles with ease. As they fall, you notice a group of pole dancers in the corner of your eye, their spiked heels clicking against the floor as they twirl around.
Scarlet, Jessica, and Nicole are their names, and they're not happy to see you. They charge towards you, spinning their poles in deadly arcs. You parry their attacks with your weapon, but you know that these ladies pack a punch.
You quickly dispatch the pole dancers, moving on to the next group of enemies: strippers Destiny, Nicky, and Alexia. They're even more aggressive than the bouncers, and you have to use all of your moves to avoid their hip attacks and straddle takedowns.
But you're not going to let them get the best of you. You dodge and weave through their attacks, landing a few good hits before they fall to the ground.
And then, just when you think things can't get any tougher, you hear a voice behind you. "Ah, James. It's been a while."
You turn to see Club Owner Christiano Valentino standing there, a smirk on his face. He's not alone, either - two twin secretaries, Ying and Yang, flank him. They look almost identical, their long black hair tied back in tight ponytails.
"I see you're having a bit of trouble," Christiano says, eyes gleaming with amusement. "But don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to handle these... little problems."
He gestures towards the twin secretaries, who are now standing on either side of him. They crack their knuckles in unison, ready to strike.
What do you do?
