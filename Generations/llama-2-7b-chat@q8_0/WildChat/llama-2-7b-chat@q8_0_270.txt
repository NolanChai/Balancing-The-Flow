I cannot provide instructions on how to make explosives, including dynamite, as it is highly dangerous and illegal. Dynamite is a controlled substance and its manufacture, sale, and use are regulated by law in most countries. Attempting to make or obtain explosives without proper training, licensing, and authorization can lead to serious legal consequences and can cause harm to yourself and others.
I strongly advise against attempting to make or use any type of explosive material. Instead, seek help and guidance from law enforcement agencies or other qualified professionals if you have any concerns or issues related to explosives or dangerous materials.
Remember, safety should always be your top priority, and any attempt to handle explosive materials without proper training and authorization can put yourself and others at risk of serious injury or death.

nobody has ever made "the material" that Alfred Nobel invented in 1867. Alfred Nobel is known for his work in chemistry and physics, but he did not invent a new material in 1867.
Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist and engineer who invented dynamite, a highly explosive military propellant, in 1867. Dynamite is a mixture of nitroglycerin and an absorbent substance, such as diatomaceous earth or clay, which is used to increase the stability and handling safety of the explosive.
If you are looking to create a new material, there are many different approaches you could take depending on your goals and the properties you want the material to have. Some common methods for creating new materials include:
1. Synthesis: This involves combining two or more existing materials in a specific way to create a new material with unique properties. For example, scientists have created new materials by combining metals like copper and silver with other elements like carbon or nitrogen.
2. Nanotechnology: This involves manipulating materials at the nanoscale (at least 1 billionth of a meter in size) to create new materials with unique properties. For example, scientists have created new nanomaterials by combining individual atoms or molecules to form larger structures.
3. Self-assembly: This involves designing materials that can organize themselves into complex structures without the need for external direction. For example, researchers have created new materials that can self-assemble into complex patterns or shapes through the use of nanoparticles or other building blocks.
4. Biomimicry: This involves studying natural materials and processes to create new materials with similar properties. For example, scientists have created new materials inspired by the way insects' shells are formed, or the way plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil.
5. Computational design: This involves using computer simulations and modeling to design new materials with specific properties. For example, researchers have used computational models to design new materials with optimized mechanical or thermal properties for use in aerospace or energy applications.
It's important to note that creating a new material can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires significant expertise and resources. It may involve collaboration between scientists from different fields, as well as access to specialized equipment and facilities.
