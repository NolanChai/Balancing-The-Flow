Here is the equivalent Python code for the C code you provided:
```
import sys

def calculate_result(white_balls, power_ball):
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 7:
        print("Usage: {} power_ball (5 white balls)".format(sys.argv

To check if you are running Python on Linux, you can use the following command in a terminal:

```
python --version
```
This will output the version of Python that is currently installed on your system.

In Python, you can use the `subprocess` module to execute a C program and capture its output. Here are the equivalent commands to the ones you provided:
1. Compiling the C program:
```
$ subprocess.run(

The issue is that you are printing the result inside a function, which means it will only be printed when the function is executed, not when the script is run directly. To print the result outside of the function, you can move the `print(f...)` statement to the main part of the script, after the `if __name__ == "main":` block. Here's an updated version of your code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
def calculate_result(white_balls, power_ball):
	return 0

if __name__ == "main":
	if len(sys.argv) != 7:
		print("Usage: {} power_ball (5 white balls)".format(sys.argv

Sure! Here are the files and their permissions in the directory `/lottery`:
* `a.out`: Owned by `harry` with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (`rwx`).
* `lottery.c`: Owned by `harry` with read and write permissions for the owner (`rw-`), but no execute permissions.
Based on these permissions, it looks like both files are owned by `harry`, but `a.out` has more permissive permissions than `lottery.c`. Specifically:
* `a.out`: `rwx`
* `lottery.c`: `rw-`
This means that the owner of `a.out` has full control over the file, including read, write, and execute permissions. The owner of `lottery.c`, on the other hand, has read and write permissions, but not execute permissions.
