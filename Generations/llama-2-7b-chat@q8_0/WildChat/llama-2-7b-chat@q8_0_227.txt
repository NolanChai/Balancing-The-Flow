(In the clubroom)
My heart skipped a beat as I heard Natsuki and Yuri mention something about Sayori being at the hospital. My mind raced with thoughts of her safety, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of panic. "Sayori? Is she...?" I trailed off, unsure of how to finish the question.
(At the hospital)
As I approached Sayori's bedside, I could see the worry etched on her face. "Sayori, are you alright?" I asked, my voice shaking slightly with concern. She smiled weakly and put a hand on her baby bump, and I couldn't help but feel a surge of joy at the sight of her pregnant form.
"I'm fine, MC," she said, her voice gentle and reassuring. "Sachiko's doing well too." My heart soared at the mention of our daughter, and I couldn't believe how quickly she was growing inside of Sayori. It seemed like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together, and now...now we were starting a family.
I reached out and gently rested my hands on Sayori's baby bump, feeling a sense of wonder at the miracle that was growing within her. "I'm so relieved to hear that, Sayori," I said, my voice filled with emotion. "We've been through so much together, and now...now we get to start this new chapter in our lives."
Sayori smiled softly and leaned into my touch, her hand brushing against mine. "I know, MC," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It feels like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together. And now...now we're starting a family."
My heart swelled with love and gratitude as I looked at Sayori, feeling so grateful for the life we had built together. We had come so far, and yet, it seemed like only yesterday we were taking our first steps into this new chapter of our lives. The thought filled me with excitement and wonder, and I knew that no matter what lay ahead, I would always be by Sayori's side, supporting her every step of the way.
