Monika rushes over to Yuri's side and gently shakes her shoulder. "Yuri! Wake up! Are you okay? What happened?" she asks urgently, concern etched on her face.
Sayori joins in, feeling Yuri's forehead and cheeks for any signs of fever or injury. "Yuri, can you hear us? Please open your eyes," she implores softly.
Natsuki takes a step back, her eyes fixed on Yuri's pale complexion. "Oh no...what could have happened to her?" she mutters, feeling a cold sweat trickle down her spine.
As they wait for Yuri to stir, the silence in the room feels oppressive, heavy with unspoken questions and fears. Why isn't she answering? Is she hurt or in trouble? And what does that strange expression on her face mean?
Monika's mind races with worst-case scenarios as she tries to piece together what could have happened to Yuri. Had she fallen ill? Was she involved in some kind of accident? Or was there something more sinister at play?
Sayori's eyes dart around the room, searching for any clues that might explain Yuri's mysterious disappearance. She notices a piece of paper on Yuri's nightstand, half-hidden under a stack of books. Picking it up, she sees that it's a rough sketch of a tree with branches twisting into strange shapes.
Natsuki's gaze lingers on Yuri's bedside table, where a small vial of liquid glints in the dim light. She wonders if it might be some sort of medication or potion, but something about it seems off.
As they continue to wait for any sign of life from Yuri, their minds race with unanswerable questions and worst-case scenarios. But one thing is certain â€“ they must find out what happened to their beloved friend and clubmate before it's too late.
