Ran 2 3/8" 4,6# 9Cr-1Mo N. VAM special clearance tubing to 3331m. Stuck pipe at 2296m and 2287m while RIH, the stuck point corresponds to 3 1/2" nipple at 600m. Worked string, continued RIH with 2.375” tubing to 3331 m.
In 1996 during an extended production test, salt accumulated in the produced fluid, plugging the 3.5” tubing and the surface system. The salt bridge was circulated out with fresh water using coiled tubing. The plan was to attempt a pull-out of the old 3.5”-2.875” completion with a straight pull only, avoiding an expensive fishing job.
Since it didn't come easily, 2.375” tubing was run inside the old 3.5”-2.875” completion.
Fresh water was injected through the 3.5”-2.375” annulus, and oil was produced on the 2.375” tubing.
A tubing cleaning job was performed on September 14th, 2015, by pumping 6 m3 of 15% inhibited acid and 7 m3 of flush.
The well flowed steadily with no issues Monday night, September 14th, 2015, with WHP = 35 bar, CP = 30 bar, MA = 27 bar, FLP = 17 bar, INJ Rate = 6 m3/d. However, the morning of September 16th, the MA (inj.) pressure dropped off to 0 bar, and the CP began dropping as well. By 12:00 that day, WHP = 20 bar, CP = 0 bar, MA = 0 bar. That night, the injection rate was returned to 6 m3, then later reduced to 3 m3/d.
