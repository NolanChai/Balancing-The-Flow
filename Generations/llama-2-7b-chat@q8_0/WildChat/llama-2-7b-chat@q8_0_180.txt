As the colleagues gathered at the pub after work, they chatted and joked around, enjoying each other's company. The conversation turned to hypnosis, and Nadine, a skilled hypnotherapist, playfully pretended to hypnotize David with her fingers. Everyone laughed at the idea that hypnosis could actually work, but Nadine was determined to prove them wrong.
Without warning, Nadine leaned in close to David and began an impromptu induction. She started by counting backwards from ten, her voice soft and soothing. As she counted down, David's eyelids grew heavier, and his head nodded slightly forward.
"You are getting very sleepy," Nadine continued, her voice low and calm. "Your eyes are feeling heavy, and your body is feeling relaxed."
David's eyes closed completely, and he leaned back in his chair, his arm dangling over the side. The others watched in amazement as Nadine effortlessly hypnotized him with her impromptu induction.
"Now, David," Nadine said in a commanding voice, "I want you to obey my every command."
David's head nodded up and down, and he muttered something unintelligible. Nadine smiled and continued the hypnosis session, instructing David to perform various tasks, such as counting backwards from 100 or reciting a silly poem.
Every time Nadine woke him up, David obeyed her commands without hesitation. The others laughed at his mindless obedience, but Nadine was impressed by her own skill. She repeated the process several times, each time bringing David deeper into trance and back again.
As the night wore on, Nadine instructed David to kneel before her like a slave and massage her sweaty feet. David complied without question, his mind completely under her control. The others gasped in shock as he obediently massaged Nadine's feet with a look of complete focus.
Finally, Nadine brought David back to full awareness, but not before instructing him that he would forget everything except that he was very easy to hypnotize. As he came to his senses, David looked around the pub in confusion, unsure of what had just happened.
The others teased him about being so easy to hypnotize, but David just laughed it off. Nadine beamed with pride at her own skill, and they all continued their night out, enjoying each other's company and remembering the unexpected turn of events.
Reactions:
* Jan: "Wow, Nadine! I didn't think you could do that!"
* Scott: "Dude, you were totally under her control. That was insane!"
* Kirsteen: "I can't believe he actually obeyed her commands like a robot!"
* David: (groaning) "What happened? I just wanted to relax...and then...this happened."
* Nadine: "It's okay, David. You're safe now. Just remember, you're very easy to hypnotize."
As they left the pub, David couldn't stop talking about his bizarre experience, and Nadine smiled to herself, knowing she had proved her skill as a hypnotherapist. The others just shook their heads in disbelief at the strange turn of events.
