Hello everyone! My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I am thrilled to be here today as a fellow of the We4A program. As a co-founder of Inspcorp, a research-based technology transfer startup committed to developing difference-making technologies, and Eco Blocks and Tiles, a green technology company that manufactures high-quality and affordable building products using mixed post-consumer waste materials, I have firsthand experience with the challenges that women entrepreneurs face in the business world.
As a mother of three adorable little ones and a PhD scholar in hydrology and water quality, juggling multiple roles can be overwhelming at times. When I joined the We4A program in March this year, it was like finding an oasis in the desert. The experience has been incredibly fulfilling, as I've had the opportunity to network with other women entrepreneurs without feeling intimidated or inadequate.
I still remember attending my first event organized by We4A – the Celebrating Women 2023 event at Radisson Blu on March 31st, where I was nervous but also grateful to be surrounded by supportive women. The program has provided me with valuable resources, including events and online masterclasses, one-on-one mentoring opportunities, marketplaces, and celebrations like this one.
Attending the Nyayo Mums soko event in Nairobi, sponsored by We4A, was a particularly enriching experience. I had physical items for my thrift shop, Swahili snacks from the coast, flyers for our new rainwater harvesting technology, and flyers of our eco-friendly roof tiles. It was an incredible opportunity to connect with other entrepreneurs and potential customers.
One of the most significant takeaways from my experience in the We4A program is the importance of showing up. Whether it's attending events, networking, or introducing oneself to new people, showing up amplifies the impact of our innovations and businesses. I am grateful for the women in this program who show up, including Sarah from Nyeri in the cosmetics industry, Rose from Kisumu making briquettes, Maureen from Nairobi running Nyayo mums soko, Hellen from Nyeri as a consultant in green energy, Linda with her amazing Africa-inspired fashion line favoloso by Nanu, Mwanaisha running an online clothing store Mimi that caters to all family needs, Caroline of wise hubs Kisumu, and many more.
In conclusion, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the team at We4A, led by Tracy and Nikita, for their unwavering support, logistical organization, and dedication to empowering women entrepreneurs. Thank you for creating opportunities that allow us to show up, network, and grow our businesses. And thank you to the entire team of GIZ and the We4A program for prioritizing the success of women in business. 
Thank you!

Good day everyone, 
As a Co-Founder of Inspcorp and Eco Blocks and Tiles, I am thrilled to be here today as a fellow of the We4A program. My name is Presidio Anonizomed Person, and I am honored to share my story with you all. Being a mother of three and pursuing my PhD in hydrology and water quality, I must say it has not been easy juggling various responsibilities while also growing my businesses. However, the We4A program has provided me with an invaluable network of fellow women entrepreneurs who have supported me unconditionally.
At my first event with the We4A program, which was the "Celebrating Women" event held at Radisson Blu on March 31st, I was nervous and shaking as I sat among other accomplished women. However, their kindness and warmth quickly put me at ease, and I knew I had found a community that would help me grow and succeed.
Through the We4A program, I have attended various events and masterclasses, which have provided me with valuable insights into entrepreneurship and business growth. For instance, I was sponsored to attend the Nyayo Mums soko event in Nairobi, where I showcased my home décor items and Swahili snacks, made cash sales, and even got introduced to potential partners for my rainwater harvesting technology.
The program has also given me opportunities to network with other women entrepreneurs who share similar passions and goals. I have met amazing women like Sarah from Nyeri in the cosmetics industry, Rose from Kisumu who makes briquettes, Maureen from Nairobi who runs Nyayo mums soko, Hellen from Nyeri who is a consultant in green energy, Linda with an Africa-inspired fashion line called Favoloso by Nanu, Mwanaisha who runs an online clothing store Mimi that caters to all family needs, Caroline of Wise Hubs Kisumu, and many more.
I must say, showing up is a crucial part of the growth of our businesses. Amplifying our voices and demonstrating the impact of our innovations and businesses requires us to be present and visible. Although it can be challenging at times due to various reasons, including logistics and family obligations, showing up is inevitable and essential for success.
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Tracy and Nikita of the We4A program team for their unwavering support and organization. Thank you for creating opportunities for women entrepreneurs to show up, network, attend masterclasses, enjoy one-on-one mentoring, participate in marketplaces, and celebrate each other's achievements. Your efforts are greatly valued and appreciated.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire team of GIZ and the We4A program for recognizing the importance of supporting women entrepreneurs. Your work is crucial in creating a more equitable business environment that empowers women to succeed and make an impact in their communities. Thank you once again, and I look forward to continuing to grow and network with the We4A community.
