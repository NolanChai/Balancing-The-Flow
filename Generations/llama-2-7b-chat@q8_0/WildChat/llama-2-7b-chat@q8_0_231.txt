It has been an amazing start to the new year and a wet one for us in Guangzhou. Even with the rain, the K2 classes have had a great start and month. September saw our kids returning with great energies, happy faces, and settling into school life with ease. We are really happy to have them back with us.
This year has had a few changes in both staffing and academics, but through it all, we have seen a positive attitude flowing in classes and students. We have merged classes, and our kids have enjoyed making new friends and adapting well to new teachers. We also see them enjoying the new STEM lessons, where this month they made candles, built 3D cubes, and made their own playdough.
The topic of the month was 'All About Me.' Our kids enjoyed the topic as they learned about their birthdays, homes, and more about themselves. We spoke about what they want to be when they grow up and about being different and how it is beautiful to be different. As always, they enjoyed the crafts and art the most, where they made birthday poppers, portraits of themselves and friends, and built their own homes. They also explored how to take care of themselves and more about germs.
As we have now entered K2, we have started phonics as part of the curriculum. Our kids have taken well to phonics, learning the sounds and building their vocabulary with new words. Together with sounds, songs, and movement, they are learning well and enjoying phonics lessons. We are confident to see good improvement in phonics this year.
The month of September is known as the month of Adaptability. All our students have shown adaptability as they have settled and adapted back into school life with little hesitation. This month, we awarded Beatrice, Daniel, Sky, Yanhong, Chase, Renie, and Louis with the Certificate of Adaptability as they overcame challenges and adapted the most. Great work and well done! We also want to say a Happy Birthday to Daniel and Louis as they celebrated their birthdays in the month of September.
As we are now at the end of September, it is also the mark of our first break and Mid-Autumn Festival. We would like to take the opportunity to wish all parents and students a Happy Holiday and hope that you and your families have a great and restful holiday together. We also want to thank all parents for their support and efforts in the first month of school.
Best Wishes,
The K2 Team
