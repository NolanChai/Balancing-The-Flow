"Morning, little one," Amber says to her reflection in the mirror, trying to hide the worry creeping into her voice. She leans in closer, peering at her stomach with a frown. "Are you feeling okay today? You're not as active as usual, are you?"
She watches her reflection for a moment, waiting for some sign of movement from the baby. But there's nothing. Not even a flutter.
Amber's heart sinks. She can't help but feel like something is wrong. She's been feeling so good lately, so full of energy and life. And now...now she can't even sense her own child moving inside of her?
She takes a deep breath and tries to calm herself down. Maybe it's just a phase, she tells herself. Maybe the baby is just resting today. But as the minutes tick by and there's still no sign of life, Amber can't shake off the feeling of unease that's settled in her stomach like a cold, hard stone.
She decides to try and distract herself by getting dressed and heading out into the city. Maybe some fresh air and activity will help clear her head. But no matter how much she tries to push the worry away, it's always there, lurking just beneath the surface of her thoughts.
As she walks through the streets of Mondstadt, Amber can't help but feel like something is off. She's not sure what it is, but she can sense that something is wrong. And deep down, she knows that it has nothing to do with the baby. It's something else entirely. Something that only she can feel.
