Infertility is a complex issue that can be caused by a variety of factors in both men and women. While it is true that in about 40% of cases, infertility is due to male factor infertility, the remaining 60% are due to female factor infertility or unexplained infertility (where no specific cause can be identified).
Here are some of the common causes of male infertility:
1. Low sperm count or poor sperm quality: A low sperm count or poor sperm quality can make it difficult for the sperm to fertilize an egg. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, infection, injury to the testicles, and exposure to toxins such as tobacco smoke or heavy metals.
2. Varicocele: A varicocele is a swelling of the veins in the scrotum that can affect sperm production. It is estimated that up to 15% of men with infertility have a varicocele.
3. Blockages or obstruction: Blockages or obstruction in the reproductive tract, such as a blockage in the epididymis or vas deferens, can make it difficult for sperm to travel through the reproductive system and reach the egg.
4. Retrograde ejaculation: This is a condition where semen is released into the bladder instead of being expelled through the penis during orgasm. This can reduce the amount of sperm available for fertilization.
5. Chromosomal or genetic abnormalities: Some men may have chromosomal or genetic abnormalities that can affect their fertility. For example, some men may have Klinefelter syndrome, a condition where they have an extra X chromosome, which can affect sperm production.
In contrast, the common causes of female infertility include:
1. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular menstrual cycles, cysts in the ovaries, and infertility.
2. Endometriosis: This is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, which can cause inflammation and scarring that can lead to infertility.
3. Fibroids: These are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can affect fertility by blocking the fallopian tubes or by disrupting implantation of the fertilized egg.
4. Age: Women's fertility declines with age, particularly after the age of 35.
5. Male factor infertility: As mentioned earlier, male factor infertility can also play a role in female infertility, as sperm quality and quantity are important for fertilization.
It is important to note that in about 20% of cases, both partners may have an equal role in causing infertility. In these situations, it may be necessary to investigate both partners' fertility before attempting treatment.
