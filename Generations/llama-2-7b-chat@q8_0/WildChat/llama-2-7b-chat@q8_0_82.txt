Yes, there are several issues with the SQL statement you provided in Lua:
1. SQL injection vulnerability: The `string.format()` function does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, which can lead to SQL injection attacks. You should avoid using string concatenation for building SQL queries altogether. Instead, use a real SQL library that supports parameterized queries and escaping.
2. Incorrect syntax: The `update` statement is missing the table name before the set clause. You should update the table `club_info` instead of just `info`.
3. Missing column names: You are updating multiple columns (`field_name`, `value`) without specifying their column names explicitly. In a real SQL query, you would need to specify the column names, like this: `update club_info set field_name = ?, value = ? where cid = ?`.
Here's an updated version of the SQL statement that fixes these issues:
local sql = "update club_info set field_name = ?, value = ? where cid = ?"
-- Replace with your actual data
local fieldName = "field_name"
local value = "value"
local cid = 123 -- Replace with your actual value
sql:execute(fieldName, value, cid)
This way, you can avoid SQL injection attacks and write more robust SQL queries in Lua.
