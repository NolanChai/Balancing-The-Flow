INT. JANE’S KITCHEN - DAY

Jane is standing at the kitchen counter, staring at her phone in disbelief as she listens to the voice on the other end of the line. Her older sister, Andrea, is being arrested for drug possession.

JANE: (into phone) What?! No way! That can’t be happening!

ANDREA: (over phone) I’m sorry, Jane. I know this is a shock to you. But I have no choice but to turn myself in.

JANE: (frustrated) Turn yourself in?! How could you get mixed up with drugs again?! You promised me that you were done with all of that!

ANDREA: (sadly) I know, Jane. And I’m so sorry. But I couldn’t stop. It was like I was trapped in this vicious cycle and I couldn’t get out.

JANE: (angrily) Well, now you’re going to have to deal with the consequences! You could have been killed! Or worse!

ANDREA: (defensive) It’s not like that, Jane. I know it looks bad, but I swear I wasn’t using them for fun. I was just trying to get by, you know? Like you do when you’re struggling to make ends meet and you feel like there’s no way out.

JANE: (disbelieving) You expect me to believe that?! After everything we’ve been through together?! You’re still using drugs and now you’re getting arrested?!

ANDREA: (tearfully) Yes, Jane. I know it’s not exactly what you want to hear, but it’s the truth. And I’m so sorry that I have to burden you with this right now. But please, just try to understand.

JANE: (storming out of the kitchen) I can’t believe this! You’re going to have to get a lawyer and post bail and probably go to rehab again! And I have to deal with all of this too! (stomps off)

ANDREA: (defeated) I know, Jane. I’m so sorry. (hangs up the phone and drops it on the counter, tears streaming down her face)
