Adjusting the exposure compensation by +2 stops will indeed make the 18% grey object appear brighter and closer to white in the final image, but it will not actually turn the object white.
Exposure compensation adjusts the camera's ability to capture light relative to the brightness of the scene. When you set exposure compensation to +2 stops, the camera will allow more light to reach the sensor than it would without the adjustment. This means that objects in the scene that are brighter than the base level (18% grey) will appear even brighter, while objects that are darker than the base level will appear less bright.
However, it's important to note that exposure compensation only affects the camera's ability to capture light, not the actual color of the objects in the scene. So, while a 18% grey object may become brighter and closer to white, it will still retain its original color balance.
In summary, adjusting the exposure compensation by +2 stops will make an 18% grey object appear brighter and closer to white in the final image, but it will not actually turn the object white.
