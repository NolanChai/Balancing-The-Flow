As we sped towards the hospital, Emily's contractions grew stronger and closer together. She gripped MC's hand tightly, her knuckles white with strain. "I can't believe this is happening," she panted. "I wasn't supposed to give birth for another week."
MC's face was a mix of concern and excitement. He glanced in the rearview mirror at Emily, then back at the road. "Don't worry, Emily. We're almost there. Just hang on a little longer."
Yuri and Monika sat in the front seats, their faces filled with tension as they navigated through traffic. Monika reached back and gently squeezed my hand. "It's okay, Natsuki. You're going to be a great mom. Just push when you feel ready."
I gritted my teeth and focused on my breathing. My belly was throbbing with each contraction, and I could feel the baby crowning. I knew I couldn't wait much longer. With one last burst of strength, I pushed with all my might.
As the baby slid into the world, a cry of joy erupted from Emily's lips. MC pulled over to the side of the road, and we all rushed to see the newborn. Emily gazed down at her baby with tears of happiness in her eyes. "It's a girl," she whispered. "Her name is Ava."
We spent the next few hours in the hospital, marveling at the little bundle of joy. As I held Ava in my arms for the first time, a wave of emotions washed over me. I had never felt so alive, so filled with purpose. Motherhood was everything I had hoped it would be, and more.
As we left the hospital with Ava cradled in Emily's arms, I couldn't help but feel grateful for this unexpected twist of fate. Sayori's dream had come true, and mine too. We had become mothers, and nothing could ever take that away from us.
