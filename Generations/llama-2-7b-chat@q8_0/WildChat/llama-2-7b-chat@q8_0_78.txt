Here is a revised version of the paragraph, condensed to 150 words while maintaining accuracy and clarity:
"I prioritize clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information. I strictly adhere to patient confidentiality guidelines as outlined in the Patient Code of Rights and Privacy Act. In my role, I utilized software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documentation purposes. Following proper logout procedures, I conducted a blood sugar level check and administered insulin under supervision, recording accurate details in the patient's electronic file with date and time, and obtaining preceptor signature to ensure accuracy and maintain patient privacy."
Grammar and spellings have been checked, and the paragraph has been condensed to 150 words while still conveying the necessary information.

During my clinical placement, I have consistently upheld the principle of patient confidentiality by never disclosing residents' details outside the clinical facility. Recently, during a handover to the next shift, a family member entered the area and inquired about the patient's progress. To address their inquiry while maintaining confidentiality, I promptly paused the handover process, attended to the family member, and resumed once they left the room. This approach allows me to prioritize both the family member's needs and patient confidentiality simultaneously. Maintaining patient confidentiality is a fundamental aspect of providing quality care and building trust within the healthcare setting. By adhering to this principle, I ensure that patients feel secure in sharing their personal information and receiving appropriate care.

During a recent interaction with a resident, I had the opportunity to explain the significance of Levodopa in her treatment regimen. I conveyed that this medication plays a crucial role in replenishing dopamine levels, which can help alleviate symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slow movement. I also discussed potential side effects and how the medication contributes to the improvement of her overall health condition. To ensure comprehension, I provided a clear and concise explanation, using simple language and examples. The resident expressed understanding of the information provided, demonstrating that she was satisfied with the explanation.

During my medication rounds, I encountered a patient who refused to take all of his morning medications. The patient was agitated and non-compliant with both food and medications. Rather than forcefully administering the medications, I decided to give the patient time and space to calm down.
Later on, I took the opportunity to explain the importance of taking the medication on time and how it can help manage his conditions. I also explained the possible consequences of not taking them. While the patient had the right to refuse the medication, I made sure to document the refusal and hand over the medications to the next shift. I also reminded them to update the patient's general practitioner (GP) when they are available.
In summary, I:
1. Gave the patient time and space to calm down during medication rounds.
2. Explained the importance of taking medications on time and how it can help manage conditions.
3. Documented the patient's refusal to take their medications.
4. Handed over the medications to the next shift.
5. Reminded them to update the GP when available.
