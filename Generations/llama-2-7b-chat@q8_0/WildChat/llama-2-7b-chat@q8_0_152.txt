the door opened, and William stood before her with a smile. "Hey there, little one! What brings you here today?" he asked in a friendly tone. Rose hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond, but then she blurted out, "I don't want to be here!" and turned to run away. William chased after her, laughing and calling out, "Hey, slow down! Where are you going? Don't be scared, I'm here to help!"

Rose stopped in her tracks and looked back at William, feeling a mix of fear and confusion. She didn't know why she had run away, but now that she was faced with his kind smile, she felt a sense of safety. "I don't want to talk to Karen," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
William nodded understandingly and said, "Okay, no problem. Let's go inside and have some tea. I'll help you figure things out." Rose hesitated for a moment, then nodded and followed William into his apartment. As they sat down in the living room, William asked her gently, "What's wrong, little one? Why don't you want to talk to Karen?"
Rose took a deep breath and began to explain, "Karen wants me to learn new things and be more like other kids. But I don't want to change who I am. I just want to play chess and be with my brother." William listened patiently, nodding his head and making soothing noises. When Rose finished speaking, he said, "I understand how you feel, little one. It's okay to be different, and it's important to do what makes you happy. But sometimes, we have to make sacrifices for the people we love."
Rose looked up at William with tears in her eyes, feeling a sense of understanding and gratitude. "Thank you," she whispered, and William smiled and hugged her gently. "You're welcome, little one. I'm always here to help."
