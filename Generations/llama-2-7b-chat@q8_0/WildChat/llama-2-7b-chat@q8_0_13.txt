The answer to the riddle is "A".

Explanation:

The element "A" has no end, as it is a continuous letter. By turning the letter "A" around, you are essentially creating a new letter, which is "a", which reflects the word "friend".

Ah, I see! Yes, the answer to the riddle is indeed "me." Here's how the riddle works:

The riddle starts by asking "Who am I?" which is a common question that people ask themselves when thinking about their identity. Then, it provides two clues that seem unrelated: "I don't have any arms or legs" and "I can run anywhere." These clues are meant to be confusing and misleading, as they don't seem to fit with the idea of a person.
However, when you put the clues together, you realize that the answer is actually "me" - the speaker who is asking the question. Here's how it fits:
* "I don't have any arms or legs" refers to the fact that the speaker has no physical body parts (arms and legs). Since the speaker is a person, they don't have any physical limbs.
* "I can run anywhere" refers to the fact that the speaker can think and communicate ideas without any physical restrictions. They can "run" their thoughts and ideas anywhere in their mind, and express them through language or other forms of communication.
So, the answer to the riddle is simply "me." The speaker is their own identity, and they are asking themselves who they are while also acknowledging their ability to think and communicate without any physical limitations.
