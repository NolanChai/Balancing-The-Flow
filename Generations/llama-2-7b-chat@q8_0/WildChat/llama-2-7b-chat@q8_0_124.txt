Lita Cabellut is a Spanish artist known for her vibrant, expressive paintings that blend figuration and abstraction. Here are some questions and answers from an interview with Lita Cabellut:
Q: What inspires your art?
A: My art is inspired by my own emotions and experiences, as well as the world around me. I'm interested in exploring the human condition and the complexities of life through my paintings.
Q: How do you approach the creative process?
A: I start by making a lot of sketches and studies before beginning a painting. I work from a place of intuition, letting the painting unfold organically. I try not to think too much about the end result, but instead let the process guide me.
Q: Your paintings often feature bold, vibrant colors. What role do color play in your work?
A: Color is incredibly important to my art. I use it to express emotion and energy, as well as to create texture and depth in my paintings. I'm interested in the way that color can evoke different feelings and moods, and I try to use it in a way that enhances the overall impact of the painting.
Q: Can you tell us about your technique?
A: I work primarily with oil paint on canvas, using thick layers of paint to build up texture and depth. I also incorporate collage elements into some of my pieces, using found objects and materials to add additional textures and dimensions.
Q: How do you approach the act of painting itself?
A: For me, painting is a form of meditation. It's a way for me to lose myself in the process and forget about everything else. I find it incredibly therapeutic and fulfilling, and it allows me to express myself in a way that feels truly authentic.
Q: What do you hope viewers take away from your work?
A: I hope that my paintings inspire viewers to look at the world around them in a new way. I want them to see beauty in unexpected places, and to feel something – whether it's joy, sadness, or wonder – when they experience my art. Ultimately, I hope that my work helps people connect with their own emotions and experiences on a deeper level.
Q: Can you tell us about any upcoming projects or exhibitions?
A: Yes, I have a few exciting projects in the works! I'm currently working on a series of paintings inspired by the natural world, and I also have an exhibition planned for later this year at a gallery in New York City. It will feature some of my latest work, as well as a few new pieces that I'm particularly excited about.
