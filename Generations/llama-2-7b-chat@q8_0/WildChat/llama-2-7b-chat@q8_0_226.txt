Here are some key concepts to consider when implementing e-commerce for a small supermarket:

1. Website Design and User Experience: A well-designed website with an intuitive user experience can help attract and retain customers. Consider using a simple layout, easy navigation, high-quality product images, and clear product information. Make sure the site is mobile-friendly to accommodate more than 50% of online shoppers who use their smartphones to shop online.
2. Product Offering: To be successful in e-commerce, you'll need to offer a wide range of products that meet customers' needs and preferences. Consider stocking essential grocery items, fresh produce, meats, dairy products, baked goods, and other everyday essentials.
3. Inventory Management: Efficient inventory management is critical for an e-commerce supermarket. Implement a system that can track and manage your stock levels, automate order fulfillment, and provide real-time updates to customers on product availability. 
4. Payment Systems: Offering multiple payment options can improve the checkout experience and increase conversions. Consider integrating popular payment gateways like PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay to make transactions smooth and secure. 
5. Delivery and Shipping: To offer a seamless shopping experience, consider partnering with local courier services for delivery and shipping. You can also offer in-store pickup options for customers who prefer to collect their orders personally.
6. Customer Service: Providing excellent customer service is crucial for building trust and loyalty among online shoppers. Consider offering multiple channels for customer support, such as live chat, email, or phone calls. Train your staff to respond promptly and courteously to customer inquiries and resolve issues efficiently.
7. Analytics and Reporting: Use data analytics tools to track website traffic, sales, and customer behavior. This will help you identify areas of improvement, optimize your e-commerce strategy, and make better business decisions. 
8. Security Measures: Online shopping security is a top concern for customers. Ensure that your website uses secure servers and encryption technologies to protect customer data from cyber threats. Display trust badges and certifications from reputable third-party organizations like VeriSign or Trustwave to enhance credibility.
9. Social Media Integration: Utilize social media platforms to promote your e-commerce supermarket, engage with customers, and showcase products. Share recipes, product demonstrations, and other content relevant to your target audience to build brand awareness and generate interest in your online store.
10. Personalized Offers and Discounts: To encourage repeat business, offer personalized promotions and discounts based on customers' purchase history or loyalty program status. This can help increase customer retention and drive repeat sales.
In conclusion, e-commerce for a small supermarket requires careful consideration of various concepts, including website design, product offering, inventory management, payment systems, delivery & shipping, customer service, analytics & reporting, security measures, social media integration, and personalized offers & discounts. By implementing these strategies effectively, you can build a successful e-commerce business that attracts and retains customers.
