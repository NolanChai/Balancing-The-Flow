Here is a Band 9 IELTS writing task 2 essay on the topic of the increasing trend of people deciding to eat healthy food and exercise regularly:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards individuals adopting healthier lifestyle choices, such as consuming nutritious foods and engaging in regular physical activity. This shift towards a healthier way of living can be attributed to various factors, including the rising awareness of the importance of maintaining good health, the increasing availability of healthy food options, and the recognition of the numerous benefits associated with regular exercise.
One major factor contributing to this trend is the growing understanding of the significance of a balanced diet in maintaining good health. With the prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, people are becoming more conscious of the need to fuel their bodies with nutrient-dense foods that can help prevent these conditions. As a result, there has been an upsurge in the demand for organic and whole foods, as well as a shift towards plant-based diets.
Another significant factor is the increased availability of healthy food options. Supermarkets and restaurants are now offering more fresh produce, lean proteins, and whole grains than ever before, making it easier for people to incorporate healthy choices into their daily lives. Additionally, there has been a proliferation of fitness centers, yoga studios, and outdoor recreational spaces, providing individuals with a wider range of opportunities to engage in physical activity.
To further encourage more people to adopt healthier lifestyle habits, governments and organizations can implement policies and initiatives that promote the benefits of exercise and healthy eating. For instance, schools can incorporate compulsory physical education classes into their curriculum, while workplaces can provide on-site fitness facilities or subsidize gym memberships. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can be launched to educate individuals about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and the potential consequences of neglecting it.
In conclusion, the trend towards consuming healthy foods and exercising regularly is a positive development that can have numerous benefits for individual health and well-being, as well as society as a whole. By understanding the factors driving this trend and implementing effective strategies to encourage more people to adopt healthier lifestyle habits, we can promote a culture of wellness that will have far-reaching consequences for generations to come.

Here is a Band 7 IELTS writing task 2 essay in response to the question:
More and more people have been deciding to lead a healthy lifestyle by consuming nutritious food and exercising regularly. This trend has gained popularity over the past few years, with various factors contributing to it. According to a survey conducted by the World Health Organization, one of the primary reasons for this shift is the growing awareness among people regarding the importance of maintaining good health. With the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, individuals have come to recognize the significance of adopting a balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent these conditions.
Another significant factor driving this trend is the changing lifestyle and work culture. Many people are now leading sedentary jobs that involve sitting for long periods, which has resulted in a decrease in physical activity. As a result, individuals have become more conscious about exercising regularly to counteract the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, the rise of social media has also played a role in this trend, as people are exposed to images and videos showcasing healthy eating habits and fitness routines, thereby influencing their choices.
To encourage more people to adopt healthier lifestyles, governments and organizations can take several measures. For instance, they can promote nutrition education in schools, workplaces, and communities, providing individuals with the knowledge required to make informed decisions about their diet. Additionally, they can create policies that support physical activity by investing in public parks, bike lanes, and other recreational facilities. Furthermore, celebrities and influencers can play a crucial role in this trend by advocating for healthy living through their social media platforms, which has the potential to reach a vast audience.
In conclusion, the growing interest in healthy lifestyles is a positive trend that can have long-term benefits for individuals and society as a whole. By addressing the factors contributing to this shift and implementing effective measures, more people can be encouraged to adopt healthier habits, leading to better overall health and wellbeing.

Band Score: 7

This essay demonstrates a good understanding of the reasons behind the growing trend of healthy eating and exercise habits, as well as potential measures to encourage even more people to adopt these habits. However, there are some areas that could be improved upon to raise the overall band score:

1. Coherence and Cohesion: The essay jumps between different ideas and points without a clear connection, making it difficult to follow the writer's argument. To improve coherence and cohesion, the writer should organize their ideas into logical paragraphs with a clear transition between them.
2. Language and Style: While the essay demonstrates good use of simple language, there are some instances of overly complex sentence structures that can make the text difficult to understand. To improve language and style, the writer should aim for clearer and simpler sentences that convey their meaning effectively.
3. Clarity and Accuracy: Some sentences could be more concise and clear, while others contain minor errors in grammar or punctuation. To improve clarity and accuracy, the writer should proofread their text carefully to catch any mistakes.
4. Lexical Resource: The essay could benefit from a wider range of vocabulary and phrasing to convey ideas more precisely and creatively. The writer could use synonyms, idiomatic expressions, and collocations to enhance the overall quality of their language.
5. grammatical Range and Accuracy: While the essay demonstrates good control of basic grammar structures, there are some areas where the writer could improve their grammatical range and accuracy, such as using more complex sentence structures and varied verb tenses.

Overall, this essay scores a 7 out of 9 due to its good understanding of the topic, coherent structure, and adequate use of language. However, there are areas that need improvement, particularly in terms of coherence, language, clarity, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. With some revisions and improvements, the essay could score even higher in the band score range.
