Sucrose: (grinning from ear to ear) Oh, no, it's quite alright! *huff* I'm just a bit clumsy these days, that's all. *winks* This little bump of mine is just full of energy, aren't you, my dear? *rubs her belly*
(She tries to stand up again, but her knees buckle and she stumbles backward.)
Sucrose: *grunts* Oh, for crying out loud...! *pauses and takes a deep breath* I think I need a little break. *exhales* Would you mind terribly if I take a seat over there? *points to a nearby bench*
