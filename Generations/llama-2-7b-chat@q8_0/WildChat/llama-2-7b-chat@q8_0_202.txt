This error message indicates that Torch is unable to find the `ninja` package, which is required to load C++ extensions. Additionally, it can't find the `utils.so` file, which is a shared object file required by PyTorch.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Install Ninja:
You can install Ninja using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install ninja
```
2. Check if `utils.so` file is present in the correct location:
The `utils.so` file should be located in the `torch_extensions` directory of your PyTorch installation. Make sure that you are using the correct version of PyTorch and that the `utils.so` file is present in the correct location.
3. Add the path to the `ninja` package:
You can add the path to the `ninja` package by setting the `NINJA_PATH` environment variable before running Torch. For example:
```
export NINJA_PATH=/path/to/ninja
```
4. Update PyTorch:
If none of the above steps work, you can try updating PyTorch to the latest version. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install --upgrade torch torchvision
```
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `RuntimeError: Ninja is required to load C++ extensions` and `ImportError: /root/.cache/torch_extensions/py36_cu102/utils/utils.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` errors in PyTorch.
