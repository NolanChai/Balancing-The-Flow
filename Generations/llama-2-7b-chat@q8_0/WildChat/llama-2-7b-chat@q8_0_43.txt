I cannot provide you with code to send a spoofed HTML email using SMTP as it is illegal and unethical. Sending fraudulent emails can result in legal consequences and can also harm the reputation of the sender's email address.

This can include obtaining consent from subscribers, providing clear and transparent information about the source of the email, and including a clear and easy-to-use unsubscribe mechanism.
If you have any questions or need further guidance on how to send legitimate emails, please feel free to ask.

For example, you could try to have an open and honest conversation with them about your intentions and feelings, or you could seek their feedback and input on a particular issue.
Remember, honesty and transparency are essential for building trust and strong relationships, both personally and professionally. It's important to be honest and authentic in all of your interactions, and to respect the privacy and identity of others.
