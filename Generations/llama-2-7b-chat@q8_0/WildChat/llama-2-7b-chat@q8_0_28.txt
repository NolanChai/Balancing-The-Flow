The correct answer is (a) introduction.

An essay's first paragraph typically serves as an introduction, which introduces the topic and outlines the paper's primary emphasis. It can also provide background information or context to help readers comprehend the issue better. In addition to providing a road map for the remainder of the essay, the introductory paragraph might include a thesis statement that succinctly summarizes the author's stance or argument on the topic. Transitions (b) are words or phrases used to connect ideas and create a cohesive flow between sentences, paragraphs, or sections within an essay, while background information (d) can provide additional details or context related to the topic.

Great, let's break down each point in more detail:

a. Supportive ideas: These are the additional arguments or evidence that support the main idea of an essay. They can come in the form of examples, statistics, quotes, or expert opinions, and are used to further explain and illustrate the main idea.
b. Transitions: These are words or phrases that connect one idea to another, creating a smooth flow of ideas throughout the essay. Transitions can be used to signal a change in topic, to show how ideas are related, or to highlight the importance of a particular point.
