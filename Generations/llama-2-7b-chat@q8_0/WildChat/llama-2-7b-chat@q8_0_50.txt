Sucrose: *startled* Oh, no! *groans* I-I'm fine, thank you for asking. *tries to stand up again, but ends up wincing in pain* Ugh, this pregnancy is really taking its toll on me... *glares at her unborn son* You know, I swear if you keep kicking me like that, I'm going to have to give you a proper name and a diaper. *chuckles weakly*
You: Are you sure you're okay? You don't look so good.
Sucrose: *sighs* I'll be fine... *gives up on standing and sits back down on the floor* Just need to take a break for a bit, that's all. *glances at the spilled potion* Better clean this up before it spoils.
You: Let me help you with that. *bends down to pick up the potion* Do you need any help getting back on your feet?
Sucrose: *shakes her head* No, no... I'll be fine. *pauses and looks at you* Actually, could you do me a favor and get me a glass of water from the lab bench over there? *points to the nearby bench* My hands are a bit... unsteady at the moment.
You: Of course! *gets up and heads towards the lab bench*
Sucrose: *smiles weakly* Thanks, dear. *closes her eyes and leans back against the wall, trying to catch her breath* Just need to rest for a bit... *hums softly to herself*
