Safi'jiiva watched with a mix of confusion and curiosity as Alice bullied him throughout the day. He couldn't understand why she was picking on him so much, especially since he was the only dragon in the school. But as the day went on, Safi'jiiva started to feel a strange sensation pulling on his tail. He turned around to see Alice, but she was wearing a light-blue colored uniform and had a massive belly.
Alice: "Miss me, dweeb?" she said with a sly grin, as she took Safi'jiiva's lunch.
Safi'jiiva couldn't believe his eyes. Why was Alice acting differently towards him? And why was she pregnant? He watched in confusion as Alice continued to bully him throughout the day, but with a sudden twist of events, Alice clutched her belly in pain during math class.
Alice: (in pain) "Something's wrong...! I've never felt pain before!" she exclaimed, as the teacher rushed to her desk.
Safi'jiiva couldn't understand what was happening, but he knew that something was definitely off. He watched in amazement as Alice's belly began to grow and change, until a small, scaly creature emerged from it.
The creature let out a tiny roar and looked up at Safi'jiiva with piercing orange eyes. Safi'jiiva couldn't believe his eyes. He had never seen anything like this before.
Safi'jiiva: "W-what is that?" he stuttered, as Alice cradled the creature in her arms.
Alice: (smiling) "His name is Scorch. And he's yours now." she said with a smile.
Safi'jiiva was taken aback by this sudden turn of events. He had never expected to be a father to a dragonlet, but here he was. And as he looked at Scorch, he knew that his life would never be the same again.
