In ancient Egyptian and Greek papyri and inscriptions, there are three forms of personal names derived from the god Hermanubis:
1. Ἑρμάνουβιϲ (attested six times): This form simply repeats the god's name without any further modification.
2. Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances): This form is derived from the god's name through the suffix -ᾶϲ, which was a common Greek suffix for personal names based on Egyptian deities.
3. Ἑρμανουβίων (four instances): This form is also derived from the god's name through the suffix -ίων, which was another common Greek suffix for personal names based on Egyptian deities.
It is worth noting that in one instance (9), a female nurse is named Ἑρμανουβιϲ, which is highly unusual for a female theophoric name to be unmarked for gender in this way. The author suspects that the element -ανουβιϲ in Ἑρμάνουβιϲ may have been conflated with the similar declension of Greek feminine names in -ίϲ, -ίδοϲ, which would make it more appropriate to read the nurse's name as an oxytone (Ἑρμανουβίϲ).
