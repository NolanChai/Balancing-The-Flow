Title: The Battle for Führerprinzip: A Nazi German Civil War (1963)

Synopsis:
In an alternate history where Hitler did not die in 1945, he passed away in 1962, plunging the Third Reich into a civil war over who should succeed him as Führer. Albert Speer, the reformist architect and one of Hitler's most trusted advisors, sees an opportunity to modernize and transform the Reich. Martin Bormann, a conservative member of the Party, fears that such changes would undermine the traditional values and beliefs that have sustained the Reich for decades. Hermann Göring, the aging and power-hungry Reichsmarschall, sees the struggle as an opportunity to reclaim his rightful place at the top of the Nazi hierarchy. Reinhard Heydrich, the ruthless SS leader, is determined to eliminate any opposition and secure his grip on the Party.
As the civil war rages across Germany, Speer must navigate treacherous political waters while also overseeing a massive infrastructure project to transform the country into a modern, industrial powerhouse. Bormann works tirelessly to rally support from the Party faithful and maintain the status quo of traditional Nazi values. Göring uses his influence and cunning to undermine Speer's efforts and position himself as the rightful heir to Hitler's legacy. Heydrich, meanwhile, utilizes his fearsome reputation to consolidate power within the SS and eliminate any potential challengers to his authority.
As the conflict escalates, alliances are forged and broken, and betrayals abound. Speer must confront the dark secrets of his own past in order to find the strength to lead the Reich toward a new future. Bormann must reconcile his loyalty to the Party with his own personal demons and decide whether to fight for the old or embrace the new. Göring is forced to confront the legacy of his own crimes and decide whether to atone or continue down the path of destruction. And Heydrich must confront the true nature of his own ambition and the price he is willing to pay for power.
