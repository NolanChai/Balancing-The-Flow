Financial projections are estimates of a company's future financial performance, including revenue, expenses, profits, and cash flow. Here are six common financial projections that entrepreneurs and small business owners may use:
1. Income Statement Projection: This projection shows the company's projected revenues, costs of goods sold, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income for a specific period of time (usually a year or quarter).
2. Balance Sheet Projection: This projection shows the company's projected assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time (usually the end of the fiscal year or quarter). It provides information on the company's financial position and its ability to meet its obligations.
3. Cash Flow Statement Projection: This projection shows the company's projected cash inflows and outflows over a specific period of time (usually a year or quarter). It helps entrepreneurs and small business owners understand their company's liquidity position and its ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.
4. Break-even Analysis Projection: This projection shows the point at which the company's total revenue covers its total costs, including fixed and variable costs. It helps entrepreneurs and small business owners understand when their business will become profitable.
5. Revenue Growth Rate Projection: This projection shows the company's expected annual growth rate in revenues over a specific period of time (usually 3-5 years). It helps entrepreneurs and small business owners plan for future revenue growth and make informed decisions about investments and resource allocation.
6. Expense Projection: This projection shows the company's expected annual expenses for various categories, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and marketing. It helps entrepreneurs and small business owners understand their costs and make informed decisions about budgeting and cost control.
By preparing these financial projections, entrepreneurs and small business owners can gain valuable insights into their company's financial health and make informed decisions about the future of their business.
