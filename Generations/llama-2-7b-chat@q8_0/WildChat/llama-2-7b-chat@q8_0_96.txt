Ran 2 3/8" 4,6# 9Cr-1Mo N. VAM special clearance tubing to 3331m. Stuck pipe at 2296m and 2287m while RIH, the stuck point corresponds to 3 1/2" nipple at 600m. Worked string, continued RIH with 2.375” tubing to 3331 m.
In 1996, salt accumulated in the produced fluid, plugging the 3.5” tubing and surface system during an extended production test. The salt bridge was circulated out with fresh water using coiled tubing. The plan was to attempt a pullout of the old 3.5”-2.875” completion with straight pull only, avoiding an expensive fishing job.
▪Since it didn't come easily, 2.375” tubing was run inside the old 3.5”-2.875” completion.
▪Fresh water was injected through the 3.5”-2.375” annulus, and oil was produced on the 2.375” tubing.
▪A tubing cleaning job was performed on September 14th, 2015, by pumping 6 m3 of 15% inhibited acid and 7 m3 of flush.
▪The well flowed steadily with no problems on Monday night (September 14th), with WHP = 35 bar, CP = 30 bar, MA = 27 bar, FLP = 17 bar, and an injection rate of 6 m3/d. However, on Wednesday morning (September 16th), the MA pressure dropped to 0 bar, and the CP began dropping as well. By noon the same day, WHP = 20 bar, CP = 0 bar, MA = 0 bar. In the evening of the same day, the injection rate was reduced to 3 m3/d.
