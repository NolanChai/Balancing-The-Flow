Welcome to One Piece: The Text Adventure Game! You are Luffy, a young pirate on a quest to become the greatest pirate in the world. Your journey takes you to the bustling port city of Water 7, where you have just arrived after a long sea voyage. As you step off the dock, you are greeted by the sound of merrymaking and the smell of freshly cooked food. The city is filled with colorful buildings and lively market stalls, and you can hear the chatter of people from all over the world speaking in different dialects.
You find yourself standing in front of a large building with a sign that reads "Water 7's Grand Marina." The marina is bustling with activity, as sailors and travelers come and go, and you can hear the sound of dolphins splashing in the distance. You have several options to choose from:
1. Explore the Grand Marina and see what it has to offer.
2. Head to the market stalls to check out the local wares.
3. Visit the nearby tavern to gather information and hear rumors of adventure.
4. Set sail for other destinations, such as the nearby island of Fishman Island or the mysterious Elbaf Island.

What would you like to do first, Luffy?
