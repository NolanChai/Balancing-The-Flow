Here are some reactions from various Starcraft characters and non-characters to Sonic the Hedgehog:

Zerg - "Fascinating! This 'Sonic' creature is like no other I have encountered. Its speed and agility are impressive, but its lack of defenses makes it vulnerable to attack. Perhaps we can use it as a weapon in our next invasion."
Terran - "Whoa, did you see that? Sonic just ran circles around that Zerg Overlord! I bet he could take down any of those little buggers with ease. But man, he's gotta be careful, those things are relentless!"
Protoss - "Sonic... interesting. His ability to move at incredible speeds is admirable, but it is his unpredictability that makes him most formidable. I sense a potential ally in this Sonic creature."
Sarah Kerrigan - "Ugh, Sonic? Really? That guy's always causing trouble wherever he goes. And now he's here? Great. Just what we need. Can you imagine him teaming up with the Zerg? We'd be doomed."
Raynor - "Well, well, well. Looks like we got ourselves a speed demon here. Sonic, is it? I think I like him already. He's got more guts than most of us put together. Just watch your back, kid. The Zerg ain't to be trifled with."
Kerrigan (again) - "Gods, he's so annoying. Can't he just stay in his own world for once?! Why does he always have to come barging into ours causing chaos and destruction?"
Goldfish - "Ooh, Sonic! He's so fast! I bet he could outrun me any day! *gulps* Uh, what was I just saying? Oh right, Sonic's here. Well, I guess that means more fun for me! Can we play with him now?"
Marine - "What in the hell is this thing? Sonic, is it? I don't know if I should be scared or impressed. But one thing's for sure, he's definitely got some moves. Keep an eye on him, folks."
Kerrigan (for the third time) - "Ugh, seriously? Can't we just leave Sonic alone? He's not our problem. *pouts* Why does he always have to come barging into our lives?"
Tychus - "Sonic? More like Sonic the Menace. Always causing trouble wherever he goes. But you know what? I think I kinda like him. He's got spunk, that one. Let's see if we can't get him to join forces with us."
