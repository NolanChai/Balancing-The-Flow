As I lay in the back seat of the car, feeling the intense labor pains, I couldn't help but think about how this was all happening so suddenly. Just a few days ago, we were all gathered in the clubroom, and now here I was, on my way to the hospital to give birth to Sayori's baby.
I looked over at Emily, who was also experiencing labor pains, and saw her grimacing in pain. She was the only person who knew the truth about MC's betrayal, but she had chosen to forgive him and support him through this difficult time.
As we sped towards the hospital, I could feel the baby moving inside me, and I knew that I had to push through the pain in order to give birth. It was a surreal experience, but one that I knew was necessary for Sayori's dream of motherhood to come true.
I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing, willing myself to push through the pain. And then, suddenly, the baby was crowning, and I felt a rush of excitement and joy as I heard Sayori's voice in my head, urging me to keep going.
With one final push, the baby was born, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was a girl, and she was perfect. I couldn't help but think about how this little girl was a symbol of the bond that we all shared as members of the club, and how she would bring us even closer together.
As we made our way to the hospital, Emily and I held our newborn daughters close, feeling grateful for the unexpected turn of events that had brought us all together. And as we gazed into the eyes of our precious little ones, we knew that this was just the beginning of an amazing journey, one that would fill our hearts with joy and love for years to come.
