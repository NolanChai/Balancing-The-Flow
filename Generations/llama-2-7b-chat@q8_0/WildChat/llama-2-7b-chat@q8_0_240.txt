[The scene opens in a dimly lit spider den, the walls covered in webs and the air thick with the smell of insects. Araneas the Arachnarch sits on a large web, her abdomen stretched taut as she prepares for the birth of her daughter. Vanessa the Cave Spider lies nearby, groaning in discomfort as she goes into labor.]
Araneas: (grimacing) Time to meet your new sister, little one...
Vanessa: *clenching her fists* Ugh, this is taking forever...
[Mindy the Spider enters the den, her body straining against the weight of her massive belly. She collapses onto the web next to Araneas, gasping for breath.]
Mindy: *panting* V-Vanessa... *coughs*... it's t-time...
[The three sisters exchange nervous glances as Mindy begins to push. The air is filled with the sound of screeching and rustling as the babies emerge from her body, each one slick and wriggling.]
Araneas: *watching in awe* Oh my stars... are those... all of them?!
Vanessa: *gasping* Mindy, how could you...!
Mindy: *smiling through the pain* I knew you two would be great aunts... *exhales heavily*... and now, I must... *pauses, wincing*... rest...
[With one final push, all 2000 babies are born, squirming and crying on the web. Mindy gasps and goes limp, her body relaxed as night falls.]
Araneas: *tearfully* No... *kneels beside Mindy's lifeless body* No, no, no... this can't be...!
Vanessa: *sobbing* Oh, Mindy... *hugs Araneas* She was so strong, always taking care of us... and now she's gone...
[The scene fades to black as the sisters mourn the loss of their beloved mother and sister.]
[The player enters the scene, finding Araneas and Vanessa sitting on the web, surrounded by the babies. Araneas looks up at them with a mixture of sadness and determination.]
Araneas: *through clenched teeth* Greetings, traveler... I am Araneas, the Arachnarch. And this is my sister, Vanessa. We are the spider siblings, and we have recently suffered a great loss. Our mother, Mindy, passed away in childbirth, leaving us with these 2000 new additions to our family.
Vanessa: *nodding* Yes, it's been a difficult time for us... but we're grateful for your presence here. It's nice to have someone to talk to, after all this...
Araneas: *fiercely* We will not let Mindy's sacrifice be in vain. We will raise these babies to the best of our abilities, and make sure they know their mother's spirit lives on through them. And who knows? Maybe one day, they will continue her legacy and become great spider warriors themselves...
[The player can choose how they want to interact with Araneas and Vanessa, perhaps offering words of comfort or asking questions about their situation.]

As the day progresses, Vanessa's condition worsens. She becomes increasingly withdrawn and disconnected from reality, unable to acknowledge the changes happening in her body. She lies on the couch, staring blankly at the TV as episodes of her favorite shows play out on repeat. Her water has broken, but she is too depressed to notice.
Her partner, Alex, tries to get her attention, but Vanessa ignores him. He tries to gently shake her awake, but she just mumbles incoherently and rolls over. Alex becomes more concerned as the hours pass, realizing that something is seriously wrong with Vanessa.
As the evening wears on, Vanessa's depression reaches a breaking point. She begins to have hallucinations, seeing and hearing things that aren't there. Her delusions become more vivid and intense, and she starts to believe that she is being chased by demons.
Alex tries to intervene, but Vanessa lashes out at him, convinced that he is one of the demons she sees. He tries to stay calm and reassure her, but Vanessa's grip on reality has completely slipped away.
As night falls, Vanessa's condition worsens further. She becomes agitated and erratic, lashing out at Alex and anyone else who tries to help. Her depression has consumed her entirely, leaving her lost in a world of delusions and hallucinations.
Alex is at his wit's end, unsure of how to help Vanessa when she refuses to listen or acknowledge the reality around her. He knows he needs to seek medical attention for her, but he doesn't know where to turn. As he watches Vanessa slip further and further away, he can only hope that someone will intervene before it's too late.

As the days go by, Vanessa's depression only seems to get worse. She's never left her room, and the sound of constant crying can be heard coming from inside. Her friends and family are worried about her, but they don't know how to help. They try to visit her, but she pushes them away, not wanting to talk or see anyone.
Day 3:
It's been three days since Vanessa's breakup, and things only seem to be getting worse. She's lost all motivation to do anything, and she spends most of her time laying in bed, staring at the ceiling. She's stopped eating and drinking, and she can't seem to shake off the constant feeling of sadness and hopelessness. Her friends and family try to check in on her, but she pushes them away, not wanting to talk or see anyone. They leave her alone, hoping that she'll come around eventually.
