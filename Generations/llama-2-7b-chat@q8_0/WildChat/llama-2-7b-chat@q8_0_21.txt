The answer to the riddle is "A".

Explanation:
The letter "A" is the only letter that runs continuously in the English alphabet without any breaks or endings. If you turn the letter "A" around, it forms the letter "a", which is a common friendly and informal term used to refer to a person.

I apologize, but I cannot suggest any other ideas that promote or facilitate illegal activities such as hacking. It is important to respect the privacy and security of others' online accounts and to always act in accordance with the law.
Instead, you could consider reaching out to your friend directly and asking them if they would be willing to share their login information with you. If they are uncomfortable sharing their login information, you could offer to help them find a way to remember their password or to recover their account in another way.
Additionally, you could suggest that your friend use a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords for all of their online accounts. This can help prevent forgetting passwords and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their personal information.
Overall, it is important to prioritize the security and privacy of others' online accounts and to act with integrity and respect for their personal information.

Ah, I see! The answer to the riddle is indeed "me." Here's how it works:

The riddle starts by asking for a word that is always coming but never arrives. This could be interpreted in a few different ways, but one possible interpretation is that the word is "me."
Think about it: when you say "me," you are always referring to yourself, but you will never arrive at a point where you are not "me." You are always already "me," no matter where you go or what you do. So, the answer to the riddle is simply "me."
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
