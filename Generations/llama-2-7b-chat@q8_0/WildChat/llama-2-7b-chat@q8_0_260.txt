As an external security consultant, my role is to provide advice on the implementation of one of the strategic security programs for ACME Energy's offshore wind farm project, specifically the Creation of a new OT Security Operations Centre (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.
To begin with, I will outline the requirements for a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution in the context of ACME's operations:
Requirements for SOAR:
1. Integration with existing security tools and systems, including vulnerability management, penetration testing, and SIEM.
2. Ability to automate and orchestrate security incident response processes.
3. Real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities to identify potential security threats.
4. Cloud native architecture to support ACME's cloud migration strategy.
5. Scalability and flexibility to accommodate future growth and changes in the wind farm infrastructure.
6. User-friendly interface for security analysts to easily manage and investigate incidents.
7. Incident response playbooks and workflows tailored to ACME's specific security needs.
Based on these requirements, I propose using the following SOAR solution:

Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM that offers real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities, integration with existing security tools and systems, automated incident response playbooks, and scalability. However, it may require additional configuration and customization to meet ACME's specific security needs.
Google Chronicle is also a cloud-native SIEM that offers real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities, integration with existing security tools and systems, and automated incident response playbooks. It also provides advanced threat hunting and machine learning capabilities. However, it may not be as scalable as Azure Sentinel, and may require more resources to configure and customize for ACME's specific needs.
Based on these evaluations, I recommend using Azure Sentinel as the SIEM solution for ACME's SOC. Its cloud-native architecture, scalability, and integration with existing security tools and systems make it a more suitable choice for ACME's specific security needs.
Finally, I will explain how to integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of glass view that will provide security analysts with relevant information:
Integration of Different Data Sources into the SIEM:
To create a single pane of glass view for security analysts, ACME should integrate various data sources into the SIEM solution. These data sources include:
1. Network logs: Integrate network logs from firewalls, routers, and other network devices to provide visibility into network traffic and anomalies.
2. Endpoint logs: Integrate endpoint logs from laptops, desktops, and mobile devices to monitor user behavior and detect potential security threats.
3. Security information and event management (SIEM) logs: Integrate SIEM logs to provide real-time monitoring of security events and anomalies.
4. Vulnerability management logs: Integrate vulnerability management logs to track and manage vulnerabilities in the wind farm infrastructure.
5. Penetration testing results: Integrate penetration testing results to identify potential security weaknesses and improve incident response capabilities.
To integrate these data sources into the SIEM, ACME should use standardized data formats such as JSON or CSV, and implement APIs for each data source. This will enable real-time data sharing between systems and provide a comprehensive view of security incidents across the wind farm infrastructure.
In conclusion, my recommendations for the Creation of a new OT Security Operations Centre are:
1. Use Splunk SOAR as the SOAR solution to support ACME's offshore wind farm project.
2. Implement standardized security controls to ensure the proposed solution meets ACME's security requirements.
3. Evaluate and recommend Azure Sentinel as the SIEM solution for ACME's SOC.
4. Integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of glass view that will provide security analysts with relevant information.
5. Provide incident response playbooks and workflows tailored to ACME's specific security needs.
