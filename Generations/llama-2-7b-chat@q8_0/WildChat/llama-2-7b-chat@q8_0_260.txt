StarCraft Characters' Reactions to Sonic the Hedgehog:

1. Jim Raynor: "Sonic?! What the hell is that thing?!" (confused and wary)
2. Kerrigan: "A...a blue, rotund creature with spikes? Impressive. But don't try any funny business with my Zerg, Sonic. I have a job to do here." (curious but firm)
3. Arcturus Mengsk: "Ah, another...ahem...'hero'. How quaint. (Sonic) amuses me. I have more important things to attend to than your little blue friend." (distracted and dismissive)
4. Tassadar: "Sonic...a being of pure speed and agility. Fascinating. But I fear you are no match for the Dark Templars, Sonic. We will not be distracted by your antics." (interested but unimpressed)
5. Nova Terra: "H-hey, what's up, dude?! (Sonic) is like, totally gnarly and all! Can you like, race or something? I bet you're way faster than me!" (excited and eager)
6. Zeratul: "The...Sonic...creature. (Pauses) Fascinating. A being of pure chaos, unrestricted by the constraints of the Protoss. How...intriguing." (curious and thoughtful)
7. Raynor's Oldest Daughter: "Ew, Sonic?! You're so...gross! And what's with all those spikes?! (Runs away in fear)

1. Zerg Drone: "Sonic?! What...thing...is that?! *Shudders* It looks like it was made for chaos and destruction!" (fearful and agitated)
2. Terran Marine: "Whoa, Sonic?! That's one weird-lookin' dude. I ain't sure if I want to race him or run away from him." (confused and wary)
3. Protoss Zealot: "Sonic...*Sigh*...yet another abomination that threatens the balance of the universe. We must not let it corrupt our pure minds with its frivolous speed." (dismayed and disapproving)
4. Orca: "Sonic?! Who's that?! *Chuckles* Oh, you're just a little blue guy running around in circles? (Laughs) You're not even worth my attention, Sonic." (amused but unimpressed)
5. Golem: "Hmm...Sonic...*Sniffs* You smell like a creature from another world. Fascinating. Perhaps you could teach me some new moves?" (curious and open-minded)
