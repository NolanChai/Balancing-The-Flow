Here's a corrected version of your email:

Hi Crystal,

May I confirm if HR will upload the business objectives to my performance goals for tracking? Or do I need to fill that in myself? My line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct. Thanks.

Best regards,
Jimmy

Here is a corrected version of the email with some minor grammatical errors and typos corrected:

Hi Crystal,

May I confirm if HR will upload the business objective goals to my performance goals for tracking or I still need to fill that in myself? Because My line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct. Thanks.

Best regards,
Jimmy

Here are some of the errors and typos corrected:

* "May I confirm if HR will upload" should be "May I confirm whether HR will upload".
* "coz" should be "because".
* "My line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct" should be "My line manager has already assigned five performance goals in HR Direct".

Here is a corrected version of the sentence:
"May I confirm whether HR will upload the business objectives to my performance goals for tracking, or do I still need to enter the business objectives in the spreadsheet myself if I have already entered them in HR Direct? My line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct. Thank you."
Here are some of the grammar and spelling corrections I made:
* "May I confirm if" should be "May I confirm whether"
* "HR will upload" should be "Will HR upload"
* "do I still need to fill" should be "do I still need to enter"
* "goals in the spreadsheet by myself" should be "business objectives in the spreadsheet myself"
* "Thanks." is not necessary and can be removed.

Here are a few corrections to the sentence you provided:

* "Since" should be "Since."
* "Crystal is on leave till this Friday" should be "Crystal is on leave until this Friday."
* "Will back next Mon" should be "Will be back next Monday."

Here's how the corrected sentence might look:

"Since Crystal is on leave until this Friday, shall we still meet tomorrow for our discussion?"
