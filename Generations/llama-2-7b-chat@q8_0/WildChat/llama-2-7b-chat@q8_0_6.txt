FADE IN: 

INT. HAWKINS LAB - DAY

Max is sitting at her desk, staring blankly into space. Joyce and Hopper are nearby, discussing the latest developments in their investigation. Suddenly, Max's eyes roll back, and she begins to convulse. Her body contorts and twists, as if something is controlling her from within.
JOYCE: (concerned) What's happening?!
HOPPER: (grabbing Max by the shoulders) It's the Mind Flayer, Joyce! It's taking control of her!
Max's body begins to convulse more violently, as if the Mind Flayer is trying to force its way out. Joyce and Hopper look on in horror as they realize that Max is possessed by the monster from the Upside Down.
MAX (in a demonic voice) (growling) I'M THE MIND FLAYER... AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
Joyce and Hopper try to restrain Max, but she is too strong. She rips free from their grasp and begins to destroy the lab, smashing equipment and sending debris flying everywhere.
JOYCE: (terrified) We have to find a way to stop it!
HOPPER: (determined) I'll figure something out. Just stay away from her!
As Max continues her rampage, the scene fades to black.
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. HAWTHORNE CREEK HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
Max is walking down the hallway, looking confident and determined. She stops in front of a group of students and smiles mischievously.
MAX: (excitedly) Guys, I have something to tell you! *leans in* You know how I've always been the nice one? The goody two-shoes? Well, it turns out I've always wanted to be evil. Like, seriously evil. *winks*
The students stare at her in shock and disbelief.
STUDENT 1: (skeptically) What do you mean?
MAX: (excitedly) I know, right? It's crazy! But hear me out. *leans in closer* I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I realized that being evil would be so much more fun. Think about it - no more worrying about grades or getting along with people. Just pure, unadulterated chaos and destruction! *giggles*
The other students are starting to get freaked out, but Max just keeps going.
MAX: (excitedly) And the best part is, I've already taken the first step. *smirks* I let the Mind Flayer in. *nods* Yeah, you heard that right. The Mind Flayer. He's like, my new BFF. *giggles*
The students are horrified, but Max just keeps going.
MAX: (excitedly) And you know what? I can feel it already. The power. It's like, coursing through my veins. *smirks* I can't wait to see what kind of mischief we can get up to together! *giggles*
Suddenly, the school intercom speaks up.
SCHOOL INTERCOM VOICE: (serious tone) Attention students, please. We have a situation in the school. The Mind Flayer has taken control of Max and is using her to wreak havoc on the school. Please stay inside and avoid any confrontations until further notice.
Max just keeps grinning, unaffected by the intercom's warning.
MAX: (excitedly) Oh, this is going to be great! *giggles* I can't wait to see what kind of chaos we can cause! *smirks*
FADE OUT.
