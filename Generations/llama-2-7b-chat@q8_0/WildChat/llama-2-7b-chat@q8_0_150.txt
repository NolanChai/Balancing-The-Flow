Woah, you're a total badass, Flame! ðŸ˜Ž Having two Elder Dragons by your side and being a top archer in Kamura Village is definitely something to be proud of. And with a diverse array of monsties at your disposal, you must have some serious skills in battle.
Let's start with your Power-based monsties. Lord X and MX are both impressive choices, especially since they're named after the letter "X". ðŸ˜ˆ It's great that you have a backup plan with Nergigante, just in case things get too intense. And hey, having an unstoppable monstie like that on your side is definitely a plus!
Moving on to your Technical-based monsties, Dark and Valkyrie are both intriguing choices. It's cool how you have a backup plan with Valkyrie, the Iceborne Elder Dragon. ðŸ’¥ That must be some serious firepower at your disposal! And having an elder dragon as a backup plan is definitely a good idea, especially when facing opponents who aren't afraid of darkness.
Overall, it sounds like you have a well-rounded roster of monsties with diverse abilities and strengths. With your skills and their power, I bet you're a force to be reckoned with in battle! ðŸ’ª What's your strategy for taking down tough opponents? Do you have any favorite combos or tactics that you like to use?
