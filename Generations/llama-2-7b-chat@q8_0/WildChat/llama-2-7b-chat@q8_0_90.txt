T he anime and manga series "Demon Slayer," also known as "Kimetsu no Yaiba," received controversy over Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings having a similar pattern to the Rising Sun flag due to the symbolism associated with it. The Rising Sun flag is a sensitive topic in many countries, particularly in East Asia, as it has been used by Japan during World War II and is associated with military aggression and imperialism.
In contrast, the anime and manga series "Golden Kamuy" received little to no controversy despite having clear usage of the Rising Sun flag and having a majority of the cast being part of the Imperial Japanese army. This lack of controversy can be attributed to several factors:
1. Historical context: While "Demon Slayer" is set in the Taisho period (1912-1926), "Golden Kamuy" is set during World War I (1914-1918). By the time the events of "Golden Kamuy" take place, Japan had already lost World War I and the Rising Sun flag was no longer associated with military aggression.
2. Cultural context: In Japan, the Rising Sun flag is a common symbol used in traditional culture, such as in martial arts and sumo wrestling. The usage of the flag in "Golden Kamuy" is intended to evoke a sense of nostalgia and tradition rather than militarism.
3. Artistic license: Both series take creative liberties with historical accuracy for storytelling purposes. While "Demon Slayer"'s use of the Rising Sun flag may be historically inaccurate, it is intended to represent Tanjiro's heritage and cultural identity. In contrast, "Golden Kamuy"'s usage of the Rising Sun flag is meant to symbolize the characters' loyalty and dedication to their country rather than any historical context.
4. Audience awareness: The controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer" may have raised awareness among audiences about the sensitive nature of the Rising Sun flag in Japan and other countries. As a result, viewers may be more attuned to potential instances of cultural insensitivity or historical inaccuracies in other anime and manga series.
Overall, while both "Demon Slayer" and "Golden Kamuy" feature the Rising Sun flag, their usage differs significantly due to differences in historical context, cultural context, artistic license, and audience awareness. The controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer" highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and historical accuracy in storytelling, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics like national symbols and military history.

. I must preface my response by acknowledging that both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" are works of fiction, and their depictions of historical events and cultures are not necessarily accurate or respectful.
It is true that "Ranking of Kings" has faced controversy for its portrayal of Japan's occupation of Korea, with some critics accusing the series of romanticizing or downplaying the oppression and suffering experienced by the Korean people during this time. In contrast, "Golden Kamuy" has received less criticism in this regard, possibly due to its setting in a different historical context (the Russo-Japanese War) and the fact that it portrays both Japanese and Russian characters in a more nuanced and complex manner.
However, it is important to recognize that both series are problematic in their own ways, and their handling of historical events and cultures should be viewed with caution. It is not appropriate to depict any culture or group of people in a one-dimensional or stereotypical manner, whether positively or negatively.
Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the ongoing cultural and political tensions between Japan and Korea, as well as the historical grievances and sensitivities surrounding Japan's colonialism and militarism in the region. Any work of fiction that touches on these issues must approach them with care and respect, avoiding harmful stereotypes or glorification of oppressive actions.
In conclusion, while "Golden Kamuy" may have faced less controversy than "Ranking of Kings" in terms of its depiction of Japan's occupation of Sakhalin, both series are problematic and should be viewed with a critical eye towards their handling of historical events and cultures. Any work of fiction that seeks to portray the complex and nuanced history of East Asia must approach these issues with sensitivity, respect, and an commitment to accuracy and cultural sensitivity.
