Not necessarily. The number of upvotes and the upvote percentage are just two metrics that can give an idea of how well a Reddit post performed, but there are other factors to consider as well:
1. Comment count: Even if the post didn't receive many upvotes, it could still have generated a lot of comments, which can indicate that it sparked interest and discussion among users.
2. Engagement rate: The engagement rate of a Reddit post is calculated by dividing the number of interactions (upvotes, comments, etc.) by the number of unique viewers. Even if a post doesn't receive many upvotes, it could still have a high engagement rate if users are actively interacting with it.
3. Content quality: The content of the post itself can also impact how well it performs on Reddit. If the post is well-written, informative, or entertaining, it may receive more upvotes and comments even if the overall percentage is lower.
4. Subreddit popularity: The subreddit where the post was shared can also impact its performance. Some subreddits are more active and have a larger following than others, so a post with the same number of upvotes might perform better in a more popular subreddit.
5. Time of posting: The time when the post was shared can also play a role in how well it performs. If the post is shared during a time when the subreddit is particularly active or during a Reddit event, it may receive more attention and upvotes than if it were posted at a less busy time.
In conclusion, while a low upvote percentage and a small number of comments can indicate that a Reddit post wasn't well-received, there are many other factors to consider as well. It's important to take into account the context of the subreddit, the quality of the content, and the timing of the post when evaluating its performance.
