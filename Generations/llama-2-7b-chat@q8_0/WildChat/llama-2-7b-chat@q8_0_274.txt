Earth is the third planet from the Sun in the solar system and the only known planet to support life. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is composed of rock and metal and has a solid surface. Earth is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from the Sun and has a diameter of about 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers).
Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is divided into seven continents, including Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Earth has five oceans: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Southern Ocean.
Earth's rotation is 24 hours, and its orbit around the Sun takes about 365.25 days. The planet experiences seasons due to its tilt on its axis, which is approximately 23.5 degrees. Earth also has a magnetic field, which protects it from harmful solar radiation and charged particles.
Earth's biosphere is home to a vast array of living organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. The planet's ecosystems support a rich variety of habitats, such as forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, and more. Earth is also home to a diverse range of species, with estimates suggesting that there are between 8.7 million and 30 million different species on the planet.
Humans are one of the many species that call Earth home. Our species, Homo sapiens, evolved on this planet around 200,000 years ago and has since developed complex societies, cultures, and technologies. Today, there are over 7.9 billion people living on Earth, with most of us inhabiting cities and relying on technology to support our daily lives.
Overall, Earth is a unique and fascinating planet that supports an incredible array of life forms and ecosystems. Its distance from the Sun, atmosphere, magnetic field, and tilt on its axis all contribute to making it an hospitable environment for life to thrive.
