As you continue to explore the forest-like place, you can't help but feel a sense of familiarity with it. It's almost as if this is a less technologically advanced version of Fear Factory, the labyrinthine facility where you and your friends are frequent visitors.
"Do you guys feel a sense of familiarity coming from this island?" Archeogiana asks, breaking the silence. "Or is it just me?"
Eye of Kingthulhu nods in agreement. "Yeah, this does look like Fear Factory, but less technologically advanced."
Necrohemoth rolls his eyes. "Well, you can't blame the Sculk-elemental Blacksight. Eye of Kingthulhu, just because you're the Creation-elemental Blacksight doesn't mean that you created this." He shoots a sideways glance at Archeogiana. "And Archeogiana, I don't want to see any chaos from this point."
Archeogiana pouts and crosses her arms, looking slightly offended. "Seriously? You expect me, the Chaos-elemental Blacksight, to not cause chaos? It's literally MY thing, you know."
Just as she speaks, Archeogiana doubles over in pain and collapses onto your back.
