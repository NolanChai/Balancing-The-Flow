Safi'jiiva watched as Alice writhed in pain, her massive belly glowing with a strange light. The other students were panicking, trying to figure out what was wrong with their classmate. Safi'jiiva felt a pang of confusion and worry - he had never seen anything like this before.
As the teacher rushed to Alice's desk, Safi'jiiva couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. What could be causing this? He had always been the outcast at school, the only dragon in a sea of humans. But now, it seemed that even the humans were afraid of something - or someone.
As the teacher tried to tend to Alice, Safi'jiiva couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. What was happening to her? And why was she still bullying him, despite whatever was wrong with her?
The rest of the day passed in a blur of confusion and fear. Safi'jiiva tried to focus on his schoolwork, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was very wrong. And as he watched Alice struggle through the day, he couldn't help but wonder if this was all connected - if there was some deeper mystery at play here.
But for now, Safi'jiiva could only sit and wait, watching as the events of the day unfolded around him. He was a dragon, after all - and he had always been better at waiting than anything else.
