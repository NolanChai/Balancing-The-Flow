The correct answer is: True.

The USDA has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, including the investigation of genetically engineered crops. The agrobacterium method for delivering transgenes and some of the genetic elements delivered are from plant pathogens, which falls under the jurisdiction of the USDA. Therefore, investigation of genetically engineered crops originally fell to the USDA.

The correct answer is: True.

The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, which includes the investigation of genetically engineered crops. The agrobacterium method for delivering transgenes and some of the genetic elements delivered are from plant pathogens, so the USDA has a role in regulating these crops.

The correct answer is: True.

Electroporation is indeed an ex vivo and non-viral delivery method, meaning it is performed outside of living cells rather than inside the cell itself. On the other hand, adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a viral delivery method that can be used in vivo, meaning inside living cells. So, this comparison is accurate.
