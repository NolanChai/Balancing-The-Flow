This error message indicates that Torch is unable to find the `ninja` package, which is required to load C++ extensions. The `utils/utils.so` file is also not found, which is a shared object file required by Torch. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:
1. Install the `ninja` package:
You can install `ninja` using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install ninja
```
2. Check if `ninja` is installed:

If `ninja` is not installed, you can try installing it using the following command:
```
pip install --upgrade ninja
```
3. Set the PATH environment variable:

You may need to set the `PATH` environment variable to include the directory where `ninja` is installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
export PATH=/path/to/ninja/bin:$PATH
```
Replace `/path/to/ninja/bin` with the actual path where `ninja` is installed.
4. Check if the C++ extensions are installed:

Make sure that the C++ extensions are installed and linked correctly. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
torch-mode --cpp_ext
```
If the C++ extensions are not installed or linked correctly, you may need to reinstall them using the following command:
```
pip install torchvision --cpp_ext
```
5. Check if the `utils/utils.so` file is in the correct directory:

Make sure that the `utils/utils.so` file is located in the directory where Torch is installed. By default, Torch is installed in `/usr/local`, so you can check if the `utils/utils.so` file is in this directory. If it's not there, you may need to reinstall Torch or move the file to the correct location.
6. Try restarting your machine:

Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve issues like these. Try closing and opening your terminal, then running your script again.
If none of these steps work, you can try searching for more detailed solutions online or seeking help from the Torch community.
