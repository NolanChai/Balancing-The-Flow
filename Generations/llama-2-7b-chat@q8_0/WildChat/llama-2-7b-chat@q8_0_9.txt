Here's a possible scene for Stranger Things Season 4, Episode 7:

INT. HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY - DAY
Max (played by Sadie Sink) is sitting in the Hawkins National Laboratory, looking through some old files on the Mind Flayer. She's trying to find any information she can about the creature and how it might be able to possess people. As she reads through the files, Max suddenly starts to feel strange.
MAX: (confused) What's happening? It feels like... like something is inside my head.
JIM HARSHaw (played by Joe Keery): (concerned) Max, are you okay? You look a little pale.
MAX: (staring off into space) I don't know... everything seems so... distant. And the voices... they're getting louder.
Jim and the other scientists exchange concerned glances as Max starts to slur her words and stumble around the room. Suddenly, she lets out a blood-curdling scream and falls to the ground, convulsing.
JIM: (panicked) We need to get her out of here! The Mind Flayer is taking control of her!
The scientists rush Max out of the lab and into an ambulance, but as they drive away, we see that Max's body is no longer moving. Her eyes are rolled back in her head, and her mouth is open in a grotesque grimace. The Mind Flayer has fully possessed Max.
CUT TO:
INT. THE UPSIDE DOWN - DAY
The Mind Flayer is now controlling Max's body, and it's wreaking havoc on the Upside Down. It starts to summon more and more creatures from the Upside Down, creating a swirling vortex of darkness that threatens to consume everything in its path. The Mind Flayer is determined to take over the world of the living, and it will stop at nothing to achieve its goal.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY - DAY
The scientists are frantically trying to find a way to stop the Mind Flayer from possessing Max. They perform some kind of ritual, but it's clear that they're running out of time. The Mind Flayer is too powerful, and it's only a matter of time before it takes over completely.
MAX: (in a voice that's not quite her own) I... I can feel it... the Mind Flayer... it's inside me... and it's going to destroy everything.
The scene ends with Max's possessed body standing in the middle of the lab, surrounded by the scientists who are trying to save her. But it's clear that they may be too late. The Mind Flayer is closing in on its next victim, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.

INT. HAWTHORNE CREEK HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Max is walking down the hallway, looking confident and determined. She stops in front of a group of students who are whispering and snickering.
MAX: (smirking) Hey, what's all the commotion about?
STUDENT 1: (nervously) Uh, nothing much. Just talking about how creepy Mrs. Wong's new student is. (glances at Max)
MAX: (chuckling) Oh, you mean me? (winks) Don't worry about me. I'm not as scary as you think. (leaning in) In fact, I've always wanted to be evil. (smiling mischievously)
The students gasp and step back, horrified. Max takes pleasure in their reactions, enjoying the fear she has inspired.
MAX: (in a low, sultry voice) Yes, you heard that right. I've always wanted to be evil. And guess what? I've given myself to the Mind Flayer. (smirking) He's my new best friend. ( holds up her hand, revealing a small tattoo of the Mind Flayer's symbol)
The students scramble away, terrified, as Max walks off with a satisfied smile on her face.
FADE OUT.
