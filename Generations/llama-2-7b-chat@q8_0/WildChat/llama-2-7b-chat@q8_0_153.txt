When you measure a gray card or an 18% gray object under a camera, it means that the card or object reflects 18% of the light that hits it. This is a standard reference point for exposure measurement and adjustment.
If you set your camera's exposure compensation to +2 stops and take a photo of an 18% gray card or object, the resulting image will not make the object white. Exposure compensation adjusts the overall brightness of the image, but it does not change the color of the objects in the image.
In fact, if you apply +2 stops of exposure compensation to an 18% gray card or object, the resulting image will likely be closer to 14% gray (which is 1 stop darker than 18% gray). This is because the camera's sensor is more sensitive to light than the human eye, so it will capture a slightly darker image than what we see with our eyes.
To make an 18% gray object appear white in an image, you would need to adjust the exposure compensation to a value that is lower than +2 stops. The exact amount of exposure compensation needed depends on the specific lighting conditions and the desired brightness of the final image. A good starting point for most scenes is to set the exposure compensation to 0 stops, which will result in a neutral gray object in the image. If the object appears too dark, you can adjust the exposure compensation upward (towards +1 or +2 stops) to brighten it.
