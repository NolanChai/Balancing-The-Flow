The correct answer is (b) transitions. The first paragraph of an essay typically sets the stage for the rest of the essay by providing background information, establishing the context, and introducing the main idea or thesis statement. Transition words and phrases are used to connect ideas, signal a shift in focus, and guide the reader through the essay.

Great! Let's break down the components of an essay further:

a. Supportive Ideas: These are the ideas that support the main idea or thesis statement. They can be examples, facts, statistics, quotes, or other pieces of evidence that help to prove or illustrate the main point.
b. Transitions: These are the words or phrases that connect one idea to another. They help to flow of the essay and make it easier for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought. Some common transitional words include "however," "in addition," "nevertheless," and "therefore."
c. Details: These are the specific pieces of information that support the main idea. They can be examples, statistics, or other evidence that help to prove or illustrate the point.
d. Body Paragraphs: These are the main sections of the essay where all the key ideas and supporting details are discussed. Each body paragraph typically begins with a topic sentence that expresses the main idea or central focus of the paragraph, followed by supporting details and evidence that help to prove or illustrate the point.
e. Thesis Statement: This is the main idea or central focus of the essay, stated in a concise and clear manner. It is usually the first sentence of the introduction and sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
f. Topic Sentence: This is the sentence that introduces the topic of each body paragraph. It provides a brief overview of what will be covered in the paragraph and helps to guide the reader through the essay.
g. Background: This is the first part of the introduction that provides some general information about the topic. It can include historical context, definitions, or other background details that help to set the stage for the rest of the essay.
h. Introduction: This is the first part of the essay where the writer introduces the topic and gives some general information about it. It typically includes a thesis statement, topic sentence, background, and any other relevant details.
