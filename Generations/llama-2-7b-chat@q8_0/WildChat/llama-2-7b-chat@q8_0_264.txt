It is possible for someone to have a strong affection for their children and still exhibit narcissistic traits or behaviors. Narcissism is a personality disorder that is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. While it is common for parents to have strong feelings of love and attachment towards their children, this does not necessarily mean that they are immune from developing narcissistic tendencies.
Some ways in which a mother might exhibit narcissistic traits while still loving her children include:
1. Prioritizing her own needs and desires above those of her children: A narcissist may prioritize their own wants and needs over those of their loved ones, including their children. This can manifest in things like ignoring a child's needs or feelings to focus on their own desires, or using the children as a means to an end (e.g., gaining attention or validation).
2. Using her children as a source of supply: A narcissist may use their children as a source of supply, which can include emotional support, admiration, and validation. This can involve using the child's achievements or successes to boost the mother's own self-esteem, or seeking out excessive praise and attention from the child.
3. Being overly critical or demanding: A narcissist may have unrealistic expectations for their children, and may be overly critical or demanding of them in order to maintain a sense of control and validation. This can involve setting unreasonable standards for the child's behavior or achievements, or constantly criticizing them for not meeting these standards.
4. Being dismissive of the child's feelings: A narcissist may be dismissive of their children's feelings or needs, and may prioritize their own emotional well-being above those of their loved ones. This can involve ignoring the child's concerns or dismissing them as unimportant, or minimizing the child's feelings in order to maintain a sense of control and dominance.
It is important to note that not all parents who exhibit narcissistic traits are necessarily bad or abusive. However, if these behaviors are causing harm to the child or damaging their self-esteem, it may be worth seeking professional help to address them.
