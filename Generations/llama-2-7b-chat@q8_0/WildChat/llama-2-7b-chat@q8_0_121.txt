"Hmm, something's off," Amber mutters to herself as she checks on her belly. She can't quite put her finger on it, but something about the way her daughter is moving inside of her feels different.
She tries to shake off the feeling and tells herself that she's just being paranoid. After all, she's been pregnant for months now and everything seems fine. But as the days go by, Amber can't help but feel a growing sense of unease.
"Maybe I should check with a doctor," she thinks to herself, considering whether or not she should make an appointment. But she's hesitant to worry about it too much, afraid that she might be overreacting.
As she gets dressed and heads out the door for her day in Mondstadt, Amber can't help but feel a sense of dread hanging over her. She tries to push it aside and focus on the tasks at hand, but the feeling persists, lurking in the back of her mind like a dark cloud.
(As she walks through the city, Amber can't help but notice that people are staring at her. At first, she thinks it might be because she's pregnant and drawing attention to herself, but then she realizes that something else is off.)
