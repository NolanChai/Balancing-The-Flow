Note: The market size and growth rates mentioned in the sources may vary slightly due to differences in data sources, methods of calculation, and time periods considered. However, these sources are generally reputable and provide a good overview of the markets for men's permanent and semi-permanent hair dye worldwide.

The use of men's hair dye, particularly for beards and scalp hair, is not as common in Brazil when compared to other parts of the world. In fact, Brazil has a unique culture surrounding grooming and personal appearance, which may contribute to this difference. Here are some insights into why men's hair dye is less popular in Brazil:
1. Cultural influence: Brazil has a strong Afro-Brazilian heritage, and many Black Brazilians have traditionally embraced their natural hair textures and afros as a symbol of pride and identity. This cultural background may contribute to a lower adoption rate of men's hair dye in Brazil compared to other parts of the world.
2. Hair care practices: In Brazil, traditional hair care practices often involve using natural ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and henna to nourish and protect the hair. Men may be less likely to use commercial hair dyes if they are already using these natural products as part of their grooming routine.
3. Fear of stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding men's hair dye in Brazilian culture, particularly among Black communities where Afro-textured hair is highly valued and seen as a symbol of beauty and identity. Men may be reluctant to use hair dye due to concerns about societal norms and expectations around masculinity.
4. Availability and affordability: In Brazil, men's hair dye products are not always readily available or affordable for everyone, particularly in smaller cities or rural areas. This lack of access could contribute to lower adoption rates compared to other parts of the world where these products are more widely available and marketed.
5. Other beauty trends: In recent years, Brazil has seen a rise in popularity surrounding natural beauty products and trends like minimal makeup and embracing one's natural appearance. This movement may have contributed to a lower demand for men's hair dye among Brazilians who are more focused on natural and organic grooming practices.
6. Market competition: The Brazilian market is highly competitive, with many established players in the beauty industry. Local brands that cater specifically to Afro-textured hair may have a stronger presence than international brands offering men's hair dye products. This local competition could lead to lower adoption rates among Brazilians who prefer to support domestic brands and products more tailored to their needs and cultural background.
7. Education and awareness: Men in Brazil may be less aware of the benefits and options available when it comes to men's hair dye. This lack of education could contribute to lower adoption rates as men may not understand how or why they should use these products, or may have concerns about their safety or effectiveness.
8. Personal preferences: Ultimately, personal preferences play a significant role in any beauty trend, including the use of men's hair dye. Brazilians may simply prefer to embrace their natural hair textures and avoid using chemical-based products for various reasons, such as concerns about health or environmental impacts.
In conclusion, while the use of men's hair dye is not uncommon globally, it is less popular in Brazil compared to other parts of the world due to a combination of cultural, historical, and socioeconomic factors. Addressing these underlying reasons could help increase adoption rates among Brazilians who are interested in this trend but may be deterred by various barriers to entry.
