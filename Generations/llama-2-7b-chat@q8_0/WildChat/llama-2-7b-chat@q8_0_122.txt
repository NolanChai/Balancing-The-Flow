(The scene fades back in, and we see John sitting in the same position as before, but now he's staring intently at the TV. The only lighting comes from a blue glow emanating from the screen and the static of an old TV tuned to an unusual channel.)
John: (muttering to himself) This is strange. I've never seen anything like it before. It's like they're trying to send me a message, but I can't quite decipher it. (pauses) Wait a minute... what's that? (looks closer at the TV) Is that... could it be... "Pylons"? (excitedly) Yes, it is! One of the new ident sequences is on! (leaning forward) I wonder what it means. (continues to stare intently at the TV, mesmerized by the blue light and static.)
(The scene remains static for a few moments, with only the sound of John's heavy breathing and the faint hum of the TV in the background. The blue light flickers slightly, casting eerie shadows on the walls around him. As the tension builds, it becomes clear that John is not alone in the room.)
(Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness, their face obscured by a hood. They approach John slowly, their eyes fixed intently on the TV. The figure reaches out a hand and touches John's shoulder, causing him to jump with a startled yelp.)
Figure: (in a low, raspy voice) Hello, John. We've been waiting for you. (pauses) You see, we know all about your fascination with the TV static. And we have a message of our own that we want to share with you... (leans in closer) Are you ready to hear it?
