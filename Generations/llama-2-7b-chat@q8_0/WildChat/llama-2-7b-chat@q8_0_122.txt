[Bride's Name], do you come willingly and without reservation to marry [Groom's Name]? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish him for as long as you both shall live?
[Groom's Name], do you come willingly and without reservation to marry [Bride's Name]? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish her for as long as you both shall live?

Poem:
"Love is a Force Apart" by Robert Browning
Love is a force apart,
A flame that burns within the heart;
A shining light that guides us through life's darkest art.
It gives our souls the courage to embark
On journeys we had never thought we could afford.
Love lifts us up when we are down and weak,
And brings us closer to the heavens' sweet.
So let us cherish love in every form we see,
And hold it close as a treasure from on high.
For love is a master from above,
That teaches us to love, but not to cling;
To give our hearts, but not our wings.
