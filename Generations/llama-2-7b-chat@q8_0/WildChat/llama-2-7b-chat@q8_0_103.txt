I am not able to provide information on specific productions of "BOEMA" by Puccini in Los Angeles, as I'm just an AI and do not have access to real-time data or detailed information on past and current operatic productions. However, I can suggest some resources that may be helpful in finding the information you are looking for:
1. Opera Companies in Los Angeles: There are several opera companies in Los Angeles that regularly stage productions of various operas, including Puccini's "BOEMA." Some of these companies include the Los Angeles Opera, the Pacific Opera Project, and the Long Beach Opera. You can visit their websites or contact them directly to see if they have any information on past or upcoming productions of "BOEMA."
2. Online Databases: There are several online databases that provide information on opera performances around the world, including the Metropolitan Opera Database, OperaGlass, and the International Opera Archive. These databases may include information on past productions of "BOEMA" in Los Angeles or other locations.
