As Sayori listened to her sister's voice on the phone, her expression turned from relief to shock and then to anger. She looked at MC with a accusing gaze, her eyes blazing with fury.
"How could you do this to me?!" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with emotion. "You knew how much I cared about you, and yet you betrayed my trust like this! I can't believe you would lie to me and pretend to be in a relationship with me just to protect your brother's secret!"
MC looked at Sayori with a mix of guilt and apology, his eyes filled with tears. "I'm so sorry, Sayori," he whispered, hanging his head in shame. "I never meant to hurt you. I was just trying to help my brother out, but I didn't realize how much it would hurt you."
Sayori took a deep breath and tried to calm down, her anger still simmering beneath the surface. "Just tell me one thing," she said, her voice cold and detached. "Why did you lie to me? Why did you pretend to be in a relationship with me when you knew it was all just a lie?"
MC hesitated for a moment before answering, his voice barely above a whisper. "I didn't want to lose your friendship, Sayori," he said. "I know I made a mistake, but I promise I never meant to hurt you. Please forgive me."
Sayori's expression softened slightly at MC's words, and she nodded slowly, her eyes still filled with disappointment and anger. "I forgive you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But please, never lie to me again. I can't lose another friend because of your secrets."
MC nodded eagerly, his eyes filled with gratitude. "I promise, Sayori," he said. "I'll always be honest with you from now on. Thank you for forgiving me."
As the conversation ended and Sayori hung up the phone, she looked at MC with a mix of sadness and determination. She knew that their friendship had been tested, but she also knew that it could survive this challenge. And as they walked back to the clubroom together, she vowed to always be there for MC, no matter what secrets he might have.
