The inscription from Dion in Macedonia, dated to the imperial period, mentions a name based on Hermanubis, specifically Ἑρμα-νούβιοϲ. This form of the name is not known from Egypt, where the cult of Hermanubis originated. However, a third-century dedication in Thessalonike, across the Thermaic golf from Dion, suggests that a cultic association of Hermanubis existed and was supported by certain individuals. Additionally, a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage (LIMC n. 15) also attests to the popularity of the cult outside its original home in the Roman period.
