INT. JANEâ€™S HOUSE - DAY

Jane and her family are sitting in the living room when they hear a commotion outside. They look out the window to see police cars and ambulances parked outside.
JANE: (excited) What's going on?!
ANDREA: (calmly) I think it's me. *turns to face her family* I got arrested.
MOM: (shocked) Andrea! Why?!
ANDREA: (sighs) It's a long story, but basically, I was at the protest again and things got out of hand.
DAD: (concerned) Is everything okay, sweetie? Are you hurt?
ANDREA: (shakes her head) No, I'm fine. Just a little... bruised. *looks at Jane* Sorry, kiddo. I didn't want to get arrested in front of you, but sometimes these things happen.
JANE: (confused) But why were you protesting again?! You said you weren't going to!
ANDREA: (hesitates) I know, Jane. And I shouldn't have gone. But sometimes it feels like no one is listening to us and we need to take drastic measures to get our point across. *looks at her family* I know this isn't the right way to do things, but I can't just sit back and watch while our rights are being taken away.
MOM: (tearfully) Andrea, please be careful! We don't want anything to happen to you!
ANDREA: (smiles weakly) *hugs her mom* I will, Mom. I promise. But sometimes, for the greater good, we have to take risks. *looks at Jane* You know, kiddo, change never comes from sitting on the sidelines. We have to be brave and stand up for what's right, even if it's hard.
JANE: (determined) I'm going to help you, Andrea! I won't let them take your rights away!
ANDREA: (smiles* *hugs Jane* You're a great kid, Jane. Don't worry, everything will be okay.
