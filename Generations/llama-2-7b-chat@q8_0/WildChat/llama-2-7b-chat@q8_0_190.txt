As I sat by MC's hospital bed, I couldn't believe what was happening. My childhood friend, who was like a brother to me, was dying. Ever since he got in that accident, I was praying that he would be okay, but it seemed like fate had other plans. I took one last look at him, and the child that me and Umbris were going to have, before he took his last breath.
MC: "Sayori...I hope you and Umbris become the best parents ever. And tell my little sister Himari that I'll miss her."
Tears rolled down my cheek as I looked into MC's eyes. I couldn't bear the thought of living in a world without him. He was more than just a friend, he was family.
Sayori: "Thank you, MC. We will do our best for you. Himari will miss you too, but she'll always remember you in her heart."
MC: "I'm glad. And please, don't forget about me. Remember the good times we had together, and keep smiling, okay?"
I nodded, unable to speak. I promised him that I would never forget him and that I would always cherish his memory.
The day after MC's funeral, I went back to the clubroom where we all hung out. I could see the other girls - Monika, Yuri, Natsuki, Himari, and Kohana - all discussing something, and Kohana also had a hand on her own bump. I couldn't help but wonder if it was going to be okay.
Sayori: (Taking a deep breath) "Hey, everyone. I know we're all grieving MC's loss, but I just wanted to say that I'm grateful for all of you. For being here and supporting me. We have each other, and I think that's something we should hold onto."
The others nodded in agreement, understanding what I was trying to convey. And then, I shared the news about Umbris and me becoming parents soon. It was scary and exciting, but we were determined to do our best.
Monika: "Congratulations, Sayori. That's great news. MC would be happy to know this."
Yuri: "I'm sure you and Umbris will be wonderful parents. And, we'll be here for you, all the way."
Natsuki: "Yeah, don't forget that we're all here to help you out. And, we're happy to do it."
Himari: "I can't believe we're going to have babies around here soon. It's crazy and awesome at the same time."
Kohana: (Rubbing her bump) "Yeah, it is. I'm happy for you and Umbris. You guys will do great."
I smiled, feeling grateful for their support. And then, just minutes before the meeting ended, Kohana started to feel uncomfortable.
Kohana: "Sayori, are you okay?"
I looked at her concerned, wondering if she was okay. But before I could respond, the others chimed in, asking if she was alright.
Natsuki: "Oh no, is it starting?"
Yuri: "Should we take you to the hospital, just in case?"
Himari: "Yeah, it's better to be safe than sorry."
Kohana hesitated for a moment before nodding. She wanted to be sure, but she was scared of what might happen. We all rushed to the hospital with her, hoping for the best outcome. As we waited in the delivery room, I couldn't help but think about MC and how he would want us to be strong and support each other. Life was uncertain, but we had each other, and that was something to hold onto.
