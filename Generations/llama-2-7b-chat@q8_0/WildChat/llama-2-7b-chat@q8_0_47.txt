Yes, there are several issues with the SQL statement you provided in Lua:
1. Syntax errors: The `string.format()` function in Lua requires a format string to be enclosed in `%s`, `%d`, etc. Instead of using `%s` for all fields, you should use `%q` for strings and `%i` for integers. So the first field should be updated as follows: `"update club_info set `%q` = \"%s\" where cid = %d".format(field_name, value, cid)`
2. SQL injection vulnerability: The `string.format()` function can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into your application. To avoid this, you should always use parameters instead of concatenating user-supplied data into your SQL queries. You can use the `%d` format specifier to pass a parameter value as an integer, like this: `"update club_info set %d = \"%s\" where cid = %d".format(field_name, value, cid)`.
3. Lack of escaping: The `value` variable may contain special characters that need to be escaped in the SQL query. For example, if `value` is a string that contains a single quote (`'`), it will be treated as a string literal by MySQL and cause an error. To escape these special characters, you can use the `mysql_escape_string()` function in Lua: `"update club_info set `%q` = \"%s\" where cid = %d".format(field_name, mysql_escape_string(value), cid)`.
Here's the updated SQL statement with these issues fixed:
```lua
 update club_info set `%q` = `"%s"` where cid = %d
end
```
