As I sat in the supernatural clubroom with my fellow club members, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. It was another day, just like any other, but it was also different. Sayori was 7 months pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl, and this was her first pregnancy as a vampire.
As the club president, I had to make sure that everything ran smoothly, but I couldn't help but feel a little anxious about the upcoming meeting. Sayori's pregnancy made things a bit more complicated, especially since she was due any day now. I hoped that she would be okay and that the twins would come healthy.
As we gathered around the table, Yuri, our talking zombie member, started the meeting by updating us on the latest supernatural events in town. Monika, our hybrid of a human and a phoenix, listened intently, her eyes never leaving Yuri's face. Sayori sat quietly, rubbing her belly every now and then, looking a bit pale and tired. I could tell she was feeling uncomfortable, but she tried to hide it by smiling and nodding along with the rest of us.
After Yuri finished speaking, we moved on to the agenda for the meeting. Monika had found some new information about a potential threat to our town, something that could affect all of us supernaturals. We discussed possible ways to deal with it, and I made sure to remind everyone of their roles and responsibilities in case anything happened.
As the meeting went on, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my friends. Despite the challenges they faced as supernaturals, they were all so dedicated and determined to protect our town and each other. And now, with Sayori's pregnancy adding an extra layer of complexity to our lives, I knew that we would have to work even harder to support her and make sure everything went smoothly.
As the meeting came to a close, I stood up and addressed everyone. "Thank you all for your hard work and dedication," I said. "I know it's not easy being supernaturals in this world, but I have faith that we can overcome any obstacle as long as we stick together."
Sayori smiled weakly and nodded in agreement, and the rest of the group echoed their support. It was moments like these that reminded me why I was so grateful to be a part of this club and to have such amazing friends by my side.
