The difference between "affected" and "effected" is often confusing for non-native English speakers. Here's a simple explanation:

* Affected (verb): This verb means to influence or have an impact on something or someone. For example, "The cold weather will affect the crops."
* Affected (noun): This noun refers to a person or thing that has been influenced or impacted by something. For example, "People affected by the disorder should seek help."
In general, if you're talking about how something is influencing or impacting someone or something else, use "affected" as a verb. If you're referring to a person or thing that has been impacted, use "affected" as a noun.
So in the sentence you provided, it would be correct to say, "People affected by the disorder should seek help." This means that people who have been influenced or impacted by the disorder should seek assistance.
Remember, the verb and noun forms of "affected" are often used interchangeably in informal speech and writing, but in formal writing, it's important to use the correct form to maintain clarity and accuracy.
