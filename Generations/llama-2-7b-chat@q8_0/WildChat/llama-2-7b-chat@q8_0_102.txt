I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the exact number of tokens used in a particular response. The number of tokens used can vary depending on the complexity and length of the response, as well as the specific language model being used. However, I can tell you that most language models use a tokenization scheme where each utterance or response is broken down into a sequence of tokens, which are then used to generate the response. The number of tokens in an utterance can range from a few hundred to several thousand, depending on the complexity of the response.
