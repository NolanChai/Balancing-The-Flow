Lilac, a slender and agile ant-sized girl with long blue hair, watched in disbelief as Goku chowed down on a whole fish. "What are you doing?!" she exclaimed. "That's not food! That's a living being!"
Goku, oblivious to the commotion he had caused, chewed contentedly on his meal. "Huh? Oh, this? It's just some old fish I found. Don't worry about it."
Ants, who was standing next to Lilac, shook her head in disgust. "Can you believe it? Eating a living creature like it's nothing. Disgusting," she muttered under her breath.
Lilac crossed her arms, looking horrified. "I can't believe you would do something like that, Goku. Don't you have any respect for life?"
Goku shrugged, his massive frame towering over the two ants. "Life is food, especially if it's not doing anything else. It's just nature."
Lilac and Ants exchanged a look of disbelief. They had never seen anyone so careless with their food before. In their world, every living being was precious and should be treated with respect. They couldn't understand how someone could see it any other way.
As Goku finished his meal, he noticed the three of them staring at him in disapproval. He chuckled and patted his belly. "Don't worry about it, guys. I'm not gonna hurt anyone. I just needed a quick snack."
Lilac narrowed her eyes. "You're not hurting anyone? What about the fish? You just ate it whole!"
Goku grinned, showing off his sharp teeth. "Oh, that? Don't worry about it. Fish are plenty, and they don't feel anything when I eat them. It's all good."
Ants shook her head. "You're disgusting, Goku. How could you do something like that?"
Goku shrugged again, unphased by their criticism. "Hey, it's just the way things are done in my world. You guys are just too soft if you don't see anything wrong with eating fish."
Lilac rolled her eyes. "You have a lot to learn about empathy and compassion, Goku. Maybe one day you'll understand why we value life the way we do."
Goku chuckled again. "I don't know about that, but I'm sure it's interesting living in your world. Maybe next time I come here, I'll stick to eating leaves or something. You guys don't have to worry about me hurting anyone then."
Ants and Lilac exchanged a relieved look. They were grateful that Goku had promised not to harm any more living beings. As they continued on their journey, they couldn't help but wonder what other strange customs and beliefs the giant warrior from the human world held.

The Freedom Planet Girls couldn't believe their eyes as they watched Lilac interact with a group of ants. They had always been tiny creatures, but now they were the size of ants? How was that even possible?
"Wow, Lilac, you really know how to make friends with the little guys," Vena said, trying to contain her excitement.
"Yeah, I guess being immortal does have its perks," Lilac replied nonchalantly, not realizing the impact her actions were having on the Freedom Planet Girls.
"Wait, are you telling me that you're immortal?" Zenith asked, her eyes wide with wonder. "That means you'll never die?!"
Lilac nodded, a smug grin spreading across her face. "That's right. I'm invincible. At least, that's what I thought until now."
The Freedom Planet Girls looked at each other in disbelief. They had never met anyone who was immortal before, let alone someone who could make friends with ants.
"I don't know if I could handle being that small," Zenith said, wrinkling her nose in distaste. "And what about the humans? Don't they scare you?"
Lilac shrugged. "Nah, they're not a problem. I mean, they're big and all, but they're nothing to be afraid of."
Vena chuckled. "You're so brave, Lilac. But just how do you plan on defeating the humans if they're too big for you?"
Lilac grinned mischievously. "Oh, I have a few tricks up my sleeve. And besides, I'm not alone. I have my friends here to back me up." She gestured to the ants, who were now crawling all over her body and carrying her off into the distance.
The Freedom Planet Girls watched in amazement as Lilac disappeared into the distance with her new ant friends. They couldn't believe they had just met someone who was immortal and could make friends with creatures the size of ants. It was a truly incredible sight, and one that they would never forget.
