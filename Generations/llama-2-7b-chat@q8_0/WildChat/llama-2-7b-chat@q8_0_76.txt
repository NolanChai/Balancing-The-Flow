...INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY...
Jane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose are seated in the auditorium, surrounded by their fellow classmates. The school principal stands at the front of the room, addressing the crowd.
PRINCIPAL: Good morning, students. I hope you're all doing well today. I have an important announcement to make.
The students murmur and whisper to each other, curious about what the principal might be saying.
PRINCIPAL: We are delighted to inform you that a new student will be joining our school in the coming weeks. Her name is Julia Fairbanks, and she is the daughter of Mr. Fairbanks, the owner of Fairbanks's department store.
The students gasp and whisper among themselves, recognizing the famous local family.
JANE: (whispering to Sam) Oh my god, it's Julia Fairbanks!
SAM: (nodding) I know, right? She's like a local celebrity.
ARON: (chuckling) Yeah, and she's definitely not going to be anyone's friend.
MOLLY-ROSE: (excitedly) Can we get her autograph? Pleeeease?
The principal continues to speak, introducing Julia Fairbanks to the audience.
PRINCIPAL: Ms. Fairbanks is a highly intelligent and motivated student, and we are confident that she will be an asset to our school community. Please give her a warm welcome.
Julia Fairbanks enters the auditorium, accompanied by her father. She is a tall, slender girl with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. She walks down the center aisle, smiling and waving at the crowd.
JULIA: (excitedly) Hi everyone! *giggles* I'm so excited to be here! *smiles widely*
The students stare at her in awe, some whispering and snapping photos on their phones. Julia takes her place at the front of the room, ready to give her speech.
JULIA: (confidently) Thank you all so much for welcoming me here today! *giggles* I'm Julia Fairbanks, and I'm thrilled to be joining this amazing school! *smiles widely* As many of you know, my daddy owns Fairbanks's department store, and I'm his biggest daddy's girl in the entire world! *giggles*
The students snicker and whisper among themselves, finding Julia's attitude and speech amusing.
JANE: (whispering to Sam) Ugh, she thinks she's so cool with that "daddy's girl" nonsense.
SAM: (nodding in agreement) Yeah, it's like, hello, we get it.
ARON: (chuckling) And that whole "biggest daddy's girl in the world" thing? *rolls his eyes* Please.
MOLLY-ROSE: (excitedly) Can we please ask her to be our friend now? Pleeeease?
The students continue to whisper and giggle among themselves, finding Julia Fairbanks' arrival at their school to be both amusing and entertaining. Little do they know, Julia's confidence and attitude mask a deeper insecurity and struggle, one that will soon come to light as she faces the challenges of high school life.
