The causes of infertility can be divided into those that are primarily due to female factors, male factors, or jointly due to both partners. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), approximately 40% of infertility cases are caused by male factors, while around 40% are caused by female factors and the remaining 20% are due to a combination of both partners or are unexplained.
Male factor infertility can include:
1. Low sperm count or poor sperm quality: This is the most common cause of male infertility, and it affects around 1 in 5 men.
2. Poor sperm motility: Sperm that are unable to move properly may not be able to reach the egg, making fertilization difficult.
3. Blockages or obstruction: If there is a blockage in the reproductive tract, it can prevent sperm from reaching the egg.
4. Undescended testes (cryptorchidism): In some cases, the testes may not have descended properly into the scrotum, which can lead to reduced fertility.
5. Varicocele: A varicocele is a swelling of the veins in the scrotum that can affect sperm production and fertility.
6. Retrograde ejaculation: In this condition, semen enters the bladder instead of being released through the penis during ejaculation.
7. Chromosomal abnormalities: Some men may have chromosomal abnormalities that can affect their fertility.
8. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones such as testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) can affect sperm production.
While male factor infertility is a common cause of infertility, it's important to remember that many men with these conditions can still father children with assistance, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
It's worth noting that male factor infertility is more easily identifiable and treatable than female factor infertility. However, both partners should be evaluated to determine the underlying cause of infertility and develop a personalized treatment plan.
