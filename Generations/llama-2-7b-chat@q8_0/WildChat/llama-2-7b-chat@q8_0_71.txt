The correct answer is (B): Treatments are randomly assigned to subjects within each block.
A randomized block design is a variation of a randomized controlled trial that involves dividing the subjects into blocks based on certain characteristics (in this case, age-group) and then randomly assigning treatments to subjects within each block. This allows researchers to control for potential confounding variables that may be related to the blocking variable (age-group).
In a well-designed randomized block design experiment, treatments are randomly assigned to subjects within each block. This ensures that the treatment assignment is not biased towards any particular age-group, which helps to minimize confounding and ensure that the results are due solely to the effect of the treatment being studied.
The other options are incorrect:
* Option (A) is not true, as the number of subjects in each block may be the same or different.
* Option (C) is incorrect, as a randomized block design can still have a control group. In fact, having a control group is often desirable in a randomized block design experiment to allow for a direct comparison between the treatment and control groups.
* Option (D) is also incorrect, as a matched-pairs design involves pairing subjects from one group with subjects from another group, whereas a randomized block design involves randomly assigning treatments to subjects within each block.
* Option (E) is incorrect, as in a randomized block design, the subjects in one block receive one treatment, and the subjects in the other block receive the other treatment.

There are a total of $8$ possible outcomes when the die is tossed: $3$ red faces, $3$ yellow faces, and $2$ blue faces. Since each face is equally likely to land face up, the probability of any particular face landing face up is $1/8$.
To find the probability that a player will toss the die at least $2$ times before blue lands face up, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Let's define an event $A$ as "blue lands face up on the $2$nd toss or later".
The probability of landing on blue on the $2$nd toss or later is:
$$P(A) = P(\text{blue lands face up on $2$nd toss or later}) = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$$
Now, we want to find the probability of at least $2$ tosses occurring before blue lands face up. This is equal to the probability of not happening $A$, which is:
$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$$
So, the probability that a player will toss the die at least $2$ times before blue lands face up is $\frac{3}{4}$.

Here are some steps you could use to solve the problem of determining whether there is a significant association between exercise and happiness, using methods taught in AP Statistics:

1. Formulate a research question: "Is there a significant association between exercise and happiness?"
2. Develop an hypothesis: "Exercise will be positively associated with happiness."
3. Select a study design: This could be a correlational or experimental study. For the purposes of this example, let's assume we are using a correlational study design.
4. Choose a measure of exercise: Let's say we are measuring the number of minutes spent exercising per day.
5. Choose a measure of happiness: Let's say we are measuring overall satisfaction with life, using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied).
6. Collect data: Collect data on the number of minutes spent exercising per day and overall satisfaction with life from a sample of individuals.
7. Check for normality of the data: Use histograms and box plots to check if the data are normally distributed. If the data are not normally distributed, consider transforming the variables or using non-parametric methods.
8. Check for linear association: Use scatterplots to visually inspect the relationship between exercise and happiness. Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) and interpret it in terms of strength and direction of the association.
9. Test the null hypothesis: Use a statistical test (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to determine whether there is a significant difference in happiness scores between individuals who exercise more versus those who exercise less.
10. Interpret results: If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that there is a significant association between exercise and happiness. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it suggests that there may not be a significant association between exercise and happiness.
Some additional considerations to keep in mind when analyzing this data include:
* Control for potential confounding variables (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic status) by including them as covariates in your statistical analysis.
* Consider the sample size and whether it is large enough to detect a significant association between exercise and happiness.
* Think about how you could design future studies to further investigate this relationship.
By following these steps and considering these additional factors, you can use methods taught in AP Statistics to help determine whether there is a significant association between exercise and happiness.
