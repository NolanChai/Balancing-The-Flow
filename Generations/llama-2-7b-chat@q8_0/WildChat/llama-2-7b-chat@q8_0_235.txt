In 150 years after a catastrophic thermonuclear war devastated the planet, the world has undergone significant changes. The United States, which was reduced to scattered holdouts across the country, has undergone a "neomedieval" state of collapse. Despite this, modern society has been preserved due to the efforts of officials and surviving members of the intelligentsia who meticulously preserved all knowledge from germ theory to basic forms of manufacturing. Although some knowledge was lost, such as impractical or specialized technology, the vast sum of human knowledge was saved.
In the aftermath of the war, various warlords, roving gangs, emergency county governments, and self-proclaimed Presidents fought for power across America. However, this dynamic and chaotic situation repeated itself across America for decades. As the radiation faded and the climate recovered in the decades after the end of the war, humanity's population began to grow again. Water became the preferred method of travel as land routes were destroyed or treacherous, and the Mississippi River basin became a vital artery in America. Modern sailing ships began to sail the seas, connecting the rest of Latin America with the world.
The rebirth of global trade was revolutionary, allowing for the spread of "new" ideas, technology, and goods across the world. California, once a sleepy town, became a bustling port city with ships calling from all over the world. Luxury goods such as coffee and chocolate returned, much to the delight of local people. The growing literate population indulged in literary classics, political tracts, and most importantly the history of the United States. By the 2060s, California was swept up in a craze for all things Americana from dress to cuisine to literature. This craze was most intense in the political sphere, where the idea of uniting the chaotic lands and restoring the United States began to take root.
A general named Henry "Enrique" Santos received a vision from George Washington himself, calling for a great crusade to reunify the chaotic lands and restore the United States. On a platform of pan-Americanism, he swept the country's election and became the first Potus of the Grand Republic. His son, Marcos, continued his work and declared the unification of the United States of America as the Grand Republic in 2088. Today in 2133 AD, it's finally morning in America, with a massive road stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic completed shortly after the Restoration, and bustling cities sprung up across the continent.
The Republic is governed as a proud republic, with the authority of the Potus unquestioned across the realm. However, the issues of communicating over the vast breadth of the Republic have led to power being centralized in the Potus and the Senate. The Senate consists of representatives from states who are elected to ostensibly represent their home state's interests, but they elect the Potus as they would like in an old parliamentary democracy. While the Potus' word is law, he has delegated much of the governing to the Senate due to his old age and desires for his eldest son to be elected as the next Potus. The political drama continues between the Washingtonians, who support the Potus and the Santos Line, and the Republicans, who seek to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the Potusial title with a true republican structure centered around the Senate.
Not even the Senate's word is supreme throughout the Republic, as its control varies significantly across the continent. The Republic's control is strongest near the Interstate, where direct control is easily enforced, but fades away as you move farther away from it. Mexico, which was largely spared from the nuclear exchange except for unlucky cities on the border with the United States, has undergone a wait-and-see approach, mostly successfully. Today, Mexico and the Republic rest in an uneasy status quo along their shared border.

The stability of the Republic of Turkey is a complex and multifaceted issue, and there are different perspectives and assessments depending on various factors and criteria. Here are some points to consider:

1. Political Stability: Turkey has experienced periods of political instability in recent years, including the coup attempt in 2016 and ongoing protests and demonstrations. However, the country has a robust democratic system, and the government has made efforts to consolidate power and address opposition concerns.
2. Economic Stability: Turkey's economy has faced challenges in recent years, including high inflation, currency fluctuations, and a large current account deficit. However, the country has made progress in reducing inflation and improving macroeconomic stability, and the government has implemented policies to promote economic growth and job creation.
3. Social Stability: Turkey is a diverse country with a large and growing population, and social stability can be a challenge in some areas. There have been tensions between different ethnic and religious groups, particularly in the southeast region, and there are ongoing issues related to Kurdish rights and political representation.
4. Regional Stability: Turkey is located in a volatile region, bordering several countries with complex political situations, including Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The country has been involved in military operations in Syria and has provided support to opposition groups in the region, which has impacted its relations with neighboring countries and the international community.
5. International Relations: Turkey's relations with other countries have been a source of instability in recent years. The country has had tensions with several European Union members over issues such as migration, human rights, and Cyprus dispute. Additionally, there have been strains in relations with the United States due to differences on issues such as Syria, Iran, and Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system.
6. Military Stability: Turkey has a strong military, but it has faced challenges in recent years, including budget cuts, demographic changes, and concerns about corruption and human rights abuses. The country has also been involved in several military operations in Syria and Libya, which have raised concerns about the potential for conflict escalation.
7. Cybersecurity: Turkey has faced cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns in recent years, particularly from foreign actors. The country's digital infrastructure has been vulnerable to hacking, and there have been concerns about the potential for cyber threats to critical infrastructure and national security.
8. Environmental Stability: Turkey is experiencing environmental challenges, including air and water pollution, deforestation, and the impact of climate change. The country has made efforts to address these issues, but there are ongoing concerns about the long-term sustainability of its natural resources.
9. Health Crisis: Turkey has faced several health crises in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the country's economy and society. The country has implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus, but there have been concerns about the government's response to the crisis and the potential for future outbreaks.
10. Public Trust: Turkey's political stability is also influenced by public trust in the government and institutions. There have been concerns about corruption, government accountability, and the erosion of democratic norms and values in recent years, which can impact public trust in the government and its ability to address social and economic challenges.
In conclusion, while Turkey has made significant progress in recent years, the country still faces many challenges that can impact its stability and prosperity. Addressing these challenges will require a sustained effort by the government, civil society, and other stakeholders to promote good governance, human rights, and democratic values.

The concept of a "government of the Republic" is often associated with a system in which power is distributed among various branches and levels of government, and in which the rights and interests of citizens are protected through a system of checks and balances. This can help to prevent any one person or group from gaining too much power and abusing it.
However, there are also potential problems that could arise with this type of system:
1. Gridlock: With multiple branches and levels of government, it can be difficult to get anything done. Different branches may have conflicting priorities, and it may be hard to reach a consensus on important issues.
2. Inefficiency: The system of checks and balances can make it difficult for government to act quickly or decisively in times of crisis. Decisions may be delayed or blocked by opposition from other branches or levels of government.
3. Political polarization: The system of checks and balances can also lead to political polarization, as different branches and levels of government may have competing ideologies and agendas. This can make it difficult to find common ground and compromise on important issues.
4. Lack of accountability: With multiple branches and levels of government, it can be hard to hold anyone accountable for their actions. It may be difficult to determine who is responsible when something goes wrong, or to hold someone accountable for their mistakes.
5. Bureaucratic inefficiency: The system of checks and balances can lead to bureaucratic inefficiency, as decisions may be delayed or blocked by red tape and administrative hurdles.
6. Difficulty in addressing complex issues: With multiple branches and levels of government, it can be difficult to address complex issues that require coordination and cooperation among different branches and levels of government.
7. Lack of representation: The system of checks and balances may lead to a lack of representation for certain groups or communities, as their interests may not be well-represented in the various branches and levels of government.
8. Difficulty in implementing change: Changes in policy or law may be difficult to implement due to the system of checks and balances, which can make it hard to pass new legislation or make significant changes to existing laws.
9. Increased costs: The system of checks and balances can lead to increased costs, as different branches and levels of government may require additional resources and personnel to carry out their functions.
10. Difficulty in addressing emergencies: In times of crisis or emergency, the system of checks and balances may make it difficult for government to act quickly and decisively. Decisions may be delayed or blocked by opposition from other branches or levels of government.
