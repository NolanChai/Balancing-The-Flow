The number 2637.195 can be rounded to 2640 with significant figures.

Here's why:

* Significant figures (SF) are the digits in a number that are considered significant or meaningful. In other words, they are the digits that provide important information about the number.
* When rounding a number, you can only consider the SF when determining how many digits to retain. This means that if a number has more than 3 SF, you should only keep the first three and round the rest away.
* In this case, 2637.195 has 4 SF (the 2, 6, 3, and 5). When rounding to significant figures, we consider the first three SF (the 2, 6, and 3) as important and keep them, while rounding the last two SF (the 0.195) away. Therefore, the rounded number is 2640.
So, in summary, when rounding 2637.195 to significant figures, you should keep the first three SF (the 2, 6, and 3) and round the rest away, resulting in the rounded number of 2640.

To estimate the number of chocolate chips in the bag, we can use the following formula:
Number of Chocolate Chips = Mass of Bag / Mass of 100 Chocolate Chips
Plugging in the values from the problem:
Number of Chocolate Chips = 2041 grams / 31 grams
= 65 chocolate chips per bag
So, there are approximately 65 chocolate chips in the bag.

To find out how many crackers are in the box, we need to use the information provided in the problem. We know that the mass of the box is 328 grams and the mass of 27 crackers is 24 grams.
We can start by dividing the mass of the box by the mass of a single cracker:
328 g / 24 g/cracker = 13 crackers
So, there are approximately 13 crackers in the box. To round this number to the nearest integer, we can use significant figures and round up to 14 crackers.
