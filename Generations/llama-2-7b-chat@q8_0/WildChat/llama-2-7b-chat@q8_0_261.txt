The correct answer is:

It is the area of a smaller polar rectangle, divided by the area of the corresponding small rectangle in the , plane, in the limit as the size goes to zero.

In double integrals in polar coordinates, the magnification factor r is used to scale the integration over the radial coordinate r and the angular coordinate Î¸. The idea behind the magnification factor is that as the size of the small rectangle in the r-plane approaches zero, the area of the corresponding polar rectangle approaches its limiting value.
The formula for the double integral in polar coordinates is:
$$\iint_{R^2} f(r,\theta) dA = \lim_{a \to 0} \frac{\iint_{a < r < b} f(r,\theta) dr d\theta}{b-a}$$
where a and b are the limits of the integration over the radial coordinate, and the limit as the size of the small rectangle in the r-plane approaches zero.
The magnification factor r is used to scale the integration over the radial coordinate, so that the area of the small rectangle in the r-plane is proportionate to the area of the corresponding polar rectangle. As a result, the double integral can be evaluated by scaling the area of the small rectangle in the r-plane by the limiting value of the magnification factor as the size approaches zero.
Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

The statement "if $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bounded continuous function, then $f$ is differentiable almost everywhere" is false in general.

To see this, consider the function $f(x,y) = |x|$ for $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$. This function is bounded and continuous, but it is not differentiable at the point $(0,0)$. Therefore, option (c) is correct: $f$ is not differentiable almost everywhere.

The correct answer is (a): The triple integral of 1 over a region is the volume of the region.

A triple integral is a mathematical operation that integrates a function over a three-dimensional region in space. It can be thought of as a generalization of the double integral, which integrates a function over a two-dimensional region. The triple integral is defined as:
$$\iint \limits_R f(x,y,z) dxdydz$$
where $R$ is the three-dimensional region over which the integration is being performed.
The relation between triple integrals and volume can be understood by considering the case where the function $f(x,y,z)$ is constant over the region $R$. In this case, the triple integral reduces to:
$$\iint \limits_R f(x,y,z) dxdydz = \int \limits_R f(x,y,z) dx dy dz = Vol(R)$$
where $Vol(R)$ is the volume of the region $R$. Therefore, we can see that the triple integral of a constant function over a region is equal to the volume of that region.
In general, the triple integral of a function over a region can be thought of as a measure of the "volume" of the region in three-dimensional space. The function $f(x,y,z)$ represents the "density" of the material within the region, and the triple integral gives us the total volume of the material within the region.
So, option (a) is the correct answer.

Given the region of integration: $0\leq x \leq y \leq z \leq 1$, we need to determine the limits of $z$ in the triple integral.
The correct answer is (a): $0\leq z \leq 1$.
Explanation:
In a triple integral, the order of integration matters, and we need to integrate over each variable separately. In this case, we are integrating over $dydzdx$, which means we need to integrate over the region $0\leq x \leq y \leq z \leq 1$.
Since the integrand is a function of $x,y,z$, the limits of $z$ are important. We want to integrate over all values of $z$ between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, the correct answer is (a): $0\leq z \leq 1$.

To determine which answer is possible, we can use the fact that the center of mass must satisfy the following condition:
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i} = \text{constant}$$
where $m_i$ are the masses of the particles in the cube, and $x_i$ are their positions.
For the given problem, we have:
$$\begin{aligned}
m_{x}&= x^3+y^3+z^3 \\
m_{y}&= x^3+y^3+z^3 \\
m_{z}&= x^3+y^3+z^3
\end{aligned}$$
The center of mass is at the origin, so we can set $x=y=z=0$ in the above equation. This gives us:
$$\begin{aligned}
m_{0}&= 0^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 \\
&= 0 \\
\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the only possible center of mass is (0,0,0), which corresponds to answer B.
