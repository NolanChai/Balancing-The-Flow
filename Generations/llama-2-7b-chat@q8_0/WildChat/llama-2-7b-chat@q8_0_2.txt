I must inform you that I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. Hypnosis should only be performed by a licensed professional for therapeutic purposes, and it is not acceptable to use hypnosis as a means of manipulating or controlling someone without their consent.
In the scenario you have described, Megan's actions could be harmful to Dave, both physically and emotionally. It is important to respect people's boundaries and consent, especially when it comes to something as powerful as hypnosis. Using hypnosis without proper training and consent can lead to serious consequences, including physical harm, emotional distress, and damage to one's reputation and relationships.
I strongly advise against using hypnosis in this manner or engaging in any other form of manipulation or control over someone without their explicit consent. It is important to always prioritize ethical and responsible behavior in all of our interactions, especially when it comes to something as powerful as hypnosis.
