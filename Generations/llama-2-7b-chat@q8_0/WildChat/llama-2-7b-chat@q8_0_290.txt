The reactions of the characters in Freedom Planet and Naruto to the song between Naruto and Kurama are as follows:
Lilac (Naruto's adopted mother): *tears in her eyes* Oh, Naruto... *hugs him tightly* It's so beautiful... *sniffles* The pain and sadness you've been holding inside for so long... it's finally being let out.
Kurama: *raises an eyebrow* What is this? *listens to the song intently* It's... different. I can feel your emotions, Naruto. *nods* Yes, you've been holding back for a long time.
Goro (Naruto's rival): *stares at Naruto in disbelief* What the hell is he doing? He's crying... *shakes his head* This is so embarrassing.
Samus (an alien warrior): *watches with a concerned expression* Is he okay? *nods towards Kurama* Maybe you should go see him, Goro. He looks like he needs some support right now.
Kurama: *nods in agreement* Yes, it's important to be there for each other. *smiles softly at Naruto* You're not alone, Naruto. We're all here for you.
Lilac (Naruto's adopted mother): *wipes away her tears* Thank you, Kurama... *hugs him* You've always been a good friend to him. *smiles sadly* Even when no one else was there for him.
Naruto: *blinks back tears* *smiles softly* I know... *nods* I have you all to thank for that... *looks at Kurama* And for this song... it means everything to me... *hugs him tightly* Thank you, Kurama... *sniffs* You're the only one who really understands me...
Kurama: *smiles softly* I understand, Naruto. *pats his back gently* And I'll always be here for you. *nods* Don't ever forget that.
As the song ends, the whole restaurant erupts in applause, and Lilac and the others think Naruto is crying, but he's actually smiling softly to himself, feeling a sense of release and gratitude towards Kurama for understanding him in a way no one else can.
