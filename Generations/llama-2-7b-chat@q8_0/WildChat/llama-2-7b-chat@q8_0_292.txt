A podcast is a series, typically episodic, of digital audio files that can be downloaded or streamed online through various platforms, such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Google Podcasts. Hosts discuss specific topics, interview guests, share news and views, or create fictional stories through narration or dialogue. They are often created by individuals or organizations and can range in style from informative to entertaining. Listeners can subscribe to a podcast and receive new episodes automatically, making it easy to keep up with their favorite shows.
