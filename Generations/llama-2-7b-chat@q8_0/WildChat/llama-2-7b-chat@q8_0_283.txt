Here is a sample 3-month sales strategy for a company focused on ADHD using virality, referrals, and targeting physicians:

**Month 1: Launch Viral Campaign**

* Create a viral campaign centered around a unique offer or contest that appeals to parents and caregivers of children with ADHD. For example, create an "ADHD Challenge" where participants share their experiences and tips for managing ADHD symptoms on social media using a branded hashtag. Offer a prize for the most creative post.
* Share content on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter that highlights the challenges of managing ADHD, and how your product/service can help. Use relevant hashtags to increase visibility and reach a wider audience.
* Collaborate with influencers in the parenting and education spaces to promote your campaign. Offer them incentives such as free products or services in exchange for sharing your content with their followers.
* Launch a targeted email marketing campaign to parents and caregivers of children with ADHD, highlighting the benefits of your product/service and how it can help manage symptoms.
**Month 2: Referral Program**

* Develop a referral program that incentivizes current customers to refer their friends and family who may be interested in your product/service. Offer rewards such as discounts or free products for each successful referral.
* Reach out to physicians and healthcare professionals who specialize in ADHD and ask them to participate in a referral program. Offer them incentives such as continuing education credits or free products in exchange for referring patients to your business.
* Create a landing page on your website that outlines the referral program and provides information about how to refer friends and family. Share this page on social media and via email marketing campaigns.
**Month 3: Physician Targeting**

* Identify and target physicians who specialize in ADHD and are likely to be interested in your product/service. Use resources such as LinkedIn or ZoomInfo to find these physicians' contact information.
* Develop a direct mail campaign that targets these physicians, highlighting the benefits of your product/service and how it can help manage symptoms of ADHD. Offer them a free trial or demo to experience firsthand how your product/service can benefit their patients.
* Reach out to physicians via email and phone to follow up on the direct mail campaign and answer any questions they may have about your product/service.
* Consider partnering with physician advocacy groups or organizations that specialize in ADHD to further amplify your messaging and reach a wider audience of physicians.
**Additional Tips:**

* Monitor the performance of your viral campaign, referral program, and targeted outreach to physicians. Use data and insights to optimize each strategy and improve results over time.
* Utilize user-generated content from social media and other channels to create testimonials and case studies that showcase the impact of your product/service on families affected by ADHD. Share these stories with potential customers to help build trust and credibility.
* Use a customer relationship management (CRM) tool to manage leads, track referrals, and analyze sales data. This will help you identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and tailor your strategies accordingly.
By implementing this 3-month sales strategy, you can effectively use virality, referrals, and targeting physicians to drive sales and growth for a company focused on ADHD. Remember to track and analyze data throughout the campaigns to optimize results over time.
