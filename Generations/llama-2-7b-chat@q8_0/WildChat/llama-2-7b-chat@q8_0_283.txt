the door opened, and William greeted her with a warm smile. "Hey there, little one! What brings you here today?" Rose hesitated, unsure of how much she could trust William, but something about his kind demeanor put her at ease. She explained how she had run away from Karen's house and ended up in front of his apartment. William chuckled and said, "Well, you're certainly welcome here! Come on in." Rose entered the apartment, feeling a sense of relief as she saw that it was neatly furnished and tidy. William offered her a glass of milk and asked her to sit down on the couch. As they chatted, Rose learned that William was indeed Joseph's subordinate, but he had always been kind to her and never judged her. She felt grateful for his friendship and confided in him about her fear of Karen. William listened attentively and promised to keep her secret. As the evening went on, Rose realized that she had found a new ally in William, someone who would always be there for her no matter what.
