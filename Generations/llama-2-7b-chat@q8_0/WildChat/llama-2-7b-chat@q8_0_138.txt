1/ 🎶 In 2023, making music as a musician is more accessible than ever. With the rise of streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok, it's never been easier for artists to reach a global audience. But, have you ever wondered how musicians actually make money from their craft? 💰
2/ 💸 Streaming has undoubtedly changed the game when it comes to music income. According to the @RIAA, streaming accounted for 80% of total recorded music revenues in the US last year alone! 📈 With millions of users subscribed to streaming services, the potential for royalties is vast. But, how do musicians actually get paid? 🤔
3/ 🎵 Back in the day, musicians would rely on album sales and touring revenues as their main sources of income. But with the rise of streaming, those options have become less lucrative. In fact, according to a study by @IFPI, the average annual income for a recording artist has decreased by over 40% since 2013! 📉
4/ 💸 So, how do royalties fit into all of this? Well, when a musician's song is streamed on a platform like Spotify, they receive a small percentage of the revenue generated from that stream. That percentage can vary depending on things like the type of license and the platform itself, but it's typically around 0.004 to 0.008 cents per stream! 🤯
5/ 🎓 But here's the catch: with millions of songs available on streaming platforms, the competition for those tiny royalty payments is fierce! That means musicians need to create music that resonates with listeners and stands out from the crowd in order to generate a meaningful income. 🔥 It's not easy, but it's doable! 💪
6/ 🎬 So, what can musicians do to make money in this new streaming landscape? Well, there are plenty of strategies: collaborate with other artists, create music for ads and TV shows, offer exclusive content on Patreon... the list goes on! And, of course, keep creating great music that connects with fans and generates royalties. 🎶
