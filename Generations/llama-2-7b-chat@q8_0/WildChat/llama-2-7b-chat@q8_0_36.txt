Valefor: "Mindy? Are you okay? What happened?"

Mindy: (sniffles) "I-I was flying over the forest, and then...and then I just fell out of the sky! I don't know what happened. I couldn't control my wings."

Valefor: (concerned) "Let me see. Maybe if I touch your wings, I can figure out what's going on."

(Valefor gently takes hold of Mindy's wing, and begins to inspect it.)

Valefor: "Hmm...it looks like there's a strange energy signature emanating from your wing. It might be causing the disturbances we've been experiencing."

Mindy: (tearfully) "What do you mean? Is it serious?"

Valefor: "I'm not sure yet, but we need to get you to Bahamut as soon as possible. He may be able to help you."

(Valefor carefully leads Mindy back towards the cavern, with Ifrit and Bahamut following closely behind.)

Ifrit: "So, what's the plan?"

Bahamut: "We need to figure out what's causing this energy disruption. Once we do, we can determine the best course of action."

(The group enters the cavern, with Valefor taking her place next to Mindy.)

Valefor: "We'll need to work together to solve this mystery."

(The scene ends with the aeons gathered around Mindy, ready to begin their investigation.)
