The correct answer is: True.

Explanation: The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, including the investigation of genetically engineered crops. In the early days of genetic engineering, the USDA was responsible for investigating the safety of these crops, as some of the methods used to deliver the transgenes were derived from plant pathogens. Specifically, the Agrobacterium method, which is commonly used to transfer genes into plants, involves the use of a bacterium called Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This bacterium naturally infects plants and can transfer DNA from one plant to another, and some of the genetic elements delivered by Agrobacterium are from plant pathogens. Therefore, it makes sense that the USDA would have jurisdiction over the investigation of genetically engineered crops that use this method.

The correct answer is (True). The USDA has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, and as such, the agency was responsible for investigating genetically engineered crops that used the Agrobacterium method to deliver transgenes. The Agrobacterium method involves using a bacterium to transfer genetic material from one organism to another, and some of the genetic elements delivered through this method are derived from plant pathogens. Therefore, it was appropriate for the USDA to investigate these crops.

The correct answer is: True.

Explanation:

Electroporation is indeed an example of an ex vivo and non-viral delivery method, as it involves the use of an electric pulse to create temporary holes in the cell membrane, allowing the entry of therapeutic molecules.
On the other hand, adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a viral delivery method that can be used in vivo, as it is capable of infecting cells and delivering genetic material to the nucleus of those cells. Therefore, this option is true.
