I couldn't believe my eyes as I stared at the crater in front of me. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. The ground was scorched and blackened, and there were strange symbols etched into the earth. My mind raced with questions - where did this come from? What happened here?
Sayori, Yuri, Monika, and I all stood in shock, unsure of what to do next. We had just finished our supernatural club meeting when the loud crashing sound filled the air. It was unlike anything we had ever heard before, and it seemed to come from nowhere.
As we approached the site of the crash, we saw a strange creature lying on the ground. It was an alien, and he was out cold. I could see that his UFO was completely destroyed - there was nothing left of it. It was as if it had been annihilated from existence.
I couldn't believe what was happening. Aliens? In our town? It seemed like something straight out of a science fiction movie. But here we were, staring at the destruction caused by this strange being.
"What do we do now?" Monika asked, her voice trembling with fear.
Sayori, Yuri, and I exchanged uneasy glances. We had no idea what to do with an unconscious alien in our town. But one thing was certain - this was a moment that would change everything.
