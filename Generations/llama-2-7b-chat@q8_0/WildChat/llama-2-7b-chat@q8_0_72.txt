Here are some suggestions for fine-tuning your statement:
1. Use more specific language: Instead of using a general term like "Annual Statement," consider using the specific name of the document you are referring to, such as "Annual Financial Report" or "Annual Accounting Statement."
2. Clarify your role: It would be helpful to specify your role in the process, such as "I am checking with CCMS as a [position title] within [organization name].")
3. Provide context: Give some background information or context about why you are checking with CCMS and what you hope to achieve by doing so. For example, you could mention that you want to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements or that you want to obtain accurate financial data for internal reporting purposes.
Here is an example of how you could fine-tune your statement:
"FYI, I am checking with CCMS as a [position title] within [organization name] regarding the average size of annual statements in production. As part of our efforts to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and provide accurate financial data for internal reporting purposes, we are verifying the sizes of these statements to confirm they meet the necessary standards."

Here is a proofread version of the statement:
"FYI, regarding the Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS. The average size in production may differ."
Some minor changes were made to improve clarity and accuracy:
1. "Annual Statement" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun.
2. Added a period at the end of the sentence for improved clarity.
3. Changed "difference" to "may differ" to correct the grammatical mistake.
