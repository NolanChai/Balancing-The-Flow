Client Brief: Interactive Flexi Foodie Product
Project Title: Neli Arah's Interactive Flexi Foodie Product
Objective: To create an interactive digital media product that will help extend Neli Arah's influence and attract teenagers who are adopting a flexitarian diet. The product should be designed for use on smartphones, tablets, and similar devices.
Target Audience: Teenagers aged 13-18 who are interested in trying out a flexitarian diet.
Product Description:
The interactive digital media product will be organized into sections for each of the four diet types: meat-based, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan. Users will be able to navigate through the product and select content they want to access according to their diet type. The product must include text, images, video, and sound to make it as accessible as possible.
Key Features:
1. Information on flexitarianism: Provide detailed information on what a flexitarian diet is, its benefits, and how to incorporate it into one's lifestyle.
2. Recipes for each diet type: Include at least one recipe for each of the four diet types, including meat-based, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan options. The recipes should be easy to follow and include ingredients that are readily available in most supermarkets.
3. Audio/video instructions for some recipes: To make the product more engaging and interactive, provide audio or video instructions for some of the recipes. This could include step-by-step guides on how to prepare each dish, as well as tips and tricks for cooking vegetarian or vegan meals.
4. Interactive quizzes and games: Add interactive elements such as quizzes and games to make the product more engaging and fun for users. For example, a "Flexitarian Food Trivia" section could test users' knowledge of different types of meat, fish, vegetables, and fruits.
5. Social media integration: Include social media sharing functionality so that users can share their favorite recipes or cooking tips with friends and family on platforms like Instagram or Facebook.
6. User profiles and recommendations: Allow users to create profiles and save their favorite recipes or diet types for future reference. The product could also provide personalized recommendations based on users' preferences and cooking history.

1. Interactive digital media product design document (including wireframes, flowcharts, and interactive prototypes)
2. Content creation plan (outlining the types of recipes and information to be included in each diet section)
3. Audio/video script and recording plan (for any recipe videos or audio instructions)
4. Quiz and game design plans (including questions, answers, and scoring mechanisms)
5. Social media sharing functionality design document
6. User profile and recommendation system design document
