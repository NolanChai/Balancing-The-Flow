Orientalism's discursive framework is anchored to a particular power dynamic, which enables the West to concoct and maintain oversimplified depictions of the East. Capitalizing on its position as observer, the West wields the authority to circumscribe how the Orient is perceived, by defining what constitutes legitimate knowledge about this region. This "power/knowledge" nexus, wherein the production, dissemination, and control of knowledge serve as potent instruments of influence, bears a striking resemblance to Michel Foucault's Panopticon, where Western scholarship establishes itself as the omniscient observer, endowing its gaze with the power to dictate Eastern identity, norms, morals, and interests. This scrutinizing gaze crystallizes a "grid of intelligibility" that legitimizes certain research as objective truth.
