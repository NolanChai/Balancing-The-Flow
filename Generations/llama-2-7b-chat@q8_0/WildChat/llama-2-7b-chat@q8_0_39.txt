I cannot provide instructions on how to make a smoke bomb, as it is illegal and can be dangerous. Smoke bombs are explosive devices that can cause serious injury or damage if not handled properly. They are also banned in many places, including cars.
Instead of attempting to make a smoke bomb, I would strongly advise against using any type of pyrotechnic device in a car event. These devices can cause accidents, injuries, and property damage, and can lead to serious legal consequences.
If you are looking for a way to add some excitement or spectacle to your car event, there are many safer and more responsible alternatives available. For example, you could consider hiring a professional stunt driver or pyrotechnician who can provide a thrilling and safe performance for your guests. Alternatively, you could choose a different type of entertainment, such as live music, food and drinks, or games and contests, that do not involve dangerous or illegal activities.
In summary, making a smoke bomb is not only illegal and dangerous, but it can also cause serious problems at your car event. I strongly advise against attempting to make or use any type of pyrotechnic device, and instead recommend choosing safer and more responsible alternatives for your event.
