Thank you for providing more information about your license renewal policy. Based on what you've shared, here's an updated response:
"We apologize for any confusion earlier. Our licenses are renewed every month according to the membership period, regardless of whether it's monthly or annual. This means that if you subscribe to our annual plan, your license will be valid for one year from the date of subscription. We hope this clears up any confusion, and please let us know if you have any further questions."

Here is a possible translation of the sentence:

"We apologize for not being clear earlier. The license is renewed on a monthly basis in line with the membership period, whether it's monthly or annual."

In this translation, the word "according to" has been replaced with "in line with," which more accurately conveys the idea of something happening based on a particular period of time. Additionally, the phrase "whether monthly or annual" has been added at the end of the sentence to make it clear that the renewal applies to both monthly and annual memberships.

Here is a rewritten version of the sentence with better grammar and readability:

"Hello Chris Milam,

We apologize for any confusion we may have caused regarding the license renewal process. To clarify, the license is renewed on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the membership period chosen by the customer."
