This error message indicates that Logstash cannot find any configuration files in the specified path: `D:/ElasticSearch/logstash-8.3.0/logstash.conf`.
Here are some possible causes and solutions for this issue:
1. Check the file path: Make sure that the path you provided is correct and exists in the Logstash installation directory. Double-check that the path is accurate, including any drive letters or UNC paths.
2. Verify the configuration file existence: Ensure that a configuration file named `logstash.conf` exists in the specified path. You can do this by checking the directory manually or using the command `ls logstash.conf` in the terminal.
3. Check for typos in the path: Make sure there are no typos in the path you provided, especially if it's a UNC path. Typos can cause Logstash to fail to find the configuration file.
4. Check the Logstash installation directory: Ensure that Logstash is installed correctly and that the configuration files are located in the correct directory. You can check this by running the command `logstash --config` in the terminal, which will display the configuration directory path.
5. Add the configuration directory to the Logstash configuration file: If the configuration file is not located in the default configuration directory, you can specify the directory using the `input_dir` setting in the Logstash configuration file. For example: `input { stdin { type => "file" } path => "/path/to/config/directory" }`.
6. Check for any other configuration files: Make sure that there are no other configuration files with the same name in different directories. If you have multiple configuration files, Logstash may not be able to find the one you intended it to use.
7. Restart Logstash: After making any changes to the configuration file or directory, restart Logstash using the command `service logstash restart` (on Unix-based systems) or `logstash stop` and then `logstash start` (on Windows). This will ensure that Logstash uses the updated configuration.
If none of these solutions work, you can try checking the Logstash logs for more detailed information on the error message.

There are several reasons why the `HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress` property might not be returning the real IP address of the client in an ASP.NET Core web application:
1. **Network configurations**: The client's IP address might be hidden by their network administrator or ISP (Internet Service Provider) due to security reasons or other policies. In such cases, the `RemoteIpAddress` property will return a non-existent or private IP address.
2. **Proxy servers**: The client might be using a proxy server to access the web application, which can mask their real IP address. In this case, the `RemoteIpAddress` property will return the IP address of the proxy server instead of the client's actual IP address.
3. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: The client might be connected to a VPN, which can also hide their real IP address and return a different one in the `RemoteIpAddress` property.
4. **Correct configuration of reverse proxy**: If you are using a reverse proxy server like NGINX or IIS to serve your web application, you might need to configure it correctly to forward the client's request to the actual IP address of the client. If not configured correctly, the `RemoteIpAddress` property will return the IP address of the reverse proxy server instead of the client's actual IP address.
5. **Client-side issues**: There might be some issues with the client's network or browser configuration that can cause the `RemoteIpAddress` property to return an incorrect IP address. For example, if the client is using a DNS (Domain Name System) server that returns an incorrect IP address for their location, it can cause problems with the `RemoteIpAddress` property.
To overcome these issues, you can try the following approaches:
1. Use the `HttpContext.Request.UserAgent` property to get the client's browser information, which might contain additional details about the client's network configuration or location.
2. Use a third-party library or service that can provide more accurate information about the client's IP address, such as GeoIP APIs or reverse DNS lookups.
3. Implement a custom authentication mechanism that requires the client to provide their actual IP address during login or registration processes, which can help you identify and block any suspicious activity based on the client's IP address.
4. Use additional security measures, such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, to prevent malicious attacks from clients with hidden or incorrect IP addresses.

Elasticsearch 报错：received plaintext HTTP traffic on an HTTPS channel，closing connection

Error:

Received plaintext HTTP traffic on an HTTPS channel. This is a security risk and may expose your Elasticsearch instance to man-in-the-middle attacks. Please ensure that all incoming requests are encrypted using TLS/SSL.
Reason:
Elasticsearch has detected that the incoming request was not encrypted with TLS/SSL, which is a security protocol used to secure communication over the internet. Since Elasticsearch communicates with clients over HTTPS, it cannot process any further requests from this client until the connection is upgraded to use TLS/SSL.
Cause:
The most common cause of this error is using an unencrypted HTTP proxy or a firewall that does not support HTTPS inspection. Other causes may include misconfigured SSL/TLS settings in Elasticsearch or the client, or a compromised client certificate.
Resolution:
To resolve this issue, you can take the following steps:
1. Ensure that your Elasticsearch instance is configured to use TLS/SSL for all incoming requests. This can usually be done by setting the `https` setting in the Elasticsearch configuration file (usually located at `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`) to `true`. For example:
```yaml
http.https.port: 9200
http.https.enabled: true
```
1. Check your HTTP proxy or firewall settings to ensure that they are configured to support HTTPS inspection. If you are using an unencrypted HTTP proxy, consider switching to a TLS-enabled proxy instead.
2. If you are using a custom SSL/TLS certificate and key pair for Elasticsearch, ensure that the certificates are properly installed and configured on your system. You can check the certificate configuration by running the following command:
```bash
curl -v -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes'
```
If you see a warning message about the certificate not being trusted, you may need to configure your system to trust the certificate.
3. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you can try disabling TLS verification in Elasticsearch by setting the `transport.tls.Verify` setting to `false`. However, this should only be done as a temporary measure while troubleshooting the issue:
```yaml

transport.tls.Verify: false

```
Note that disabling TLS verification can introduce security risks, so use this option with caution and only until you have resolved the underlying issue.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, received plaintext HTTP traffic on an HTTPS channel is a security risk that can expose your Elasticsearch instance to man-in-the-middle attacks. By ensuring that all incoming requests are encrypted with TLS/SSL, you can prevent this type of attack and keep your data secure. If you encounter this error in your Elasticsearch environment, follow the steps outlined above to resolve the issue and ensure that your system is properly secured.
