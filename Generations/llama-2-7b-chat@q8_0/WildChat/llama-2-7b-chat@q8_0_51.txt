Ah, I see! Thank you for clarifying that. So, to confirm:
* The license is renewed every month according to the membership period, which can be either monthly or annual.
* For an annual subscription, the license is valid for one year from the date of subscription, regardless of the month in which the subscription was made.
Is that correct?

Here is a possible translation of the sentence:

"I apologize for not making ourselves clear earlier. The license is renewed on a monthly basis in accordance with the membership period, whether it's monthly or annual."

Here is a more accurate and polite response to Chris Milam's inquiry:

Dear Chris,

I apologize for any confusion earlier regarding our licensing renewal process. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. To clarify, the license of our software is renewed on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the membership period chosen by our customers. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Best regards,
