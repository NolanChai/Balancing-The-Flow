Based on the formula you provided, it looks like you are using the `FIND` function to locate the position of the first space character in the sentence, and then using the `LEFT` function to extract the text up to that point. To modify the formula to find the first two words instead of the first three words, you can simply adjust the `FIND` function to look for the second space character after the first word.
Here is an updated formula that should give you the first two words in a sentence:
=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, FIND(" ",C2, FIND(" ",C2, 2)+1)-1),"")
In this formula, we are using `FIND` function twice to locate the position of the second space character after the first word. The first `FIND` function locates the position of the first space character after the first word, and the second `FIND` function locates the position of the second space character after the first word. We then use the result of the second `FIND` function to extract the text up to that point using the `LEFT` function.
For example, if you enter the sentence "The quick brown fox" in cell C2, and apply the formula, it will return "The quick" as the first two words.

```
=IF(LEN(A1)>6,"More than 6 words","Less than 6 words")
```
In the above formula, "A1" refers to the cell where you want to check the length of the text. The formula will return "More than 6 words" if the length of the text in that cell is greater than 6 words, and "Less than 6 words" otherwise.
You can also use this formula for an entire column by using the column letter (e.g. A:A) instead of a single cell reference.
Alternatively, you can use the following formula to check if the length of the text in a cell is greater than or equal to 6 words:
```
=IF(LEN(A1)>=6,"More than 6 words","Less than 6 words")
```
You can also use this formula for an entire column by using the column letter (e.g. A:A) instead of a single cell reference.

Yes, you can use data validation in Excel to restrict the input to a specific format. Here are some ways to achieve this:
1. Format Cells if Value is Not a Date:
Use the Format Cells option in the Data Validation tool to convert any non-date values to dates. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the cell or range of cells where you want to apply data validation.
b. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation".
c. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Format Cells if Value is Not a Date" from the "Allow" drop-down list.
d. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.
Now, whenever someone enters a value into one of these cells that is not a date, Excel will automatically convert it to a date format.
2. Require Only Numbers:
You can use data validation to restrict input to only numbers. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the cell or range of cells where you want to apply data validation.
b. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation".
c. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Numbers Only" from the "Allow" drop-down list.
d. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.
Now, whenever someone enters any text into one of these cells, Excel will display an error message and prevent them from saving the value.
3. Require a Specific Format:
You can use data validation to restrict input to a specific format, such as a phone number or an email address. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the cell or range of cells where you want to apply data validation.
b. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation".
c. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Custom" from the "Allow" drop-down list.
d. Enter the format for the input value (e.g. "012-3456789").
e. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.
Now, whenever someone enters a value into one of these cells that does not match the specified format, Excel will display an error message and prevent them from saving the value.
4. Restrict Input to a Range:
You can use data validation to restrict input to a specific range of values. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the cell or range of cells where you want to apply data validation.
b. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation".
c. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Numbers Only" from the "Allow" drop-down list.
d. Enter the minimum and maximum values that are allowed (e.g. "0-10").
e. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.
Now, whenever someone enters a value into one of these cells that is not within the specified range, Excel will display an error message and prevent them from saving the value.
5. Allow Only Certain Characters:
You can use data validation to restrict input to only certain characters. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Select the cell or range of cells where you want to apply data validation.
b. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation".
c. In the Data Validation dialog box, select "Characters" from the "Allow" drop-down list.
d. Enter the characters that are allowed (e.g. "ABC123").
e. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.
Now, whenever someone enters any text into one of these cells that does not match the specified characters, Excel will display an error message and prevent them from saving the value.
These are just a few examples of how you can use data validation in Excel to restrict input to a specific format or range. You can customize the data validation rules to fit your needs and ensure that only valid data is entered into your worksheet.
