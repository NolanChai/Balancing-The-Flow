In this passage, the author is discussing the interpretation of the "thousand years" mentioned in the Book of Revelation. The author suggests that the number "a thousand" may not be meant to be taken literally, but rather as a proverbial expression used to convey the idea of a long period of time. The author references other sacred books and scholars who have interpreted the "thousand years" as a metaphor for many generations or days.
The author also mentions that some scholars have suggested that the Revelator borrowed the idea of the "thousand years" from the Rabbins, citing a tradition in the Talmud that the righteous would revive and fall no more during this period. The author notes that this tradition is similar to the idea expressed in the Apocalypse, where the righteous are said to reign with Christ during the dragon's restraint.
The author concludes that John used the traditions of the Jews to describe the coming prosperity of the church during the dragon's restraint, rather than intending to convey a specific length of time. The use of the "thousand years" is seen as a way to express a long period of time in a way that would be meaningful and relatable to the audience.
