(In the clubroom)
Monika: "Oh no, Natsuki's not here yet? That's strange. She was just with us a minute ago."
Sayori: "Yeah, maybe she did go to get something to eat. She does have a bit of a fast metabolism."
Yuri: "I hope so, because we really need her for the meeting. We were just about to start discussing some ideas for our next literature club event."
Monika: "I know, I'm excited to hear what everyone came up with. It's always interesting to see how creative everyone can be when it comes to planning these events."
(Meanwhile, at the hospital)
Doctor: "So, Natsuki, how are you feeling today? Any symptoms or discomfort?"
Natsuki: "Um, well...I guess I've been feeling a bit off lately. A little nauseous and tired all the time."
Doctor: "Hmm, that could be normal for a pregnant woman, especially in the fifth month. But let's take a look at you with this ultrasound and see how your baby is doing."
Natsuki: (nervously) "Okay...I guess it's just a routine check-up?"
Doctor: "That's right. We'll just need to take some images of your baby to make sure everything is developing properly. Don't worry, it's completely safe and painless."
