Here is an example of how you could write an assembly language program in TASM for the DOS operating system that performs the task you described:
; Declare the input file
fileinput input.txt

; Read each element from the input file into a register
read %ax, %bx
loop @eof input.txt
    ; Skip over any whitespace at the beginning of the line
    cmp byte
