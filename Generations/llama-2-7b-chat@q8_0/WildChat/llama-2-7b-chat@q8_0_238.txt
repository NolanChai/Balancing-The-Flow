Соответственно, Plant for obtaining PAW has been improved after plasma treatment. After this treatment, water acquires new physical and chemical properties. Significant concentrations of H2O2 и NO3− appear in the water. In the formation of H2О2, O2 dissolved in water is also consumed, which is reflected in the redox potential of the solution. The appearance of the nitrate anion leads to acidification of the solution (decrease in pH) and an increase in electrical conductivity. It should be noted that the specific electrical conductivity and concentration of NO3− linearly depend on the treatment time. At the same time, there are currently cheap and fast means of controlling the specific electrical conductivity and the concentration of NO3−. This means that simple и convenient ways to control the preparation of PAW have been found. It has been established that the use of PAW solutions with a concentration of 0.5–1.0% increases germination energy, protects against fusarium and hyperthermia in cotton plants, wheat and strawberries. The use of PAW provides significant advantages over the SDS Dalbron and Bakhor, which are widely used today in Uzbekistan.
