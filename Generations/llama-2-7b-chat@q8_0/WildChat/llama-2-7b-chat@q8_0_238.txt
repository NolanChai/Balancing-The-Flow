Interviewer: Lita, thank you for joining us today. Your portraits are incredibly striking and emotive. Can you tell us a little bit about your creative process?
Lita Cabellut: Thank you! I'm glad to be here. My creative process is quite organic and intuitive. I usually start with a rough sketch of the sitter, trying to capture their likeness as accurately as possible. But then, I let my emotions guide me, and I allow myself to get lost in the painting process. I layer washes of paint, building up the colors and textures until I achieve the desired mood or atmosphere. It's a very physical and emotional experience for me, and I feel like I'm channeling something deeper and more profound than just capturing someone's likeness.
Interviewer: That's fascinating. Your portraits are often described as "emotionally charged." Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?
Lita Cabellut: Yes, of course! I believe that emotion is the driving force behind all creative expression. When I paint, I'm not just trying to capture someone's likeness; I'm trying to tap into their emotions and experiences. I want my portraits to be more than just a visual representation of someone; I want them to convey the essence of who they are as a person. Emotions are what make us human, and I believe that art has the power to capture and express those emotions in a way that nothing else can.
Interviewer: Your portraits often feature bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors. Can you tell us about your choice of color palettes?
Lita Cabellut: Color is an essential element in my work, and I choose my palettes based on the mood and atmosphere I want to convey. Sometimes, I'll use more muted tones to create a sense of introspection or melancholy; other times, I'll go for bold, vibrant colors to capture the subject's energy and vitality. I believe that color has the power to evoke emotions and to transport us to another place, and I try to harness that power in my work.
Interviewer: Your portraits have been described as "intimate" and "personal." How do you approach capturing the essence of your sitters?
Lita Cabellut: I believe that the most personal and intimate portraits are those that capture a person's soul. When I paint, I try to connect with my sitter on a deeper level; I want to understand their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Sometimes, this means asking them questions about themselves, sometimes it means just being in their presence and allowing myself to be moved by their energy. I believe that art has the power to transcend the physical realm and tap into something more profound and universal; when I'm painting someone, I'm trying to capture that deeper essence of who they are.
Interviewer: That's a beautiful way of thinking about it. Your work has been exhibited around the world. Do you have any favorite places or experiences from your travels?
Lita Cabellut: Oh, wow! Yes, I do! I've been lucky enough to travel extensively throughout my career, and each place has left an indelible mark on me. One of my favorites is Tokyo; the city is just so vibrant and alive, it's like a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds. And the food! Oh, my goodness, I could eat sushi for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! But I think what I love most about Tokyo is the way the city seems to embody the concept of "wa" – a term that roughly translates to "harmony" or "balance." It's like everything in the city is in perfect harmony with itself and with the world around it.
Interviewer: That sounds incredible. Finally, do you have any advice for aspiring artists out there?
Lita Cabellut: Always! My advice would be to never stop experimenting and exploring – both within yourself and outside of yourself. Art is a journey, not a destination, and there's always room for growth and evolution. Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things; it's through those risks that we learn and grow the most. And lastly, I would say that art has the power to change the world – one brushstroke at a time! So don't be afraid to use your voice and your talents to create something beautiful and meaningful.
