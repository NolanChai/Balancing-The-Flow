Natsuki: *excitedly* Oh my good, I feel something moving! *takes out her pregnancy journal* It's the 4th month already! *starts drawing a small heart next to the date*

(The scene shifts back to Natsuki in her bedroom, cradling Hiroshi in her arms.)

Natsuki: *smiling* I can't believe they're already here. It feels like just yesterday I was finding out I was pregnant with triplets. *looks at the pictures of her bump* And look at how big my belly was! *chuckles*

(Natsuki gently places Hiroshi into his crib and starts to arrange the blankets around him.)

Natsuki: *softly singing* Hiroshi, Hiroshi... you're so tiny but so strong. Mama loves you so much, little one. *pauses and looks at her son with a smile* You and your sisters are going to be the best of friends, I just know it. *smiles wistfully*

(Natsuki leans back against the headboard and closes her eyes, feeling content and grateful for her precious little family.)
