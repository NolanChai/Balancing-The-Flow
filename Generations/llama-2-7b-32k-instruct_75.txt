The US FDA has added a black box warning on antibiotics that includes Cipro, Levaquin and Avelox because they can cause ruptured or torn tendons. The warning is also required for other antibiotics in the fluoroquinolone class of drugs. Tendon damage from these medicines has been reported by thousands of patients. Some 200,000 people were forced to undergo surgery and others experienced permanent injury. (CNN)
