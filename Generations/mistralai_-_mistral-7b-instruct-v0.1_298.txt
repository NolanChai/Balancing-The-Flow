 Manchester United are reportedly facing the possibility of losing another promising young player, as they have yet to begin negotiations with Brazilian midfielder Andreas Pereira over a new contract. The 21-year-old has been a standout for his national team and is considered one of the brightest prospects in South American football, but United's failure to act quickly could see him move on to another club before his current deal expires in 2019.
