My first reaction to this is that it's probably not a very good idea, but I can understand why some people are concerned about traffic congestion in Texas. However, if they really want to tear down something old then maybe we could just replace the Eiffel tower with an ordinary building?  Or perhaps instead of demolishing a historical landmark such as The Statue Of Liberty they might consider making it into a museum or something like that?
