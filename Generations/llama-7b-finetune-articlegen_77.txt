Forgetfulness can be a sign of something more serious than simple old age. That’s according to experts who say memory loss typically begins in middle age. While everyone has trouble remembering things from time to time, forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40. But the more people forget their keys, the more likely they are to be at risk for dementia . Researchers analysed data from two large studies involving adults aged between 51 and 86. The team found that nearly half of those who had forgotten their keys had evidence of impaired memory and cognition - a precursor to the more serious condition, Alzheimer's disease. Experts warn people should seek medical advice if they begin forgetting things such as their children's names, pets or where they put their car . Dr Kumar Bharat Bhushan, one of the researchers on the study, said: 'We were surprised to find that this kind of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which can be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, is present in up to 40 per cent of the middle-aged and elderly individuals. This kind of memory loss can also occur as part of normal ageing and does not necessarily lead to dementia.' The researchers analysed data from more than 5,900 people over the course of six years who had been followed up in two large studies involving adults aged between 51 and 86. Those who forgot where they put their keys were then assessed with a questionnaire to determine whether or not they showed signs of dementia. The scientists found that about half of those who reported forgetting the location of their car, house keys, pets or other personal items did have evidence of mild memory impairment and cognitive problems. 'This kind of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which can be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, is present in up to 40 per cent of the middle-aged and elderly individuals,' said Dr Bharat Bhushan . Experts warn that while forgetting where you left your keys may not mean anything, people should seek medical advice if they begin forgetting things such as their children's names or pets. Dr Eric Reiman, another researcher on the study, said: 'The more frequently someone forgets where they have put their car keys or forgets a word during conversation with a friend, for instance, the higher the risk of cognitive impairment.' Dr Bharat Bhushan added: 'It is important to detect early signs of mild memory loss so that treatment and prevention can be started before more serious problems occur. We should not ignore these symptoms as they may just be a normal part of ageing but we encourage people who are concerned about their own memory or the memory of others to consult with their physicians.' The study was published in the journal Neurology. . A recent UCLA study found that those who forget where they put their keys (like this man pictured) may be at risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease . In October, a study from Harvard Medical School warned that getting older is linked with brain shrinkage that could make you more likely to develop dementia. The researchers said the findings indicate that 'the brain does not stop growing in size until you are well into adulthood'. And they concluded that 'experience is good for your brain.' In September, a separate study from UCLA warned those who forget where they put their keys may be at risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that people with this type of memory loss are more than twice as likely to develop dementia later in life. The new research, which was published in the journal Neurology, also suggested the condition can even lead to an early death. They warned it is important not to ignore signs of mild memory problems - like forgetting where you put your keys - because they may indicate Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. 'In a large and diverse study population we found that individuals who had amnestic MCI [amnestic mild cognitive impairment] were more than twice as likely to develop dementia within four years compared with those without amnestic MCI,' the researchers wrote in their report. Dr Eric Reiman, one of the study's authors and a neurologist at the University of California Los Angeles, told MailOnline: 'Our findings suggest that aMCI may be an early indicator of dementia risk. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which aMCI is due to age-related changes in cognition versus other causes.' Researchers followed more than 50,000 people who were aged between 62 and 99 for up to six years . The study found that about half of those who forgot where they put their car, house keys or pets also showed evidence of mild memory impairment and cognitive problems. Scientists warned it is important not to ignore signs of mild memory problems - like forgetting where you put your keys - because they may indicate Alzheimer's disease . 'The more frequently someone forgets where they have put their car keys or forgets a word during conversation with a friend, for instance, the higher the risk of cognitive impairment.' The researchers said their findings support previous studies that have suggested that early detection of dementia may improve outcomes and help patients live longer. They also believe it is important to determine whether lifestyle factors such as exercise, diet and social engagement are associated with a reduced risk of developing amnestic MCI in later life. 'There's no treatment for this condition,' Dr Reiman added. 'However, if individuals know they have it then they can be vigilant about other things that could reduce their risk, such as exercise, eating well and social engagement.' The study was published in the journal Neurology . Previous studies have also suggested a link between memory loss and dementia. Last month, scientists from Johns Hopkins University found people who were forgetful were more than three times likelier to develop Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - an intermediate stage between normal age-related memory loss and full dementia - are almost four times more likely to die prematurely from heart failure, lung cancer or other conditions than those without MCI. Dr Paul Howard Jones said: 'The earlier someone has signs of cognitive impairment, the higher their risk for adverse outcomes.' He added that further research was needed to determine why dementia and Alzheimer's disease is associated with heart problems and cancer deaths in people who are young enough to be at low risk. Previous studies have suggested a link between memory loss and dementia . 'Cognitive impairment has been shown to reduce life expectancy by two years but the reasons for this were not well understood,' said Dr Howard Jones. The study was published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. Last month, scientists from Johns Hopkins University found people who were forgetful were more than three times likelier to develop Alzheimer's disease . Previous research has also suggested that having a larger waistline can increase your risk for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease by up to 70 per cent. A study of more than 4,500 adults found those with larger waists were three times as likely to develop the memory problems within eight years. The researchers said that having excess fat around the middle may damage the blood vessels in the brain and block an important pathway between neurons - which may cause brain atrophy or shrinkage, resulting in dementia. 'It is likely that waist circumference contributes to the development of cognitive impairments by increasing insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress,' said study author Dr Nicole Spartano from Boston University School of Medicine. Scientists said having excess fat around the middle may damage the blood vessels in the brain and block an important pathway between neurons . They also found that people who had a larger waist were more likely to have poorer memory than those with smaller waists, even if they did not develop cognitive impairment. The researchers said it is unclear what causes the association but that the results 'suggest a need for lifestyle changes and improvements in diabetes risk factors'. The study was published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. In June, scientists from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) warned those who get older are linked with brain shrinkage that could make them more likely to develop dementia . Scientist at UCLA found that people over 60 had an average decrease in the size of their brains of 4.8 per cent, or about half a cubic inch. They said the findings indicate that 'the brain does not stop growing in size until you are well into adulthood'. And they concluded that 'experience is good for your brain.' Researchers at UCLA also found people over 60 had an average decrease in the
