A gang of thieves dressed in burkas stole over £1.4 million in luxury watches from Selfridges after posing as wealthy Muslim women, a court heard. The group walked into the store in central London carrying handbags, pretended to be interested in purchasing expensive timepieces and then left with the goods.

The incident happened at around 2pm on March 3 when six suspects entered Selfridges and made their way towards the watch department. They then selected a number of watches worth £1.4 million before leaving the store without paying. The gang is believed to have used burkas to disguise themselves before carrying out the theft.

Police said that they were called to the scene after staff noticed the group acting suspiciously and alerted security. Officers arrived on the scene shortly afterwards and arrested all six suspects on suspicion of theft. The watches, which included Rolexes, Cartiers and Omegas, have not yet been recovered and police are still investigating the incident.
