 The estranged wife of the limo driver who died in the fire has released a statement thanking the community for their support and expressing her deepest condolences to the victims' families.

In an interview with CNN, Kerry Mcdermott said she was devastated by the loss of life and that her thoughts were with the people affected by the tragedy. She also expressed her gratitude to the first responders who rushed to the scene to try and save lives.

Mcdermott's estranged husband, Justin Barboza, was one of the seven people killed in the limo fire in upstate New York on Saturday. The couple had been divorced for several years, but Mcdermott said she still considered him a member of her family.

"Justin was my brother-in-law and I loved him like my own," she said. "I feel so bad for his wife and their children. They are going through something no one should have to go through."

Mcdermott also addressed criticism that the limo driver had a history of reckless driving and that he should not have been behind the wheel of such a large vehicle. She said she did not know all the details of the accident and could not comment on it.

"All I can say is that my brother-in-law was a good man," she said. "He loved his job and he loved driving. He was very careful and responsible."

The investigation into the limo fire continues, and the cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Mcdermott said she would be willing to speak with investigators if asked to do so.
