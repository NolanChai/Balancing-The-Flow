Saif al-Islam, the fugitive son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, is reportedly trying to reach a safe haven in Zimbabwe while also negotiating to surrender. According to sources close to the situation, Saif al-Islam has been in contact with Zimbabwean officials and has expressed a desire to seek refuge in the southern African country. However, it remains unclear whether Zimbabwe will grant him asylum, as Harare has previously stated that it will not accept any Libyan nationals wanted by Interpol.
