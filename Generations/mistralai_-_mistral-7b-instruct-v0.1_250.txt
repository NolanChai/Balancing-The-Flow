 Redknapp's third signing of the summer. The former Liverpool player has been training with QPR for several weeks and will undergo a fitness test on Monday. It is understood that Diarra is keen to join QPR and play in the Premier League once again. However, his agent, Stéphane Bramhall, has yet to discuss terms with the club. If Diarra signs for QPR, he would become Harry Redknapp's third signing of the summer, following Jordan Pickford and João Mário.
