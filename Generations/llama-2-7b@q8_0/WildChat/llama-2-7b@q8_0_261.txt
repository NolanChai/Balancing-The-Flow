[SURV]The story is set in an alternate history timeline from 1997 to 2025. It takes place in New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. (both cities have separate states.)

- Paige Kwon's Mother (Kwon Kyung-sook) - Korean-American, divorced from Matthew Broderick since 1997, had an affair with him when she was waitressing in New York and became pregnant. She came back to South Korea after having the baby because she did not want people to know about her affair. Her height is 5 feet 2 inches tall.
- Matthew's Father (Michael Broderick) - Hispanic/Irish, Matthew's father was an alcoholic who abandoned him when he was young and he does not remember his face because it has been over 30 years since he saw him. His height is 5 feet 8 inches tall.
- Paige Kwon Broderick - She was born in Seoul, South Korea on April 4th, 1980 as Paige Kwon-Broderick (her Korean name Jang Mi means "beautiful" and the reason why she kept this name). She moved to San Francisco when she was a teenager with her mother. In 1997, Kyung-sook told her about Matthew Broderick being her father by showing Paige her US citizenship card because he is an American citizen. They came from Seoul and went to the airport on February 3rd, 1997 (the same day that North Korea fired missiles over Japanese airspace). Kyung-sook got pregnant while working as a waitress in New York and had no idea she was pregnant until she got back to South Korea. When Paige found out about the affair with Matthew Broderick, she went to America for her father at age 16 (in early September of that year). In early October 1997, Kyung-sook left Seoul and moved back to California because of scandals involving Matthew. At age 37, Paige is single with no kids but she has a dog named Marley (named after the book "Marley & Me" by John Grogan). Her height is 5 feet 4 inches tall.[/MARG]
[ROL]Paige is visiting San Francisco to see her father for the first time in her life at age 16. He lives in a mansion on the Pacific Ocean in Pacific Heights and he drives her back and forth from San Francisco International Airport (SFO). In his car, they talk about what they like about each other and that she is his daughter, but he has never met her before until now because Matthew Broderick was unaware of her existence.
As the story goes on, Paige tells her father that she wants to go back to Seoul after she graduates from high school in June 2001 (because she knows nothing about New York) and he doesn't want her to leave but they agree that she will be staying with him until then. They also talk about how Kyung-sook is living near them with James & Tabitha since she moved back there from Korea after Matthew Broderick married another woman named Marlene Goldsmith in 2014 (she had two daughters, Loretta and Lydia). Paige gets upset when Matthew asks her to stay at his place instead of hers so she can know him better but he tells her that this is what their mothers want them both do since they are not friends anymore.[/ROL]
[EVN]As a result, Matthew Broderick was unaware of his daughter Paige's existence until now. The story takes place in an alternate history timeline from 1997 to 2025, where the world is experiencing rapid change and it also includes major events such as wars, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, etc.[/EVN]
