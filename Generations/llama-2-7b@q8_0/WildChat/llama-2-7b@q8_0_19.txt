The mass of the chocolate chip bag is given as,2041 g which is too high to be the actual mass of the bag and it includes some other content also. The mass of 100 chocolate chips is,31g , and there are 67 grams of empty space in the bag.
So there must be only 250 - 256 g in the bag, which is equal to less than 254 g

### Explanation:

The mass of 100 chocolate chip is calculated by using the given data that a chocolate chip weighs approximately 31 grams. The mass of the bag is too high because it includes the empty space in the bag and the content of the other items which were mixed with the chocolate chips.
The mass of the bag minus the mass of the chocolate chip is equal to the empty space in the bag plus the rest of the material of the bag. The mass of 100 chocolate chips in the bag equals,
67g + (250 - 254 g) = 31g which means there are 31 grams in one hundred pieces of chocolate chip. The mass of a single chocolate chip is about 31 grams and that makes it possible to estimate the number of chocolate chips in a bag by calculating the total mass of all the items minus the mass of the bag only.

### Solution:
We need to find out how many crackers there are in a box that weighs 924g, and is empty except for 27 of those cracker, which weigh 24g each. We know that the total mass of all of those objects is 924 grams (we subtracted out the empty box). If you multiply this by 10, it gives us the answer in terms of pounds and ounces:
