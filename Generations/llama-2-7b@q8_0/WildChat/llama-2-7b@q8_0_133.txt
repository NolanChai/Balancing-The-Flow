I think the main thing I've noticed so far, since I'm not terribly experienced in this style of writing yet, is to get out of my head more when writing, i.e. not second guess everything that comes into my mind as being "too much", and just write it down and see where it takes me.
I also need to work on characterization a lot. I feel like my dialogue flows really well but the characters themselves are pretty uninspired, so I'm trying to find some good examples of strong character writing in order to help myself out with that problem.
One thing that is somewhat of an issue for me is that I've found that I tend to write better when I'm not sure what the outcome will be and have more room to just let it go where ever it takes me, but at the same time I also feel like if you don't know where a scene or story is going to end up, then there's no real point in writing that scene/story to begin with.
I think what I will do for my next exercise (if that even makes sense) is to write a scene, but not worry about the outcome, and just let it flow where ever it goes and see how it plays out. That should help me get more comfortable with leaving my brain at home when writing. I'll make sure to post it here once it's completed.
I think we're all still learning and experimenting, and as long as we keep on doing that then our writing will improve over time (or so I believe).
