(We all looked at each other as Sayori’s face turned serious again.)

Natsuki: “Sayori…what is it?”

MC: “Everything okay?”

Monika: “Is it about the baby? Is everything okay with her?”

Yuri: “I can sense that something’s wrong.”

(Sayori listened intently to her sister’s words, and eventually hung up the phone.)

Sayori: “It…it looks like my sister had a miscarriage. She didn’t want me to know because she knew it would upset me, but now that I’m pregnant too, she wanted to tell me.”

(We all looked at Sayori, shocked by the news.)

MC: “Oh, no! That must have been so painful for her.”

Natsuki: “And she was worried about you knowing?”

Monika: “That’s because she knows how much you care for her and don’t want to hurt her feelings. She knew that telling you now might make things more difficult for you, but she wanted to be honest with you.”

Yuri: “Sayori…I think we should all go home together after school today. You need some time to yourself, and we can support you through this tough moment in your life.”

MC: “Yeah, we’re all here for you, Sayori. And don’t worry about us. We’ll take care of the clubroom.”

Sayori: “Okay…thank you guys so much. You’ve always been there for me, even when I didn’t deserve it.”

(We all hugged her and gave her reassuring smiles.)

MC: “And we still support MC as a member of our club. We won’t let him get away with anything again.”

Yuri: “Yes, but we also understand that he has his own struggles in life. We just hope that he can continue to grow and become a better person for himself and those around him.”

Natsuki: “And I’m glad Sayori’s pregnancy is going well. She’ll make an amazing mom when the time comes.”

Sayori: “Thank you guys so much for your support. I really needed that right now.”

(We all left together after school, heading towards our homes to spend some quality time with Sayori and her sister.)

Yuri: “So, what’s it like being pregnant?”

Sayori: “Well, there are a lot of new things I have to learn, and it’s been an adjustment. But I’m really excited to be a mom soon.”

Monika: “That’s so exciting! And we can all help you when the time comes.”

(We continued on our journey, supporting Sayori as she faced this new chapter in her life.)

Natsuki: “It must be tough to deal with your own sister’s loss while going through this pregnancy. I know how much it means to her that you’re carrying her baby.”

MC: “And we all want to support Sayori as she goes through these life-changing experiences.”

Sayori: “Thank you guys so much for everything you did today. You really helped me get through this tough time in my life, and I won’t forget it.”

(As we finally arrived at Sayori’s house, the door opened to reveal her sister standing there.)

Sayori’s Sister: “Oh, hey guys! It’s so good to see you all again. And especially after such a difficult day.”

Yuri: “It was an interesting day, that’s for sure.”

Monika: “Well, we’re here for Sayori, and she can always count on us as friends.”

Natsuki: “We won’t let you down, Sayori. And if you need anything, just ask.”

MC: “Yes, and I want to thank all of you for your support today. It means a lot to me as well.”

Sayori: “Thank you everyone for coming here today. This was really helpful for me to get some perspective on things and know that we’re all in this together.”

### Conclusion:
(I could see the happiness in Sayori’s eyes as she looked at us with a grateful smile. And I knew that we had all been through a lot together, and that our friendship was stronger than ever before.)

Natsuki: “And now that you know what happened between MC and his sister, you won’t have to worry about being pregnant anymore.”

Sayori: “Yes, I’m glad we can finally move forward as a club. And I really appreciate all of your support today.”

(We all hugged each other as Sayori’s smile grew even wider.)

MC: “Well, I guess the club room will be open again soon enough. But for now, let’s just focus on supporting our friends and helping them through tough times.”

Sayori’s Sister: “Exactly! We need to stick together as a family, no matter what happens in life.”

Natsuki: “I couldn’t have said it better myself.”

Monika: “Yes, we are stronger when we work together and support each other.”

Yuri: “And that’s exactly what our club stands for. We may not always agree or understand certain situations, but we can always find a way to work things out in the end.”

Sayori’s Sister: “That’s right! And I’m really proud of all of you. You guys have been through so much together and have become even closer as friends over time.”

(The conversation continued for some time, and we eventually parted ways with Sayori’s sister. But our bond as a club remained strong, and I knew that we would continue to support each other no matter what.)
