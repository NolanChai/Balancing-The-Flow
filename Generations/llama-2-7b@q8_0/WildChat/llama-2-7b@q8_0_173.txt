I've seen a number of posts regarding how to get the red flower with the white stripe. Here is what I did, and I hope it helps someone else! It was not hard at all.
The easiest way (at least for me) was to find a piece of a tree that has nice bark on it. Find one with no cracks or anything like that.
1. Gather up the bark and cut it into chunks, about 4-5 inches in diameter. I used a box cutter since I don't own a saw.
2. Heat the pieces of wood over the fire for quite some time until they are all black on one side. Put them on the cool end so that you don't burn your fingers, and watch closely! It doesn't take long at all to get the blackness onto both sides, and then some.
3. Flip over each piece of wood into the flame for a few seconds until they are red and shiny. Repeat on the other side of each chunk.
4. Set these aside and repeat with more pieces if you would like! You may not get a perfect striped flower, but it should be close enough that you can paint over it with your acrylics when you're finished. I'm sure this method also works on other woods...I just used the piece of bark off of our tree because I didn't have anything else handy!
