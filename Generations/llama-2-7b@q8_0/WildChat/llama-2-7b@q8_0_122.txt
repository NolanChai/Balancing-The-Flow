The first thing to note here is that if you were going to make it darker than black, you could use something like this:
```css
.dark {
    background-color:#000;
}
```
This would give all your elements a dark grey/black background.
Now for the TVs...

To start with, I would create two TVs and apply different background colours to them using CSS.

I'll use the following code to demonstrate what you can do:

```html
<div class="tv">
    <img src='/assets/img/tv_1.png'/>
</div>
<div class="tv">
    <img src='/assets/img/tv_2.png'/>
</div>
```
And for CSS:
```css
.tv {
    width:50%;
    height:50px;
    background-color:red;
}

/* Set a different background colour for each TV */
@media screen and (max-width : 1360px) {
    .tv:nth-child(evenn) {
        background-color:green;
    }

    .tv:nth-child(odd) {
        background-color:blue;
    }
}
```
You can also use this code to create a static image from your TVs, which is useful for animation purposes.

To use it you would replace the background colours with the images:

```css
@media screen and (max-width : 1360px) {
    .tv:nth-child(evenn) {
        background-image: url(/assets/img/tv_2.png);
    }
}
```
Using this code, I can create the effect of two TVs which only show the static image when the screen is small enough for them to be on a single line (see example).

### Response 1:
Additionally, you could use media queries and change the background-image for each tv according to the width of the window. This would make it more dynamic!
```css
@media screen and (max-width : 1360px) {
    .tv:nth-child(evenn) {
        background-image: url(/assets/img/static_tv.png);
    }
}
```
