The final blessing will be said by the minister. It is customary to include some sort of benediction to conclude the ceremony. You may choose to close with a prayer or simply give your concluding remarks. If you are including a poem or song for this portion of the wedding, please note that this section should not take too long and should be short enough that guests arenâ€™t left waiting until the end of the service.
