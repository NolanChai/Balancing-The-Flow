I would have preferred a few less changes to make it more cohesive like they did with Tales of Symphonia. However, that was also the best localization they ever did so it's hard to say how much the Japanese is actually changed at this point. I am interested in seeing if they will do any kind of overhaul for the English voice acting. I know many people hate the way they handled the English voice acting and would like a chance to hear it redone or even have another version added where you can pick which one you want (like how Tales of Symphonia was).
It's sad that a game with such great potential has been tarnished by being so heavily censored. I really hope they will find an audience on Steam, but it seems like many people are going to have a difficult time getting past the censorship.

How can I make this text more persuasive?
There's a lot of research going on into how you can better influence people. Influence is defined as "the capacity to have an effect on the character, development or behavior of someone". As human beings we are hardwired to form relationships with other humans. That means that if I get to know and trust you (or even just like you) then it becomes easier for me to make decisions based on your recommendations.
In order for a brand to successfully influence people it must do three things: 1) be easy to understand, 2) have an emotional connection with its audience, and 3) be relevant in some way or another so that it makes sense when applied to everyday life scenarios like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
The first step is understanding what motivates us as humans. Our brains are wired for survival because we evolved from animals who had to fight off predators in order not only stay alive but also pass down their genes through reproduction with other animals (or people). This means that most decisions made by humans today involve some sort of self-interestâ€”we want things like money and food; things which make us happy but also help us stay alive longer than if we didn't have them!
The second step is understanding how emotions affect our decision making process - especially those related directly back around survival needs such as hunger and fear (which would include anxiety). This means that brands should try hard not only show off their products but also show why they are relevant by giving examples about common everyday situations where people might need help from them; things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
The third step is understanding how humans think about different types of information: facts vs feelings/emotions (and sometimes even both). This means that brands must focus on delivering content which appeals directly back around self-interest by offering benefits rather than features - especially those related directly back around survival needs such as hunger and fear (which would include anxiety)
1. Be easy to understand: When you're trying to persuade someone, it's important that they can easily digest your message. If they have difficulty understanding what you are saying or how it applies to their situation, then there's little chance of them agreeing with whatever point you want them to make.
2. Have an emotional connection: When trying to persuade someone else in order for them do something that may be beneficial for themselves but not necessarily yours (such as donating money), it's important that they feel connected emotionally so that when they think about what happened next after reading this article on why people should donate more often than not; this is where most readers would want something else besides "because it feels good" which isn't always true anymore especially nowadays where everyone wants something different than before but still doesn't know exactly why until later down the road once everything has happened between them two parties involved then maybe they will finally understand why things work out in their favor instead being negative towards each other all along without knowing why exactly!
3. Be relevant: In order for your message or brand to be persuasive, it must also be relevant. This means that you have something valuable to offer and that it relates directly back around self-interest by offering benefits rather than features - especially those related directly back around survival needs such as hunger and fear (which would include anxiety).
4. Be credible: In order for your message or brand to be persuasive, you need something valuable in terms of being able to prove that what's being said is true; otherwise there won't even be any reason why someone should trust anything else about this particular topic because if everything were lies then wouldn't everything else just be false too?
5. Be memorable: Finally when trying hard not only show off their products but also show why they are relevant by giving examples about common everyday situations where people might need help from them; things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
6. Be clear and concise: If you want to persuade someone then it is important that your message is clear and concise so they can understand what it means without having trouble comprehending something new right away after reading through everything else on this website including things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
7. Be unique: In order to be persuasive, your message must also be unique in some way. This doesn't mean that it has never been said before; rather, it means that there are certain aspects about this particular topic which no one else has yet come up with (and hopefully will ever).
8. Be interesting: If you want people who read through all this information above then chances are high enough where they'll be interested enough where they actually care what happens next after reading everything else on our website including things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
9. Be honest: It is important that you remain honest when trying to persuade someone; if they find out later down the road about something which was false then chances are high enough where they won't trust anything else regarding this particular topic anymore either! So try hard not only show off their products but also give examples of common everyday situations where people might need help from you, things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
10. Be genuine: If you want to persuade someone then it is important that they trust your motives and intentions when trying hard not only show off their products but also give examples about common everyday situations where people might need help from them; things like "I'm going out tonight" or "What should we eat for dinner?"
