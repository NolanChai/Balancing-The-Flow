This paper is based on the experimental study and theoretical analysis of the process flow of a single-pass catalytic reactor for the conversion of CO2 into liquid hydrocarbons. The authors also developed a theoretical model to predict the CO2 SPCE at different temperatures, pressures, reaction time (reaction duration) and concentrations. 

### Recommendation:

This paper is an interesting review that highlights recent progress on single-pass catalytic CO2 conversion processes from the perspective of various reaction conditions. The authors have clearly explained how different reaction conditions can affect the overall CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems through the single pass CO2 SPCE. The researchers used their previous models to further explain this relationship between process variables, but I think they should have analyzed how other process parameters such as temperature, reaction time and concentration affect the overall conversion efficiency and energy efficiency of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems.
