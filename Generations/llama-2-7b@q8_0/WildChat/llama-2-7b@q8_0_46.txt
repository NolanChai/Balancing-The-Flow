# Introduction

* The introduction should grab the reader's attention so that he or she is interested in reading further.

  * It provides a glimpse of what will follow in the body paragraph(s).
  
  * It gives context for your paper by explaining what you are talking about and why it’s important to study this topic.

* The introduction can be written in two parts:

1. Hook, which grabs your reader's attention
2. Background information that explains the issue and shows its importance to your readers

* Writing an introductory paragraph is easier than writing a thesis statement because you are not trying to limit yourself by choosing one main idea over another; instead, you’re simply providing context for what follows afterward in terms of content (and possibly structure).

## Hook

A hook is the first sentence(s) or two that capture readers' attention.

* A good hook should be:
  1. Short and sweet - no more than three sentences long, preferably just one!
  2. Engaging and interesting - make sure it grabs your reader’s attention from the get-go with a little humor or shock value (but not too much!)
  3. Relevant to what follows afterward in terms of content as well as structure; this means using specific examples where possible rather than generalizing about how things work overall.

* The hook is your opening sentence, and it should be the most compelling part of your essay. 
The first paragraph in an essay introduces the topic and indicates the focus of the essay.
If you are writing a research paper, then this will not be true for every section; but even if your paper isn’t organized according to headings or chapters (which most aren’t), it still needs some kind of introduction before moving into its body paragraphs! 

## Transitions

Transitions are words and phrases that signal the reader to move from one idea, thought, or sentence to another. These devices help smooth the flow between sentences by providing a bridge for them all to travel across together as if they were on a conveyor belt! They also provide closure at certain points where you might want your readers' attention focused somewhere else entirely so that they don’t get lost during transitions themselves.

* Transition words and phrases help make an essay more coherent by connecting different sentences together into one cohesive unit instead of having each paragraph stand alone without any relationship whatsoever with its neighbors beyond being physically adjacent on paper! 
A transition is a word or phrase that signals to the reader that you're moving from one idea, thought, or sentence to another. This helps smooth out your writing by giving your readers more time to digest information before moving onto something else—and it also lets them know where they should be focusing their attention so as not get lost while reading!

## Thesis Statement

A thesis statement is the main idea or claim of an essay. 
It tells readers what you will cover in your paper and how you will do so, including any arguments against it if there are any (or if not then why). 
In other words: It's like saying "Hey everyone! I'm writing this essay about X topic here!" before getting into detail on that subject matter itself with supporting evidence later down below within each body paragraph after having introduced yourself first at top above somewhere else along way somewhere else somewhere else again somewhere else too much somewhere else way over there somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else someplace else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else someplace else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else someplace else

## Background

Background is the information you need to know in order to understand a topic or subject. It can be anything from an explanation of how something works, why it matters and what its consequences might be if left unchecked; background includes both historical context as well as current events that have shaped our thinking about that issue today (and tomorrow).
