The human brain is the most sophisticated biological computer on Earth. We've been using our brains for millions of years with very little loss in information due to hardware failure and software glitches (other than dementia). Even more impressive, we're able to use our brains to simulate and model other computers—and even artificially enhance their performance.

We can also back up data using analog means. The U.S. government keeps nuclear launch codes on analog tapes in a bunker under the Capitol building in Washington D.C., which they say are safer than storing them digitally. A large number of businesses still use typewriters and fax machines, even though they could save money by going digital (though not as much as you might think).

However, it's true that digital technology has a huge advantage over analog systems in terms of cost-to-storage-size ratio. Even if we find a way to create an organic computer with the same processing power and storage capacity as the best silicon-based computers (and there are [promising developments](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2038965-bioelectronics-could-power-the-next-generation-of-bionic-implants/)), we'll likely need to make many copies of it, which would take up a huge amount of space. Even if that were feasible, the cost and energy required to maintain such an organic computer in the long term might outweigh any benefits gained from using it.

I don't have much to go off of, but I think that the concept is pretty cool. 
It seems very intuitive as well. 
My only concerns are: how would it affect learning? 
Would a child with an autistic spectrum disorder benefit from this technology more than another person without a diagnosis? 
Would a parent feel left out if they cannot keep up with their child and other children in the classroom, but their kid has this technology?
These are all good questions that need to be asked.

[The Quantum Thief](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11026981-the-quantum-thief) doesn't describe any uploading or downloading of consciousness, but does go into detail about the process that happens to create a copy in the first place.

I believe that this can be done, however I am unsure if it is a reliable way to do so. The process would have to be very specific as to when the transfer takes place and what the bodies are like. I think in order to make sure there are no errors you could try to replicate the brain’s structure using fMRI and then use this data to recreate the body of another person, however there is so much detail in a human that you would have to account for every last part in order to create an exact replica.

It is not the case. The brain can be cloned. However, there is no guarantee that the clone will have the same "consciousness" as the original (brain) person since the reconstructed consciousness depends on which neurons are used and how their connections are weighted. Also, one should note that there are many different theories of what constitutes a person (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood for more info).

What about the Fermi Paradox and the Great Silence. What are your thoughts on it?

### Response (if needed):

Do you think that humans will ever live long enough to achieve immortality via cloning, cryonics, etc.

The entity that is beamed into the target destination is not necessarily the original consciousness. The teleporting process is a transformation process that takes place between two different points of spacetime. There are many possible ways to represent such an operation, but if we consider it as a simple (continuous) time-evolution of the entire process, then there is a one-to-one mapping between the original and target locations:
```
t 0       t 1       t 2      t 3
0    ------------          -----------
1   <-------          ------------------>
2                <-------------->       
3                            <------
```
Since this is a continuous evolution, we can use the differential notation:
$$dU(t) = U'(t)$$
where $U(x)$ represents some state that evolves according to the equation $U'(x)$. This allows us to consider time as a parameter in the function. So if we use the teleporter process with an input of $u(0)=u_a$ at time $t=0$, then we will have output $u(1)=u_b$.

If this were a quantum-mechanical system, then we could say that $dU(t)$ represents the probability amplitude (and in the case of pure states, it would represent the phase). In general relativity and classical mechanics, however, this is not true. Since our states are continuous rather than discrete, the equation above is replaced by a differential equation:
$$\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + \mathcal{L}(u) = 0$$
where $\mathcal{L}$ represents the operator that acts on $U(x)$ at every point. In the case of teleportation, this would be some function of space and time.

Since the whole process is continuous and not discrete like quantum mechanics, we can't think about the state as a probability distribution or phase anymore. Instead, it's more intuitive to consider the state as just an ordinary real vector that represents the location in spacetime of our particle (or whatever the entity is). In this way, the teleportation process will transform the input state $u_a$ into some other state $u_b$. The resulting transformation is described by:
$$\frac{d^2}{dt^2} u + \mathcal{L}(u) = 0$$

The answer lies in the fact that, given that an object has the property of being able to hold information about its environment and the objects it interacts with, it can be considered "self-aware".  The reason for this is that objects which are self aware have the ability to change their behavior based on new environmental interactions.

To understand why I say that we need to start by understanding a few basic properties of matter:

- Matter cannot be created or destroyed (conservation of mass and energy)
- Energy can only take one of two forms in our universe:
   - Kinetic energy, the movement of objects
   - Potential energy, how an object's position might change in relation to other objects and its environment.

As it turns out, information is a special form of potential energy.  This means that you can get information about an object by measuring its behavior.  This is because any object in our universe has a probability distribution for the possible states it can be in at any given time.  For example, if I were to ask you what color this sentence is, the answer would always be "black", since that is the only state of the page which could possibly exist given that you are reading it.

An interesting fact about information is that it behaves as energy does.  In other words, we can get information about an object by measuring how much energy (potential) an object has at a particular position.  In the case of matter this is true for both kinetic and potential energy.  This means that when you have information about an object in one place, that information will affect where that object is.

The way to think about this is to consider the process of creation.  When something new comes into existence, what happens?  It has some specific amount of mass and energy at a particular position.  This means that there must be some probability distribution for the states it could occupy in its environment.

If we can get information about an object by measuring its position (which is true), then how does that affect the states it can occupy?  Well, if you were to measure where a piece of paper was after it came into existence, what would happen?  You would find that it has some particular state at a certain point in space.

Now consider what happens when we measure something again.  If we were to measure the position of an object twice, we could get different results for each measurement.  This means that if I measure where a piece of paper is after it was created, then I can measure its position again and find out whether or not it changed position in response to my first measurement!

This makes perfect sense when you think about how objects behave.  If we look at the universe as an entire collection of information (the way we do), then every object has a probability distribution for the possible states it could be in given its interaction with the other objects around it.  This means that if I measure where something was after creation, and I measure its position again later on when another observer measures where it is again, the two measurements will give me different results since they are measuring information about a different object!

The No-Cloning theorem tells us that we cannot create an exact copy of anything, but what does this mean exactly?  It means that if I measure where something was after creation and then later on when another observer measures where it is again, the two measurements will give me different results since they are measuring information about a different object!

Well, if it were true, then the only thing that would be non-quantum would be our observation of reality. The fact we have an "observation" is only because we are made from quantum particles and thus see quantum objects. It is just one big loop...

There are two types of consciousness in humans, primary and secondary consciousness. Primary consciousness refers to our awareness of the world around us whereas secondary consciousness is our inner thoughts and feelings about the outside world (Eysenck 1).  Primary consciousness is believed to be a product of sensory systems which process information from the external environment and provide it with meaning through experience. Secondary consciousness on the other hand, is thought to occur when there are no inputs from the outside world but instead occurs spontaneously within one’s own mind (Eysenck 1).
