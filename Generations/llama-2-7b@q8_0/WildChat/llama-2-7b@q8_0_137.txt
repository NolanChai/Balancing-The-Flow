* subjective - we determine the magnitudes ourselves, using a scale of our own making.
* objective - we can observe magnitude based on how much energy has been released.

Objective:
- PGA(peak ground acceleration)
- PGV (peak ground velocity)
- RMS(Root mean square)
- HS(Harmonic standard deviation)
- LF(Low frequency)
- HF(High frequency)
- DP(Damping percentage)
Subjective:
- Strength
- Intensity

### PGA
$$\begin{align}	PGA=\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{\Delta^{2}}{\left( 1-\tan ^{2}(\gamma /2)\right)}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\end{align}$$
