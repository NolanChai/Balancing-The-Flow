Same as above but counter clockwise.  Gap of Dunloe (with a short stop to walk up to the waterfall) and the lake district. [/INST]
Drive from Galway to Doolin (and back) along the coast and view the cliffs of Moher.  Catch a boat tour of Aran Islands. [/INST]
Same as above but go through the Burren instead of Clare Island and go through County Mayo instead of Donegal.   [/INST]

Monday morning we headed out of Dublin around 7:30. The first stop was the Rock of Cashel which is about a 2 hours drive from Dublin. It is a beautiful castle and cathedral but it does get a bit busy when there are groups touring so keep that in mind if you decide to go. After visiting this place we had some lunch before heading out on our way back to the coastal town of Killarney.
I have always wanted to drive around Ireland, I like to think about it as driving through a really beautiful green fairy tale land. Once you get into Killarney, there is a small town that has an abundance of cute shops, restaurants, and hotels. We checked in at one of the local B&B’s (Dromquinna Manor). After settling in, we set out to see some sights around the area including Ross Castle.
Ross castle is a 15th-century tower house located on Lough Leane, near Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland.[1] It stands on a small island, accessible at low tide, with a causeway connecting it to the mainland. It was built in the late 15th century by O’Donoghue Mór, ruler of all Ireland and Lord of Kerry.[2] It is protected as a national monument and open to the public throughout the summer season
The town of Killarney is also known for it’s horseback riding and we decided to go out on the tour that included going through Gap of Dunloe (a natural limestone passage) and crossing the glacial lakes on the way. It was a great activity, especially if you are looking for something unique to do while traveling.
We finished our night at “The Blarney Stone” which is a castle that has the world famous Blarney stone in it’s gardens. The Blarney Stone (Irish: Lia Fáil) is the legendary Stone of Eloquence, set into the wall of Blarney Castle, Blarney, Ireland. Kissing the stone while hanging upside down off the castle wall traditionally endows the kisser with the gift of the gab (great eloquence or skill at flattery).
Day 2: Travel to Cork and visit Cobh/Queenstown

Re: [Trip Report] Organize a one day driving trip and show appropriate time needed for us that makes this the most effective use of our time.
I will be there next week on 28th & 29th July... I can give you an update about Killarney, Kenmare area.
In my opinion the Ring of Kerry is not worth to visit since it's a very touristic route and overcrowded with traffic. You have better places in Ireland that are much more beautiful than this place.
