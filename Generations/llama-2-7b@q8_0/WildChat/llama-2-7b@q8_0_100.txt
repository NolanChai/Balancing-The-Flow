Hey all! My name is King and I've been playing through Half-Life for the first time (with the exception of Opposing Force) with a mod that I made. It's a story-driven mod in which Gordon is trying to get back home, but doesn't want to do it alone so he enlists the help of his friends and enemies. The mod contains all 4 episodes plus a short epilogue and some bonus levels (which are optional).
I was wondering if you guys would like to try it out, and give me some feedback? It's called A New Journey and can be found here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-new-journey

I played Alyx's level. I liked it, and I was disappointed when I finished the level. It felt like you had set up a good start to a really good mod. The first person perspective was fantastic, and the way you showed the city through the windows of the bus made me feel like I was actually there.
I know this is the wrong section for feedback on levels, but since my next step is to play the rest of your mod, and I can't see how it starts until I finish the first level, I thought it best to leave the feedback here.
The only other thing I found odd was when you showed the bus driving through the tunnel with a shadow in front of it. It was very disconcerting! ;D

Thanks for the feedback. The story is definitely not over, I've only been working on this mod for about a month and I think it's going to be pretty long. If you would like, I can send you my moddb profile so that you can add me as a friend and we could chat about the mod if you like?
As far as the shadow goes, I was kind of going with the idea that maybe there were monsters in the tunnels? But it probably just looks weird. :P

I'm not sure what kind of monster you would be referring to... It was more the fact that as I was driving along in first person and I could see through my windshield (which is a very nice touch), when I saw this shadow in front, it took me a moment to realize it wasn't part of the environment.
It's all good though. I look forward to playing your mod!

I think I understand what you mean now. I had an idea for a sort of half-lifesized monster that was kind of like a mix between the Vortigerns and Striders but never got around to making it. The tunnel scene is just something I had in mind as kind of a transition from Alyx's level into Gordon's and not really something I intended to actually see or play through.
I'll try to get some feedback on the first chapter though!

Title: Re: Half-Life (Ep. 1, 2) mods that are playable from start to finish
I know this is old but I'm looking for suggestions of good playthrough videos! Any help would be great? :)

Sorry it took me a while to get back to you. I don't really know any YouTubers who do playthroughs of Half-Life but I will say that my mod is pretty good at being able to be played from start to finish, so maybe one of those could work? I've gotten some feedback that the mod is hard to get started with, and I am working on making a shorter intro level in the next release.
I really hope you guys check it out! :)

Well, since my original post here was about a mod that I was playing and I'm currently not playing any Half-Life mods at the moment (but there are quite a few in my Steam library to choose from), maybe you should consider putting up your mod on ModDB for some of our more dedicated members here.

Hey Savage! I'm still here and I will consider putting it up on Moddb soon. I have a question for you though. Do you know if there are any good Half-Life modding communities out there? I haven't gotten into that part of the Half-Life series yet, so maybe you could point me in the right direction?
I do not think there is an official mod community here on TTLG for HL. However, I am sure we all know someone who has played a few and probably some people here have their own mods as well. You might consider asking one of our members to test your mod out and give you feedback!

Hey guys, I made another update for my Half-Life story. This time we get a look at Barney's level, and meet some new characters!
If you would like to give it a try or check out the trailer, here's the link (I was going to wait until after the end of chapter one to post this but I can't help myself!) http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-new-journey
Post by: King on July 19, 2014, 10:55:33 AM
Hey guys, the newest chapter is finally done! :) I've been working on it for a few weeks and I think it turned out great. In this part, we get to see more of Barney and also meet some new characters including a person who was mentioned in chapter one that you may or may not recognize ;)

I'm sorry I haven't been posting here recently. I've been working really hard on getting the final chapter of my story done and I've finally gotten it to a playable state! As always, if you would like to try out the mod, here is the link: http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-new-journey/downloads/a-new-journey-chapt-31

I haven't been around here much because I've been busy getting my mod ready for its final release! Unfortunately that means it is nowhere near done. Right now I have to work on adding in the cutscenes and fixing some bugs. The good news is that the next update will be done soon and you can finally play through all of the episodes back to back!

I'm back! I just uploaded a new episode for my mod, which is currently in its final stages of completion. Unfortunately, I don't know how long it will take to finish but it should be done pretty soon :) If you would like to try the newest chapter, here's the link: http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-new-journey/downloads/a-new-journey-chapt-41

Hey King! I've been playing through your mod and am almost done with the fourth episode! You do a really good job of using Half-Life assets to set up an immersive and atmospheric game. There is one thing that bothers me though, which is how you use the crowbar sound effect for everything (including jumping).
