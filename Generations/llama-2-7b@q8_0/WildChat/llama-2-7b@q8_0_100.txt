The answer is `B`, since the reddit post only got a score of 0 it must have been down voted by some people, meaning that at least 58% of people did not like the post and therefore would not upvote. The post also had 77 comments, which is rather high for such a low percentage of people liking or disliking the post, so the post was probably not well recieved
