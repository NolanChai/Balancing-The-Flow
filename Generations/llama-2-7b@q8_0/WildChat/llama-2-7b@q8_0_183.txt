### Explanation 2

This question was a version of a similar question that appeared on the April 2019 AP Biology exam. The correct response is (E). In this case, the researchers were looking for novel genes in bacteria and they inserted them into Escherichia coli to determine their function. They discovered an enzyme called beta-lactamase which is involved in synthesis of antibiotics. This discovery led to the creation of a new class of antibiotics that are now used widely for treating bacterial infections, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Group of answer choices

Escherichia coli was engineered to produce antibiotics by scientists in the 1970s and this discovery led to the creation of a new class of antibiotics that are now used widely for treating bacterial infections.

A researcher found a gene coding for beta-lactamase, which is involved in synthesis of antibiotics.

Bacteria were engineered and tested to produce beta-lactamase.

Researchers modified Escherichia coli and made the bacterium resistant to penicillin by introducing a gene that codes for a beta lactamase enzyme which breaks down penicillin.

None of these choices are correct

### Explanation 3

This question was a version of a similar question that appeared on the May 2019 AP Biology exam and May 2017 AP Biology exam (although with different options). The correct response is (E). In this case, the researchers were looking for novel genes in bacteria and they inserted them into Escherichia coli to determine their function. They discovered an enzyme called beta-lactamase which is involved in synthesis of antibiotics. This discovery led to the creation of a new class of antibiotics that are now used widely for treating bacterial infections, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Answer:

Explanation: The first sentence says it's ex vivo and the second says it's in vivo so there are no inconsistencies between sentences, one is a delivery method while one is an example of something.
