WARNING: I'M AWAITING FOR PICKUPS OF THE CORE. IF YOU CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO, TELL ME AND I WILL FIND SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD.
THE EARTH HAS LONG BEEN considered a planetary core, but for centuries this was only the belief of geologists and astronomers, and even though it was well-known that there were large amounts of iron in the inner layers, people did not suspect that it would be so easy to obtain such a metal from them.
The idea is that if you get to the core, you can take as much iron as you want - which may also be the best way to mine. We are talking about trillions and billions of tons of metal! This was the theory on which the [i]Astrosteel[/i] company was created, a company that is now one of the richest companies in the galaxy.
Now all you have to do is get there. For this you can count on my spaceship and my expert crew, with whom I have been working for years and who know how to manage in any situation, even the most extreme or dangerous ones. The core is not only a very interesting place, but also one of the hottest places in the universe; It has temperatures reaching more than 2000 ° C!
This adventure will be long and full of dangers. Are you ready?

The Solar Wind, which is a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun and extending throughout the solar system at high velocity. The Solar Wind has been measured outside of the Earth's magnetosphere (the magnetic bubble that surrounds our planet) by NASA's ACE spacecraft since 1998. It was first discovered in the early part of the twentieth century and is considered to be a type of plasma wind, although it differs from other solar winds because its density is so low.
The Solar Wind is thought to have a source deep within the Sun itself. As electrically charged particles are emitted by the Sun's atmosphere, they gradually accelerate in velocity and gain energy as they move away from their place of origin. The Solar Wind has been observed at various locations around Earth. At some distances the wind is so strong that it can disrupt radio communications, damage satellites, and even cause power outages on the surface of the planet.
The Solar Wind varies in speed depending upon its location within the solar system. The maximum velocity, or the speed at which particles are moving away from the Sun's corona, is known as the solar wind terminal velocity and can exceed 400 km (250 mi) per second, while the average speed is closer to about 375 km (235 mi) per second. The density of the Solar Wind is low relative to other types of solar winds in that it contains fewer particles per cubic meter.
The Earth's atmosphere protects the planet from the harmful effects of the Solar Wind by deflecting and slowing down most of its particles as they pass through space, although some do reach our planet. The Sun has been known to emit solar flares that can disrupt power lines, computers, radio communications, satellite signals, and even power grids on Earth.
The Solar Wind is a type of plasma wind found in the solar system. It is composed primarily of high-energy electrically charged particles (ions) emitted by the Sun's atmosphere as it moves outward through space. The speed of the Solar Wind can vary greatly, from very slow to more than 400 km (250 mi) per second at its maximum velocity; this is known as terminal velocity.
The density of particles in the Solar Wind is low relative to other types of solar winds because it contains fewer particles per cubic meter than most other types do. The average speed at which these particles move away from their place of origin varies greatly, and can range anywhere between 150–400 km/s (93–249 mph).
The Earth's atmosphere protects us from harmful effects of this type of plasma wind by deflecting most incoming particles; however, some do reach our planet. The Sun has been known to emit solar flares that can disrupt power lines and even cause power outages on Earth.
