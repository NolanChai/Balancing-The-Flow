<p>Music is no longer an industry that only the rich can afford to be in. The internet has made it so that anyone with a computer or phone can make music in this day and age. You do not even need to know how to play an instrument to produce tracks now. With free online software such as Ableton Live, you are able to mix songs on the spot and post them directly onto platforms like YouTube and Soundcloud without having to pay for a studio.</p>
<br><p>The internet has made it easier than ever before to find your own niche in music. For example, if you are into rap/hip-hop then there is an entire community online who share similar interests with you! There are also lots of websites where artists can sell their beats &quot;for free&quot; so that anyone else can use them without having to pay anything.</p>
<br><p>I think it's safe to say that the internet has had a huge impact on how we listen to and share music today. Streaming services like Spotify have completely changed our relationship with music â€“ now everyone has access not only through paid subscriptions but also through free options where you can find new artists based off of what other people are listening too.</p>
<br><p>Social media has been another huge change in the industry as it's become easier than ever before for musicians (especially up & coming ones) to connect with fans online which helps increase exposure + reach more potential listeners.</p>
