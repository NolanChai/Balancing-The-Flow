It's an interesting time to be alive, when one can experience the "crowd" feeling of a rock concert at home. But it also means that one has to contend with all the disadvantages of that particular type of entertainment. A few friends and I were discussing the idea of making a video game out of this current state of affairs, where you have a room full of people in their underwear.
These are just my first sketches for that concept, but we'll see what becomes of it!
I don't really care how long this goes on as long as I can continue to watch it...
