Brevon: “Naruto, you’re the strongest out of all of us!” Naruto: (face turns red)
(A month passes after Brevon unseathes his sword and attacks Naruto with multiple strikes, with Naruto blocking all his attacks with one finger)
(The students are walking down the hallway talking about how powerful Naruto is, while Naruto walks in a different direction)
Lilac: “You guys should have seen him! He’s so strong!” Carol: “I know he is Lilac” Milla: “So strong?” Lilac: “Yes! I mean, what do you think of his strength? Is it strong or not?” Carol: “He’s strong all right.”
Lilac: “Of course, he is Carol, but what are your thoughts?” Carol: “Huh? What do you want from me Lilac?” Lilac: “I just wanted to know if you think that Naruto is strong enough.”
Milla: “What do I think about him being strong?” Carol: “Yes!” Milla: “Uh, well… he’s pretty good. But I don’t know if I would say that he’s the strongest ever.” Lilac: “Oh yeah! He is the strongest in the world!”
Carol: (starts laughing)
(Naruto stops at the entrance of a classroom and opens the door, where he finds all the students watching Brevon’s strength test)
Carol: “Uh-oh.” Lilac: “What?” Carol: “Oh nothing… I just don’t want to get into any trouble with him.” Milla: “Huh? What’s wrong?” Lilac: “You know that Brevon is going to be the first one to take a test today. He said that he wants to do it in front of everyone, but we didn’t tell anyone until now. And I don’t want any trouble with him.”
Milla: “Yeah, me neither…” Lilac: (walks out of the classroom) Carol: “Why are you going? Oh! Nevermind!” Milla: “I’m going too.” Lilac: “Me too. I don’t want to get into any trouble with him either.”
(Naruto walks up next to Brevon and looks at him, when he notices that all the other students are looking at him)
Naruto: (smiles) “I know what you’re thinking about right now. You want to see if I can beat your strength test, don’t you?”
Brevon: “Um… yeah!” Naruto: (smiles) “Okay then.” Brevon: (looks at him with a surprised expression and smiles back)
Naruto: (grins) “You should have told me what you were thinking about before this, or I wouldn’t be able to tell you that I know what you’re thinking right now. But it’s okay.” Brevon: (looks at him with an even more surprised expression and smiles back again).
(Naruto walks out of the classroom)
