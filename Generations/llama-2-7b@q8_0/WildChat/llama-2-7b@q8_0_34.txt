It’s not so much that you misunderstood (you don’t seem to have), but rather that you didn’t provide enough context for what the author is saying. You left out some important stuff like the citation and the reference style.

The only reason I was able to understand it was because I happened to know the subject area of interest, namely Coptic papyri. That gave me a better understanding of the background context; it also helped that it’s just one of those things that you kinda get after reading 1000 pages on the subject matter (it’s not like I actually understand everything about it but at least have some idea).

In other words, it is impossible for someone who has never heard of Coptic papyri or ever read any book related to this topic to understand your excerpt. So the only way you could have possibly done so was if the author had used very simple language and even then there’s a chance he might not be understood.

Therefore, in order for your text to be helpful as an example of good academic writing, it needs context.
