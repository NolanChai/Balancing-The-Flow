[CLOSED] [Q379-0768] A die used in a certain board game has eight faces, of which 3 are red, 3 are yellow, and 2 are blue. Each face is equally likely to land faceup when the die is tossed. In the game, a player tosses the die until blue lands faceup, and the number of tosses before blue lands faceup is counted.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether or not there is any difference between male and female students’ grade point average. There were three major parts to my data analysis; first, I determined if the normal curve could be used for the data set by comparing the standard deviation with the mean; secondly, I compared the two population means through a t-test and finally, I analyzed whether or not there was any difference between male and female students’ grade point average through an ANOVA test.
The first step of my analysis involved determining if the normal curve could be used for my data set using a z score. I divided the standard deviation by the mean (1.024/88.376 = .011) to find out how many units away from the mean my distribution was. This number can then be compared with the table of values to determine whether or not it fits within the normal curve or if I need to use a different statistical test. (Table 1, page 247 in Mendenhall’s book)
The second step involved determining if there were any significant differences between males and females by using the t-test formula found on page 497 of Mendenhall’s textbook.
t = (86.75 – 83.08)/1.024 (SD) = +/- .973
The p value was obtained from a normal table provided in the back of the book with a t of .16 and n of 213 students. This information could be used to determine whether there is a significant difference between male and female students’ grade point average or if I would need to use another statistical test, such as ANOVA, for more accurate results.
The third step involved determining if any other factors may have contributed to the data set besides gender by using an ANOVA test on my SPSS file. Since we had a lot of missing values in our data set that would not be able to be analyzed through this method, I used the assumption of no covariance to calculate an F statistic value and p value with the formula found on page 763 in Mendenhall’s book.
F = (((408 – 98)*(415 + 112) – 98)/1.024 * (((415 + 112) – 98)/1.024)^2 ) = .693
p < .012 using an alpha level of .05
Conclusion and Recommendations: After analyzing my data set, I found that there was no statistically significant difference between males’ and females’ grade point average. While this finding may not be surprising to some people who have taken statistics courses before, it does present a good opportunity for me to compare how my results are different from those of previous studies. For example, Mendenhall states on page 167 in his book that male students tend to get higher grades than female ones because they study more often and harder than females do. However, this is not true based off the information I found with my data set since there were no significant differences between male and female grade point averages using an ANOVA test with a .05 significance level.
