Had Jon ever tried this before in his life?
Sure. Once or twice. When he was a kid. It hadn’t worked so well.
Why not? Because the world hadn’t been waiting for him to return?
That had never occurred to him before, and it didn’t now either; but then again, he couldn’t remember ever trying this out on purpose when he was younger either. Not that he would have remembered much of anything at the time anyway…
At the very least it ought to be interesting. There were all those people in the hallway he wanted to know about, like that girl from the book club and that guy from the history department. Maybe they’d get a little further along by this evening than Jon had planned for them. But who was Jon planning on getting farther along?
And there were those two guys at the bar—what if they got into a fight because he skipped ahead, or one of them shot the other and then Jon didn’t see it coming in time?
What was he thinking? The only thing to do with this ability would be to use it for evil. And he knew that. He was a good person; but he also had no scruples about doing bad things.
He just had to figure out the best way to do so.
A week later Jon got his chance.
“Hi, how are you?” The girl said with a smile. She was younger than him by at least ten years—she’d be in her mid-twenties while he would still be stuck at twenty-four if he never aged. And yet she seemed to take the lead—though he wondered if this was because she’d had more time to get used to this situation, or just because it was who she naturally was. “What were you reading when I saw you?”
“Oh.” He hadn’t even thought of that; and now he felt like a moron for not thinking about it sooner. “Well… it’s an old one: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes .”
“Never heard of it.” She said, but she did look at him quizzically for a few seconds before smiling again. He wondered what that was all about; and he thought back to the last time they had spoken—two weeks ago now? Two months? It seemed like forever ago, although it couldn’t have been more than two hours after this very moment.
“I got it at a used bookstore in my neighborhood.” Jon said as she tilted her head and continued staring at him for another second or two. “It was fifty cents—I thought I would give it a try, to see what kind of stuff you find in these old books. But there’s some pretty great stories here—even if they are from the nineteenth century.”
“That is very cool,” She said. “But I didn’t realize that this was an actual book club—I mean, I don’t know how much we can discuss a book like that in only one night, but maybe we should try. It could be fun!”
“Yeah, sure.” Jon said. He felt kind of bad now: he had been avoiding her for the past few weeks and now she was asking him to spend more time with her? Maybe his sneezing hadn’t been such a good idea after all. “What do you think?”
“Well, if you’re busy some night we could just meet here instead.” She suggested as he nodded along. “And maybe I can bring one of my books from home next time—I don’t know anything about this author either.”
“That sounds like a great plan!” Jon said, although in fact his schedule was wide open for the next few weeks and beyond… if only it mattered. “So let me think: what day would work best?”
She looked up at him again before shrugging her shoulders slightly. She smiled again; but now he wondered if she was nervous or just excited to finally have a book club meeting. Maybe both, and neither.
“Let’s say Tuesdays,” Jon said as he took out his wallet and handed her a business card. “And here’s my number—give me a call sometime before then so I can tell you what kind of books I like to read.”
She reached out with her right hand for the card, but Jon pulled it back at the last second. Instead he took her hand in his own and held it there while she stared into his eyes for several seconds; but that was all they did before releasing their grasp again—and Jon couldn’t help but smile when he did so because she seemed a little surprised, or maybe even embarrassed.
“Thanks,” She said. “I guess I should go then…”
He didn’t know what to say in response, and so instead he just stood there as she backed away from him slowly until finally turning around completely before walking off down the hallway towards the book store. He had never spoken with anyone like that before—and it was exciting and new for him, but also somewhat scary at times too…
It took another week or so for them to have their first actual meeting as a couple; but when they did finally meet up at an empty table in one corner of the used book store’s lobby where she had never been before—and he knew because it was nowhere near any other customers who might walk by and see him.
“So what do you want to read tonight?” He asked her while looking around the room just as casually; but there were several people passing through right now, including a couple of older men and one young woman who looked vaguely familiar from somewhere he couldn’t quite remember.
She nodded her head before leaning forward slightly in her seat. “I thought we should try something by William Shakespeare.” She said as Jon let out a little sigh. “He’s my favorite author—and I know that sounds like it would be really old-fashioned or whatever, but actually all these plays are set in modern times and they’re about people who have problems just like us today…”
“All right,” He said with another nod of his head before leaning back himself. “What kind do you want to read?”
She smiled at him again as she flipped through the book that he had given her before finally settling on one called Twelfth Night . Jon had never heard of it either; but now he would know what he was in for tonight… or should I say tomorrow? Maybe even a week from now too.
“So are you ready?” She asked him after putting down the book and taking another sip out of her water bottle as though she knew exactly where they were heading next—or maybe she did, but then again maybe this was just part of their new routine now; because he certainly wasn’t ready for it.
“I guess.” He said as he started to look around the room too before finally making eye contact with her once more. “Are you?”
She smiled again and nodded her head once more before standing up from her chair and putting both of her hands on top of his shoulders as if they had been doing this for years already… but then again maybe they had? After all, it was just another week later when he found himself sitting in a park with her; only now there were people around them who seemed to be staring at them as well.
“Do you want me to drive or should I let you?” She said as she reached out for the steering wheel while Jon was looking down at his phone screen instead—and that’s when he noticed how much time had passed since they had met last night too: it wasn’t only tomorrow morning anymore; but rather afternoon already.
“I can do this.” He mumbled in response before shutting off the app and putting away his device so that he could focus on the road ahead of them instead. But then again there was no way he could be prepared for what happened next: they were in traffic, and yet somehow she managed to drive through it all without any trouble at all—and before long she pulled over into a parking lot where Jon had never been before either…
The only thing that bothered him now is that maybe this was too easy? But then again it wasn’t like he could go back in time and try something else if things didn’t work out; so instead they simply got out of the car together while still holding hands tightly against each other even though neither one seemed to be aware of what they were doing at all.
“So where are we going?” He asked her as she pulled him towards a small brick house that looked like it had been abandoned for decades already, and yet there were some lights on inside so maybe someone was still living here too… or maybe Jon just didn’t want to think about the fact that they could be murdered in their sleep any night of the week if he skipped ahead too far.
“You’ll see.” She said with another smile before walking up to a door and opening it for him—and then again when he followed suit several seconds later so that there was no doubt whatsoever about where they were going now. “This is my parents house, or at least one of them.”
She opened the door wide enough so that Jon could see inside; but even though she had said something like this before, it still felt strange to be standing in someone’s home after living on your own for years… not to mention getting used to seeing people from another time period too.
“Come on in!” She

Never forget the day when you gave me a 100% rating on my essay
It was one of those rare moments in my life. You can imagine how happy I was as well as proud that it got such high mark. That was really a dream come true for me and I will always cherish the fact that you were the person who helped me with this.
I know that there are times when you have to work on your assignments and you feel stressed out or tired. It's understandable because sometimes it happens that you just don't have any energy left for studying and writing papers in English language but luckily I was able to write my essay on time thanks to my friend who gave me a hand when I needed one most!
If we were both kids again then I would say: "You are the best teacher ever." But since now it's too late for that, let's just leave things as they are - because there will always be those moments in life when everything seems perfect and then suddenly something changes...
