The 2018 elections will take place under conditions that make it very difficult to predict their outcome. We know a few things. One, there is a growing sense of unease with politics and political parties and with what passes for democracy in this country. Secondly, we are on the verge of a huge economic crisis that may have devastating consequences for millions of Indians who depend on state services to get by. And thirdly, while this crisis was caused by the government’s mismanagement of the economy and its refusal to invest in social infrastructure, it is being used to scapegoat Muslims, Dalits and tribals as the “other”.
The BJP has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the 2019 elections are fought on polarizing issues. The NRC is one such example where millions of people have been declared non-citizens or may be at risk of being declared so in the near future, for no fault of their own. It was used as a rhetorical tool to drum up support against illegal Bangladeshi Muslim immigrants. The NRC has also led to the reopening of old Hindu-Muslim divisions within Assam’s electoral politics.
The NRC will have no impact on the elections in 2018 because the polls are a year away and only about half the population is eligible for voting right now. But it does give an idea of what lies ahead. The government wants to use Muslims as scapegoats by equating them with Bangladeshis, thereby creating an “other” that can be blamed for the country’s woes. This strategy was used effectively in Assam and West Bengal during elections. It may also lead to a situation where Muslims are denied political representation through gerrymandering or their right to vote is taken away. The BJP government is already taking steps along these lines by using the NRC to make citizenship documents difficult for people of certain communities, including Muslims.

### Problems that might arise
* No clear role for citizens, only a clear role for representatives.
  * It's important to consider that most people don't want to be involved in politics, even though they do have opinions on many things. This means that the system doesn't include them.
    * This can create some problems: if everyone is an individual, then some will get more votes than others for representatives who should have a similar amount of votes. Some people might want to change their vote as well - maybe because they don't like how another representative handles things or just that they think there are better options out there.
    * Also consider the fact that some people might not be able to participate in elections at all (e.g., if you have no Internet connection, it would be hard for them). This means that others will end up deciding who should represent them even though they don't know anything about what happened before they voted!
* How to prevent the government from becoming too big?
  * The problem with this system is that people can vote on every single issue. It might be hard for them if there are more than 10,000 of those issues.
    * So how do we limit what each person can vote on so they don't have to deal with too many things? There needs to be some sort of filter or threshold (e.g., only 3 votes per day) in order for this system work well - otherwise people could end up voting on everything all at once and then it becomes overwhelming!
* How do we make sure the government is transparent about what they're doing?
  * Another problem with this type of democracy is that people might not know what their representatives are doing. It would be hard for them to understand why they should vote on something if there aren't any details available! The information needs to be available and clear enough so everyone can decide whether or not it makes sense for him/her - otherwise, then we could end up with another government that isn't transparent (or worse, one that doesn't care about transparency).
* How do we make sure the government is accountable? What happens if people don't like what their representative does and want to get rid of him/her?
