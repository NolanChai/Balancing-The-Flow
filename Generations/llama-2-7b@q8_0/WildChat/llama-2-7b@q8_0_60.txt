I've noticed that you used to love your "big names" and have not really looked at my list. I can send it privately if you would like. There are two more: Heracles-Oupuphis and Apollonios-Kabirion.
The name "Apollonios" in the Kabirion district is likely a reference to Apsinthus (Apsinthos) who was known as Theophrastos, the son of Apollo according to Pliny.[14] Apsinthus was revered by Ptolemy II Philadelphus at Memphis. Apsinthos was also called Apollonios because he was the father of a boy named Apollophanes (ApollophanÃªs).[15]
I'm going to be looking for Apollonians and Heraclesians in the papyri, not only as names but also as places. There may have been lots of little towns that got their names from these gods, much like we do today. I would love it if you could send me a copy of your list.
