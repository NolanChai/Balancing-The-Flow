I like your prompt style! Here are some general suggestions to improve your work.
                            
                            - Add more details in the environment. For example, "sitting on a grassy field under a clear blue sky" does not provide much detail about where or when this scene takes place. Instead, you could specify that it is during sunset at an outdoor festival with booths and people milling around.
                            
                            - Add more details in the composition. For example, "composition focused on the dog's face" does not give any sense of where the camera is placed or what angle it is shot from. Instead, you could specify that the camera is close up to capture the dog's facial expression and body language.
                            
                            - Add more details in the mood. For example, "joyful spirit" does not provide much description of how this scene makes people feel. Instead, you could use specific words like "happy," "content," or "relaxed."
                            
                            - Try to vary your prompts and stay within Midjourney's capabilities. For example, using a lens size in a photography style is not realistic for this generative AI. Instead, you could use a zoom lens or a wide-angle lens. Also, try to avoid using unrealistic concepts like "magical" or "fantasy."
