Yes, I think so. If you're a mommy who only loves your kids that means you're just one step away from being a narc. You have no time or care for any other people in this world and it's all about you. So, basically yes, you are narcissist.
[QUOTE=Oliver;536162]Yes, I think so.

If you think about all of them being good then you could even say that they were abusing their kids by not giving them what they need since it was just for themselves.

So, if being a narcissist means that they will be able to avoid failure then I think it's justified for them to do that since it's only temporary.

I can't see how anyone could consider themselves a "good" mother if they didn't put their children first. I mean, sure, we all have our own responsibilities and other things we care about but those should never come before our kids needs. They are always gonna come first in the end.
[QUOTE=Parker;536180]I can't see how anyone could consider themselves a "good" mother if they didn't put their children first.[/QUOTE]It all depends on what you mean by good, I think that there are so many things in the world to be concerned with and if you put your kids above everything else then it will seem like you have failed. Like I said before, these women don't want to fail, they just want a temporary solution which is becoming narcissistic.

For example: If I were a mother and my daughter was sick then I would probably stay up all night taking care of her instead of sleeping because she's more important than anything else at this point. So, yes, good mothers have their priorities straight but still there are many other things they need to do as well which is where it gets complicated.

It would be like the best thing you ever did or something that changed your life for better so I would consider this good and it's not easy at all, especially when you have kids with different personalities but that doesn't make them any less of a mom.

But just because someone puts their children first doesn't mean they aren't narcissistic or abusive parents, it can be both and in some cases even more than one at the same time!

If you think about everything they did for their kids then it's obvious that they care deeply for them, they just do it in a selfish way which is understandable considering the situation they are in.
[QUOTE=Oliver;536189]I know that but I was trying to explain why these women were still good mothers despite being narcissists.[/QUOTE]Well, then you need to explain how someone can put their children first yet not care about anyone else's feelings or thoughts. It would be like if a mother was abusing her child and the child just thought it was normal because they are used to getting things their way all of the time!

Maybe narcissism is just another form of abuse and they feel like they are doing what needs to be done for everyone else even though deep down inside it's really only hurting themselves.

They may think they are doing the right thing by putting children first but if they do it without any regard to what other people around them need then I don't consider this good parenting skills at all!

It doesn't matter if it was for selfish reasons or not because as long as she was there when they needed something then to me she did an amazing job which makes her good at this point in time even though it might not last forever.

But I would consider someone who puts their children first but also takes into consideration other people's feelings and thoughts as being a better mother. If she doesn't care about anyone else then how can
