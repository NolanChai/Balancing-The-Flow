I am looking at buying a small business and I would like to know what the following questions mean, for example.
I have used the following guide: http://www.entrepreneur.com/businessideas/article81947560.html
My question is why are there 2 separate financial projections in each of the below categories? For example, Why does it ask for 'Projected Cash flow' and then for 'Profit & Loss'. I get that they are different but I was not sure why they were asking me to provide two seperate statements.
I have looked at a few other examples on the net and found very similar questions such as this: http://www.slideshare.net/NatalieRivera10/sba-523-business-plan-guidelines-sample but there are no answers to this question either.
What does the following questions mean?
Financial Projections - 6 Key Points
These six financial statements are the most important part of your business plan, as they clearly show the lender you have a good handle on how to run an efficient and profitable business.
The cash flow projection shows what is coming in (from sales) and what is going out (to expenses). It's designed to help you avoid shortfalls or overages of capital.
A statement of your company's assets, liabilities and net worth should give potential lenders confidence that you are on top of the financial side of things.
This statement shows how much profit a business is making in a given period of time (monthly, quarterly, etc.). A healthy business will show increasing profits over time, but not at an unsustainable rate.
A projection of how much revenue you expect to generate and the corresponding expenses gives a snapshot of your financial viability and potential profitability for a period of time (monthly, quarterly, etc.).
This is a statement showing how much income a business expects to make over a given period (for example: 12 months). It also shows projected expenses.
This shows what is owing to lenders or suppliers, as well as any short-term debt that may be incurred through the course of a year. It's important to note this statement will only include obligations that come due within one year (so won't show long-term debt).
Financial statements should give potential lenders confidence in your ability to operate an efficient and profitable business, but they may not necessarily tell you everything you need to know. You can get a more comprehensive view of your business's financial health by conducting a break-even analysis.
For example, if you sell $50,000 worth of products in a given year, it's important to understand what that number really means (in terms of profits and expenses).
A good place to start is the break-even formula: Break-Even Price = Total Costs / Total Revenue. So if you spend $25,000 on goods and services, divide it by $50,000 in sales; that means you would need to sell $25,000 worth of products just to break even (and that's before any profit is factored into the equation).
Break-even analysis helps you get a better idea of how much revenue your business needs in order to remain profitable. This is an important consideration for any lender as it gives them insight into what kind of financial risks they are taking on when considering investing in your venture (for example, if sales decline then expenses could go up and suddenly things start looking quite bleak).
You should also note that break-even analysis can be applied to both short-term and long-term periods. So you could do it monthly or quarterly depending on how often you sell products/services. The more frequently you apply this formula, the better sense you'll get of what your business needs in order to operate successfully (and profitably).
