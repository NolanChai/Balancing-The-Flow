Max reveals to Eleven that her real goal is to destroy Hawkins.  She uses a demonic laughter, causing the other characters to turn around in shock, and says, "I'm the one who's been helping them all along. I let it in. I let him take over my body, because they've always hated me anyway."  
She then begins attacking her classmates with a spear before being stopped by Mike and Dustin.  After Eleven defeats the Mind Flayer, Max comes back to normal, saying she had been possessed all along.
