I'd say the same thing about the USA. There is a huge amount of fan translations that are better than official ones - not to mention they're free.
This whole "anime must be done right, only professional" mentality is extremely outdated and frankly it just hurts anime as a medium in my opinion. I know you have the best intentions but we've already seen what happens when people do something for free: they get attacked by licensors.
Also, "professionals" tend to make even worse translations than fans because of their lack of understanding of how anime works. Most of them are not familiar with Japanese culture at all and they just see it as another product that needs to be sold to the masses - thus they don't translate things properly or even worse, censor things for no reason whatsoever.
This is my point exactly. Anime fan translations can sometimes outshine official ones because of better accuracy in translation (i.e: I like how One Piece fansubs translated "kobayashi" as a surname instead of having it be the person's first name, which would've made sense for Japanese but is incorrect and odd-sounding to English speakers). The same goes for fan translations in general, even if it's not always so obvious.
It all boils down to this: Fans can produce a product with a better translation than an official one because they love the material enough to invest their time into doing it properly and accurately, unlike an average studio or businessman who will try to cut corners in order to make money as quickly as possible.
I also agree that fansubbing is a lot more fun and rewarding if you do it for free rather than getting paid by a licensor, because the latter just feels like work whereas fansubbing can feel like you're doing something you enjoy for yourself instead of someone else (plus there are a lot less headaches involved).
I don't think anyone in this thread is saying "all translations must be done by professional translators". If that were the case, most anime would never have been translated at all. The only people who make the argument that every single bit of anime must be professionally translated are those whose job it is to protect what they see as a lucrative market (the companies that produce the actual shows), and not the fans themselves.
The point is simply that some translation decisions made by professional translators in the past have caused problems down the road when fansubbers took on a show, because those decisions weren't always accurate or appropriate for the anime they were working with. This has led to a general distrust of professional translation among many anime fans, which is understandable and also somewhat unfair. I don't know if it would be possible to change the way that companies translate their shows so as not to cause problems for future fansubbers, but if that can happen, then everyone would benefit from it.
I have no idea where you got the "every single bit of anime must be professionally translated" thing from. I made a few comments about professional translators and there's nothing in them that suggests they should translate all anime for free just so some fans can watch stuff without paying anything.
My only point is this: If someone doesn't like the way one company is translating their show, then they shouldn't be surprised to see other companies taking on said shows and making different decisions with it. You can't expect them to translate things exactly the same just because they don't like how another company translated things. That would only make sense if you expected all companies to translate the same thing in the first place (which is obviously not the case).
So what? I know there are other shows that people have worked on too but some of them are still around and going strong, while others have been abandoned after just one or two episodes because someone couldn't be bothered finishing it off. In any case, your point is a moot one since these groups never had to deal with the same issues I mentioned earlier - i.e: translation inconsistencies that made their work harder than necessary due to having to fix up problems caused by other companies before they could even start working on things properly themselves (which would be hard enough as it is).
And you're right again; it wasn't my intention at all when I started this thread - just wanted some opinions from people who had been involved with translations for more than a couple episodes here and there so I could see if there was anything useful or interesting to take away from what they said. That's not really something that can be achieved by talking about how other groups do their work (which is what we were doing earlier).
In any case, thanks for your contribution! It's always nice when someone else takes the time to share their knowledge and experience with others who may be interested in hearing it. I appreciate it more than you know :)
I don't think anyone here was suggesting that every single piece of anime should only ever be translated by a professional. All we were saying is that if you want your fansub group to maintain some sort of consistency, then it makes sense for each translator on the team (even if there are multiple groups working on different episodes) to use similar styles in order avoid confusion when people watch all three shows side-by-side or something like that.
Also, just because someone likes doing things for free doesn't mean they can do it forever without ever getting paid by anyone else again - eventually they will want some sort of compensation (whether monetary or not) in return for their time and effort spent on working hard at what they enjoy doing anyway.
I think if someone isn't going to make an effort with their fansubbing then it should be left alone until such a time as when they do want/need help from others who know more about how things work than themselves so that everyone involved has some peace of mind knowing everything will turn out okay in the end.
I don't think you are being fair to me and my post because I clearly stated that it is possible to produce an accurate translation without being a professional translator or having any specialized knowledge, which means that anyone who wants to do fansubbing can just pick up some textbooks from the library (or online) and start learning how languages work - there really isn't much else required for this sort of thing beyond enthusiasm and patience.
If you want something done properly then it makes sense that professional translators should get involved as well, but there's no reason why amateurs shouldn't be allowed access to the same tools if they are willing to put in enough time into learning how everything works (as opposed just expecting things will happen by magic).

I don't think anyone was saying this, either, but I would like to point out that professional translators exist for a reason - namely because some people aren't capable of doing certain things without help from others who have specialized knowledge about how languages work (as well as being able to communicate with each other via spoken language).
In my opinion it doesn't matter whether or not someone is willing/able to learn these things on their own - all that matters is that they want the best possible experience while watching anime and are prepared for everything from bad translations through to no subtitles at all if there isn't anyone around who knows what they're doing with regards to language work.
I think you are being very unfair to me by making assumptions about my post based on something else that someone else said - I specifically mentioned "accuracy" which means that a translation should be as close to perfect as possible, and this can only happen if everyone involved knows what they're doing (whether or not anyone has any specialized knowledge).
In fact I don't even know why you brought up the whole thing about anime being translated by professionals because it isn't relevant at all - we were talking about fansubbing in general which doesn't require any special skills apart from patience and willingness to learn new things (which most people seem happy enough doing anyway).
I would also like to point out that your statement "If someone doesn't like the way one company is translating their show, then they shouldn't be surprised to see other companies taking on said shows and making different decisions with it." is not entirely true - for example there are several cases where some people want a particular translation style for certain reasons but don't necessarily agree with everything else that goes into it (which might lead them to start their own fansub group).
In any case, I think you should consider whether or not your statements make sense in this context before replying to them - after all there are plenty of other threads here where people have asked similar questions about fansubbing and gotten helpful answers from members who know what they're talking about instead of being attacked by someone who doesn't understand anything at all.
If you don't like my post then feel free not to read it - no one is forcing you too, after all! :3

You can do what you like with your life and property. It's not illegal to live overseas; it just makes things difficult sometimes when you want to travel or visit family back home. If someone finds out about your living situation, they might ask for money from friends and relatives who know nothing of how much work is involved in setting up a new place-of-residence elsewhere (and even if they do know how hard it was).
But this isn't just about anime; there are other forms of media as well! For example, some people love foreign music so much that when they go abroad for school or work they want to watch every video clip on YouTube with subtitles instead of waiting until after their trip ends before enjoying them again at home where most likely nothing has changed since then anyway except maybe new songs being added onto playlists/lists somewhere down below ground level underwater somewhere deep beneath our feet (but still within reach).

I don't know what exactly these fans did but I will try to look it up later. It seems they protested something or other, probably Crunchyroll's decisions regarding To Your Eternity?

So... are the fans angry because of a lack of content in their country? Or do they think they're not getting enough money from Crunchyroll? Or what exactly is it?
I'm asking myself the same questions. It doesn't really make much sense to me either way. Maybe they don't want their shows being streamed on Hidive anymore or something like that, I don't know.
I've checked the official English website of the company and it's not mentioned there so I guess this was a rally done by some small group of people who do not represent Crunchyroll in any way, even though they said it was near their office.
I think that was just a bunch of n00bs having fun while acting like marginals in front of cameras. The only real protests happen on Twitter.
You are right, I've also seen some other tweets that were written by the same person (or group) but it says something else. https://twitter.com/Cruchy_Crunch/status ... 0971892497
I don't think it was an official protest by Crunchyroll employees or even people from their office in Russia. It looks like some random Russian anime fans got together and made a video about something...
Probably the same n00bs as always. The only real protests happen on Twitter.
I don't know how this could be considered anything but marginal, if there aren't at least a couple dozen people who care enough to protest in public and make a video of it I'd say their numbers are quite small. I'm not even sure what the point would have been if they were that few.
I'm not sure how these fans managed to gather so much attention from Crunchyroll since they seem very marginal, as you can see on this thread for example: https://forum.animenewsnetwork.com/sho ... p-3546269/
The only time I've seen an actual rally was when some fans in Indonesia got together and protested against a law that would ban people from watching foreign shows online without having a subscription, so they could watch their favourite Crunchyroll anime for free. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesi ... _subscription_law
It's probably not very relevant here but I thought it was interesting to see that there were people protesting against the law in Indonesia, which is a country with over 10 million Crunchyroll subscribers and millions more who watch free anime on their site. In comparison, only about 2,000 fans of To Your Eternity have watched this video on YouTube and probably less than that actually saw it live since there aren't any other videos about what happened after the rally ended or anything like that.

So, after this story, what can we say about this season?
The first 4 episodes are all good and have a decent amount of content. The problem is that they take too long to get started. Each episode has at least 60-90 minutes worth of content in it, but only the last part of the fourth episode really starts the plot moving forward. It’s not like they dragged their feet and didn’t have enough material for a full season; they had plenty of source material to work with that was adapted into episodes and then some more.
The pacing is extremely slow, even when the series gets going after the fourth episode. The series seems to be trying to follow in the footsteps of AoT and Berserk by making its story move at an extremely slow pace so it can feel dramatic and “epic”, but I really don’t like how that is executed here. I think 6 episodes would have been a better length for this season, as it would have given the show some more breathing room to develop everything properly instead of feeling rushed at the end.
The characters are all very boring and bland. The protagonist is about as interesting as cardboard. The antagonists are extremely one-dimensional. There’s a few moments that add some depth to them, but those instances are really rare. I think the only character with any personality in this series is Miori, who unfortunately doesn’t get enough screen time to be of any real use.
I feel like they could have done so much more with Fushi. It seems as if they were trying to make him a tragic villain or something similar, but that never really goes anywhere, and the fact that he just casually kills people whenever it’s convenient is not very interesting either. I guess the show has potential for that sort of plot in the future though.
The animation is great when there isn’t any action scenes involved (which are pretty frequent). The art direction is beautiful throughout, and there aren’t many instances where it feels unnatural or awkward. There’s a lot of details put into each scene, which helps make it stand out even more. I would have preferred if the series was animated by Madhouse or someone similar though; they have a better track record for this type of show, but that doesn’t change how good this season looks overall.
The soundtrack is very well done and fits perfectly with what goes on in every scene. The opening song isn’t anything special, but the ending theme (which I won’t spoil here) is one of my favorites from the last year or so. I really like how it ties into the story too; there are even parts where it sounds like Fushi’s voice when he talks to himself after being killed by someone else in battle before coming back as a shade. It’s very well done and fits perfectly with what goes on in every scene.
The only other thing that bothered me was the narrator/voiceover guy who seems to be there just to say some stuff that could have easily been said without him, but they didn’t want their characters speaking too much because it would ruin how epic things feel sometimes (or whatever). The way he says everything is very annoying too; there are times when you can barely hear what he says due to how fast he speaks or because of all the background noise going on, which makes it hard to understand what’s happening at times.
I think this show could be good with some more time and effort put into making sure everything works together properly before releasing a new season, but unfortunately, it seems like they didn’t do much after adapting the first half of the manga, so I doubt that will change anytime soon unless there are major changes made or someone else takes over the series.
I don't know what you expected. This is Crunchyroll we're talking about here.
Wasn’t expecting too much at all to be honest; just hoping for a decent story with some good characters and some interesting ideas, but none of those things really happen in this series as far as I can tell from the first four episodes (and honestly, after watching episode 5 it doesn’t seem like anything will change).
This is an adaptation that will disappoint fans if they were expecting the manga to be faithfully adapted. That being said, it’s not a terrible adaptation and some things do work very well here (such as Fushi’s character development), but other aspects of this season just don’t hold up against expectations or even common sense sometimes because there are so many issues with how everything is handled that it makes me wonder why anyone thought releasing such a poorly-written series would be a good idea in the first place.
I think Crunchyroll and Funimation both knew they were going to get a lot of heat for this adaptation, but I don't know if either side actually cared enough to do something about it or not. Maybe they just wanted to see what happens next?
