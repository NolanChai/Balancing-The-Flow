A Podcast is an audio file which can be downloaded by internet users to play on portable media players (MP3 player, smart phone) or computers. The file contains multiple episodes and you can download each episode at once or subscribe to the feed where new episodes are added. You can also listen online if your computer has a fast connection speed.
