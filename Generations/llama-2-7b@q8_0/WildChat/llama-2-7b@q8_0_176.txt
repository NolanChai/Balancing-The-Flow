The fact is that they were selling a product with features that have been removed. That's like you going to Walmart and purchasing 10 apples, and when you get home find out that three of them are missing because the store forgot to put them in your bag. Wouldn't you be pissed? Of course you would!
They have a right to their opinions but I think they have been misled or they are blinded by their own convictions. What's even worse is that some of the players who have been involved in the community for years are now going on about how they used to play it and "they don't know" what happened etc, when in fact they do know full well because they were involved with the project all along! I see people saying things like this as a sign that there is something wrong.
I also agree that you should wait and see for the sake of objectivity but at the same time if it was my money that was stolen from me, I wouldn't be waiting around to find out.
@Ronin: We’re not saying that they shouldn’t feel ripped off; they absolutely should! It’s just that these changes aren’t as big of a deal as everyone is making them out to be and I would argue that the backlash was completely blown out of proportion. If you look at how many people are leaving over this, it doesn’t take much to see why we believe that this whole situation has been greatly exaggerated.[/INST]
If it really is only 500 players then there's no problem with it being a small number. I don't think any of the developers care what most people have to say because they know that if they make a game like this in the future, they will be able to get more players than 500 at least by being much better at marketing and advertising.
I do not agree with the removal of features or content for this new update. I would understand if there were some changes made but removing core gameplay features is not what i am used to from R2 games.
The way i see it, the community should have been told about these changes before hand because most people will stop playing if they do not like a change and they may also consider switching over to other servers if this is how things are going to be handled now.
I hope that at least some of the content removed can be put back in but i doubt it due to all the work it would take for them to remove everything else.
