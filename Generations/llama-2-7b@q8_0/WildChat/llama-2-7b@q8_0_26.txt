Comment: Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.

Answer: You could do something like this using list comprehensions and lambda functions.

\begin{code}
>>> def find_minimum(x):
        return min([y for y in x if y > z])
\end{code}

Usage is easy enough, it returns the first element of the input sequence that is greater than your given `z` value.

Comment: @MosesKoledoye It doesn't have to be an array, just pass a list.

Answer: You can use [`min()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#min), but you need to compare each element with `z`. Something like:

\begin{code}
import operator
my_list = [1, 3, -5, -9]
print min(my_list, key=operator.gt) #-9
\end{code}
