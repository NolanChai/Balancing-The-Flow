Sweden's constitution was adopted on June 1, 1809. The constitutional documents have been revised several times since its adoption and it currently contains a total of 65 articles (which are grouped into nine chapters) and eight appendices. The Constitution is the supreme law in Sweden; it may be amended by referendum if approved by more than half of the votes cast, or by ordinary parliamentary procedure if a two-thirds majority supports the change.
