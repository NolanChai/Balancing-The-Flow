The physician, Bill Hartman, has been a leader in the treatment of spinal disorders for several years. His work on the lumbar region is known and studied around the world. This method was also applied by his brother, Kevin Hartman. So what are the critics of the methods used by this pair? What are their most controversial claims regarding physiotherapy, back pain and the spine in general?
1- Methods of treating lumbar region:
There is no need to resort to any type of invasive surgery or other types of treatments for chronic lumbar disorders. The most important thing is to identify the cause of such a problem and treat it, through effective exercises that are specific to each individual.
2- What is the source of lumbar region pain?
There is no need to go after any source of lumbar region pain if one knows how to find out the exact area from which the symptoms emanate and then use specific treatment methods for it. If you suffer from back discomfort, try not to ignore this fact, but seek help as soon as possible to avoid aggravating your condition, which can even cause paralysis.
3- Spinal discs:
It is true that spine discs are important in the structure of a healthy vertebra, but it would be better to try not to overestimate their value or importance when dealing with back pain.
4- Influence of age on the lumbar region:
Lumbar disorders affect people regardless of age and sex. This is one of the reasons why treatment should always be effective for all individuals, especially if they have tried all kinds of conventional methods without success.
5- The importance of back pain relief:
The importance of dealing with chronic lumbar region disorders cannot be underestimated. Back pain can interfere with any activity or affect the daily routine and therefore it must be treated as soon as possible. There are many treatment methods that help in this regard, but some of them may not work for everyone, which makes it necessary to use alternative approaches that target the underlying cause instead of just relieving symptoms temporarily.
6- The role of physical therapy:
There are many methods available to treat lumbar disorders such as physical therapy and exercise programs designed by specialists in this field who will be able to determine what is best suited for you based on your specific condition and needs.
7- Lumbar region pain relief:
The importance of finding out about the cause of chronic back problems cannot be overestimated, since they can lead to serious complications such as paralysis if they are not treated properly or with effective methods. It is also important to follow up on the progress after treatment so that there will be no recurrence later on due to another untreated problem in this area.
8- What about yoga?
Yoga exercises are an integral part of many people's daily routine, but it has been proven that they cannot help much when dealing with chronic lumbar disorders. This is why it would be better not to rely solely on them for back pain relief and instead seek professional medical help which will offer more effective methods in this regard.
9- The effectiveness of exercise programs:
There are many types of exercises that can help relieve chronic lumbar region disorders, but some of them may be more suitable than others depending on the severity and duration of such problems.
10- The importance of determining the cause:
The most important thing to do when dealing with back pain is to determine its exact cause so that effective treatment methods will be chosen accordingly. This can only happen if a thorough evaluation takes place before starting any type of treatment or program.
11- Methods of treating chronic lumbar region disorders:
There are many types of treatments available for chronic lumbar region problems, but not all of them work well for everyone due to different reasons such as age and sex which affect the effectiveness of some methods.
12- What about back pain?
Back pain is a common problem that can be caused by various factors such as trauma or injury, overweight, obesity or poor posture. It would be better not to ignore it if you feel any discomfort because it may lead to more serious problems in the future especially if not treated properly and on time.
13- Lumbar discs:
Lumbar spinal discs are important for supporting and protecting your back but they do not cause pain themselves unless there is a problem with them or with another part of the vertebrae.
14- Age and lumbar region:
The importance of determining the exact source of lumbar discomfort cannot be overestimated because it can lead to more serious complications such as paralysis if not treated on time or with effective methods that target its underlying cause instead of just relieving symptoms temporarily.
15- Chronic back pain:
Chronic lumbar region problems should not be ignored and they need to be dealt with properly so that there will be no recurrence later on due to another untreated problem in this area.
