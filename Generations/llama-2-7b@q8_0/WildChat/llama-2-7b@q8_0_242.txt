The first time I met my future wife was on a train platform in Tokyo. She was waiting for her train and I was waiting for mine back home in Osaka, but it didn't really matter which way our paths would cross because we were going to the same place--the end of the line.
She had been away from Japan for over ten years and was on her way home after visiting relatives in New Zealand. She was traveling by herself so I felt like I should say something to make her feel welcome, but my Japanese wasn't good enough yet to talk about anything more than simple things like food or weather.
I decided that if she got on the same train as me then it would be easier for us both because we could use sign language instead of trying to speak each other's languages at once. And so when I saw her waiting at the station, I ran over and asked her politely in English: "Please do you want ride with me?"
"I am sorry," she replied. "I cannot understand your accent."
I said "Okay, how about we try Japanese instead?" She agreed to this so we sat down together on my train car and began practicing our new language while eating some snacks I had brought along from Osaka just in case there were no shops available where she would be staying. It turned out that we both liked rice crackers so much so that when the time came for me to get off at my stop, we decided not only should ride together again but also share a small flat until I could find more permanent accommodation elsewhere in Tokyo--which wasn't easy considering how hard it is usually possible find vacancies right now even though they exist because of low rents due high unemployment rate caused by recent economic crisis here (or "recession" if you prefer).
The next day, we took a taxi out to an apartment building near Shibuya station where I had found one available room via online classifieds. We were both surprised how much better our relationship was after sharing this experience together so early into our courtship (it's like when you meet someone for the first time at a party but end up talking all night). After we moved in and started living together, things continued getting more serious between us; within two months it became clear that neither one of us wanted any other partners. This led me to propose marriage right away--even though she had never been married before herself either!
I couldn't be happier with how things are working out for both myself and my future wife so far--and we've only been together about two years now (but who's counting?) We hope this story will serve as an inspiration for others seeking true love in their own lives too...who knows, maybe one day soon someone else may find themselves falling head over heels for another person just by being kind enough to offer them a ride on train platform like I did with Talia Mar!
Talia Mar is the name of an English singer songwriter who has been making waves in recent years. She recently uploaded a video to her YouTube channel that went viral, and it featured her singing while pouring water on herself and farting at the same time. The resulting sound was hilarious, and people couldn't help but laugh at what they were watching!
The best part about this whole thing is that after laughing so hard I could barely breathe again (seriously though), it occurred to me how much fun it would be if Talia Mar wrote a story about herself doing the same challenge as she did in her video - but instead of just talking about what happened during filming, she'd write from first person perspective as if she were actually there!
I can see this being an amazingly entertaining read with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments where we get to hear directly from Talia Mar herself what went on behind the scenes while making such an incredible video clip for all to enjoy. It would make sense then that Talia Mar should write this story so everyone can experience her unique perspective firsthand rather than having them rely solely upon just watching another person do it online--and boy does she have some great stories about farting!
