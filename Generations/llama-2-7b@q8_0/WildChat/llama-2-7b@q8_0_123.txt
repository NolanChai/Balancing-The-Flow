[SPEAKER]Hi, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Fellow from Kisumu County. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I am a fashion entrepreneur. This program has opened my eyes to a lot of things that are happening in the industry that I didn't know about before and it really helped me to be more aware of how we can contribute better to society and our communities, even as individuals. It also exposed us to mentors who have been doing the same business as us, which is very important because when you're starting up a new venture or a new project you need people with experience who can advise you on how to do things and this has helped me so much in terms of making good decisions. We4A also connects us with investors that will help us grow our businesses further, which is very important because the future for us as entrepreneurs lies in funding from investors or other financial institutions who can help us make better decisions and achieve more success in what we do. One of these investors includes <INSTITUTE> which has been really helpful to me in terms of my business plan and they also helped us create a better marketing strategy for our company. This has been very important because I don't know about other people but when it comes to business I don't think we are born with that innate ability or skill of how best to do things, so having someone who can advise you is always good especially when they have done the same thing before and are very knowledgeable in terms of their field.
[SPEAKER]I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I'm from Kisumu County. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.  I started my business with the intention of helping people to save money and also provide jobs for my fellow Kenyans, so that they can earn a living by making their own clothes. We are at a time when unemployment is on the rise and it's important for us as individuals or even as communities to be able to create our own opportunities which will then lead to more employment opportunities for others around us who may not have been able to find work anywhere else before this program was introduced. <INSTITUTE> has also helped me in terms of connecting with investors and getting funding so that I can expand my business further. They are really helping us achieve our goals as entrepreneurs by providing mentorship sessions where we share experiences from other countries or even within our own country which gives us insight into what works best for different businesses depending on the location and also gives advice on how to deal with challenges that come up in running any kind of business.
[SPEAKER]Hi, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I'm from Kisumu County. I own a fashion brand called <INSTITUTE>. We are a group of women who started making clothes in 2014 when we realized how difficult it was for young people like ourselves to find jobs and earn money by working with us instead of competing against each other on the job market, which is what happens when there's no work available in your field. So after seeing this problem first hand, we decided to do something about it together because if one person can change their life then so too could 10 people or even 25 people working with us at any given time. The best thing about being an entrepreneur is that you don't have to wait for anyone else before starting your own business, which means we get to be our own bosses and make our own decisions without having to ask permission from another person first - something I think everyone should try at least once in their lives!
[SPEAKER]We4A is a program that has given me hope for the future of women entrepreneurs.  This program provides mentorship, support and advice on how best to grow your business by connecting you with investors who will help you achieve more success in what you do. It also introduces us to new markets around Kenya so that we can sell our products further away from home than just within our own community or city. Another benefit of this program is that it provides us access to events such as <INSTITUTE> where we can network with other entrepreneurs who may have similar goals and aspirations like us, which means we get to share ideas on how best to grow our businesses further without having any competition from other companies in the same field as us because everyone is working together towards making each others' business successful.
[SPEAKER]One of my favorite parts about this program has been meeting so many different people who are passionate about what they do and want nothing but success for themselves in order to make their dreams come true one day too! It's amazing how much we can learn from each other if only someone gives us a chance - that's why I think <INSTITUTE> has been so helpful because it's given me an opportunity to meet other entrepreneurs who are trying just as hard as me but might not have had access before now like some others did already due to where they live or work within their country.
[SPEAKER]I would recommend this program to anyone who wants help starting up a new business because it really does make all the difference when you're trying something for yourself and don't know what else to do! If there was one thing I learned from <INSTITUTE> it would be how important networking is when trying new things so if somebody asks me about my favorite part of this program, then that's definitely going into top 10 without question!
[SPEAKER]It has been a great opportunity for us to meet other entrepreneurs and learn from each other. It has also given us access to events like the <INSTITUTE> where we can network with people who are interested in what we do as well which is really exciting because it's hard sometimes when you feel like no one understands your passion or vision so this program has been so helpful in connecting us all together!

[SPEAKER]I'm a student at the University of Nairobi and I want to become an entrepreneur.  One thing that has helped me in my career is <INSTITUTE> because it introduced me to many different types of businesses which made me realize what kind would suit my personality best, plus there were also other people who could share their experiences with me so I could learn from them as well!
[SPEAKER]I'm an entrepreneur and I started out by creating <INSTITUTE> because I wanted to create something new that wasn't already on

I would like to talk about this in the same way I have done in my past two blogs.
For me, the key message of the We4A project is not just about creating an App which will help people who want or need to stop smoking and that can be accessed through mobile phones. The key message for me is how the app came into being and that it was created by a group of young people themselves.
I have mentioned before in previous blogs, that the We4A project was inspired from some of the stories we heard from young people who were involved in the We Want to Know What You Think programme. The aim for this project is to provide young people with an opportunity to voice their opinions on how they think the service could be improved and how technology can be used to support a range of health issues that affect them.
During our conversations with young people, we learnt that smoking was one of the main health concerns that affected many young people in our communities. So we decided to use this knowledge as an opportunity to develop the We4A project which could help young people and give them support through their journey of quitting smoking.
Throughout the process of designing the app, we spent a lot of time with some of these young people who helped us test out different versions of our prototype app. This also allowed us to understand the main barriers that were preventing the use of other stop-smoking apps and how technology could be used to overcome some of those barriers.
The feedback from these sessions was instrumental in helping the team at Healthy Living Centre to develop an app which we felt met the needs of young people.
So when I think about creating something that is accessible, for example, the We4A app can be accessed through mobile phones, it also allows me to remember how important it is to listen and to make sure that our users’ voices are heard throughout the design process and not just at the end of it.
I hope that by sharing these stories with you all will allow you to have a greater understanding of the We4A project and its purpose and inspire you to think about how we can create more projects which include young people in our communities when creating new and innovative ideas to support them and their families.
