The exposure compensation controls how much of the scene is exposed relative to the "middle gray" setting of your camera's metering system. The metering system will make its decisions based upon what it sees, and this will affect how your photograph turns out. To see a dramatic difference in how an image looks after changing exposure compensation, I would suggest using a grey card with you to control for lighting conditions. You can either set the camera's metering mode to center-weighted averaging or spot-metering and use that as your guide.

For example, if you take one photograph using manual exposure (by setting both shutter speed and aperture yourself) with no compensation adjustment, and another using +2 compensation, the second image will appear to be overexposed while the first will not.
