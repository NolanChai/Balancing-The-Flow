Software engineers take decisions when they work in a team, which ones are they? Which processes, techniques, or technologies must be adopted for this to happen?
The answer depends on what we understand by "decision". If it is about the decision of which tools to use, then I think that this falls within the area of engineering, but if we mean how much to trust a tool and how much to invest in it, then I believe that it is more related to management.
I guess that the decision must be done by software engineers but not always. If there are multiple ways for accomplishing a goal and all of them have been evaluated from different points of view (economical, time, technical...) and a specific path has been chosen to follow, then it is a manager's job to decide which way to choose.
As an example, let's consider a team working on software development in a company where they are using a methodology (a process) that includes the use of tools to support some activities: planning and estimation tasks, requirements elicitation, design, development, testing, etc. Now, the team is going through the process for an application but they realize that the tool used to support one of their activities is not efficient enough to meet all the company's goals, it takes too much time (for instance) to complete a task with this tool. What decision should be taken? Should the whole team stop working until a new solution can be found? No. The manager should evaluate what consequences stopping the activity would have for other teams and choose an alternative that is less efficient than the previous but more effective for their current goals, maybe a different kind of tool, etc.
To conclude: software engineers take decisions about how to achieve the requirements, which tools are going to be used, and which processes, techniques and technologies should be applied in order to reach them but managers decide when a particular way is not working anymore because it does not meet current goals or they think that another solution will work better for their team.
I think that I have answered both questions:

In this project I have to write a program which fulfills some functional requirements. The idea is, that the user should enter his or her name (first and last) in two textboxes. In addition there are some other fields where he or she can specify some information about him- or herself. After that a new line should be written in a text file which contains the names of all students. This textfile should look like this:
Name1, Name2, Name3...
The program has to fulfill the following requirements:
If the user enters an empty string ("") into the textbox with name (first and last), then this line should not be written in the text file at all. The same is valid for any other empty string.
If the user enters a single character as first name, then the line has to be written without any commas:
Name1,...
If there are commas in the names, but they are separated by two spaces instead of one, then these lines have to be written correctly like this:
Name2,,,...
The last requirement is that the program should write a new line between each student (i.e. it has to write the following lines after entering the data above):
If there are any other requirements I will update this post with an answer to these questions as soon as possible.
I tried to create a program which fulfills most of the requirements, but not all of them. I have to use the "WriteAllText" function from System.IO because I have to write into a text file and it would be really helpful if somebody could help me with this problem:
I already used the first WriteLine-Method to add an empty line at the beginning of the file, but after that I don't know how to write my own lines into the file. (There is no WriteLine-function in System.IO)

The key to successful implementations is not only how well the technical solution works but also how it fits into your environment, how easy it is to use and maintain. Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are a set of criteria that define the performance expectations of an application or system. The NFRs cover factors such as scalability, security, availability, usability, and interoperability.
The process of implementing non-functional requirements involves understanding what your business needs from its technology and then designing a solution that meets those needs. In this blog post we will discuss the different types of NFRs and how they can be implemented in an IT environment.
1) Performance:
Performance is a measure of the efficiency with which a system operates or processes information. The performance of an application may depend on factors such as response time, throughput capacity and scalability. These metrics are typically measured by testing scripts that simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., peak traffic). Performance requirements can be implemented using techniques like caching and load balancing.
2) Security:
Security is a key concern for any organization. A security breach can result in data loss, damage to reputation or even legal action. The level of security required depends on the type and sensitivity of information being stored/processed by an application. There are many ways to implement security such as firewalls and encryption but it is important that these measures are tailored specifically for each organization’s needs.
3) Availability:
Availability is another crucial NFR in modern IT environments. Applications need to be available all the time without any downtime (except scheduled maintenance). This requirement can be met using techniques like clustering, replication and backup/restore solutions.
4) Usability:
The usability of an application defines how easy it is for users to find what they’re looking for quickly without getting frustrated due to complex interface design or confusing navigation paths etc… This NFR can be satisfied by improving user experience through better designs, intuitive interfaces and effective training programs.
5) Interoperability:
Interoperability means that two systems are able to work together seamlessly regardless of their different technologies/standards being used (e.g., Cisco networking equipment with Microsoft Active Directory). This requirement can be addressed using protocols like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and WSDL (Web Services Description Language).
6) Compliance:
Compliance is an important NFR for most organizations because they are subject to regulations that govern how their data must be handled (e.g., HIPAA in healthcare sector). The main goal here is usually making sure all policies/laws have been followed when designing solutions so there’s no risk of fines or legal action later on down the road. Compliance requirements can include things like encryption, backups and auditing procedures.
7) Portability:
Portability means that applications are able to run on multiple hardware platforms without any special code being written specifically for each one (e.g., Microsoft Office running on both Windows PCs as well Macs). This requirement can be addressed by using open standards such as HTML5, CSS3 etc… Portable apps also tend to perform better because they’re optimized across different operating systems/hardware architectures rather than just being designed around one single configuration (like desktop versions of Microsoft Office).
8) Scalability:
The ability for an application or system to handle increased workloads without suffering performance issues is known as scalability. The main factors that affect scalability include response time, throughput capacity and resource utilization levels. It’s important not only have a solution capable enough for current needs but also future ones too so there aren’t any bottlenecks later on down the road when demand suddenly spikes up unexpectedly (e.g., Black Friday sales). Scalability requirements can be satisfied using techniques like clustering/load balancing, auto-scaling infrastructure solutions and caching etc…
9) Reliability:
Reliability means that an application will continue working even in the face of hardware failure or software bugs without causing any disruptions to users (e.g., email services continuing operating properly despite server crash). This NFR can be addressed using techniques like high availability/disaster recovery solutions, backups etc…
10) Supportability:
Supportability means that a system is easy to maintain and repair even when issues arise unexpectedly due to software bugs or hardware failures. The main goal here is usually making sure all problems get fixed in a timely manner so users don’t have any disruptions during normal operations (e.g., email services continuing working properly despite server crash). Supportability requirements can be satisfied using techniques like monitoring/logging solutions, automated remediation tools etc…
11) Portability:
Portability means that applications are able to run on multiple hardware platforms without any special code being written specifically for each one (e.g., Microsoft Office running on both Windows PCs as well Macs). This requirement can be addressed by using open standards such as HTML5, CSS3 etc… Portable apps also tend to perform better because they’re optimized across different operating systems/hardware architectures rather than just being designed around one single configuration (like desktop versions of Microsoft Office).
12) Scalability:
The ability for an application or system to handle increased workloads without suffering performance issues is known as scalability. The main factors that affect scalability include response time, throughput capacity and resource utilization levels. It’s important not only have a solution capable enough for current needs but also future ones too so there aren’t any bottlenecks later on down the road when demand suddenly spikes up unexpectedly (e.g., Black Friday sales).
13) Reliability:
Reliability means that an application will continue working even in the face of hardware failure or software bugs without causing any disruptions to users (e.g., email services continuing operating properly despite server crash). This NFR can be addressed using techniques like high availability/disaster recovery solutions, backups etc…
14) Supportability:

In the past, there were many different models of how to develop a piece of software. However, in the 1970s, a series of standards were created that have been used by most software development companies for decades and are now considered "best practices". These include the following:
In general terms, an agile process is iterative (that is, each time we work on it, we build it again to be sure everything works correctly). And incremental (that is, as soon as possible, we start using what we have built). It can also be considered an approach to software development that favors cooperation over documentation.
Although there are many agile methodologies, one of the most widely used in recent years has been Scrum, which emerged from a research project at the end of the 90s on "How do you organize an engineering team?". It has become known as the framework that best combines software development with product development.
The Scrum methodology was created to solve the problem of how to create a successful software project in an environment where there were no defined requirements, but rather only vague ideas and changing customer needs.
To do this, it is necessary to make very frequent deliveries (usually every two weeks or so), thus adapting quickly to changes as they occur without having too much invested beforehand.
As for Scrum's rules, there are five:
In a sprint (i.e., the iteration in which we are developing our software) we do not exceed 2-3 working days of meetings between all participants and with the client.
The delivery is done at the end of each iteration, so that when it begins to be tested, all possible problems have already been fixed. In addition, there must always be a demonstration of what has been done during these meetings.
All decisions regarding work must be made in those meetings and not before or after.
The work should always be done by teams (which are usually formed by 5-7 people) and not individually; each person is responsible for different tasks within the same project.
Each team member must have an assigned role, which must always remain constant throughout development: Scrum Masters are in charge of controlling that everything runs correctly during meetings with clients or other stakeholders; Product Owners coordinate tasks between developers and ensure that they do not exceed deadlines set at the beginning of each iteration; finally, programmers develop code.
What is a software development process? What does it consist of?
A software development process is an ordered series of activities used to design, implement, test, maintain, or improve a piece of computer software (source: Wikipedia).
This includes the steps that must be followed when creating a new application such as requirements analysis, project planning, code design and implementation, testing, maintenance, and quality assurance. Each step can vary depending on your specific situation but some are more commonly used than others because they represent good practices for software development projects.
How many phases does a typical software development process have?
A common way to define a software development process is by breaking it down into smaller pieces. This can be done in two ways:
- By dividing the overall project into subprojects or modules, each one having its own set of tasks and resources (e.g., team size).
- Or simply as different stages within which specific activities take place throughout the life cycle of your product (e.g., design phase followed by development phase etc.).
A typical software development process has 3 phases: analysis, development, testing. The analysis phase is the first step in any project and it involves identifying what needs to be done. Once this has been established, we enter into the second phase which is development where all possible solutions are created for these problems before choosing one or two as options for implementation. Finally, there's testing which verifies whether our solution works correctly by checking if everything works as planned without any issues arising during use (i.e., no bugs).
What are the benefits of using an Agile development process?
Agility is not a specific software development methodology, but rather an approach to software development that emphasizes customer collaboration and continuous improvement. It also prioritizes flexibility over predictability when it comes to managing risk and ensuring delivery on time, budget and scope (source: Wikipedia). In this way, Agile can be used as a term for any methodology or process that has these characteristics in mind; however there are several specific methods which have become widely known under the name "Agile".
One of these methods is called Scrum. It was developed by Jeff Sutherland back in 1986 but it wasn't until 2005 that Mike Cohn wrote about its use in software development projects on his website (source: Wikipedia). This methodology follows five basic rules:
The project must be broken down into smaller pieces, each with a clear objective and deadline.
Daily meetings called "stand-ups" are used to keep everyone up-to-date on progress; these should happen early in the morning so that they don't interfere with work time later on during the day/week (e.g., at lunch). This helps ensure all team members know what needs doing before they leave for home or take another break from their computers!
In addition, there should be daily check-ins between developers and product owners (or whoever else needs feedback) so that everyone knows where things stand with each item on your list.
The last two rules deal specifically with communication: first, developers must send emails instead of text messages or phone calls; secondly, they should avoid using slang words such as "kthxbye" unless absolutely necessary because they sound unprofessional!
Finally, there are several other benefits associated with Agile software development processes including increased productivity due to more frequent releases and greater flexibility when dealing with changes in customer requirements.

[TUTORIAL] I have a problem with a question:
- When designing and writing software code you must consider:
- What is the purpose of the program?
- How are tasks or subtasks organized in this program?
- How should data be collected and stored?
- How will the program be tested for errors?
- Which language/technology/tools should be used to develop the software (User interface, Programming language, Data model, Database)? 
Which of these elements is more important to a software developer when writing software code?
A. Program structure and organization
B. Data collection and storage
C. Testing for errors
D. Language/technology/tools selection[/TUTORIAL]
I don't know what does that mean "program structure and organisation" I have found a lot of information about testing but none about software design, the rest doesn't make much sense to me either...

We know that software systems have different kinds of complexity, one being the structure (sometimes called design) and the other being behavioural. It is often said that we must address both these aspects when considering how complex a system may be. In this blog post I argue against such a viewpoint, claiming instead that there is no need for us to define the breadth versus depth issue in software complexity: as far as the notion of complexity itself is concerned (and not its various types), we do not have to worry about it being too deep or too wide.
What does “depth” and “breadth” mean?
The term “depth” refers to how far one must go to understand a system, i.e., the level of abstraction one has to use when considering a system’s behaviour. The term “breadth” is usually used in conjunction with depth to indicate the amount of detail involved (in terms of functionality), e.g., the number or types of constructs that make up a given program.
When we talk about the complexity of an algorithm, for example, we’re generally referring to its depth because we want to know how much time it takes for a computer to solve some problem—and not necessarily how long it would take someone using pen-and-paper methods or another algorithmic technique that doesn’t rely on computing power.

Yes, that is one of the primary issues in building large systems.
Also, the fact that the system may be too complex to manage or maintain is a common problem as well.

I am doing my final exam for ESE6001 please explain me how to answer Q2 (c)
1. The main goal of using a computer is to provide an effective method of communication, particularly for transferring data between different users who are separated from each other in either time or space. In this regard, what does a computer system provide that earlier methods did not? What do you see as being the major benefits and drawbacks of these systems?
2. How would you compare a distributed operating system with a traditional single-computer operating system such as UNIX or Windows? List two techincal concerns in developing large systems. Are my answers correct? The basic issue is how to handle all the pieces, parts, and relationships or in other words how to decompound complex problem and it's solution.
3. What are the advantages of a single-user operating system over an OS that supports multiple users? If you were designing one of these systems, what kind of hardware would you use with your software? In what ways might the software be enhanced in order to support more users on this same hardware platform? Explain your rationale.
4. Why is it important for a system designer and user to have an understanding about how data is stored in the computer's memory? How can this knowledge help you design your own applications, particularly those that will involve accessing and modifying large amounts of data?
5. If you were required to store very large quantities of data, such as a database or digital library, what type of storage system would you select based on the cost and performance considerations associated with each method? What about when there are a number of users who access this same database? How might your decision change if you had 100 times more users accessing the same data?
6. If you were building your own home, what kind of computer hardware would you purchase based on how much money was available to spend and the goals that you wanted to achieve? List three different types of software that you may want for this machine based on your answer to Q5 and explain why each is useful in a home environment.
7. Explain why it is important for your computer to be able to connect with other computers over the Internet and how it does this. If there are no networks available, how would you communicate with these devices? How can this technology help you do your job or complete school projects if you are using a single-user system (such as Windows) on your own personal laptop?
8. Why is a network operating system better than one that is not connected to other computers? What problems could occur if one computer was still running such an OS? Describe how the Internet enables information to be shared between two or more people at once in a manner similar to communicating face-to-face in person. How might this information sharing help you achieve your professional and/or academic goals, as well as those of your company or organization?
9. If your computer were running Windows XP Professional or 2007 Server on your desktop computer or laptop at work, what would you change to make it more efficient for the purposes outlined in Q8? How might the performance and availability of your system be affected if you did not take steps to do this?
10. List three different kinds of software that are useful for creating Web pages. Explain how each type of software helps you accomplish different tasks. What advantages or disadvantages does using Web-based software have over desktop applications, especially in a business environment where employees use different computers throughout the day and do not want to have to install programs on them?
11. Describe the difference between a website (as discussed in Q10) and an application that uses this data. For example, how would you distinguish between using a Web-based form to submit your résumé versus a desktop application such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Writer to create your resume? How might each of these methods be used to share your information with others (e.g., employers, family members)?
12. Explain what you mean by the term "intranet," and describe how this concept is similar to that of a website in terms of sharing information between people or organizations. In particular, what are some advantages and disadvantages of using an intranet? How might this technology be used to support employees within a business who do not have easy access to the Internet?
13. Why is it important for computer hardware and software designers to have knowledge about how humans communicate with computers in order to create effective interfaces that help users solve problems? What kinds of things should they consider when designing an interface that allows people to complete tasks successfully? Describe two different types of interfaces used by common applications such as Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, or Google and explain why these types are useful in the environment where you work.
14. Suppose that you were using a desktop application at your job for composing e-mail messages (e.g., Outlook) to communicate with others about various projects. Explain how using different software would affect your ability to do this task versus sending e-mails from another platform (e.g., Web mail such as Gmail). What are the benefits and drawbacks of each type?
15. When designing an application, what kinds of questions should you ask yourself about how users will be interacting with your software in order to ensure that it is easy for them to perform their tasks? Explain how this knowledge could help you create a more effective interface, including the ability to predict some potential problems and solve them before they occur.
16. Suppose you were designing an application or website where users would be required to enter data (e.g., contact information) into fields within your software in order to submit it somewhere else online (e.g., PayPal). What kind of feedback should the interface provide users when they are typing and submitting this information? How might this help them avoid errors or at least know what went wrong if something happens during submission so that they could try again with corrected data?
17. Describe a time when you encountered an application that had poorly designed input fields for entering data into it (e.g., PayPal). What kinds of things caused this problem and how might each type be addressed in order to improve the overall usability of your software design?
18. As discussed throughout this course, people often use applications on their computers or mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets to accomplish tasks that require both hardware and software components working together (e.g., writing an e-mail message). Explain why it is important for programmers to understand how different types of machines will perform these tasks so that they can design software solutions that provide the best user experience possible given all available options at a given time?
19. List two different types of input devices that you might use when developing applications in order to make them easier for users to interact with on their computers or mobile devices. What are some benefits and drawbacks associated with each type, especially from the perspective of designing an effective interface? In what ways does having this knowledge help you create software that is more usable than if someone else had designed your application without any input device experience in mind?
20. How would you compare a desktop computer (such as Windows or Mac OS) with a mobile device such as the iPhone, iPad, Android phone/tablet, Blackberry smartphone, etc., from a technical standpoint based on what we have discussed throughout this course? Which type do you prefer and why does it fit better into your lifestyle than another option available to purchase today?
21. Describe how software designers use the concept of modularity when creating applications. List two different ways that this can help them create more efficient code by reducing the amount of repetition required during programming tasks or improving user experience by making it easier for users to learn new functions as they become available in future versions of their software (e.g., Microsoft Office).
22. If you were designing an application, what steps would you take before writing any code so that your program is as easy as possible for others who might need to work on it later? For example, explain how modularity helps make this process more efficient by breaking down large projects into smaller pieces and allowing developers to focus their efforts on just one area at a time.
23. How would you compare software design methods such as "top-down" (e.g., waterfall) with those like agile that are based on iterative development? What advantages do each of these approaches have over the others in terms of how quickly they can produce working applications, along with their potential drawbacks?
24. Suppose someone were to ask you about the differences between a programmer and software designer. How would this question be answered in relation to our course content? Which role do you feel is more important when developing effective systems today? Why

How do you know whether your team is doing its job? How can you measure performance without putting more resources on the task or creating metrics that distract the team from delivering software with value? What is a better way to get your team’s attention when things need to change?
How do we improve our agility as an organization? What’s working for us, and what isn’t? How can I make my delivery process more efficient while continuing to meet customer expectations for quality?
Why are there so many different ways of doing Agile development, when they all seem to result in the same product being delivered on time and within budget? Which model is best suited to our organization? What does that mean, “best”?
How do we get started with an Agile approach? How can I get my team involved without requiring a lengthy training class? Where can I find additional help from people who have gone through this before me and found success?
