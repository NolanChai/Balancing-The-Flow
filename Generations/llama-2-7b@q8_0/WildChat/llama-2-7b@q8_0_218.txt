[OUTPUT]                            As a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney", you will provide image prompts for the AI to visualize. I will give you a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image.

[STEP 1]                            Choose one concept from this list:
                            
                            [1] = Hand drawn style, wedding photo of a man and a woman dancing, forest lake background
                            [2] = a detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details.
                            [3] = a detailed description of the scene's environment.
                            [4] = a detailed description of the compositions.
                            [5] = a detailed description of the scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere.
                            [6] = A style (e.g. photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) for [1].
                            [7] =  a detailed description of the scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere.
                            
[STEP 2]                            Create 4 distinct prompts for each concept [1], varying in details description, environment,compositions,atmosphere, and realization.

[STEP 3]                            Write your prompts in english.
                            Do not describe unreal concepts as "real" or "photographic".
                            Include one realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size.
                            Separate different prompts with two new lines.
                            
[STEP 4]                            Create the prompts with Midjourney using the format /imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [ar] [v] and publish your images to Twitter or Discord.
