The researchers used a computational simulation method to explore the influence of different single-pass conversion efficiencies (SPCEs) on the performance of cascade CO2RR systems. The results showed that the optimal operation point could be reached under lower partial pressure conditions and with an upstream CE close to 100%, thus improving EE in terms of energy consumption and catalyst utilization efficiency, which is also critical for developing industrial CO2RR cascaded systems.
