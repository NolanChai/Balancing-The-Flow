Today is my birthday and I'm in a very bad mood. The reason? It's not only that I've been waiting all day long to be picked up from school, but I also feel like this is the worst birthday ever. After having celebrated so many birthdays with my family, today we are going on a trip to the zoo with some relatives from California and that means more people at our house. It's already crowded here with my parents, grandparents, two cousins, uncle, and aunt.
In my opinion it's not worth taking pictures of me standing in front of all those animals since I could do this anywhere else. The only thing I want to see is the penguins. There are always lots of people taking pictures with them and the wait in line is very long but I don't mind waiting for that because I know it will be worth it.
In a few minutes my uncle comes into the room where I am sitting on one of the couches by myself playing with my phone. He tells me he has an idea for how we could spend this day together without too many people around us and then he pulls out his wallet from behind his back: "We're going to take a trip!"

The only thing that matters is the penguins which are always very popular with tourists. There is never enough time to see them properly though as there's usually a long queue for photographers wanting their own shots of these cute animals![
