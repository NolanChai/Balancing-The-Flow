Sarah and I are standing in front of a building.  She's trying really hard not to look at her phone as we wait for our Uber driver.  I can tell that this is bothering her.  She keeps looking over at it, but she quickly turns away so she doesn't seem obvious about it.

I was sitting on the couch watching Netflix when Sarah came in.  I said "Hey!", she gave me a smile and asked what I wanted to do today.  I said "let's go shopping."  She seemed excited about it.  We drove around for an hour before finding a place that we could both agree on.

Sarah came in through the front door and dropped her bag on the countertop next to mine.  "Hey", she said with a big smile.  I smiled back at her.  She was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which made me feel kind of uncomfortable for some reason that I couldn't place.

I was sitting in my living room watching Netflix when Sarah came in through the front door with her backpack on.  She gave me a big smile and asked what I wanted to do today.  I said "let's go shopping."  She seemed excited about it.  We drove around for an hour before finding a place that we could both agree on.
