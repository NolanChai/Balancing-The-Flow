[ANSWER]: The mass of one hundred chocolate chips is 31g. The mass of the bag alone, excluding the chocolate chip is 67 g. You have to add the two masses together (2041 + 67 = 2108). So there are approximately 2100 chocolate chips in the bag.
[MATH] How many grams of water were added to create a 35 mL beaker?
Answer: If we assume that all of the water is used, then 35 mL is equal to .0467 litres or 46.7 mL and so there would have to have been .0467 litres added.
[MATH] How many grams of iron(III) oxide are present in a sample that has an iron content of 8.75%? (a) 18.3 g (b) 209 g (c) 42.9 g (d) 1,655 g
Answer: In order to solve this problem it will be important for you to know that the chemical formula of iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3 and that there are 100 grams in a mole. To figure out how many grams are present in a sample we have an iron content of 8.75% we must divide our percentage into 100 to get .0875 which when rounded off (to the nearest tenth) is 9%.
Now, as stated above there are 100 grams in one mole and so there would be .09 x 100 moles of Fe2O3 present in this sample. Because we know that iron has an atomic weight of 55.845 u, we can figure out how many atoms are present in this sample. To do so multiply .09 x 55.845 u to get a total mass of 517.62 g.
[MATH] How much does an empty bag of rice weigh?
Answer: To solve this problem we have to find out how many grams are in one cup of rice and then how many cups are in the bag and lastly add them all together. The answer will be given in units of grams. In order to find our amount of one cup you must know that there are 16 tablespoons in a cup, therefore we can multiply by 16 to get 256 tbsp which is equivalent to .489 litres or roughly .50 L.
To determine how many cups are in the bag we must convert our answer from litres to cups and so to do so we will divide the number of litres by the amount of litres in one cup, (which equals 1/0.489). We then have to multiply this by the total mass given (22 pounds or 9.97 kg) and this gives us our answer.
[MATH] A box of chocolates has a net weight of 337 grams. How many candies are in each package?
Answer: The first thing we must do is determine how much the bag of chocolates weighs excluding the packaging, to do this divide the total by four to get 84.25g. Now if we divide our answer by three (which equals our number of packages) we will be able to determine each packageâ€™s mass in grams.
[MATH] How many milliliters of water are contained in a 100 mL graduated cylinder?
Answer: In order to find out how many millilitres of water there are in a 100mL graduated cylinder we will first have to figure out the mass of our 100mL graduated cylinder and then convert this amount into volume. To do so we must know that one litre equals .968 cubic meters, therefore multiplying our answer by 9.68 will give us our answer.
[MATH] A soda can has a mass of 180 g when full. How much does it weigh when empty?
Answer: To solve this problem first we must figure out how many millilitres are in a gram (to do so divide .001 by 10 to get .001 L). Now, multiply our answer by the mass given which is 180 g. This gives us our amount of empty grams
[MATH] A student weighs a sample of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) that has an iron content of 9%. How much does the sample weigh? (a) 5.23 g (b) 604 g (c) 1,043 g (d) 3,270 g
Answer: To solve this problem you must first determine how many grams are in one mole and then how much iron the sample contains. Remember that there is an atomic weight of 55.845 u for each atom of iron(III) oxide. If we multiply our answer by .09 x 100 (which is equivalent to .9%) we will get a mass in grams equaling our final answer.
[MATH] How much water is in a graduated cylinder that contains 65 mL of liquid?
Answer: In order to find out how many milliliters of water there are in this graduated cylinder it would be important for you to know how many grams make up one milliliter and so we must first figure out what the density of the liquid is. The best way to do this is by multiplying our mass in grams with its volume in litres (which will equal .019 g/L). Now multiply this number by our total amount of liquids to get our final answer
[MATH] What is the approximate percent composition for each element in an unknown ore sample that contains 2.64% Na, 14.80% Fe and 78.35% Si?
Answer: In order to solve this problem we will first have to determine what the molar mass of each of these elements is so as to figure out how much they make up our total mass. We know that the molar mass of sodium (Na) equals 23 g/mol and iron(III) oxide has a molar mass equaling 156.4629 u. Multiplying these numbers by their respective percentages gives us an answer in grams for each element present in our ore sample.
[MATH] An empty box of cereal weighs 73 g, and the contents of a full box are listed as follows: water 14%, cereal 86%. What is the mass (in grams) of the cereal?
Answer: To solve this problem first figure out what the percentage of water is in an empty box and then use that to figure out how much cereal there is in a full box. Remember that for each gram of cereal, there are 10 mLs so we will divide our answer by 10 (the number of grams per cup) to get the amount of cups contained in one full box. Now multiply this number by how much water you had before adding any more ingredients and then subtract from your original mass which equals .04 g
[MATH] What is the approximate percent composition for each element in an unknown ore sample that contains 15% Zn, 20% Sn and 65% P?
Answer: In order to solve this problem we will first have to determine what the molar mass of each element present in our ore sample is so as to figure out how much they make up our total mass. We know that zinc has a molar mass equaling 65 g/mol and tin(IV) oxide has a molar mass equalling .104 g/mol
[MATH] A student weighs a sample of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) that contains 8.75% iron by weight. How many grams are in the sample?
Answer: In order to solve this problem you must first determine how much one gram equals in terms of atoms and then multiply your answer by our percentage of iron present which will be .0875%. To do so, remember that there is an atomic weight for each atom found within our ore sample and so we can use our number of grams per mole (16) as a way to figure out how many atoms are present in one gram.
[MATH] How much water does it take to fill a 250-mL beaker completely?
Answer: To solve this problem you must first know what the density is for liquid and then determine how much water we need to put into our graduated cylinder so as to make sure that all of the space inside is filled with liquid. Remember that one millilitre equals .01 mL (or 0.0001 L) and so we must multiply our answer by ten in order to get the desired amount needed for filling our graduated cylinders.
[MATH] An empty box of cereal has a mass of 25 g, and the contents of a full box are listed as follows: water 9%, cereal 87%.

So... mass is a property that can't be described using SI units. You know mass, which is a measurement, but you don't have a unit for it. A unit would give you more information about the measurement than what you're asking for.
For example: mass of crackers (24 g). The mass is given in grams and has the unit "grams." So the unit tells us that this measurement is made from grams. We also know the value of 1 gram, which is defined as one thousandth of a kilogram. We don't use grams for this purpose because they are too small to measure with, but if we did, we would have an additional unit: grams.
For another example: mass of box (328 g). This measurement is also given in grams and has the same unit "grams." So the unit tells us that this measurement was made from grams as well; however it does not give any other information about how big or small these measurements are. As long as you know what type of measurement your data contains, then you can use those units to calculate more precise answers than just saying "it's a mass."
Okay, so how do we find out which unit we should use? We'll start by looking at the problem statement: mass of box = 328 g. This means that there are exactly three hundred twenty-eight grams in one pound; thus if you know the value for "grams", then it is easier to figure out what kind
I hope this helped and good luck with your homework!

Hmm...so mass of 27 crackers = 24g, right? So that would make the total mass (19 grams) less than or equal to 24 grams. And then, I get a total weight of 983 g...

Wouldn't it be the answer for 27 crackers:
Mass of 27 Crackers = 24g (4x5=20) so you have to subtract that from your mass?
So, since you know the mass of the box and how many crackers are in it, then all you need is a formula for finding out how much each cracker weighs. This can be done by dividing the weight of one cracker into its volume (in this case, 24g). Once you have your answer, multiply
