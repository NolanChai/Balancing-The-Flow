Quantum computing is an emerging form of computation that leverages the principles of quantum physics to perform computations and solve problems. It relies on the ability to represent information as quantum states, such as a single particle or a collection of particles, known as qubits.

Qubits can exist in superpositions (combinations) of different states simultaneously, allowing for much faster calculations than are possible with classical computers. Quantum computing algorithms can be used to perform tasks that would be impossible or impractical on traditional computers, such as factoring large numbers into primes and solving complex optimization problems.

One way quantum computing differs from classical computing is in its representation of information. In a classical computer, information is represented by binary digits (bits) that can exist in one of two states: 0 or 1. In quantum computing, information is represented by qubits, which can be in superpositions of both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows for more efficient storage and processing of information than classical computers are capable of.

A second way quantum computing differs from classical computing is in how it performs computations. Classical computers perform operations on bits one at a time, while quantum computers can perform multiple operations on qubits all at once. This parallelism allows for much faster calculation speeds and the ability to solve problems that are too complex or large for classical computers.

Finally, quantum computing is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science, technology, and engineering through its unique computational capabilities.
