This is my first time using INST, so please forgive me if I did something wrong.
The reason for using INST is because I need to write dialogues with different lengths and tenses (e.g. present simple, past continuous and past perfect) within the same scene, which would be a huge headache if I were to use Excel.
Anyway, here's how it should work:
1. Click on cell A3. Enter “Jane’s older sister Andrea was arrested today.” in there. (This is for the title of the scene.)
2. Go to B6 and type “Andrea” there. This will be used as an anchor point whenever you add new dialogues within this particular scene.
3. Go back to cell A15 and type “Andrea said, “I’m so glad I got arrested! Now I won’t have to spend any more time with that freakish family of mine.””
4. Repeat the process from 2-3 for every character in this scene (i.e. Jane, Paul and Mary). Each person should get their own anchor point.
5. Now whenever you add a new line of dialogue (whether it's past continuous or past perfect), just type in a different cell after the anchor point. Easy peasy! 🙂
Hope this works for you. Have fun!
