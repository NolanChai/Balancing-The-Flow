The street is named after the man who invented it, and it is not known if he is alive or dead today. It stretches for an indefinite amount of kilometers to the east and west, but is no wider than 60 centimeters. The walls are smoothly polished concrete, and there are only two doors at either end, both heavily guarded by robots armed with plasma cannons.
It is a small street filled with houses, shops and offices. It has no particular name, but the numbering system makes it easy to locate buildings along the road. In total, it has 172 building numbers. The entire street is very short, barely exceeds ten meters in length. All of its buildings are three stories high, with the exception of a single bakery shop that houses no more than two floors, which stands out for its red brick facade and tall, narrow windows.
The street leads directly to the center of the city. It is lined by two-story buildings with glass facades on all four sides. There are numerous signs above the entrances in various languages - Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, English. Some buildings are under construction or have not been renovated for several years, but others have a neat appearance and prestigious addresses.
This street is named after the famous explorer who discovered it. It connects two large markets, one of which specializes in meat, while the other sells fish. There are also small grocery stores along the roadside, where people can buy food to cook at home. The buildings along the street vary in height and architectural style - some are old-fashioned wooden huts with pointed roofs, while others are modern structures made of glass or concrete.
A wide avenue leading from the central square to the south side of the city. It is lined by trees on both sides and has two lanes for traffic in each direction. On either end there is a large building with an ornate facade that houses various state agencies. The street is named after one of the most prominent figures in the country’s history, who played an important role during its independence struggle.
A narrow cobblestone road leading up to an old castle on top of a hill. It winds through thick trees and past several stone buildings with gothic architecture before reaching its destination. The castle itself looks like something out of a fairy tale - it is surrounded by high walls made of grey stone, which rise up to form pointed towers at each corner.
The street is named after the city's most famous resident, who was an artist and sculptor in his prime. It connects two major intersections with wide sidewalks on either side. The buildings along its length vary from modern office buildings to older structures that have been converted into apartments or shops.
A large intersection surrounded by tall buildings of different styles. In the center stands a statue of an unknown figure, while the streets leading off it are named after various historical events - such as Independence Day and Liberation Day. At night, the area is brightly lit with colored spotlights that illuminate both pedestrians and vehicles alike.
The street is named for its shape. It winds through an old part of town where most buildings are small, single-story houses with red-tiled roofs. The sidewalks are narrow and crowded with people walking to work or school. There are few cars on the road, but they honk at each other when drivers cut them off too often - a sign that this street is not for the faint of heart!
The street runs straight from one end of town to another through residential neighborhoods filled with small houses made of brick and stone walls that line both sides. They look like something out of an old fairy tale, but these buildings are all real; no two-story wooden cottages exist here anymore. The only exception would be those found near the center where there is more space between houses so they don't feel cramped together in such close proximity.
A street with a name that sounds like a person’s first name, or maybe the name of an animal. It has no particular shape and does not lead anywhere, but people walk along it because it is an easy way to get somewhere else. This place may be called "the most dangerous street in the city" by some journalists who want readers to know how bad things are for those living there - though nobody actually knows what dangers await them around every corner!
The street is long and straight with many trees on either side of it, which gives off a nice smell. There are no cars or people walking in this street; only houses can be seen from here (and these have windows facing away from each other).
A narrow lane that runs parallel to the main thoroughfare and ends at an old castle on top of a hill. The cobblestones are uneven, but they make for interesting views when you walk down them. It is not known who lived in this place before it became part of the city - maybe some rich family? Maybe just someone who wanted to be close enough to their neighbors without being too close?
The street was named after a famous explorer who discovered many new lands and built many large cities throughout Europe during his lifetime, which led him to be known as "the man who conquered Africa." The road itself is also long, running through fields of wheat with small villages on either side of it every few kilometers or so.
A small street lined by buildings of varying heights. Some are tall and narrow, others short and wide; all of them have flat roofs that slope downwards from front to back. There is no sign indicating what kind of building lies behind any one doorway - only that they were once occupied by people who now live elsewhere or have died long ago.
The road winds through a forest for an unspecified distance, but it never seems to end. As far as the eye can see there are trees on either side of the street and no signs indicating where one begins or ends - only that they continue into infinity.
A large square with buildings surrounding it on all four sides. The centerpiece is a statue of an unknown figure, while smaller sculptures can be found throughout the area as well as various fountains that are surrounded by ornate stonework and greenery. There are no cars in sight - only people walking around or sitting outside cafes, which makes it feel like a quiet place where time stands still for just one moment before moving on again with its inevitability and indifference towards everything around us...

Re: Recommended books on urban design, planning, and related fields
I'm going to post a link to this book in our reading list of recommended books for students taking courses about cities or transportation planning. It was written by a professor at my alma mater. I really think it will help people learn more about what makes an urban design good or bad.

I was in a similar thread recently and I would recommend Jane Jacobs "The Death And Life Of Great American Cities". Its not the most technical read but it does get you thinking about the urban environment in ways that many city planners don't think of. It might be worthwhile to read "The Fate Of Place" by James Howard Kunstler too which I just finished yesterday and it was pretty eye-opening as well.

A few obvious ones:
South Bankers vs. North Bankers vs. Riverfront
North Side (Cambria Heights) vs. South Side (East Riverside Park)
Civic leaders vs. businessmen vs. developers
Corporate vs. private interests
"Yuppie-Democrats" (Goldman Sachs types, etc.) vs. "Tax-Cutter Conservatives" (oil men, mining companies) vs. "Old Line Socialists" (union bosses).
(Obvious example: The fight between the North Side and the South Side in 1926 over the location of the city's new football stadium. North Siders wanted it on the North Side; South Siders wanted it to be in their district, but closer to downtown.)
I also recommend looking at this book:
"New York 1930":
http://books.google.com/books?id=XHQ_KMt ... t&f=false
It's a photo-history of New York from the height of the depression (which is when most of my game is set). It's quite useful for getting a feel for how people lived and worked in NYC at that time.
