I just made one and it looks like this: http://img164.imageshack.us/img164/2503/smokebomb1.jpg
You can buy them at Party City or they have them where you get balloons from. Just look for the "Blow-Up" section and you'll find them there (I think I got mine for like $7). They say that it will stay lit for 5 minutes. If it doesn't, just blow on it to make sure the wick is not covered by ash or something and re-light it.
Awesome... Thanks!
