1) The use of blockchain is very good for health systems. With the help of a secure network, the data cannot be manipulated or destroyed, which ensures that it can only reach its destination and will not fall into the hands of third parties.
2) In fact, the system stores and analyzes information about all events associated with medicines. The ability to track drug storage conditions allows for better inventory management. 
3) The project is aimed at making the distribution process safer, faster and more transparent.
4) The solution helps reduce health care costs by reducing or eliminating errors in logistics processes and improving supply chain management. It also makes the work of pharmacists easier by reducing the time it takes to look for a missing drug and identifying which products are not in stock. In addition, blockchain technology has improved traceability, which is important when medicines are transferred between health care institutions or organizations, because they can be quickly returned if there is a problem with them.
5) This project is also useful for hospitals that need to track the location and status of certain drugs during their storage cycle.
6) The pilot study will be conducted in North Carolina, Indiana and Tennessee. These are states where medication transportation and usage issues have been identified, along with the application of blockchain and IoT technology to monitor specialty medications across supply chains. This project is important because it can help save lives by ensuring that patients get their prescriptions on time, which could help them recover faster if they are ill or injured due to an accident or injury caused while working outside the home (e.g., construction worker).
7) The pilot study will be conducted in three states: North Carolina, Indiana and Tennessee. These are the states where medication transportation and usage issues have been identified. Also, this project is important because it can help save lives by ensuring that patients get their prescriptions on time, which could help them recover faster if they are ill or injured due to an accident or injury caused while working outside the home (e.g., construction worker).
8) In the future, the system can be improved with new software for managing pharmaceutical products and monitoring their storage conditions at every stage of production and distribution. This will help reduce health care costs by reducing errors in logistics processes and improving supply chain management, making life easier for pharmacists by reducing the time it takes to look for a missing drug and identifying which products are not available on site because they are outdated or have been discontinued (and therefore cannot be used).

10) In order for this project to succeed, it must involve all participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain: from producers and distributors through wholesalers and retail outlets down to patients themselves who consume these medicines every day. By making sure that everyone knows what happens at each stage of production or distribution (including how long each step takes), we can help reduce health care costs by reducing errors in logistics processes and improving supply chain management while also making life easier for pharmacists by reducing the time it takes to look for a missing drug and identifying which products are not available on site because they are outdated or have been discontinued (and therefore cannot be used).
