More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?
It is believed that, people’s life expectancy has increased over the recent decades. There have been several factors which contributed to this rise in age. Increasing income levels of people, better accessibility to hospitals, medical facilities, higher literacy rates, and technological developments are some reasons behind this trend.
On a personal note, I feel that, health consciousness has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. Most of the youngsters nowadays are concerned about their physical fitness and nutrition. They eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables rather than junk food. Besides, they go to gym regularly or do yoga at home. I have seen that my friends and relatives who used to smoke or drink tea in the past are now more careful about their diet and exercise. This shows how awareness of health has increased over time.
The main reason why people’s life expectancy is increasing is due to better accessibility to medical facilities like hospitals, clinics, blood banks etc. People with chronic diseases can go for treatment whenever they feel uncomfortable. This is possible only if there are adequate number of health care centres in a particular region. Another reason that has contributed to this rise in life expectancy is the technological advancements which made the medical treatments easier and cheaper. For example, surgeries like C-section, hip surgery or even knee replacement can now be performed more easily with modern instruments.
In addition to that, I feel that government policies have also played a key role in this trend. Health insurance is available for poor people who are unable to afford hospital bills due to medical emergencies. Besides, they provide free vaccinations for children during their childhood. Thus, people get more concerned about their health and life expectancy has increased over the decades.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that, increasing awareness of people is one of the main reasons which contributed to rise in age. However, technological advancements and government policies have also contributed to this trend. I feel that it should be continued in future as well.

Eating a balanced diet has become quite popular in recent years, but there are many factors that contribute towards it. It is essential for everyone’s wellbeing and should not only be considered when illness or ageing sets in. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this trend and give my own ideas on how to encourage people to eat healthier and exercise regularly.
One of the main reasons why eating a balanced diet has become so popular is because people are more aware that unhealthy food can have serious consequences on their bodies. For example, obesity is becoming increasingly common in many parts of the world, which has been linked to diseases such as type 2 diabetes or heart conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease). Furthermore, eating healthily means that people are more likely to lead active lives and stay fit for longer periods of time. This is particularly important nowadays given the sedentary lifestyles many individuals have due to work commitments or social pressures.
There are many things we can do as individuals or governments in order to encourage people towards eating healthier foods and exercising regularly. For example, we could introduce taxes on unhealthy foods such as sugary drinks while subsidising organic produce at farmer’s markets around the country. We could also create campaigns which promote healthier ways of living through various mediums such as radio commercials or television adverts. Finally, we should try and educate people about nutrition by teaching them how to read labels on packaged food so they know what ingredients are in their meals before buying them from supermarkets etc..
In conclusion then it seems clear why more and more people want healthier dietary options these days but also what steps we could take ourselves if we wanted to encourage others too!

There is no question that the health of our society has been declining. The obesity epidemic, which affects both children and adults alike in developed countries such as Australia or America, is one example of this trend towards unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles among people all over the world who live in urban areas where they are exposed to more processed food options than rural populations do (for instance).
This topic will be covered at length during this paper which looks into how obesity rates have increased so much since 1980: From 21% then up until 31%. This trend has been linked with other factors including lower levels of exercise among adults because they spend more time working indoors instead outdoors where their bodies were meant to be active; less accessibility to healthy foods due increased number supermarkets selling processed products over fresh produce – especially for those living away from cities where local markets used sell organic alternatives before being replaced by corporations who don’t care about quality so long as there’s a profit involved here too!
It should also be noted however: Although obesity rates have risen considerably since 1980’s but studies show that overweight individuals were still less likely than normal weight adults die prematurely from heart disease or cancer despite having higher BMI values than others did back then (although this may change soon enough if we continue down current trends).
In conclusion therefore, while it is true that more and more people are becoming aware of the importance healthy eating habits play on overall wellbeing – there still needs improvement within certain aspects such as accessibility to fresh produce for those living in rural areas where supermarkets aren’t available nearby.
Therefore this essay will focus heavily upon obesity rates among adults due its link with other health issues including diabetes, heart disease and cancer which could be prevented if individuals consumed less processed foods while exercising regularly – even just 30 minutes per day!
In conclusion therefore: We can see how important it is for people from all over world to eat well balanced diets because their bodies need them more than ever nowadays where obesity rates continue grow among developed nations despite many efforts made by government officials towards healthier lifestyles.”
