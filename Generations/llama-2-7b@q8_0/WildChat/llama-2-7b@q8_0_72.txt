I don't think you need to check the Average. You are looking at the Total and they want an average of 5-10 lines per page.

Thank you very much for your advice.
I had a chance to contact with CCMS and I got some answers about my statement:
"...if you have 10 lines on a page that will be fine..."
"...they don't care how many lines are in a statement or where they are placed, just as long as there isn't any blank space (white) on the page..."
So I think that we should try to reduce number of lines per page.
If you have more lines than 10, then add a line break and start another page. This way it will look better on their end and they won't be charged for extra pages.
That is what I do with my statements now. It looks great!

Regarding your question 4: We have tested the program but it is not fully functional for annual statement (we are still working on it). If you run the program before August 15th you will receive an error message because the files are not ready. Once they are available, we will send out another post to let you know when you can access and use them.
The following is what I got from CCMS:
The annual statement is a statement that includes all of the charges made during the year on the policyholders accounts (the account number for this is the one issued in 2009). If an insured has multiple policies, they can expect to get one annual statement per policy. It contains charges for premiums and other expenses such as fees, commissions, dividends, etc.
It looks like I will have to manually do a cut and paste of all the numbers from this statement into my spreadsheet for annual report purposes
