Natsuki: "It was such an incredible feeling to finally see you, Hiroshi! I always thought it would be nice if we were together..."

(Hiroshi has finished napping, and he is now playing in his crib with one of Natsuki's twin daughters - her daughter Miku. Meanwhile, a small crowd has gathered around them.)

### Dialogue:

Natsuki (to the small crowd): "Aren't they just adorable?"

(Hiroshi and his sisters are now playing together on the floor, with Natsuki standing over them in delight. Meanwhile, a few of the older siblings have gathered around.)

### Dialogue:

Natsuki (to the small crowd): "I'm so glad they all get along..."

(Natsuki takes her baby boy Hiroshi into her arms and cuddles him in her lap. As Natsuki sits in her bed, she begins to breastfeed once more.)

### Dialogue:

Natsuki: "He's my little man..."

(As Hiroshi finishes suckling this time, he starts crying loudly for his mother. As Natsuki gets up and walks into the kitchen to calm him down...)

Natsuki (to herself): "What am I gonna do?"
