### Instructions
The program must be able to start up, create a story of it's own in the first 10 lines (or so) and then the program should exit. This program is considered a game as you will need to tell a story. 

### Hint:
Try this out - have it write something like "The sun was shining, but there were clouds in the sky". Or even more specifics...

### Notes:
This has nothing to do with the game [Deltarune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltarune) (by Toby Fox). It's just that I used Deltarune as an inspiration and decided to make my own version of it. So yes, this is not related to the game what-so-ever.
