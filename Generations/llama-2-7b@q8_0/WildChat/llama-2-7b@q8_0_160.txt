1. The best way is to just have a general mindset of how things work in the stock market and in the financial world, what you are investing into and why you want to invest into them as well as the risks involved in that sector.
2. The best mindsets are being able to see what opportunities there are within each industry. 
3. The best mindsets are to have a good understanding of the fundamentals of the company that your investing in, for instance, what is its competitive advantage? What do they manufacture and who do they sell it to? Does the product or service meet the needs of consumers or businesses? 
4. The best mindsets are being able to think about the risks involved with the investment, not just thinking about if your going to lose money on an investment but what could go wrong with this company and how much would they have to lose for you to sell out? For instance, a company that is growing fast has high revenue growth, which leads to more profit so there is less chance of them losing a large amount of profit compared to if the business was stagnant or declining. 
5. The best mindsets are being able to think about your investments in terms of their fundamentals and future potential rather than just seeing how much money you can make today. A company with good fundamentals will be able to grow at an average rate over time which means that the return on investment would increase overtime instead of just having a short term gain from buying low and selling high.
