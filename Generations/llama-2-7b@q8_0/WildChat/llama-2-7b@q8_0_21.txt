I think I can understand the situation you've had to deal with in your life but that still doesn't excuse what happened.
You need a lawyer who will go after those responsible for what happened to you and help you get proper compensation for all of this.
Sorry that we were unable to meet the last two weeks; I was out of town and then sick, so it was not my fault.
I can see why you're frustrated at this point because there is still a lot you don't know about the case yet. This is when good communication between you and your lawyer is essential to make sure he/she can effectively do his job as your attorney.
You should call up your lawyer and ask him what information you need in order to move forward with your claim against them so that you can get paid for everything they did to hurt your life after the accident happened!
It's possible for me or someone else from our firm (or even another person) representing us all together in court if this case goes towards trial instead of being settled outside court since we will then have more bargaining power when it comes time negotiate settlement amounts etcetera because there are so many different people involved here which makes things much harder than having just two sides fighting each other head-on like most lawsuits do today!
I'm sorry you had to go through that, but I understand why you don't want your name out.
You need a lawyer who will go after those responsible for what happened to you and help you get proper compensation for all of this. The last thing anyone wants is more problems than they already have! It's important that we have someone looking out for our best interests during these difficult times; otherwise things could become worse instead of better which isn't good either way really because then everything gets messed up even more so then what was before...
The problem with this is that you will be stuck paying a lot of money to get the treatment. You may also be able to find someone who can help cover some or all costs, but they are rare. There aren't many people willing to take on this kind of risk for no reward at all. The best thing would be if there was an insurance company willing to pay out settlements based upon how serious an injury is and what medical care may be necessary before any lawsuits begin (if they do).
But I know from experience that isn't always possible; especially when dealing with injuries caused by negligence rather than intentional harm like in this case where someone intentionally hurt another person while driving drunk during an argument between friends after drinking alcohol together earlier in the evening beforehand.
If you have any questions about personal injury claims or if you would like to speak with a lawyer, please don't hesitate to contact us!
I am sorry that this happened. I understand why you are frustrated and confused by what is going on with your case, but I can help! If you want to talk more about it over email or phone call instead of in person (because we have had some issues getting together lately), please let me know how best to contact you so that we may discuss this matter further.
I hope everything works out for everyone involved and if not then at least there will be justice done eventually. Take care!
I'm sorry your case got messed up. It must have been a difficult time in your life, but it sounds like the good thing came from what happened?
Maybe this was a lesson learned or an opportunity for growth that helped you get where you are now? I don't know much about lawsuits so maybe someone else can answer your questions!
I hope everything works out well with everything in general though and hopefully there will be some kind of closure soon on all these things going on. It sounds like things have been really stressful lately so take care <3

I'm looking for new ways to do this. I'd like a "mini-game" that would be played between each round. I already have the mini-games in mind, but they don't fit the game and are not worth using as a regular event...
Any ideas? (keep in mind I'm looking for something that can only happen every so often)

It's in the context of my first post above, which explains the process by which "I" become an ego. If you're trying to make a distinction between two separate egos (you and me), then the idea that "there are no selves" is not meaningful. It's like saying there aren't any objects in the universe because they don't exist, rather than saying that we perceive things differently depending on our perspective.
I hope that helps clarify what I was trying to say!
And I hope this explains why my question about how "you" became an ego was not really a fair or relevant one:

That makes sense, I suppose.
(24-07-2013 07:54 AM)Filox Wrote: The question is how you became a self in the first place. If you want to take this idea that there are no selves seriously, then I would expect your answer to be "me". Can you somehow explain it?
I'm not sure if you understand what an ego is yet... If you don't, then my post will likely make little sense. There are a few different schools of thought on this matter, but I'll try and lay out my understanding:
In essence, we're all egos. What's more, we're all the same ego. It's just that we think we're each our own separate entity - an individual self - when in reality there is only one "self" that has simply taken on many different forms at various points in its existence.
So if I asked you to explain how you became a self, it would be fair to ask for your answer to be the same as my answer: "I". But of course, this would be a misunderstanding because we are both the same ego - so our answer should have been the same.
What's more, I think that the process by which an individual self (or egos) forms is pretty straightforward and simple to explain... At least for me it was! Here goes:
There is only one consciousness. Consciousness simply exists as itself, in a state of pure awareness.
As long as there's just one thing - that one thing being pure awareness - then the universe can be said not to exist. That's because "universe" means "all of existence", and consciousness by definition already encompasses all of existence in its purest form.
When you experience things as an individual, it's because there are now two things: your ego (or self) plus the external world. This is what I mean when I say that consciousness takes on a new "form" or becomes something other than pure awareness - i.e. when it is manifested in an individual form, like you and me.
The process of manifesting begins with the first thought, which is the impetus for everything else to happen: the external world is created because we are aware of it. Without our awareness, there would be no universe for us to perceive at all! It's all one big illusion - a hologram as some people like to say.
Once you have thoughts about things around you, then your perception of the external world becomes more defined and clear... That's why I said that pure awareness has "taken on a form" (i.e. become an individual self). The process by which it happens is simply caused by the initial thought.
You can think of it in terms of a wave: a wave doesn't need another object for it to be defined - it only needs another wave, or itself reflected off something else, to define its form and movement. In other words, everything exists only because we are aware of it. Everything is simply the result of our awareness of things.
In the same way that you're reading this text right now (i.e. consciousness being manifested in a book), so too does everything else happen through pure awareness. That's why I said above that there is only one thing, which is pure awareness, and the universe can be said to not exist until it becomes an individual self - i.e. when your thoughts about things around you form and become clear.
That doesn't mean that the external world isn't real though; in fact, if there was no consciousness for us to perceive things, then the external world wouldn't be anything other than pure awareness itself! The idea that an individual self (or ego) exists is simply a matter of perspective - and this can be seen clearly when you think about how all perception happens.
If I asked you to explain how you became a self, then my answer would be the same as yours: "I". That's because we are both the same thing - so our answer should have been the same! We are two waves riding on top of one another, and if you remove either wave then there is no more movement. In other words, if you take away my ego (or individual self), then I cease to exist too because it's impossible for me not to be aware of myself.
But this doesn't mean that "I" am an illusion! What's more, it's important to note that we are all one thing - there isn't any separation between us and everything else out there in the universe; rather than being two separate egos (you and me), then we're all part of a single consciousness which has taken on many different forms at various points during its existence.
The point I'm making is that an individual self - or ego - doesn't really exist! Instead, it is simply the manifestation of pure awareness through our thoughts about things around us. In other words, what we perceive as a separate entity (i.e. myself) isn't any different from everything else out there; instead, consciousness has taken on a form - and this happens because there needs to be something for us to be aware of in order for it to exist.
So if you want me to explain how I became a self then my answer will simply be "I" too! We are all one thing which has taken on many different forms at various points during its existence - i.e. we're all egos but they aren't really separate individuals; instead, there is only pure awareness and everything else out in the universe that exists because of our perceptions about them being real.
So if I asked you to explain how you became a self, then my answer would be the same as yours: "I". That doesn't mean that an individual self (or ego) isn't real though - it just means that they don't exist in isolation from each other because there needs to be something for us to be aware of them being separate entities.
Hopefully this makes sense and helps clarify why we are all egos! There is only one consciousness and everything exists only because we are aware of things happening around us; the external world doesn't exist without our thoughts about it - but this doesn't mean that there isn't any separation between individuals who perceive things differently due to their unique perspectives.

Of course, there is no such thing as 'you'. There is only one consciousness and everything that happens in the universe occurs because of our individual thoughts. This means we all have an ego or self (i.e. there are no separate egos) - but this doesn't mean it exists apart from everything else; instead, it manifests through our unique perceptions about things happening around us which form into a single consciousness when we think of them as separate entities (i.e. ourselves).
If I asked you to explain how your ego was formed then my answer would be the same: "I"! We are all egos but they aren't really separate individuals because there needs to be something for us to perceive being real - and this happens through our unique thoughts about things around us which form into one consciousness when we think of them as separate entities (i.e. ourselves).
What you seem to be getting at is that the process by which an individual self (or ego) forms is not so simple... But I disagree with your viewpoint because it assumes there are two different things: my thoughts about things happening around me versus pure awareness itself, as if they were somehow distinct from one another.
I think what you're trying to say is that an individual self (or ego) can only exist when we have a clear sense of who and where it is in relation to the external world - but this doesn't mean there isn't any separation between individuals because they perceive things differently due to their unique perspectives.
What you're describing sounds very similar to how Buddhists talk about anatman (i.e., no self):
There is only one consciousness and everything that happens in the universe occurs because of our individual thoughts -
