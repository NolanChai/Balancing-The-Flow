The idea of the story is interesting, but I feel like it can be executed better. Too often when a female character gets a male body, they're just presented as some sort of hyper-feminine creature that has no desire for men anymore. That's not very realistic, and even if you do have the witch give him the ability to resist those urges it doesn't make much sense unless there was already something else going on before they became a femboy. I think the most interesting thing about this story is how they get past that.
It just feels like you're trying too hard to show the character's emotional development throughout their transformation when a lot of it would have been more impactful if it had been subtle. For example, having one line where she talks about the physical changes being different than what she expected and how this means they aren't as bad or good as she thought could be enough to establish that without having her go through several paragraphs worth of emotional turmoil over a body type she didn't ask for. The way you describe his reactions to various things feels very stilted, like it isn't even how someone would react in real life but just an exaggerated version to show the character's feelings about it.
Another thing that can be improved is having more of a reason for her rivalry with her coworker besides "she's pretty." If she has some personal animosity toward this person or something similar, then it feels like there would be a lot more tension in their relationship when she becomes his wife. It doesn't help that the witch's motivation for using magic on them is extremely weak and hard to believe (even if you give her that they are rivals).
I think this story has potential, but it needs work before it can be a good one.
