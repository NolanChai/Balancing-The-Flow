B.I am not sure whether the phrasing "Being in a doctoral program" should be used or not since it is considered to be not standard English, and I cannot find its definition in any of the dictionaries or grammar books that I have checked on this. In addition, I want to know if there are other ways to express the meaning which is implied by using the phrase "Being in a doctoral program" here.
The original context is as follows:
1. My current research plan (which will be modified accordingly) includes the following steps/components (i.e., each step/component is supposed to be performed on its own):
(a) Read some journals and other documents about the field in which my project falls,
(b) Conduct a survey to obtain the information required for this paper,
(c) Develop an algorithm to solve the problem at hand, and
(d) Write a journal/conference paper.
2. I have already completed the first step by reading some journals in my field, but now, since I am not sure whether my survey is appropriate or not (i.e., it might be not appropriate), I have to consider another research plan which will be more suitable for me to complete this doctoral program as soon as possible, and
3. One of the points of this paper is that it should indicate how the problem can be solved by using an algorithm (or some other techniques). However, I am not sure about whether there are other ways to express this idea other than "Being in a doctoral program" here.
