Orientalism is a concept developed by Edward Said in his 1978 book Orientalism. In his view, the term "orientalism" refers to the Western world's cultural belief system about the Orient (East) that helped shape imperial policies and practices. It was derived from the French word orient meaning “east” or "Orientalisme" which means knowledge of the East in the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century it had become a common term for the Western systematic study of the Eastern world (the Orient). The term was introduced into the English language by William Jones in 1781, and became more widely known after being used by Friedrich Schlegel in his 1798 lecture "Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Inder." Orientalism is a form of knowledge that serves to create and maintain Western political and cultural domination over the Orient. It operates as a systematic ideology whose discourse, texts and institutions perpetuate this power dynamic.
Edward Said's book "Orientalism" was published in 1978 by Pantheon Books.[7] The book describes Edward Said’s views on the Western scholarship about the Orient (East) from a critical perspective. Said claims that Orientalism is not simply an academic discipline or a scientific method; rather it is a system of ideas based on European cultural and geographical assumptions, which produce knowledge that validates Western political interests in the Middle East and the Islamic world.[8] According to Edward Said, orientalists have created a set of "images" about the Orient (the word he uses instead of “East”) that has become a reality for many westerners. This systematic ideology operates by perpetuating and reproducing stereotypes about the East in order to maintain Western cultural and political domination over it.

Said’s work draws heavily on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.[9] However, Said rejected their methodology because it did not consider power or knowledge as separate entities. In his view, the terms “knowledge” and “power” are closely intertwined in a relationship called “power/knowledge,” which he defines as "the way that forms of social and political domination and control are also patterns for thinking about certain types of behavior."[10] This relationship is crucial to understanding Said’s thesis because it explains how Orientalism works; by creating and maintaining stereotypes about the Orient, Westerners perpetuate their power over that region.
The West exercises control over Eastern identity through the process of orientalization wherein a dominant group (the West) determines what is or isn't true about another group (Eastern). By imposing its own definitions and standards on them, orientalization creates an image of inferiority that justifies Western power. It also makes it difficult for Easterners to develop their own identities because they are constantly being compared against a standard set by the West, which often leads them to conform rather than challenge these norms.
In his work Orientalism (1978), Edward Said defined orientalism as "a mode of thought based on an acute conscious and often unconscious knowledge of Western superiority." He argued that orientalism was a systematic body of ideas based on certain geographical assumptions about the Orient (East). In other words, orientalists have created stereotypes about the East in order to maintain Western cultural and political domination over it. This has resulted in an image of inferiority for those who live there that justifies Western control of their lives.
Said also argued that orientalism is not simply an academic discipline; rather, it is a system of ideas based on European cultural assumptions which produce knowledge that validates Western political interests in the Middle East and the Islamic world.[8] This systematic ideology operates by perpetuating stereotypes about the East in order to maintain Western control over this region.
Edward Said's book Orientalism was published in 1978, and it became one of the most important works on the topic. His thesis has since been challenged by other scholars, such as Michel Foucault.[9] However, his work remains influential because it helps us understand how certain cultural assumptions can lead to power imbalances between different groups of people.

The term was introduced into English language by William Jones who coined the word "India" while describing an ancient Hindu text. Later on Friedrich Schlegel used it in his lecture Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Inder where he described Hindus as barbaric savages with no culture or civilization whatsoever. In 1856 Richard Burton published The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night which included an English translation of some Arabic stories collected over centuries by scholars in Baghdad. This book contained explicit sexual content that shocked Western readers at first but later on it became one of best seller books all around Europe because people wanted to know more about Eastern culture through literature works like this one where they could see how different life was there compared with their own lives back home!

The West's dominance over Eastern culture has led to many negative consequences for those who live there including poverty and inequality between men and women due to patriarchy within societies such as Saudi Arabia where women cannot drive cars or travel without male guardianship under Sharia law. Edward Said believed that orientalism is a form of power which justifies Western control over the Orient by creating stereotypes about them in order to maintain Western cultural hegemony over this region through imperial policies such as military intervention when needed (e.g., Iraq War).
Orientalism has been criticized by some scholars who argue that Said does not give enough credit to Arabs for their role in shaping their own culture or history because he only sees them through the eyes of Westerners.[13] However, others believe that his work is still valuable because it provides an important perspective on how certain cultural assumptions can lead to power imbalances between different groups of people.
In addition, Said's definition of orientalism is not universally accepted by all scholars; some argue that he was too critical of Westerners while others believe that his analysis is limited because it does not take into account non-Western perspectives.[14] These criticisms are valid points which show how complex the issue is and why Edward Said’s work remains important despite its flaws.
