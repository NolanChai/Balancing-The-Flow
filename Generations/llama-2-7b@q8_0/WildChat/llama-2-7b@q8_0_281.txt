I'll take "Things That Are Probably Not At All Interesting" for $800, Alex.
When I first got into blogging and social media, one of my goals was to grow a community that shared an interest in things that aren't exactly mainstream. For the longest time, it felt as if every conversation about social media ended up with people talking about Twitter or Facebook or some other platform that I'd never heard of before. I was so desperate to be part of those conversations and share my excitement for blogging that I signed up for an account on Twitter just to get the hang of it all, even though I didn't actually have any interest in using it.
And then...I started having fun with Instagram. In fact, it became so fun for me to shoot photos, edit them with filters, and share them that I decided to focus exclusively on sharing those photos on my blog. It was a lot of work (and still is) but the payoff has been worth it. I've made some great friendships through social media, both online and in real life, and I feel like I have found a community that shares my interests and has welcomed me into the fold.
In honor of this, today I'm starting something new: #DailyInstagramChallenge. Here are the rules:
1. Take 3 photos a day (or more) for 7 days using your Instagram app or website.
2. Write at least 10 short tweets about each photo that share why it was taken and how you feel about it. Use the hashtag #DailyInstagramChallenge so people who are following along can see what's going on! You can either post all ten photos in one day, or spread them out over seven days; I'm doing the former, but that doesn't mean everyone else has to do so too.
3. Share your experience with others through Twitter or blog posts about why they should give Instagram a try too - make sure you include links back here so people can see what we are up to! You don't need a blog of your own in order participate (though I hope some will), just post those tweets on whatever platform(s) feel right for you and be proud that someone else might take notice :)
The first 7 photos of #DailyInstagramChallenge were taken by me, but I'd like to see more people get in on the fun - especially if it means there will be new eyes looking at my work! Please feel free to share your own photos and thoughts here or tag them with @TheDailySnap so that others can find out about this cool community building project :)
