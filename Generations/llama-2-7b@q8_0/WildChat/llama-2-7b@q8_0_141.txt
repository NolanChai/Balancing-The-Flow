**1. Profit and Loss Statement.** A profit and loss statement (or income statement) provides you with a summary of your business’s revenue, expenses, and profits (or losses). You should be able to see at a glance how much money your company has made or lost over the specified period.

**2. Cash Flow Statement.** A cash flow statement is crucial in determining whether your business can fund its activities. This statement shows where all the money goes — and how much of it comes from debt financing, equity financing, and sales of goods or services.

**3. Balance Sheet.** A balance sheet is a summary of all your business’s assets, liabilities (debts), and equity (investments). It tells you if the company is worth more or less than it was at the beginning of the year, as well as what its sources of capital are (like loans) and how much money it has in accounts receivable.

**4. Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.** This is a statement that shows you your company’s capitalization, or the amount of money it takes to get your business started and operating (also called its “equity”). It includes any debt or investment financing as well as any contributions from shareholders like yourself — these are all listed on this statement along with any changes during the year such as losses.

**5. Statement of Retained Earnings (or Shareholder’s Equity).** This is a summary of your business’s income statement and balance sheet, showing how much profit has been retained by the company after paying taxes and dividends to its shareholders. It also shows what portion of those profits are attributable to shareholders like yourself versus outside investors or creditors who have loaned money to get your business up and running (or “debt financing”).

**6. Inventory Statement.** This is a summary of what your company sells, how much it costs you to make those sales, and what profit or loss results from them. It also includes any inventory on hand at the end of each period along with any changes in its value during that time — for example, if there were damaged goods or defective products returned by customers who weren’t satisfied with what they bought.
