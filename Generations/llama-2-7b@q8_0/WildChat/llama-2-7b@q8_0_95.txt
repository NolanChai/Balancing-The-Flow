in chronic kidney disease, how do hyperglycemia affect the levels of sodium and potassium?

Hyperglycemia causes increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which leads to an increase in Na and K excretion.

Hyperglycemia also reduces tubular reabsorption, resulting in an increase in urinary Na and K losses.

Finally, hyperglycemia can lead to insulin resistance, leading to increased glucose uptake by the kidneys. This leads to an increased excretion of both Na and K through the proximal tubule.

The blood potassium levels are increased. The mechanism is through the activation of the _renin-angiotensin system_.

#### Incorrect answers

- You can assess the abdomen by asking a patient if they have abdominal pain.
  - If yes, you can further explore by asking them which part of their abdomen is hurting and how long it has been hurtng for.
- You can use your senses to determine if there is abdominal distention or guarding

In this case, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached a contract to sell a vehicle. The plaintiff seeks damages for the cost of repairing a defect in the vehicle that was caused by an accident. The court will need to decide whether or not there was a valid and enforceable contract between the two parties, as well as whether or not the defendant breached that contract by failing to provide the plaintiff with a vehicle free from defects.

Peptic ulcers are an open sore or break in the lining of the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus. They occur when too much acid and digestive enzymes get through into these areas. Peptic ulcer disease can be caused by:
* Stress (it doesn't cause peptic ulcers but it can worsen them)
* Medications
  * Aspirin, NSAIDs
  * Corticosteroids
  * Methotrexate
  * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., citalopram or fluoxetine
* Helicobacter pylori (Hp) bacteria, which cause most stomach ulcers
  * About half of all people infected with H. pylori develop an ulcer at some point in their life. People who are infected as children may never show symptoms or get diagnosed for the disease.
  * You can't tell if a patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) bacteria by examining them. They may carry the infection but not have any symptoms, so you need to test their stool or blood for it.
  * Treatment:
    * Antibiotics can eradicate the H. pylori bacteria and prevent ulcers from forming. The most effective regimen is a triple therapy that includes two antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin) and a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid production.
    * If you suspect the patient has Helicobacter pylori (Hp) bacteria or an Hp-associated ulcer, consider testing for it. If it's confirmed they may need to be treated with antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor.
  * Stress can make the symptoms of peptic ulcers worse but it doesn’t cause them.
  * Medications used to treat migraines, arthritis (NSAIDs), or certain mood disorders (SSRIs) may increase stomach acid production and irritate an existing ulcer, making symptoms worse. These medications can also increase the risk of developing a new peptic ulcer by as much as 10 times.
* Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:
  * Rare inherited disorder that causes stomach acid to build up and form an ulcer, sometimes leading to cancer of the esophagus or stomach.
