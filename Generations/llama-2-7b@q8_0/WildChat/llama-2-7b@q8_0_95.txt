Sales of permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes grew by nearly 4% in 2017, with value sales reaching $3.8bn. The key driver of this growth was the development of new technologies for the colouring of hair, such as semi-permanent colourants that can last up to 16 weeks without the need for a further reapplication.
Forecasts indicate that sales will continue growing steadily over the next five years. This is due in part to increasing interest in semi-permanent hair dyes, which have an advantage over permanent products because they do not involve chemical bleaching of hair and are more easily removed.
Although both the US and China lead global sales, Europe represents a growing market for these products, with France (particularly its high population density around Paris), Germany and Spain representing key markets.

### 1. The number of people using the internet globally has doubled in the past decade and will double again in the next decade (or sooner). What factors will contribute to this growth?

- The first factor is that the cost of smart phones, computers and Internet connection are becoming cheaper and more affordable.
- Another factor is the increasing popularity of social media. People use these platforms for a variety of different purposes such as staying in touch with family & friends or looking up information about various topics. Social Media also gives people the ability to share their opinions on any topic which they find interesting, including politics and other issues related to human rights.
- Finally, some argue that people will continue using technology because it makes them feel special or unique compared to others who don’t own these devices/technology (e.g., if someone has a newer model phone than you). This could lead to increased usage even when there aren’t any changes in the cost of these products/services or other factors which might make people want to use them less often over time due to decreasing returns on investment from using technology more frequently (e.g., if it takes longer for your battery life to go down).

### 2. What are some ways that you can stay connected with family and friends while living far away?

- First, try using social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter as these give people access to their friends/family members' lives without having them around all the time (which would be hard if they were close by). Secondly, there are apps for messaging which allow users who live apart from one another still feel connected even though they may not get along well enough on a regular basis for face-to-face conversations anymore; these include WhatsApp Messenger and Kik Chat (both available through Google Play store). Thirdly, Skype has become increasingly popular among teenagers due to its ability to allow users who are far away from each other communicate via video calling so long as both parties have access to Wi-Fi networks which offer fast enough connection speeds for quality audio/video calls without lagging issues occurring too often during such conversations – this may come down again soon though given how quickly technology advances nowadays.

### 3. What is the role of the internet and social media in politics? Is it positive or negative? Why?

- The internet and social media have a large impact on politics because they allow politicians to communicate with voters more easily than ever before – this includes campaigning online as well as being able share news stories related specifically towards certain issues which may affect how people vote at election time. As for whether or not the influence these new platforms hold over elections will be positive/negative, I believe it depends entirely upon how politicians choose to use them when reaching out via social media channels such as Facebook & Twitter etc., especially since many Americans still do not trust politicians completely after years of scandals involving corruption within our government systems which led many voters away from supporting certain candidates during past elections.

### 4. How has the internet and technology affected the way you learn? What are some examples?

- The first change I noticed was that my ability to find information about whatever topic I wanted became easier than ever before due largely because of search engines like Google which allow users access hundreds upon thousands (even millions) different websites all within seconds after typing in a query related towards their intended search result(s). Furthermore, this also allowed me learn new things faster than ever thanks again mostly because these same types searches led me directly toward relevant content found across various platforms online such as blog posts written by experts within fields like finance & technology where I could read through articles detailing specific issues/challenges faced in those industries before making decisions regarding investments related towards them – something which would never have been possible without access to computers capable of connecting users directly with each other via wires running across continents!

### 5. What are some examples of how technology has improved our lives?

- It makes us more efficient and effective in everything we do, from work to school. We can learn faster than ever before, thanks to the internet and online courses offered by universities around the world (like Harvard). Technology also allows people who live far apart from each other or those with limited accessibility due their physical limitations such as being blind/deaf or having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) communicate easily despite these challenges – this includes using text messaging apps like WhatsApp Messenger which lets users send messages without any verbal communication happening at all!

2. What is the estimated value of the men’s hair dye market in those five countries for 2022 and by what rate it is expected to grow until 2027?
3. Which regions are likely to witness the highest growth rates over this period?
4. Who are some of the leading players in this industry, both from a global as well as regional standpoint?
5. What are the latest trends and innovations happening in this industry?

There are studies done on both sexes but it is not very common. The only study I found was from the 90's. But we should keep in mind that in Brazil men do use less hair dye and also, they go for more natural products to maintain their hairstyle and hair color (shampoo, conditioner, sprays etc).
I would say that the usage is not very common here either. My father had his beard dyed because he wanted a lighter color but he also used to use shampoos, gels, mousse etc for his hair style (which was always short and black)
