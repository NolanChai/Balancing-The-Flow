Dear Mr/Mrs <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_NAME>, 
I’m fine to meet with you on Monday morning at your convenience.

Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>

Hi Ola,

Thanks for your message. Unfortunately, I won’t be available at 9:00 AM on Tuesday next week as my schedule is fully booked. However, I could suggest other dates that may work for both of us. How about we meet on Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM? If these dates and times don’t work for you, please let me know, and I'll try to find other options.

Best Regards.

Hi Neil,

No problem about the first meeting.  I had a good look at your website and I would like to discuss with you how we might be able to improve it.  This is my first project that I've been asked to take on in terms of SEO so I am keen to understand what is expected from me as well as any pitfalls.

I have the following dates available:
- Friday 25th September (half day)
- Wednesday 1st October - full day
- Tuesday 7th October - full day
- Thursday 9th October (half day)

Please let me know if these dates work for you or if there is a better date in the next few weeks.
