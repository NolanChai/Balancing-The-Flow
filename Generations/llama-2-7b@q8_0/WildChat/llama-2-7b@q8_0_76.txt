<b>I think it would be pretty awkward and stressful to move into a new town or school if you're the daughter of a very famous department store owner.</b><br/>

Because, sure, they recognize Julia Fairbanks from her commercials or seeing her at Fairbank's with her daddy, but you would imagine that it might make them a little bit uncomfortable because of the wealth difference between themselves and the new girl.</b>
