Infertility is a disease that causes many people to experience problems in conceiving and carrying a pregnancy to term. In the US, about 7-10% of couples face fertility issues, according to an estimate from the National Institute for Health. The reasons why these patients fail to achieve conception are varied, but it is possible that their infertility issues could be related to male factors.
What’s more important – male or female factor in infertility?
Research has shown that 40% of couples with fertility problems have a male factor problem. In this article, we look at the most common causes of male factor infertility. We also examine some common myths about men and fertility so you can be informed when speaking to your doctor or partner about this important health issue.
There are many different causes of male infertility that affect men’s ability to produce enough sperm for successful conception and pregnancy outcomes (NHS 2016). The most common cause is varicocele, which is when one or more veins near the testicles become dilated and enlarged. This condition can lead to reduced quality of semen because it increases temperature in the scrotum which may damage sperm production over time (NHS 2016).
The other main cause for male factor infertility is low testosterone levels due to age-related changes within cells that produce this hormone (NHS 2016). This condition usually occurs naturally as men get older and often goes unnoticed until it reaches severe levels which can lead to decreased sex drive, poor muscle mass development and other health concerns related with aging processes such as heart disease or prostate cancer.
Testosterone deficiency is a common cause of male infertility. Low testosterone in men causes low sperm production by reducing the number of immotile sperms present in semen (NHS, 2017). This condition can be treated with hormonal therapies such as clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins that stimulate production of testosterone from within the body itself rather than using supplements.
There are many potential causes of male infertility, but some more common than others. In fact, according to NHS (2016), 40% of couples with fertility problems have a male factor problem – so if you and your partner are having trouble conceiving, it’s likely that one or both of you has an issue here. The causes below may help explain why this might be happening for you:
If you have low sperm count then there is less chance that any given ejaculation will result in pregnancy – especially if the woman is not ovulating regularly and/or producing large numbers of eggs (NHS 2016). This means that even if everything else seems fine from both partners’ perspectives, getting pregnant may still be difficult without treatment options such as artificial insemination which uses donor sperm instead.
Low testosterone levels are often associated with low sperm count – but they can also cause other problems like impotence and reduced libido (NHS 2016). Testosterone levels tend to drop over time because of aging processes like testicular atrophy which lead them downhill until eventually they reach a point where it becomes impossible for the body to produce enough testosterone on its own anymore; this is known as “male menopause” or “andropause.”
Testosterone replacement therapy has been shown effective in raising both libido and fertility rates among males who receive treatment – though some studies show mixed results when comparing natural hormones against synthetic ones like testosterone enanthate (NHS 2016). Testosterone is also known for being able to increase muscle mass which may lead some people feeling more confident about themselves after getting their T-levels back up again; however this does not guarantee better sex drives either so don’t expect miracles!
Infertility can have many causes, but one of the most common is low sperm count or low testosterone levels in men.
Myth 1: A man has to be “well endowed” for his partner to get pregnant with their child (or children).
Fact: This isn’t true at all! Many factors play into whether a couple will conceive, including age and health history on both sides as well as lifestyle habits such as smoking or drinking alcohol during conception attempts. Sperm quality is also important but doesn’t necessarily depend solely upon penis size — there are other ways that men can improve their sperm count if they have an issue here too!
Myth 2: Men should take time off from work and other responsibilities so their partners can focus on getting pregnant.
Fact: While it’s true that some couples need help conceiving, there are ways to make things easier for everyone involved without having one person stop working or taking care of the kids while waiting for their partner’s body chemistry to catch up with nature.
Myth 3: Men don’t really have an effect on whether or not they get pregnant because “the woman has all the power.”
Fact: The truth is that both partners are equally responsible for conception! This means you should make sure your partner knows how much this matters to you so she doesn’t feel guilty if things don’t work out right away (or ever). It also means being open about what’s going on with your health and lifestyle habits when trying conceive—even if it makes them uncomfortable at first because they might not want another person knowing details about their private life!
Myth 4: If a man doesn’t have any problems, he shouldn’t go to the doctor for testing or treatment.
Fact: Even if there are no obvious signs of trouble yet, it never hurts to get checked out by your healthcare provider just in case anything might be wrong! Plus this way you can start working on improving your fertility now instead of waiting until later when things have gotten worse before doing anything about them—and trust us: They will only get worse over time without intervention from someone who knows what they’re talking about (like yours truly).
Myth 5: A man’s age doesn’t matter when it comes to fertility.
Fact: As we get older our bodies go through changes that can make it harder for us to conceive and carry a pregnancy successfully, so even if you don’t have any other medical problems like diabetes or heart disease (which also affect fertility), there are still age-related considerations when considering getting started on parenthood together with your partner.
Myth 6: The only way to test for male infertility is through a semen analysis in the doctor’s office or clinic where you have an appointment scheduled beforehand (or during).
Fact: There are many ways of testing your fertility status that don’t involve going into a doctor’s office—you can even do some at home! Check out our blog post on how to test for male infertility with a DIY semen analysis kit.
