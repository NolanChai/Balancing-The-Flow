My research has been on-going for the last 3 weeks. I'm pretty confident that there is no way to do this without a firmware change. The reason is because the power supply must be able to detect the voltage supplied by it, and that requires knowledge of what you are supplying it. It doesn't matter if it is a "standard" 240v, or whatever the voltage in your house may happen to be, at any given moment.
For example, my house has a mains supply that is 110v (nominal), and at any given time I can be supplying 135v or less, or as much as 260v depending on what loads I have running at the time (and how hard they are working). It's also possible to have a single phase supply that is 240v and a neutral of 0. It's also possible for my mains to be 230v, and an earth (ground) wire of 50 or 100 ohms.
The power supplies built into the iPad are rated at 5v/1A and 19v/4.85A (iPad 2), so they must be able to detect what you've connected up. You can't do it using a UK plug, because that will have different voltage outputs depending on what country you live in (e.g. the EU is at 230v and a neutral of around 190 ohms). If it has to be UK-safe then they're out of luck as you can't reliably detect 48 or 56V AC, which would probably be what is supplied by one of those "UK plug" devices.
Incidentally, a lot of the chargers sold here in the UK are not compliant with EMC rules, and some don't even meet basic safety requirements (e.g. they overheat when used to charge an iPad or something). This means that you should be very careful about buying non-Apple supplied chargers, as it's hard for the consumer to know if any given charger is actually safe. The UK has a website where you can check the safety mark on anything, and it does work (but not for Apple stuff!).
