The Hokies return to action after an unforgettable run in last season’s Orange Bowl. The 2007 VPI & SU Football Team has made it possible for the Virginia Tech Athletic Department to establish a new standard of excellence on the playing field and in the classroom. The team will be led by Coach Frank Beamer, who recently celebrated his 25th season at the helm of the Hokie football program.
The Orange Bowl win over the University of Florida was one that will last a lifetime for Virginia Tech fans everywhere! The Hokies are back to defend their National Championship and are looking forward to another great year in 2007. This will be Coach Beamer’s 25th season leading the Hokie football program, which has resulted in 11 straight bowl berths, four ACC Championships, and eight Top-10 finishes in the Associated Press Polls.
This year the Virginia Tech Athletic Department is committed to creating an environment where student athletes are able to focus on their academic studies while preparing themselves physically and mentally for competition on game day.
