My role is to help get the message of our products out there through a variety of marketing methods like emails, social media platforms, and our website. I also help write copy for these mediums which helps in getting customers and prospects interested enough to learn more about what we do.
3. What has been most challenging about your current position/role?
I have only had one month of work experience at this company so the most difficult thing I've had to adjust to is working on a team with people who have worked here for years longer than me, which can be very intimidating.
