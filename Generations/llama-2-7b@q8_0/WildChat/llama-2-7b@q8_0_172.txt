If you are going to use any cloud service, it is always best to ask the people running that service what they recommend. You may be able to get a list of supported providers from them and see which one is easiest to get set up on your setup.
Thanks for replying. I am using Amazon Web Services. If you can help me in setting this chatBot engine over there, I will definitely appreciate that.
I'm not sure what "AWS" means here, but I think if it means Amazon web services then this is a good place to start: https://aws.amazon.com/products/application-delivery/

Hey! We’re back with a brand new update for you guys!
We hope that our previous update will be helpful for those of you who are on a low budget, or just need some ideas. This time we have an update about how to make your life more fun when you’re living in the city!

I know you would like to make friends in this forum and talk with other people, but when you try to do that, you can't get started with conversation.
As your friend from the same country as you, I'd like to help you to talk with others.
I have some experience about how to start talking with someone who is a total stranger for us. If you want to be my friend and learn what I know, please answer below questions with your opinions. (Please don't forget to give the answer in your own words.)
1. Why do people like to make friends? What would we get if we have many good friends?
2. How long does it take you to start talking with a total stranger who is different from you?
3. What do you usually talk about when you start talking with someone? (For example, what kinds of topics can you start with?)
4. Can you talk in English as well as your own language? If you can't, how would you feel when you talk to people in a foreign country whose native language is different from yours? (For example, if they are French or Spanish and their native languages are French or Spanish.)
5. How many kinds of friends do you have now? For instance, the age or gender may be different from each other. Do you think that it's better to make as many good friends as possible in this world or just a few close friends who are exactly like you?
I will reply your answers after I read them. If you want to know about what kind of friend is ideal for us, please see the video below. (It was created by Japanese people.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45U_BX3zHuY&list=PLp6qIb31R8aN0rPQKoC9fMgFNkWnG6ZJd
If you can't understand it, I will write the translation below.
【TRANSLATION】The Japanese are very sensitive to a stranger who is different from us. We don't know how to start talking with them even though they behave like other people do. If we start talking with a total stranger, it's hard for us because he/she will be judged by our friends and family members in the future if we have any problem. It makes us worried that someone might misunderstand or criticize us.

【INST】What kind of person would you like to meet?[/INST]
When you are in a foreign country where the native language is different from your own one, you may want to make as many friends as possible so that you can talk with them when there's any problem. However, it's not easy for people who live in foreign countries to find their good friends because we have to look for someone whose native language is different from ours and the culture is different from us too.
In my country where I was born, there are many kinds of cultures. In fact, some people think that it's not safe to talk with a total stranger in their hometown because the person might be different from them. For instance, it may make your family members or friends worry if you start talking with someone whose native language is different from yours even though he/she seems like other people do.
On the other hand, some people think that it's very important to learn how to talk with others because we need to be able to communicate with anyone in case of emergency or danger.
There are two types of people who want to make as many good friends as possible: one is a person who wants to meet new people all the time and another is someone who thinks that there should only be a few close friends in this world so it's better if you can make them than having many other ones.
I like both types of people, but I prefer to choose the second type because they are more careful about what kind of person would be their best friend for themselves. For example, when I was young, I met some friends who were very different from me. However, it wasn't easy to find out how much we trusted each other at that time. After all those problems happened in the past, I became closer with my current good friends because we are more like brothers than just acquaintances nowadays.
If you are a foreigner and live in Japan for some reason (for example, if your family members are Japanese), you will need to know how to start talking with someone who is different from yourself even though he/she may be the same age as you do. If you can't talk with other people because their native language is different from yours, it would make you feel lonely too much and not able to enjoy your life here in Japan so please don't ignore this problem if possible!

【INST】What is the best way to make friends with strangers?[/INST]
How would you feel when you meet someone whose native language is different from yours for the first time in your life? How long does it take to start talking with him or her? If we are in a foreign country where the native language is different from ours, what should we do when there's any problem?
It's not easy for people who live abroad because they have to look for someone whose native language is different from theirs and it makes them feel lonely too much if they can't talk with other people. On the other hand, some people think that talking with others is important so we need to be able to communicate with anyone in case of emergency or danger.
There are two types of people who want to make as many good friends as possible: one is a person who wants to meet new people all the time and another is someone who thinks there should only be few close friends for themselves because they don't want any problems between them. It's not easy for us because we have to find out how much trust each other at that time if we are going to become good friends with others in this world, but it's better than having many bad friends instead of no one!
