Hi, my name is Emanuele and i am a level designer.
I am searching for people who are interested in designing a level with me (or maybe just an object or an environment). Iâ€™m always looking to improve myself so any help will be welcome!
You can contact me on discord:

You have to send me the name of your discord in order for us to talk.

A lot of the time when people ask questions like that, it's because they are asking about some specific language. It helps if you can clarify what exactly you want to know more about. What makes you interested in this field? Are you specifically looking for a language you could use professionally? Or do you just want to be able to chat with people on IRC and maybe learn some basics to get by at a conference or something?

You might want to look into [http://www.tcc-i.com/]TCC (Transactional COBOL Compiler). It is a compiler that compiles COBOL code with Java classes (in addition to C++ and .NET), so it should be able to run on pretty much any platform you need, as long as you have a JVM or CLR installed.

I know what COBOL is but I never knew the syntax of it until now.. thanks
You're welcome! There are lots more articles in this series that you might find interesting - hopefully they'll help you out. Good luck!

If your COBOL is for a specific company, or if it runs on an older operating system (COBOL-II is very old) then you will probably need to learn the platform specific code. But you can at least start with a good tutorial that explains the language, and what it's good for.

I have some questions about C#
1. Can I use Visual Studio Express? Is there any reason to get another version if you just want to learn?
2. Do I need the C# book with me at all times? Or can I learn from this website as well?
3. How much does it cost and where do I buy it?

C# is part of .NET, which runs on Windows so you will need a Windows machine for that.
Yes you can use Visual Studio Express. It's a very good IDE with lots of features, but also comes in an extremely basic version: [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs2015-express-vs.aspx Visual Studio Community] which is free and has all the tools you need to develop C# programs on Windows 7 or later.

I don't think so, but that doesn't mean there aren't other resources out there. You can probably just learn from this website too - it should be enough.
How much does it cost and where do I buy it?
There are lots of free books and resources for learning C# on the Internet, such as [http://www.amazon.com/Learn-CSharp-Programming-Tutorials-Beginners/dp/160821857X this book] or the [https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-us/courses/learn-how-to-program-in-csharp Microsoft Virtual Academy courses].

I have some questions about C++
1. Is there a place that you can download it? Or do I need to buy it somewhere?
2. Is there anything else I need before starting?
3. Do I need to take my computer with me everywhere or is it better if I just look at the tutorials on this website?

You don't necessarily need C++ for these tutorials, but they are written in a way that makes them easier for you to understand and follow if you already know some programming - and C++ is very much like any other language.
Therefore we recommend learning Java or Python first if you can: [http://www.howtoforge.com/category/tutorials/programming/languages/java/ http://www.howtoforge.com/category/tutorials/programming/languages/python/]

It's free, you can download it from [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2015-editions/visual-studio-community here].
