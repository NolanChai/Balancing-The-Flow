Natsuki: "Alright, time to get this party started!" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

(Monika and Natsuki play their guitar in unison, then both of them stop playing and turn to each other)

Natsuki: "I can't wait for this baby to come out!"[/BGM]

Monika: "...right. Right. I guess we should prepare our birthing mat too." (puts down her guitar)

(Monika unpacks the birthing mat and sets it up on the floor, then she turns back to Natsuki.)

Monika: "So what exactly are you planning for this baby?"[/BGM]

Natsuki: "Aww, Moni-chan! That's not a very nice thing to ask!" (shakes her head)

Monika: "Hmm? I was only curious, that's all." [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Well...I guess it won't hurt to tell you!" (she smiles at Monika as she sets her guitar on the chair and sits down next to her on the mat.) "First of all, I want this kid to be a good child. One that would make me proud."

Monika: "...that makes perfect sense, Natsuki-chan!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Next...I want it to be healthy and strong, so that I could always rely on it when I need help."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "...I can imagine how you would feel that way, Natsuki-chan..."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Third...I want to feel the joy of raising a child together with someone I love."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "That would be really nice, Natsuki-chan!" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "...and fourth...I want to feel the joy of raising a child together with someone that would love me as much as I loved them."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "I know what you mean, Natsuki-chan! That would be absolutely wonderful!" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

(the two girls look at each other for a little while before Natsuki smiles and looks back to Monika.)

Natsuki: "That's it! Four goals, four wishes."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "...what do you mean?" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Well...the way I see it, our dreams for this kid are intertwined with each other! You want a friend and I want someone that would love me. And if we achieve both of these goals together..." (she looks at Monika.) "...then the baby will be as happy as us too!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "That makes total sense to me, Natsuki-chan! If we really love each other, the baby will grow up happy too!" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Yeah! So...what do you think, Monika-chan? Do we have a good chance for this baby to be born healthy?"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "Well, it depends on us...but I have faith that we will achieve all our goals!" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Oh, yeah! That's right!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "...I mean it's not like you have a choice in the matter, is it?"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "Huh? What do you mean by that?" [BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "...I...just thought that maybe we could have chosen not to get pregnant in the first place..."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "...no, Moni-chan! We can't go back and change that now! It's too late!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "..."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "We still have a chance to achieve our goals for this baby, so we should keep going!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "..."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "...look, Moni-chan! Just because we have to have this kid doesn't mean that it can't be happy!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Monika: "..."[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)

Natsuki: "You just gotta trust me, Moni-chan! Even if we have to give birth to this baby, I'll make sure that it can grow up happy!"[BGM:"Tonight I'm Gonna Party (Hard)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjOw0b6k8Ek)
