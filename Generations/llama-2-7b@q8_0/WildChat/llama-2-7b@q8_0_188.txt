Does this work? If not try modifying your formula to look for "word1 word2".
I tried that but it didn't seem to work. The only way that worked was using INSTR but that doesn't work if there is a number in between the 2 words. Also, the only way I can get it to work when there are more than three words is if they are next to each other and not separated by spaces or numbers.
I was able to solve my problem with the formula =LEFT(C2, FIND(" ",C2)-1) but I'm wondering how I could do this for a large spreadsheet that has over 50K rows. Is there a way to make this work for all cells in the table and not have to type it out manually?
Thank you! That is exactly what I wanted!

I have been given the following task:
"Create an Excel workbook that contains one worksheet (column A) with a list of names. Use column B to calculate the average number of letters per name, and use column C to calculate the total number of letters in all the names. Use columns D through G for displaying each piece of information in the cell."
I have created the first few rows:
Column A has names as follows (in one row):
Mike, Bob, Sue, Joe, Matt, John, Bill, Sarah, Freddy, Sam
Column B is showing how many letters there are per name:
3.2813570456297
Column C is showing the total number of letters in all names (which comes out to 49):
Column D has no data as I have not done any calculations for it yet
Column E shows me the average per name based on column B:
Column F shows how many letters are in Column A
I cannot work out what needs doing for Column G to get the total number of letters shown.
It is so frustrating because I can see what I need to do but cannot figure it out, if someone could give me a hand that would be amazing.
Column E should show you:
=AVERAGE(B2:B10)
I don't get what the problem is?

If you mean validate that the string contains only letters, you could use a regular expression:
=IF(LEFT($A1;1)="?","",REGEXMATCH("??"&$A1,"[a-z]*"))
