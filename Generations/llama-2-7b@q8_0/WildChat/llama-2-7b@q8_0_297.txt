I've been looking for this hentai all day, but I can't seem to be able to find out its name. The game is a visual novel based off of a story wherein a guy named Xiang Yu gets sent back in time by an ancient goddess (the game calls her "the lady" or "goddess", and she has no name). He is sent back to the time before he was born so that he can experience life as his own mother. The art style of this visual novel/hentai reminds me a lot of the game "My Girlfriend Is Xiang Yu", although the characters are different. I'm really hoping someone out there can help me find it!
The game starts with Xiang Yu meeting an older version of himself, who explains how he can return to his own timeline. He then proceeds to show him a room that contains 500 female statues (the game calls them "statuettes") which were made from clay and then fired in order to harden them up so they would be more durable for transportation purposes during the Qing Dynasty period where pornography was banned. The younger Xiang Yu is told that he has 3 chances before being sent back into his own timeline: either he can use his magical powers to bring one of the statues to life, or he can have sex with any two statuettes at once, or finally, if all else fails then he can kill himself in order to return safely home again (although I don't think that this option will work).
So far none of those three things happened but rather than give up on his quest just yet because there are still 299 statuettes left untouched, instead Xiang Yu decided that he would try out one final option: take a shower. After taking off all his clothes and getting wet under the water tap which was located directly above where he lay down flat face up on top of a wooden bed frame made from thin wooden planks nailed together side by side without any screws or nails used as fasteners (this type is called "tangkeng" in Chinese), Xiang Yu decided to see if maybe being wet might help make him feel less nervous about trying something new like having sex with someone else for once instead of always just fantasizing about them while masturbating alone at night after everyone went
What I'm looking for is a hentai where the main character (and protagonist) has to fight monsters. The only problem is that he can't get his hands on weapons or armor, so it becomes an issue of how strong does he have to be before they die from being hit with one punch?
There are many games out there which fit this description but I've had trouble finding any good ones lately because most seem to be based off of RPGs where there is some sort of combat system involved instead of just walking around looking for monsters.
The only thing I can think about when it comes down to the question "What am I looking for?" is probably one of those old school games from back in the days before computers were commonplace, or maybe even before video games existed at all! If you know what game this sounds like then please let me know so we can both enjoy its awesomeness together!!
If you're looking for a hentai that doesn't have sex scenes, this is probably not the one you're looking for. However, if you're okay with that and want to watch something that might make your blood run cold while keeping things PG-13 then keep reading! The protagonist of the show "The Cursed Sword" (also known as "Yuugen Kaisha") is a man named Masumi who lives in Japan during feudal times. He's just an ordinary guy with no special powers or anything like that--he's just trying to make ends meet while doing his best not to get killed by any of the other villagers around him (there are some pretty dangerous people living nearby). One day he gets into trouble after being caught stealing food from someone else's garden; this person happens
