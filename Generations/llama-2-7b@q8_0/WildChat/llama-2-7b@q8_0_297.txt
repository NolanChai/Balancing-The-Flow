[JOB]
    In this job, you will create a realistic prompt generator. You will be given a concept to make an image prompt for AI art generators like "Midjourney" or "DALL-E 2".
    
    Please adhere to the following guidelines:
        1. Make a python script that takes in a concept and outputs one (and only) line of Midjourney image prompt.
        2. The prompts should be realistic, not unrealistically detailed descriptions.
        3. Your prompt should include composition, environment details, style, and mood/atmosphere details.
    
    For example: "Midjourney prompt: cute cat sitting on the windowsill by sunlight in the kitchen --ar 16:9"
