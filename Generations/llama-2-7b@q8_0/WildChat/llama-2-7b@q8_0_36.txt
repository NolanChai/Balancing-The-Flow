Instead of presenting a list in a chronological order, present this information with some other type of order. Here is one option:
Continuous Change for Better Health
Slide 2: Focus on change that occurs as part of recovery trajectory. [IMAGE]
Slide 3: Illustrate the process of how people go from a state of crisis to wellness.[IMAGE]
Slide 4: Provide examples of common problems that people face (e.g., anxiety, depression) and their associated risk factors for relapse (e.g., substance abuse). [IMAGE]
Slide 5: Discuss how recovery trajectory can be influenced by several different types of changes, such as treatment, peer support, medication adherence, or lifestyle changes.[IMAGE]
Slide 6: Illustrate the process of change that occurs for people with mental illness who are on a path towards wellness (e.g., symptoms decrease over time). [IMAGE]
Slide 7: Highlight how each person’s recovery trajectory is unique and affected by many different factors. [IMAGE]
Slide 8: Explain the importance of self-care and resiliency in managing stressors (e.g., coping skills, problem solving).[IMAGE]
Slide 9: Discuss how family members can support each other throughout their recovery journeys.[IMAGE]
Slide 10: Illustrate how the process of change is continuous throughout one’s life and recovery trajectory.[IMAGE]
This information can also be presented on slides that are not as long. For example, you could have a list of four contributors to the continuum of wellness (e.g., medication adherence, peer support, lifestyle changes).
If your audience is multidisciplinary and includes providers from different disciplines, then it would be more appropriate to present the information in a way that focuses on the role that each discipline plays in supporting recovery trajectory. For example, the following two-page presentation outlines how providers can work together to help support patients throughout their journey towards wellness:
