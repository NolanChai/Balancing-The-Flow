(As Valefor approaches Mindy, she stops sobbing and stands up, wiping her tears. She then speaks to Valefor)

Mindy: (frightenedly) “Oh, thank goodness you’re here!”

Valefor: “What is it? Are you injured?”

Mindy: “No, nothing physical - but I feel a terrible presence in my mind…like something trying to get inside of me.”

Valefor: (concerned) “Really? What does this presence look like?”

Mindy: (shivering) “I don’t know…it’s dark, and there are strange creatures crawling all over it. They have sharp fangs and claws, but I can feel them reaching for me…”

Valefor: “Aha! It sounds like the same corrupt energy that Ifrit sensed in the cavern.”

Mindy: (looking puzzled) “How did you know?”

Valefor: “It must be this…creepy presence, right? That’s what caused your sickness. I think we should all gather back inside the cave to discuss our next move. Come on, let’s get back there.” (she and Mindy head towards the cavern)

Valefor: “What is it?”

Mindy: (panting) “I can’t…I can’t stop running…” (she runs inside the cave, gasping for air.)

### Conclusion:
(The aeons gather back into the cavern. Bahamut and Ifrit examine Valefor, who is still feeling sickly from the presence of the corrupt energy. Meanwhile, Mindy remains outside the cavern, sitting by herself - she seems to be fine now.)

### Instructions:
(The aeons gather back into the cave, discussing their next move. Valefor has been cured of her sickness after a thorough examination by Bahamut and Ifrit. Meanwhile, Mindy remains outside the cave, sitting by herself - she seems to be fine now.)
