Hey everyone! It's time for an interesting writing contest. Write your own funny story in the style of a movie script about a girl who is on vacation with her mother and father.
-She's at the beach in a hotel
-There's a guy who looks like the king
-A mermaid appears
-The guy saves the mermaid from the water
-He has a scar on his shoulder and it disappears after saving the mermaid
-He takes her to a restaurant where there is a party and people are dancing
-There's a fire show
-She gets into the fire show and dances with the firemen and then falls in love with one of them
-She wants to kiss him but can't because they don't know each other very well yet
-They decide that it will be easier if she pretends to be his girlfriend for a while so he doesn't have any worries about kissing her before knowing anything about her or seeing how attractive she is without makeup (she wears lots of it at this point). The story continues with more interesting things happening until they finally get together at the end.
The rules are as follows: -You must use your own words and not copy/paste from somewhere else, even if you do so in a different language.-No swear words or anything offensive (unless it's funny).-You have to write at least 1500 words with the story having to be between one page and two pages long.
The deadline is 31st May. -Write your script in the style of a movie, but with more details.-No swear words or anything offensive (unless it's funny).-You have to write at least 1500 words with the story having to be between one page and two pages long
The winner will get an award for winning this contest! You can see what we gave people last year here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BbSZw9xB2Vr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

Little Strombilia was standing on the sandy shore of an endless beach, her eyes searching for something. As soon as she turned around, she found exactly what she was looking for: a huge pile of sea shells. They were so beautiful that they made her laugh and she started playing with them.
Strombilia collected more and more sea shells in the bag that she carried on her shoulder and ran off to explore the rest of the beach. She came across a lot of interesting things, but it was only after a few hours had passed that she finally found what she really wanted: a big black crab crawling along the sandy shore. The little girl sat down in front of him and started looking at his pincers very carefully. He made no effort to get away from her so Strombilia reached out for it with both hands, trying to grab hold of one of his legs.
Her fingers were not long enough though, which meant that she could not take hold of the crab’s body. She tried again and again until finally, after much struggling, she managed to touch him. Her smile turned into a triumphant grin when Strombilia realised what it would mean if she actually succeeded in catching this sea creature alive.
She held her breath as soon as the crab started crawling away from her so that he could not feel any pressure on his body; then she grabbed him firmly with both hands and lifted him into her arms triumphantly like a trophy! Strombilia took pleasure in looking at all of the beautiful colors of this creature’s shell and was so happy about having caught one alive.
She could not help but smile as she thought back to how long she had searched for this wonderful creature before finally catching it!

Strombolia is a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. She likes going to the beach and she loves swimming in the ocean. One day, her parents decided to take her on vacation and they took her to an island called Stromboli Island.
On this island there are no cars so they had to walk everywhere they went. At first she didn't like it but as time went by she started to enjoy being there because all the animals were very friendly and everyone was so nice! She also met a boy named Mario who became her best friend when he helped save her from being attacked by some mean monkeys that were trying to take over their island.
One day while walking through town, Strombolia found out about this contest where people could write stories about what happened at the beach so she decided to enter it with her story called "The Day I met Mario". She ended up winning first place and got $100 dollars for doing so!
