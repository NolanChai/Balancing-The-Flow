* The author mentions that most people believe that they have to stretch to become flexible, but this is not true. In fact, according to Bill Hartman, stretching can be counterproductive if done incorrectly or excessively. He believes that the best way to improve flexibility is by using his method called "active isolated stretching", which involves contracting muscles in order for them to become stronger and more flexible at the same time.<br>
* According to Bill Hartman, there are two main reasons why people tend to stretch incorrectly:<ol><li>They don't understand how their own bodies work. They think that when they stretch a certain part of themselves it will automatically make them more flexible in that area.</li><li>When people overstretch, this can lead to injuries such as strains or sprains because their muscles are not strong enough for what is being asked of them.<br/>
* It has been said by many experts that stretching before exercise increases performance. However, Bill Hartman believes otherwise - he says that if someone does not understand how their body works then it is impossible for him/her to perform at maximum capacity during any type of activity!
