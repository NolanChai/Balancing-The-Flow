Rhinoplasty, also known as a "nose job", is a type of plastic surgery designed to improve the appearance and proportion of your nose. Rhinoplasty can reduce or increase the size of your nose, change the shape of the tip or the bridge, narrow the span of the nostrils, or change the angle between your nose and your upper lip.
Rhinoplasty is a highly personalized procedure that's often done to help you feel more comfortable with your appearance. Rhinoplasty may be performed on children as young as age 15, but it is usually performed on adults who are physically healthy or whose skin has stopped changing.
During the first few days after surgery, your nose will feel stiff and sore. Your face may also swell and bruise. Any discomfort you experience can be controlled with medications prescribed by your surgeon. While rhinoplasty is a highly individualized procedure, you can expect to have some combination of the following:
a small incision made across the columella —the vertical strip of tissue separating your nostrils—or inside each nostril
your nasal bone and cartilage reshaped to slim or narrow your nose
excess skin removed from the underside of the nose
supportive nasal splints or packing placed within your nostrals
Most rhinoplasty patients are very happy with their results. Even so, there is a small percentage who do not achieve their desired results. In rare cases, surgery may need to be repeated in order to achieve the desired result.
Nose reshaping recovery
While you'll notice an immediate change after rhinoplasty, it can take up to a year to see the full results of your nose job as swelling decreases and excess cartilage heals. Keep in mind that even if your goals have been achieved, the results are not permanent. Your nose will continue to age over time. You may need to undergo repeat rhinoplasty as you get older, especially after a traumatic injury or major nasal fracture.

I have done so. I also asked for further details, which you havn't provided to date.
You've given no details on how your method works other than that it is based on the Birkeland current and that it does not include any sort of aether field.
What do you mean by "rejected the aether"? That isn't something I have done, I simply stated my view that aether is not required in my theory, and that my theory has no need for aether fields (at least as far as I can see at this point). This was in response to the comment that your theory "rejects" aether.
No you didn't! You said:
I have read your theory and find it interesting but not entirely convincing, if only because it doesn't mention the aether field which is required for Birkeland current to exist. This is unfortunate as the theory is quite interesting and I would like to see more about it. If you can explain how this aethersphere works then I might be able to persuade myself of its validity, but at present I cannot do so because there are too many gaps in your description of the aether field.
I'm afraid that doesn't make me clear enough for you!
You said: "It is my understanding that you reject the notion that the Aether exists as a physical medium or as a medium of space"
In this context I am referring to the aether in aether drift theory, not Birkeland current. I am still interested to know more about it though.
I have given you details on my model and how it works, which is no different than giving you a detailed explanation of point 3, but you have chosen not to read them as far as I can see. That is your problem, not mine.
I think we need to stop this now, as clearly we are going round in circles, with you making statements and then saying that you don't know what the word "aether" means in my theory. It is quite clear what it means if you read through my thread: http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=30499.0
I am sorry for going into this, but I feel that I have to respond to accusations about not providing details of my theory (when in fact I have done so), and when you say things such as "In order to do this it is necessary that your model rejects the aether" which are completely untrue.
I think it would be better if we just agree to disagree on the subject matter, because clearly no further progress will be made here.
No, I have read through what you have written and I still don't understand how the Birkeland current works without an aether field, nor do I understand how your theory of the solar system could work. You say it has been tested (it is only theoretical), but I haven't seen any data to support this claim.
In order to do this it is necessary that your model rejects the aether. Your statement that you don't need an aether field in your theory, but simply use Birkeland current, does not constitute a refutation of the aether.
I have already said that I have read through what you wrote and that I find it interesting, but I still feel that there are gaps in the explanation which must be filled before I can be convinced by your theory. You say I am asking too much, but I feel that it is entirely reasonable to ask for further details on how your model works.
I don't know what "reject" means here though!

I think that's about right! I have given you a detailed explanation of point 3, and now you are making statements saying that it is not satisfactory. So please just tell me what needs to be done in order for my theory to be validated in your eyes? What more can I do to satisfy you on this point?
I don't think we are going round in circles at all - if you go back and read the thread again, I have provided details of how the system works, but you say that this is not enough information. If there were something else you wanted, please tell me what it is so that I can provide you with it?

I don't understand where I said in my last message that your theory rejects the Aether as you say (although I did say "rejects" the aether field). This is why I asked for clarification - you keep saying it is untrue, but I am not sure what this means. I have never rejected anything at all!
I will agree to disagree then, because I don't think there is much point in continuing with this discussion until we have a clear understanding of the points which need to be discussed and any misunderstandings can be cleared up.
