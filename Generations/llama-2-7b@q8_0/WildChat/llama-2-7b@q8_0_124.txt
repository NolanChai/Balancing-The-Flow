> 1. Why did you choose this piece?

I chose to focus on the two paintings of Lita Cabellut because they are very intriguing, she incorporates a lot of emotion in her painting as well as anatomy that I find really interesting and it's very inspiring for me!

> 2. What makes you say so?

In the painting of "Pomegranate" we can see how beautifully the paint is applied to the canvas, each detail of the painting has a purpose and Lita uses her brushstrokes very wisely, she applies the paint in such a way that it looks almost like liquid paint on the canvas. We can also see that there is anatomy involved in this painting, for example the arms and hands, as well as the eyes which are also incorporated in other Lita's artworks. The expression of the face is very intense with many emotions expressed at once!

In the second picture, "Lost Horizons" we can see that she applies paint to the canvas in a different way compared to her first painting. In this piece we are able to see how the brushstrokes are applied in a more haphazard way which creates an interesting composition for the viewer. The painting also has very intense emotions and the faces of all characters look so expressive, it's just really amazing!
