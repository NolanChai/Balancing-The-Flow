### PvE

The game has been built with three major areas in mind: endgame content (mainly for Mages and Warriors), a mid-end game area (for all classes) where you can get the best gear through dungeon runs and endless grinding, and an introductory area that serves as a tutorial for new players. The first three areas are all connected to the same city called Azewall which serves as one of the major hubs in the game world.

### PvP

The game is also equipped with its own version of a player-versus-player combat mode, with ranked and unranked 3v3 battlegrounds to play in. As a part of the closed beta test, players were able to participate in 1v1 battles.
