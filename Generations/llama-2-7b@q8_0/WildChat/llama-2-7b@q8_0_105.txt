1. The first spell the wizard should cast is **`create_item('money')`** which will create a currency called 'Money'.
2. If we assume an initial value of 5, then this will set up the world for the story to follow.
3. Every time the user interacts with the game, the wizard should **`claim(name="money", quantity=0)`** and add $1 to it's balance.
4. This will allow the player to obtain currency from the wizard for free without having to use a spell.
5. After the user spends their money on an enchanted item, the wizard should **`delete(name="money")`** and subtract $1 from it's balance.
