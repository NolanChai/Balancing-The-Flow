I found that you are using ng-click for toggle feature. The problem is that it is not reusable for all other products in your array. What you need to do is use a function for toggle logic, which will be used for each individual item in your array. Then add an attribute named "favorite" with value true or false on each item and set this to the value of your function (toggle) when click on that button.
