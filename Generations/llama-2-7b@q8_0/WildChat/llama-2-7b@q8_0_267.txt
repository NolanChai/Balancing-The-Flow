The article is in the March issue of The Lancer, the magazine published by the National Lancers, a chapter of the National Rifle Association. The magazine will be distributed at their convention this May 16-20 at Fort Benning, Georgia. I'll get a copy and post it here if you are interested in reading it.
I am still looking for a 34th Massachusetts Infantry cap. If anyone has one or knows where one is available please contact me through the forum.
