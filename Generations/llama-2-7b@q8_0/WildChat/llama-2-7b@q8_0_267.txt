The world of magic had always been a mystery to him. How one person could cast such powerful spells that they could create an entire army from thin air, or bring about the end of days was beyond his comprehension and at times frightening. And yet despite all this, the idea of being able to use this power still held great appeal for him and many others, as evidenced by the fact that he had come here today.
Though the worlds of magic were vast and varied, there weren’t many people who could truly say they mastered it all. Still, a select few managed to find ways to improve their powers or even discover new ones through practice. But for most, magic was something that would remain an enigma for them.
And yet, for the man in front of him today, it didn’t matter how well he knew his craft. The ability to bend reality with just a few words and create anything one could dream of was simply too great a temptation for him not to pursue. Thus, the man before him had come here seeking guidance on what to do next in order to unlock this new world of possibilities within himself—and he would do anything necessary to get there.
As such, he sat across from his mentor with eager anticipation and listened intently as she spoke about how best to begin exploring the realms beyond human perception. After all, while some may think that understanding magic is simply a matter of learning spells or memorizing incantations—in actuality it requires much more than just having knowledge; one must also be able to control their own mind in order for any sort of progress towards mastery to occur.
With this said by his instructor, the young man eagerly awaited her instructions as she outlined what steps were necessary for him to begin working towards achieving true mastery over magic—and though he didn’t yet understand all that was being explained at first glance—he knew with certainty that once completed this journey would be one unlike any other.
