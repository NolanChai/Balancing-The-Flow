The problem is that, so far, the only suggestion that I can come up with is to make him "Captain Toe Guy". And that's just terrible. :laughing:
Also, if it were me, I would say that there are no women in Captain Underpants; however, the heroes (and villains) are male.
Well, then I guess you know where the idea came from.
You said you have a version of this story. Post it here for us to read!
Sure, I will post one tomorrow. :)
Wow, what an awesome response. Thank you so much. :)
It's been a long day, but I'm still working on my entry (it is coming along nicely). I hope everyone else who entered had the same experience as me - great responses! I think it's going to be fun reading them all when they are posted in about a month from now. :D
Okay, so this is my entry for the contest:
A man is sitting at his desk with no idea what to do. He can’t sleep because he has to write something for his school newspaper but there aren’t any ideas coming to mind. At that moment a girl from work walks in and sits down at the next empty desk over, noticing she was sitting beside him she starts to laugh at herself. “What are you doing here?” He asks her.
“Oh I just came to hang out with some of my friends,” she says. “Yeah sure…” he thinks while thinking of a better lie to tell her that doesn’t involve his wife.
Suddenly, the girl starts looking over at him, and then puts two fingers to her lips trying to get his attention. He gets up from his desk and walks over to hers but when he gets there he realizes she isn’t really paying attention to him like he thought she would be.
“Hey,” he says with a smile, “what were you saying?”
She shakes her head as if she forgot what it was she was trying to say and then stands up to leave, but just before she leaves she stops at his desk, turns around and says, “you’re such an idiot!” and walks out of the room.
The man is left confused by her behavior, and not knowing what else to do he sits down in his chair and thinks about this situation. He wonders if it was a good idea to hire another woman after all…

Having a good think about what we really want. I have a sense that we don't know how to change anything, but I think that the key is to find something we can do, then figure out how to make it work for us, not against us. I guess we are looking at the same thing - you are right and it will be impossible if they can't see their own toes (and that seems more likely than them wanting to do good).
I think the key is that we have to find something we want to do, then find a way that is palatable. It has to come from us first, not just imposed. They are unlikely to help - but they could also make things difficult. I suppose it's about working together and doing what we can (or not) as individuals and groups to change our situation.
If we have the courage and the ability, we should try and use the same methods that those in power are using - just on a more localised scale. So if they can get us to do something to help them make things worse for us, then we can make things better by doing the opposite (and I don't mean riot or anything extreme). If we had the numbers and the ability, we could use some of their tactics against them - but I think that we are not ready to do this yet.
But it is a bit like going from having no power at all to trying to have power over other people (like they have) - so maybe we can't win if they don't want us to win (but perhaps we could still survive and live in peace with each other). I think the key thing is that we are not ready yet.
I suppose it's about finding what we really want to do, then working out how to make it work for us without making them look bad (and I don't mean riot or anything extreme). If they can use us against ourselves to help themselves and their friends, then we should be able to use the same methods against them. It is like a sort of class struggle - but I don't think that there are enough of us yet to win this kind of war - and if we did win, we wouldn't know what to do (but perhaps we could survive).
I think it's about working out how to do the opposite of what they want so as to make things better for ourselves. They can get us to help them to make things worse by using their methods against us - but I don't think that there are enough of us yet and if we did have enough, I doubt whether we could win (but perhaps we would survive).
So it seems that the first step is to decide what we want (and not just what we need), then work out how to make things better for ourselves. If they can use our methods against us, then maybe we can do something similar - but I don't think that there are enough of us yet and if we did have enough, I doubt whether we could win (but perhaps we would survive).
