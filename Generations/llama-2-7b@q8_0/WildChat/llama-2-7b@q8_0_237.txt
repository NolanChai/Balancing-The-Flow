Lilac has a dream about her mother with whom she had not seen in years due to an unknown tragedy. As a result of the dream, Lilac becomes very upset and calls out for Milla while attempting to take off. After taking off, Carol reveals that she has been trying to contact Lilac's father due to Lilac's behavior and mentions that he was a scientist. Lilac questions why her mother is not mentioned by Carol when the two are brought back to the hangar, where Carol explains the two did not know of each other since Lilac's birth as well as Lilac's father being deceased for years. She also states that Lilac was sent to be raised with her and Carol's family, who had known of her existence due to her father working on a project for them. Carol then reveals that Lilac's father had created an AI capable of experiencing human emotions and, after learning this information from Lilac's mother, she took Lilac to the hangar in order to see if there was any trace of it left.[/INST]

### Story 03

With a new set of memories, Lilac is convinced that her dream about her mother meant something. After receiving some information from Carol and Milla on her father's work, she heads back to the hangar to try and find the AI, only to be intercepted by Neera. After explaining about what was going on with her father and her mother, Lilac mentions that the two were in the same orphanage together. After some convincing, Neera agrees to let them go along if they are careful. Upon entering the hangar, a mysterious woman appears who Lilac believes to be her mother. However, it is revealed to be an AI made by Lilac's father, which Lilac had previously forgotten about.

Upon interacting with the AI, Lilac is startled when she begins crying and apologizing for abandoning her daughter in the orphanage. Carol tries to explain that her mother was killed as a result of a job gone wrong but the AI doesn't believe this. After having Milla help, the AI calms down due to her programming of being too much like Lilac and explains she is sorry for what happened during the accident.[/INST]

Lilac apologizes for causing a scene at the hangar but Carol tells them that they must leave immediately as Parusa's air forces have been deployed to find them. After receiving confirmation from Milla, Lilac leaves with the rest of her friends on board their ship. As they leave, Milla notices a suspicious aircraft following them and realizes it is Neera's plane. As a result, Carol decides to ram the ship into Neera's aircraft, which causes the pilot to eject. After finding an injured Neera, Lilac asks if she is okay before being informed that her father has gone missing.

Later on, Neera explains what happened and reveals that her father went to investigate a strange signal coming from a nearby mountain range. It is revealed that Lilac's mother was the person who sent the signal after receiving a distress call. Lilac then wonders if she is somehow responsible for her death.

Upon arriving at the mountain, Lilac and Neera enter an underground passageway where they are confronted by Carol who mentions about Lilac having Pangu with them.[/INST]

Lilac apologizes for lying to Neera but assures her that she was only following orders. After a brief moment of silence, the two make peace and continue through the passageway together as they come across the door Lilac's mother left behind. Before entering, Carol notices a strange pattern on it and decides to investigate by using Pangu, who had been turned off by them in order to hide their location. The trio soon discovers that the door leads to an underwater lab where Lilac finds her father's corpse as well as a tape recorder which contains a video of Lilac and Neera. On it, Lilac tells Neera not to give up hope for finding her father since she will never leave him again.[/INST]

### Story 07

Lilac receives a message from her mother's AI, who states she is in the underwater lab. After trying to access it through Pangu, Lilac suddenly feels something is wrong and has Carol try it as well. However, after both of them try it, they are unable to find out what is going on or how to get inside. It is revealed that Neera's plane had been hacked by Parusa and the trio is being tracked.

Later, Lilac and the others watch a news broadcast where it is revealed that the mountain range was attacked with an electromagnetic pulse weapon which disabled all power in the city.

However, as she tries to contact them, she is suddenly interrupted by Parusa forces who inform them that they will be leaving the ship.

Upon reaching Pangu's location on the other side of the planet, it is revealed that Parusa's base has been destroyed with only one survivor present who happens to be Lilac's mother.

Suddenly, Lilac receives a message from Neera saying she is coming in for a landing and decides to head out.[/INST]

Carol tells them that Parusa was tracking them after the signal they received and Milla questions how this was possible due to having sent a fake one. After some thought, Lilac realizes that it must have been her mother's AI who did it and decides to investigate further.[/INST]
