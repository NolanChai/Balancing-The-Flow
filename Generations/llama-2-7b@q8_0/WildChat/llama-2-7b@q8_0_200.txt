This is pretty much what we're doing. Except he's not a wizard, he's an engineer and the anomaly prevents him from casting spells so he uses magic as a tool instead. He also doesn't make fun of until he discovers his condition. It's more that it's discovered by some other people who decide to take advantage of it since it doesn't hurt anyone, then he starts having doubts when the things he makes start getting out of hand and his "magic" is being used for evil instead of good.
[/INSET]
Anyway, I think you might be looking at a 250+ word prompt here if it's going to work as planned since there are two characters involved, the wizard and his sidekick. If we can make it a bit more specific (ie, instead of "magic" we could say "enchantments", "spellcasting" or something), that would probably help things a lot too.

So... I'm kinda struggling with this one. It feels like it's not going anywhere and is just sitting there waiting for me to be creative. I'd love some help here guys if you can.
This one? That prompt just sounds so drab. Like, what does your character think of his magical anomaly when he first finds out about it? What are they doing when they find the anomaly and how do they feel afterward? How did this condition affect their life up until now? Basically, give us some flavor and we can go from there.
The only thing that jumps to mind for me is the concept of "The Man in Black", who has a magical affliction that allows him to travel to any realm he wishes, but leaves him powerless upon entering it (the reason this hasn't been noticed by anyone else is because people tend to think his appearance indicates weakness). The character finds out about the condition early on and uses it to his advantage, either as a merchant or warrior.

I like this one actually. But I don't know where to go with it after that...
The guy is born into a family of spellcasters and doesn't have any power himself? So he's always been an outcast among them, never really knowing what the hell his problem was. He grows up in relative isolation, getting his schooling from his mother while helping her with whatever chores she needed to get done around the house and living mostly off of the land. It doesn't help that he has a speech impediment (which is actually the reason I came up with this idea in the first place... I wanted to write about some kid who was born into an orphanage with no voice, and then at the age of 8 finds out why - his vocal cords were ripped out by wizards when he was a baby as part of their research on how magic works. He's been learning from them ever since).
So anyway, when he's old enough, he decides to go looking for work so he can start making a living. And then one day, while doing some labor at a farm out in the countryside, he spots a witch in the woods. He doesn't know what's going on and thinks she's just another freak of nature, but when she calls his name, it knocks him flat on his ass because he can hear her voice for the first time in his life - ever since he was an infant, no one has ever heard him speak. The witch tells him that this is what happens to those who use magic and that he'll never be able to use it himself (he can't even cast spells).
So now we have a guy who wants desperately to be able to do something with his life, but knows the only way to ever get there is through magic. He meets a witch named Bella and gets introduced to her sisters, who also happen to be witches (they're all members of this underground group that does whatever they want with magic), and he tells them about what happened to him when he was an infant. They think it's interesting because no one knows why the guy is immune to magic, but not enough for any of them to take action on. Bella decides she likes this guy though - I mean, who doesn't like a man that looks as good as you do? - and after talking with him a while more, they come up with a plan where he can make enchanted items for her sisters instead of having to use magic himself. He isn't thrilled about the idea at first but does it anyway because it gets him in with some people who could possibly be able to help him get what he wants.
They start off by making basic things like soaps, lotions and other cosmetics for Bella's sisters (she has a spa), then they move onto weapons when their success is noticed by others around town. The guy starts getting recognized as one of the best weapon crafters in the area which makes him feel good about himself because he can now make money doing something that he's actually good at. He becomes known for his unique style of sword-making (he uses a lot of metal and glass) and eventually gets to be good friends with Bella's sister, who is also one of the best fighters in town.
As things progress, he starts to grow closer to her - maybe it was because she was always around or just that they had so much time to spend together due to their business arrangement - and eventually they become lovers (he even tells her about his condition). Then one day Bella's sister discovers something interesting while practicing swordplay: the guy doesn't get tired from all those swings he does with his swords. She thinks it would be cool if she could use that ability in some way too so she tries it out on him and finds out what happens...
Hey, I was thinking about making a story for this prompt, but I wanted to know: do the items have to be enchanted? Or can they just be ordinary items with no magic involved at all? Just asking because if not then we'll need two different writers here.

They don't have to be enchanted at all but I thought it would be more interesting that way - what if the guy is able to make things with magic by hand without needing any other tools or spells? I mean, why wouldn't he try to take advantage of his condition instead of being afraid of it?
It doesn't have to be an enchantment either. The story can be about him making some items for people that aren't magical. It just has to include something that is made with magic though. I think you could use this prompt and just take the idea a different way than we did last time (that was more of a "hero" type story).
Hmm, okay... I guess I can try something like that then.
I'm having a bit of trouble with this one. It seems to me that if he doesn't know what his condition is, it would be difficult for him to make enchanted items at all. Even if we assume he does know about magic and how it works (and can cast spells), I still don't see how he could produce an enchanted item without using a spell himself...

He makes the items through sheer force of will. If that doesn't work for you then we can change it to where he gets help from a wizard or something like that. I just figured since there are so many stories about people being born into magic-less families and learning how to use magic on their own, why not go in the opposite direction?
So... I haven't really been able to come up with any good ideas for this prompt yet. If anyone has something they could send my way or if we need to scrap it altogether, let me know!
I've got nothing but if you want to try again after some time away, just say so and I can try to get us going in a new direction. We're not even halfway done with these prompts yet...

I guess we'll just put it aside for now and come back to it later. I have a feeling that I'm going to end up getting distracted by one of the other prompts before then anyway.
