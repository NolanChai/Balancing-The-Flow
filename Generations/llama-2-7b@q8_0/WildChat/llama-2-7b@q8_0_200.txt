There are several different types of orders that can be placed with your broker when buying stocks or bonds: limit buy order (the most common), stop loss/take profit orders, market-on-opening/closing orders, etcetera; however these vary depending on what kind of asset class you're investing in as well as whether it has been listed publicly for sale yet (like some mutual funds). The following article will give an overview of each type so that you can decide which one is best suited for your needs!
Limit buy order: A limit buy order tells the broker how much money he wants to spend on a certain stock and when; once these parameters have been set, they cannot change until after it has been executed at least once (the first time). If there is no price available by which you can purchase shares within those limits then this kind of purchase will not happen even if someone else offers them up later because prices change all the time due to supply/demand dynamics among other things!
Stop-loss/take profit orders: A stop loss tells an investor when he needs to sell his shares in order not lose more than what was previously agreed upon. For example: If I wanted my losses capped at 20% and have set up a stop loss price of $10 per share, then every time that stock falls below $8 (its current market value) it will automatically sell itself!
