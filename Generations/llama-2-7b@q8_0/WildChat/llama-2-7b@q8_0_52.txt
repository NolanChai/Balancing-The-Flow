- The controversial issue over Tanjiro's earrings is based on their pattern, not just the color of white.
- Golden Kamuy only has one character with Imperial Japanese Army background, but also with another background in World War I. So they don't have much impact from that perspective.

I don't think anyone would argue that the Russians invaded and occupied Japan or the Japanese invaded Russia. There is also no similar controversy surrounding "Golden Kamuy" for it was a time when Sakhalin was under Russian rule, even though this era is considered part of Imperial Japan due to the annexation in 1905 after the Treaty of Portsmouth.
