Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: You should check the documentation for "Time" in lua. There you will find the `now` function which returns the current system time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970 and `difftime` function to convert it into minutes, hours etc.
So all you need is something like this:

\begin{code}
local function myEvent()
    -- do your stuff here
end

-- create an event with a time after 30minutes (600s):
TriggerEvents.RegisterCallback( "PlayerDisconnected",
                            function()
                                local diffTime = difftime(now(), 600) -- get the time difference from now to 15 minutes in seconds since Jan 1, 1970
                                if (diffTime >= 0) then
                                    TriggerEvent("myEvent") -- call your event when diffTime >= 0
                                end
                            end)
\end{code}
