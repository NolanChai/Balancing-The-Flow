It is not possible to determine one management approach that will suit all companies, since different organizations have different needs. In my opinion, a hybrid system would be best suited for modern managing. This is because such an organization provides an effective combination of the strengths of traditional and contemporary approaches to management (Yoo et al., 2010).

A hybrid approach is more adaptable than other approaches, which is important in a dynamic business environment where rapid change is frequent (Robbins & Coulter, 2013). The system is characterized by the integration of various principles from both traditional and contemporary management practices. According to Robbins & Coulter (2013), there are two hybrid approaches: the contingency approach and situational approach.

The contingency approach suggests that organizations need to adopt a particular management style depending on their circumstances in order to be successful (Robbins & Coulter, 2013). The situation approach is based on the idea that different situations require different approaches to management (Robbins & Coulter, 2013).

The hybrid approach of a contingency or situational style would work better for todayâ€™s managers because it takes into account the changing needs of their companies as well as new developments in business strategy and practices.
