This is not a game. This is an experience, where you can do whatever you want. It's just that the dev team created a story to help you have fun and make this experience even better.
The first thing you need to know about this game: You are not in control of the soldiers, they move by themselves following their own rules. The only way you can give orders is writing them on papers and giving those papers to other people or directly to your soldiers.
This game has four types of characters which are divided into two groups:
1- Soldier (group 1): They're the weakest ones, they're easily scared and don't like wars. If you see a soldier running away it means he's afraid, if he's standing still, he's waiting for his friends to come back from the fight, if you see him fighting on your side, this means he doesn't care about war anymore.
2- Warrior (group 1): They love wars and fights, they don't want to be scared because they enjoy being in the battlefield. If you see one of them running away from a fight it means he wants to go home or to rest somewhere safe.
3- Archer (group 2): They're specialists, if they have good bows and arrows, they will always win against the enemy because they have great accuracy and can hit targets even when moving. If you see them running away it means they are too scared or their bow is broken.
4- General (group 2): They're the commanders, if your soldiers follow a general you can be sure that everything will go as planned. However if one of these generals runs away then all other generals will do the same thing.
You need to write orders on papers and distribute them to people who are in charge of executing those orders. If you see someone doing something wrong, ask him what he's doing and explain that it's not allowed because... You are in charge of this kingdom, remember?
The paper has two sides: A side with commands and another side with the map (you can write anything on it). Each command will be executed if you see an enemy, or your soldiers follow a general who is giving orders to your troops. Also, each command is executed after a specific time has passed. For example, if you give someone 10 minutes for something they have to do and then wait until those 10 minutes are over before executing that command.
In order to save the game (you can save at any time), just go back into your kingdom (after fighting battles) and click on "Save". This will save all changes you've made so far in this game, including new buildings or units which were added during the battle. If you want to continue playing from where you saved earlier then go back inside of that same building again and load up the latest version of your kingdom (it's called "Load").
Achievement: 100% - You have defeated all enemies in one day!
This is a tutorial for my game

I need to translate some sentences from English into German. I found an answer on another website, but it didn't satisfy me so much (but it was quite good):
"There are two sounds which are called the first formant and second formant." -> "Es gibt zwei Formanten, die als erster und zweiter bezeichnet werden"
I found that in this case using two words instead of one is a good idea. The other sentence:
"The second formant is about an octave higher than the first, or fourth harmonic (or wavelength)." -> "Der zweite Formanten liegt um ein Oktave höher als der erste oder vierte Harmonikum oder Wellenlänge."
This one doesn't quite work for me because I don't know what to call 'der' and 'die'. If there are two formants, then it must be 'die Formanten', but how do you say 'second harmonic or wavelength'? Is there some German expression for that?
I would like to use the word "Formant" as often as possible, but I don't know if it is suitable. There are two other terms:
1) Harmonikum - Does it sound OK to translate this into 'harmonic'? If so, how do you say 'fourth harmonic' in German? And what about the word 'Wellenlänge'? How would it be translated to English?
2) I could try using these two words: Formanten und Oktaven. It would sound good but... I don't know if there is a term for "second formant". Is that possible at all in German? Can you use one word instead of two?
I hope someone can help me with this! Thank you very much!!

Based on the popular game 'Marcher Kingdoms' this server allows you to live out the game experience in a world similar to that of Marcher Kingdoms. However, we are not associated with the original game or its creator (Tibor Szelei)
We aim to have fun and work as a community together.

As far as I can tell, "marcher" is an old English word that meant something like "traveling," with connotations of pilgrimage or crusade. There are places called March in England and France which are either medieval towns or the names were changed from the Germanic Mark (as in Marks and Spencer). But it seems more likely this is just a nonsense word that happened to sound like an old English word.
There is a related term, "march" which can mean marching troops or a march county. A March in the United States is a county that shares a border with another state (Pennsylvania has 3). So if you are from a march county you live on both sides of the border and have citizenship in two states.
The word is probably related to the modern German Mark, which I'm told means "border" in a place where a border existed between feudal territories or something.
I don't really think it would matter much to use "marcher county," but I did want to be sure that you didn't intend to imply any geographical features of the English Marches.
