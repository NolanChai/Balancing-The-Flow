So as I was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey again, I started to think about how in space there would be no "solid" objects for a craft to hit. There is no atmosphere (that we know of) so you can't crash into the Earth, and all the other planets are too small to actually cause any damage to a spacecraft, especially since they are relatively far apart.
However, as the astronauts in 2001 found out, there is still interstellar dust floating around, which would be very harmful if a ship were to collide with one of these particles. In fact, if I remember right, some scientists believe that this was the actual cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs - they collided with an asteroid or meteorite, causing their world (and possibly their entire species) to end.
But here's my question: how harmful would a collision like this be? Could it actually destroy a spacecraft completely? Or is it more likely that such collisions are actually harmless and will only cause damage if they happen in the wrong way, at the wrong angle, or from a low speed (which is less likely to occur than you'd think)?
I know that space has a lot of particles floating around, but how many, exactly? And what would the results be if a craft were to collide with one of these particles? Would it explode and kill everyone inside, or would it just dent and maybe lose some shielding (like a car that hits a rock)? Or is there no way to tell whether or not this collision will happen and how much damage it might cause until the astronauts actually hit an interstellar dust particle?
I'm not trying to be rude when I ask these questions, but rather because I am very intrigued by this topic and would love to find out more about it.
It is all a matter of speed - if you travel faster than the relative wind from that particles direction then you will miss it - and it will still cause damage, but not enough to kill everybody in your spacecraft (probably). If you are travelling slower than the particles relative wind (which is actually a lot faster than you think) then you may get hit.
As for how much it would dent and so on ... well we don't know, as nobody has ever been in that situation before. But as far as I am aware there hasn't been any catastrophic effects of collisions with particles like this (except for the one time a comet hit Earth about 50 million years ago).
So yeah ... its not really possible to know what will happen until it happens and then you can work backwards to see how much damage was done. But I don't think there would be any need for "shielding" if you travel at the right speed (which is something that they have discovered in spacecraft - but only because they had to travel at certain speeds).
If it hits head on, then yes you are doomed and not just dented. If it hits side on, it probably wouldn't hurt much and you can even use it for propulsion if you are going fast enough (though I doubt it would be that much of a help).
Yeah I was wondering about this too!
I believe we have a "particle telescope" nowadays. A probe (or two) could get smashed by an asteroid and survive with little damage if the probe was travelling at high speed - it would just bounce off the surface of the asteroid.
So if you're in a spacecraft that is travelling very fast then you might be safe from the dust? (unless it's really small, like a micro-particle)
Or how about this: a ship crashes into an asteroid and survives with minor damage. However, the crash causes the asteroid to change its orbit so it now passes within a million miles of Earth! So the next time we send another spacecraft past that location in our solar system, we get hit by thousands of tiny pieces of dust because they were pushed out into interstellar space when the asteroid was passing through.
How likely is this? Does anyone know if there are any asteroids with orbits like this near Earth? (And how many years ago did you say that comet impact was?)
The next time we send another spacecraft past that location in our solar system, we get hit by thousands of tiny pieces of dust because they were pushed out into interstellar space when the asteroid was passing through.
I think this is more likely to happen with a comet than an asteroid - but it would still be unlikely (it hasn't happened that often). As I said, we have never had an encounter with anything like this before ... and if something happens then it will most likely be catastrophic for all involved.
And the other thing about spacecraft hitting particles is that they usually only travel at one speed - so you can't really escape a collision unless its a large enough object to miss (which isn't going to happen often). But yes, if you do hit something then there is likely going to be some damage done because these particles are very hard.
However, I don't think this will ever cause any catastrophic events like we have seen in movies - but it might cause some smaller problems which would be more annoying than anything else. So yeah ... if you're planning on going to space then there is no need for fear here (unless of course something goes wrong with your ship).
Yeah, I know this topic is kind of old and everyone has already answered it before but I just wanted to say that the chances of getting hit by an asteroid/comet are very low. There have been several large impacts throughout history such as the dinosaur extinction event about 65 million years ago which was caused by a comet or asteroid impacting Earth, but there is no reason why we would be in danger right now because there hasn't been any major changes since then (we could all die at any time though).
If you want to read more about this topic, check out the Wikipedia article on Impacts of Asteroids and Comets. It has a lot of information on how big asteroid/comet impacts have affected Earth in the past as well as what might happen if one were to hit today!

Even a very heavy plate of metal can be pierced by a single bullet. So you need to have some kind of layer that is more resistant than that (which means thick). That's why you need a multi-layered system. And the same thing with armour. It needs multiple layers so it doesn't just absorb one hit and then die.
I do not think that foce feilds can be ignored, they are what will stop high velocity rounds from going through the ship. The hull itself is more of a line of defense for low to moderate speed projectiles as well as smaller fragments. The armor will also have the benefit of being more manuverable than foce feilds.
The issue with force fields is that they are subjected to gravity, so anything in space moving at relativistic speeds can still penetrate it and just go right through you (unless you use multiple layers like a multi-layered armor). I'm not sure about the thickness but from what I remember, 2mm steel is enough to stop most things.
Thats where a foce feild will make its mark. They can be very thin and still absorb high velocity rounds by stopping them in their tracks rather than allowing them through. You don't have to use more than one layer either, the field itself creates a shell that absorbs the shock of an impact without requiring extra material.
Yeah but that only works for high-velocity projectiles (as I mentioned) and there isn't too much of those in space.
You don't want to be moving at relativistic speeds through space. Its very dangerous, you can lose control of your ship easily and end up getting torn apart by a passing star or some other hazard. You also can't stop your ship fast enough if something is coming at you. There aren't many things flying around out there to worry about so as long as you have an efficient manuvering system, you should be fine.
Not moving at relativistic speeds, just a couple of hundreds klicks above the speed of sound and that would make most projectiles harmless against armor. Besides, when in atmosphere, ships need to move very fast anyway so the problem is not as great here.
Well then you need to have force fields for all of your ships to avoid losing control. Even if they don't fly at relativistic speeds (like I said) they can still go through space at a speed that would rip them apart easily. The atmosphere will provide some protection but it won't be enough against projectiles and debris, especially in space where there isn't much to hit the ship and bounce off.
The ships will have shields that block most of incoming projectile/debris with a small hole for the targeting system to aim through (see the BSG ships). You don't need armour plating here since you can just turn off shields when there is no enemy in sight.

The following is a list of possible injuries and their level of damage that will be considered as acceptable or unacceptable:
1. Head Trauma â€“ Brain Damage, Coma, Death
2. Spinal Injury (Parapalegic)
3. Arm Amputation, Paralysis, Broken Bones
4. Leg Amputation, Paralysis, Broken Bones
5. Eye Loss or Sight impairment
6. Bladder, Bowel or Kidney damage/loss
7. Heart Damage, Rupture or Death (if due to an injury)
8. Other Internal Organs Damaged (Lungs, Liver etc.)
9. Severe Burns and Scars.
10. Loss of Fingertips, Toes, Partial Hands, Legs, Foot/Hand Loss
These are just the most common injuries that may occur during a fight or injury from a fall. There is no limit on the type of damage that can be caused to a player. All players must declare what type and level of damage they have received within 5 days of their character receiving it. This is done in game by speaking with either the leader of a faction, if none are available, or the IC ICBM representative.
If a faction member has been injured to such an extent that they are considered mortally wounded and can no longer be healed via med tech and/or medical supplies, their player must post in-character in the OOC forum before doing anything else. This is so as not to upset other players or cause unnecessary confusion by having IC actions with a character that has been killed in an RP situation.
If a faction member who has died through RP situations in a faction, their player may then re-enter the game within 48 hours of posting a death in the OOC forum. However, before they are allowed back into the game and to regain IC control, they must first post in the same forum stating that it is their choice to return from the dead and then await another member of staff to PM them with instructions on how to proceed. The reason for this is because if a player dies in an RP situation, their character will most likely have lost all belongings as well as being unable to be healed using med tech or medical supplies. So until they are able to obtain new equipment and meds, they cannot return to the game.
Players who leave a faction without a valid reason may not re-enter the IC game for a period of six months following their departure from the faction (this is only for players who have been absent from the IC game for more than three days). This rule applies to all factions, so if you want to be allowed back in the game, it will be up to your faction leader or the IC ICBM representative.
ICBM staff reserve the right to change any of these rules at any time. They may also add new ones without notifying players beforehand but every effort will be made so that they are always kept informed via the OOC forum. This way, no player is caught out or has anything unfairly done to them.
ICBM Staff reserve the right to kill a character in an IC RP situation at any time if their actions or intentions are deemed threatening or dangerous to other players characters. They may also take control of any character that they consider to be under-played or has no real purpose within their faction and then play them for themselves. Any ICBM member may do this in an OOC RP situation but only at the request of another player, not on a whim!
ICBM staff reserve the right to ban players from the game if they are found to be intentionally disruptive or have caused serious problems within the IC game.
Weapons in the IC Game
All factions will allow their members to carry any type of weapon that is available to them in-game, but each one will differ slightly. This means that some may restrict certain types while allowing others. Below are a few examples of weapons that may be found within the game:
Guns (Handguns/Sub Machine Guns) â€“ Used by both factions and neutral characters for personal protection or to cause harm to other players and NPCs in RP situations. Factions will differ slightly with each having its own rules regarding carrying a gun in certain locations etc.. Neutrals may carry guns anywhere they please but must still adhere to any weapon restrictions that are set out by factions who want them disarmed while inside their territories/buildings/cities etc..
Bow and Arrows â€“ Used for hunting game or as part of an RP situation, where players are trying to take down the enemy without killing them. Factions will differ slightly but all weapons must be declared when entering their territory/buildings/cities etc., while neutrals may carry any weapon they like wherever they please.
Blades (Knives) â€“ Used for personal protection or as part of an RP situation where players are trying to take down the enemy without killing them, blades have become increasingly popular within the IC game but each faction will differ slightly with some being more strict than others when it comes to carrying weapons inside their territory/buildings/cities etc..
Bows and Arrows â€“ Used for hunting game or as part of an RP situation where players are trying to take down the enemy without killing them, bows have become increasingly popular within the IC game but each faction will differ slightly with some being more strict than others when it comes to carrying weapons inside their territory/buildings/cities etc..
These examples are just a few of what is available in-game and they should give you an idea as to how weapons work here at the ICBM servers. If you have any questions about them or need further information please contact either your faction leader, another player from their own faction who may be able to help with anything they donâ€™t know themselves etc..
If there is no one available then send me a private message through this website and I will get back to you ASAP. Thank you for reading and happy gaming!

The ablity for manual repaers may also be limited given if the ship is a reatervistic or near realertervisic speeds: slowing to stop may take too much time: also the STS program showed the problems with even minor reapairs: on a ship that is longer with a more complex hull geometry, even with space board robots or uterlising shuttelcraft, the risks to the crew, espercily if there is a star close enough to see (Like asttornuaghts can with earths sun) the tempreture diffencul may cuase saftey risks. Also if the spacecraft is far enough away from the nearst plant or spacesation that can send aid, this posses risk factors in or itsself.

What is the difference between INST and MUN? I have done MUN, but never an INST. Can anyone who has experience with both give me some tips or tell me how similar they are? Thanks!
Re: Question for INSTers!

I have done one INST and two MUNs in my life so I'll try to tell you the differences between both.
First of all, an INST is a conference that works under the United Nations framework, which means that it tries to solve international issues just like MUNs but with the UN as its base and that, usually, they are more realistic than MUN conferences in many aspects. For example, if you're in a MUN and you're representing Germany (as I was last time), then you might be talking about human rights issues or any other kind of social topic, but in an INST it is almost always about politics, diplomacy, economics and the like (although there are exceptions).
Secondly, there are several differences between MUNs and INSTs. I think that, if you're thinking of doing an INST, you should be aware of these:
- The workload: This is a big difference as well. While in most MUN conferences (in my experience) you can have a resolution ready just after 3 to 4 hours of working on it with your committee (depending on the topic and the kind of people you're debating against), an INST's resolution might take up to 7 or 8 hours because of the following reasons:
1. The topics are more complex, which means that the research is way longer than in a MUN;
2. You have to do more than just "debate" on your topic (for example, you have to negotiate with other committees to solve an issue). This takes up a lot of time as well.
3. Your resolution will have a lot of legal implications for the simulation and, usually, they are way more complicated than those in MUNs; so this might take some extra research (depending on your knowledge about international law).
4. The committees are usually larger (around 10 to 12 delegates each) and it means that you can't do the work by yourself or with just one other delegate: you need your committee members to get something done. So, in this regard, an INST is way more complex than a MUN as well.
- The length of time the conference lasts: The longest I have ever been in an MUN was 24 hours and it wasn't even the whole weekend (although you do need to be ready for some crazy hours). But this, unfortunately, is very rare. On the other hand, if you're doing an INST then you might spend up to a week at the conference, depending on its length and its topic.
- The atmosphere: INSTs are usually more serious than MUNs (although there are some exceptions). Most of them try to be as realistic as possible, so that you have to behave like a diplomat or a politician in order to succeed. The most interesting conferences include debates with ministers and other VIP's from your country, simulations of UN meetings where you need to negotiate agreements between delegations and stuff like that.
- The kind of people: I don't know if this is common for every INST but I have seen that they usually attract a different type of people than MUNers. Maybe it is because the workload is so much bigger, or maybe it is just because these conferences try to be more realistic. Anyway, you will find many politicians and diplomats there as well as students who are actually studying international relations (just like I did when I was a student) and that means that you'll have a very interesting conversation with people who have studied the issues in depth and know more than just the basics about politics.
So, this is it for now. If you still need help then feel free to contact me via PM. Good luck!

I've been in four MUNs and one INST so I will give my opinion of the two formats:
One of the main differences between a MUN and an INST is that you have to be more familiar with your country's politics. If you are representing India at a MUN then it helps to know about Indian politics (not necessary, but helpful). At an INST however, you will need to have a better understanding of the issues in your country.
I believe one of the best things about INST is that they simulate international organizations. This gives you a chance to actually be part of the international community and make decisions on behalf of your country. You also get a taste of how an organization operates and what their protocols are like (this may not happen in other MUNs).
Another difference is the number of people at each INST. I've never been to a conference with less than 50 people, and some can be as large as 120 or more! This helps make it feel more realistic, but also makes things run slower and more complicated because you need to get everyone on the same page before anything gets done (this may not happen in other MUNs).
I think that if you are going to do an INST then I would recommend getting familiar with current events as they can really help when it comes time for debate sessions or negotiations. You also want to make sure that your country isn't involved in any major conflicts or disagreements before coming into the conference so everything runs smoothly during proceedings; however, this isn't always possible because sometimes there is no way of knowing what will happen until it happens!
That's all I have for now. Hopefully it helped answer some questions about INST and MUN conferences! If anyone has any more specific questions feel free to PM me or another member (or both!) who might be able/willing enough to help out with anything else :) Thanks!

INST are definitely more time consuming than MUNs. In one INST I was at they had us write a full-blown resolution over the weekend and then present it to an entire committee of delegates on Monday morning. That being said, you also get some really great benefits from attending these conferences:
1) You will learn so much about your country's history and politics that can help you in school or later in life (especially if you want a career related to international relations). I remember learning more about my own country than ever before while at an INST last year!
2) It is one of the most rewarding experiences because you feel like you actually made a difference on behalf of your country's interests. You see what kind of decisions leaders make when faced with difficult choices and how they deal with conflicting viewpoints within their own government--it's fascinating!
3) You meet so many new people from all over the world who share similar goals and aspirations to yours (and often times become lifelong friends). There are also some great networking opportunities as well because many delegates go on to pursue careers in international affairs after college.
4) The food is usually good! At least at my school's INST last year they provided us with a buffet dinner each night and breakfast every morning--which was nice since we were staying up late most nights working on our resolutions or just hanging out together until 2am (or later).
5) They are usually very well organized so you don't have to worry about anything but writing good arguments for your country. The only downside is that sometimes these conferences can get a bit monotonous if you spend all day negotiating and debating on one issue--but most of the time it's worth it!
The biggest difference I see between MUNs and INSTs is that in MUNs we focus more on understanding other countries' perspectives rather than our own (which makes sense since they are usually held at high schools). Whereas with an INST we must understand how our country operates internally before we can effectively represent its interests abroad--it's just a different kind of learning experience!
So if you have any questions about what it's like being part of the international community feel free to PM me and I will try my best to help out :)

INSTers and MUNners are similar in many ways. They both allow you to debate issues and create resolutions on topics such as human rights or political reform. However, there is a major difference between the two; INSTs are usually run by a committee that has been appointed by their government (such as NATO) while MUNs are student-run conferences that simulate UN committees and other international organizations.
Therefore if youâ€™re looking for an experience where you can debate issues with like minded individuals from all over the world then both formats will suit your needs perfectly! However, if youâ€™re looking to gain more practical knowledge about how governments work then INSTs might be a better choice since they tend to focus less on theory

It sounds like the way I would prefer to get rescued. If there are any survivors on board, they may need some time to regroup before sending out a SOS that they'd be able to hear.
So you believe it is possible to be lost in space for months?
I wouldn't want my friends or family to worry about me for months with no sightings and no contact from the crew of an expeditionary vehicle. I would like to think, if it were myself, that they would be able to find a way back to civilization rather than just accepting defeat when I couldn't communicate with them anymore.
Yes, I believe it is possible for spacecrafts to lose all power and still float in space. If they do, they will need help getting their systems working again. It sounds like the way I would prefer to get rescued. If there are any survivors on board, they may need some time to regroup before sending out a SOS that they'd be able to hear.
What are your views of the idea that in the case of an exploratory space mission where the craft has been lost in deep space for months with no sightings or contact and is now believed to have perished, should the rescue organisation simply give up searching after a few weeks/months?
If I was out there alone without any way of getting back home for months on end would that be fair to those who are waiting anxiously at home? Or even those that would like me back home.
I'm not sure what you mean by "few weeks or months" here. If the spacecraft has lost all power, it won't be floating in deep space anymore and its location can only be tracked via a transponder. That said, I believe it is possible to lose sight of an object if you are too far away for your instruments to detect it (i.e., if there isn't much light coming from the spacecraft). The point is that if someone goes missing in deep space, they might not be lost forever because their location can still be determined using radar and other forms of remote sensing technology.
I would like my rescuers to keep looking until they have located me or found proof that I am gone for good (i.e., no transponder signal). If there are any survivors on board, they may need some time before sending out a SOS that they'd be able to hear from Earth.
The problem with this is the time it would take to find you and then rescue you. We don't know exactly how long it will take for spacecrafts (or their crews) to become lost in deep space, but I suspect it could be months or even years before anyone on Earth hears from them again if they aren't found within weeks/months of being launched into space by humans.
I believe that any missing person should have a search party sent out immediately after their disappearance - regardless of where they go missing from (on earth, underwater etc). I also think that rescue efforts should be stepped up once there is evidence that someone has been lost in deep space for more than 3 months without contact with anyone else who knows about them being gone.
I don't know the exact numbers, but I do have an idea of what percentage of people are rescued from a disaster at sea after being missing for more than 4 days: about 10% in my experience and that was when they were found within minutes/hours of being reported missing.
If someone has been lost for months without contacting anyone on Earth, then there is no way to know if they are alive or dead until you find them yourself or receive confirmation from another source (e.g., news reports). If it turns out that they did die while away from home then all hope would be lost unless someone finds their body before any possible rescue efforts begin; this could happen even if they were found weeks after being reported missing because there might not have been anyone else who knew about them going missing until then (or even later) - so finding them may take some time depending on where they went missing from/what happened afterwards etc..

That sounds like it could be the beginning of a great sci-fi novel, or at least a really good short story. If you ever write anything, I hope to read it someday.
Well done on finishing your first Inst. Good luck with this one!
The Witcher: "Love is like a tree" - The Golem - "And if they kill me then I'll die." - A New Life for the Oldest Soldier - "You've lost everything that was precious to you. All of your friends are dead... You don't even have memories from your childhood or your homeland!"
The Witcher 2: "There is no law which says that we must die" - "I wish I could believe you, but this isn't the first time people have been brought back to life." - "A human is not a blade of grass. There is no death for him... But there will be soon enough!"
Wow! That was really good! Your descriptions are beautiful and poetic. I especially liked how you made the ending so bittersweet. My only problem with it was that your punctuation and grammar needed a little work (I'm not sure if I did this correctly), but overall, amazing job!
Well done, this was a really great story, and I loved the ending. The descriptions were beautiful too. Good luck on your next one!
Congrats on making it into the finals! It is a wonderful story and has an original twist at the end.
