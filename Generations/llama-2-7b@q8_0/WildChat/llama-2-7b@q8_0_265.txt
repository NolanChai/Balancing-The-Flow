[HIST]Hermes, Anubis and Aphrodite were the deities whose names were used as labels to describe a type of Egyptian sarcophagus in use from the late Middle Kingdom onwards. These coffins have two human-headed bulls flanking the deceased; both these figures are usually shown with the head of a jackal, an animal sacred to Anubis.[6][7] The type of mummy case was also referred to as the "divine double" because it combined the figures of Anubis and Thoth in one coffin.
The tradition of using bull-shaped sarcophagi for royal funerals may have started with the use by Senusret I (1971–1926 BC) of a rectangular stone coffin in the shape of two bulls with human heads. In the Third Intermediate Period, Anubis became one of the most common representations on mummy cases.[8]
The association between Anubis and Aphrodite was established by Plutarch (36 BC–AD 120) in De Iside et Osiride, where he wrote that the Egyptians believed that she was "the daughter of Hephaestus".[9] She is shown with the head of an ibis or a baboon on her mummy case.[10][11][12]
[HIST]The cult of Hermes and Anubis in Greece can be traced as early as 6th century BC. The Athenians had a sanctuary dedicated to them near the temple of Olympian Zeus, where they worshipped Hermes with an image of Anubis.[13][14] At Athens, the two deities are also known from inscriptions in honour of priests or priestesses of these gods and there is a mention of "Hermas", who was honoured at Athens by a sanctuary of Hermes-Anubis.
[HIST]Hermes Trismegistus (Greek: Ἑρμής Τρισμέγιστος) is the name that has been attached to the Greek god Hermes in Hellenistic, Roman and especially medieval times. The term "Trismegistus" means "(he who) thrice-greatest",[15] from Greek ἑκατὸν μέγιστος hekaton megistas, derived from the Egyptian Hwt-kau Em Akh (meaning "Mansion of Millions of Years").
In the 2nd century AD, the Asclepius was translated into Greek from the original in Egyptian. This text is thought to be a combination of several different books written by many different authors, one of which may have been the famous Hermes Trismegistus.[16] The Corpus Hermeticum, some of whose texts are ascribed to the legendary figure, was translated into Latin and had an enormous influence on Christian and Islamic thought. It also influenced the Western esoteric tradition of magic.
The writings attributed to this figure have been very influential in the history of Western alchemy, which some consider to be its founder.[17] They are considered by many to be the most important text that has survived from ancient Egyptian wisdom literature,[18][19] although there is no proof that any of them were written by a single person.
[HIST]The Greek god Hermes was identified with Thoth in Hellenistic and Roman times, especially after Ptolemy III Euergetes built a huge Serapeum (temple to Serapis) at Alexandria around 237 BC.[20][21] The cult of the Egyptian gods, including Hermes Trismegistus, was further encouraged by Cleopatra VII after she arrived in power in 51 BC and made Alexandria the capital of her realm. She patronized many religious activities, including the building of new temples to Isis,[22] Thoth, Hathor and other gods. The worship of Hermes Trismegistus was continued by the Roman emperors.[23][24]
[HIST]The Greeks identified their god with Thoth (Tahuti) in Egyptian mythology, as a result of which Hermetic writings were also associated with Thoth-Hermes. The Greek writer Plutarch (c. 45–120 AD), writing in his work De Iside et Osiride that the Greeks knew Anubis and Osiris under the names Tahuti and Zeus, respectively.
The Greco-Egyptian god Hermes Trismegistus became a popular deity among the Hellenistic Jews of Alexandria,[25][26] who combined the Greek god with their own God YHWH, creating a composite figure called Yehudah Halevi (Judas Halévy), or Yehowah-Halevy ("Yahweh the Initiator").[27] This name was later adopted as "Yeshu", meaning "Yahweh is salvation" in Hebrew, which eventually became Yeshua/Jesus.
The term Trismegistus means "Thrice-Greatest". It comes from the Greek ἑκατὸν μέγιστος hekaton megistas, derived from the Egyptian Hwt-Kau Em Akh (meaning "Mansion of Millions of Years").[28] This name was given to Hermes by Manetho because of his great wisdom.
[HIST]The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that Hermes Trismegistus had written the Corpus Hermeticum, which was a collection of texts describing the nature of God, man's relationship with the divine, and his place in the cosmos.[29][30][31] These writings were attributed to many different authors, including a legendary figure known as "Hermes Trismegistus", although most modern scholars believe that they were written by several people over an extended period.
The Corpus Hermeticum was translated into Latin during the 2nd century AD, and had an enormous influence on Christianity and Islamic thought.[32] It also influenced the Western esoteric tradition of magic.[33][34] The writings attributed to this figure have been very influential in the history of Western alchemy,[35] which some consider to be its founder.[36] They are considered by many to be the most important text that has survived from ancient Egyptian wisdom literature, although there is no proof that any of them were written by a single person.[18][19]
[HIST]The name Hermes Trismegistus was also used in Europe during medieval times as an epithet for the Judeo-Christian God. It is first recorded in the writings of Dante Alighieri (c. 1265–1321 AD), who called the Jewish prophets "Hermes Trismegistus".[37] The name was also used by the early Christian author Tertullian (160–240 AD). In his Apology, he wrote that God had revealed Himself to Israel as "Hermēs Trismegistus", a phrase which some scholars have interpreted as evidence of an ancient Jewish belief in Hermeticism.[38][39]
