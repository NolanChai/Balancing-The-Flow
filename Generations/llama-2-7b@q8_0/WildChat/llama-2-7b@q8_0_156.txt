(“Sayori! How are you doing?” I greeted Sayori. She gave me a tired smile, and then turned to look at Kohana.)

Kohana: “Hey, Sayori. Monika told me that your husband passed away.”

Sayori: (She sighed quietly, and nodded her head.)

Kohana: “I’m sorry for your loss…”

(Kohana paused for a moment as she looked into my eyes. I could tell that she was trying to figure out how to say the words.)

Sayori: “It’s alright, Kohana. You don’t have to worry about me.”

Yuri: “Wow! That’s so sweet of you!”

(Kohana smiled at Yuri before looking back at Sayori with a worried expression.)

Sayori: (She gave a light laugh, and continued on. I watched as she explained to the other girls about MC's death. My heart ached for her. She was strong, but that doesn’t mean that she didn’t need support in order to cope with such a tragic event.)

Natsuki: “I am so sorry that this happened…”

Sayori: “It’s okay, Natsuki. Thank you.”

Himari: (She had her arms wrapped around Sayori's waist as she rubbed her back gently.)

Sayori: (I watched in silence as Himari comforted Sayori. She looked so much like MC with those big brown eyes that seemed to shine with love and understanding.)

Monika: “Wow…I can’t believe that he really passed away.”

(She sat down next to Sayori, who was slumped against the wall of the clubroom. She placed her arm around Sayori’s shoulder.)

Sayori: (Tears rolled down her face as she quietly nodded her head in agreement with what Monika said. I watched them for a while before deciding to go back to my room. As I walked out, I noticed that Himari was looking at me with tears in her eyes.)

Himari: “Sayori…I’m so sorry.”

(She hugged me tightly as she cried.)

Sayori: (I returned the hug. We both cried silently while holding each other for comfort.)

Himari: “I love you, Sayori.”

(Himari gave a gentle smile and then let go of me.)
