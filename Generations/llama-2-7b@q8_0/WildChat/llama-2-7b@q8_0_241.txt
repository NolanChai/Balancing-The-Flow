I am sure you will have seen the advertisements on tv for Socar. The idea behind it, to match up people who are looking to sell their spare car parking space with people who need somewhere to park whilst they shop or visit a hospital etc. I had a quick look at it last night and was shocked by the number of cars that were available in my area (26)!!
Has anyone used this yet? It's only been running for 2 months and there are over 20,000 users already so obviously working well!
I have just tried it. I live near a big hospital and am often looking to park on their car parks when they are full - at a reduced charge (as I don't go in the hospital). You can check availability on your smartphone. It is pretty cool, but there are no restrictions about who you share with so it could be quite dangerous if someone was breaking into your car and stealing from you whilst you were away!
[url=http://www.theexpatexchange.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=25938]What is socar business</a>[/URL], what the hell is a "car parking space" anyway? Is that like an automotive bedsit?
I'm sure I read about this some time ago and thought, who would want to do this?
Sorry, not trying to be rude but where is your sense of privacy and security? How are these people vetted? What if you get burgled or someone steals something from the car while it is parked at yours (or vice versa)?
You can get robbed in a shopping centre so how do you know who's parking where?
I'm all for the sharing economy but this one needs some work and regulation.

I've not seen any advertisements for them - is there a link? I just searched their website on google but couldn't find anything about it!
If you are looking to park, it could be good for those who have to travel into London each day. It might work well in an area where most people don't go near the main roads. However, if you do this make sure your house is alarmed and preferably has CCTV installed (if applicable).
The other risk is that they may not be insured to park on private land so make sure you get a copy of their insurance certificate before handing over the keys.
There's a link in my previous post...
I have just had another look and there are loads more cars now available - I thought it was only launched last month, but apparently they started taking bookings last November! I am not sure how I feel about this one.....
The number of available parking spaces in your area has nothing to do with the start date. If someone advertises a space it goes live on their website straight away and you can search by postcode. I think there is just more awareness now since they started the tv campaign.
There are some restrictions though, eg if you advertise a car park at your house (like where I live) you can only let people park up to 7 nights per year - but that doesn't really matter as it was designed for when the hospitals in London run out of car parking spaces!

I think it is great - you can have the extra income, people can park safely (no one steals a car if they know you are there) and you are not parking on some multi storey where cars get broken into. If I had somewhere to rent out, this would be top of my list!
I don't really see how it works. You have a space but no idea who is parking in that car? How do they check ID?
I am sure that some people will find their car stolen from underneath them and the thieves will use the app to book a space somewhere else. There needs to be more regulation around this before I would let anyone park on my driveway!

I can't tell if this is an intentional play on words or not. But I think it should be added to the quote section for some extra laughs.
The first time I played this game was about 4 years ago. And when I finished playing with one of my friends, I was so disappointed. It was just too short and easy! And since then I didn't even try playing again until recently. Then I noticed that the developers added new content and difficulty to it! Now its even harder than before! But the story remains the same: You are a slave who must find your way back home from Rome to his homeland Britannia, which is now under Roman rule...
I remember when I was in high school that I used to play this game over and over again. It had a lot of replay value because there were so many different ways you could go about completing the tasks given by your masters at each level. This made it really easy for me to get lost inside my own head as I tried figuring out which way was best for me!
The story is great too! You are a slave who must find his way back home from Rome to his homeland Britannia, which is now under Roman rule. The gameplay itself consists of managing your character's stamina and hunger levels as well as fighting against other slaves or soldiers if needed while making sure not to die along the way!
There are several different ways you can go about completing each level depending on whether it requires skill or luck; some may require both but others only one or the other. Each time you start over again after failing (which happens often enough), everything starts fresh so there is no penalty except having lost time which means more work later down the line when trying again...
The gameplay is pretty simple, but it's really fun to play around with different strategies and see how much effort it takes before you can complete each level successfully without dying or running out of stamina/hunger meters! The graphics are great too--the environments look realistic enough that I felt like I was actually there when playing through them all over again after failing once (or twice).
Overall this is an awesome game worth checking out if you're looking for something quick but challenging at the same time!

This question should be used in a job interview to discover the applicant's personality, self-awareness, and the way they respond to different circumstances. A great response will tell you about the candidate's abilities, how they view themselves, their self-esteem, what their limitations are, and so much more.
The most common type of weakness is a lack of experience with something or a desire for more learning and training opportunities. However, be careful when asking this question. The interviewer will be looking to see how the candidate presents themselves - whether they're honest about their flaws while also showing confidence that they can overcome them.
When preparing your answers, consider some of these weaknesses and strengths that may apply to you:
- Lack of experience in a specific area
- Being too trusting or na√Øve
- Inability to focus on a single task
- A tendency to get distracted easily when working
- Difficulty controlling your emotions/mood swings
- Not having enough patience with people who are difficult
This question can be asked in many ways. Here's how you should respond:
I believe my weakness is that I am too hard on myself and that this can lead to frustration or self-criticism, which doesn't help me perform at my best. My strength is that I'm very motivated by my work, so when I get something wrong it makes me want to improve even more than before!
You can also ask about their greatest strengths and weaknesses in order to understand how they view themselves as a person. This will help you decide if they're the right fit for your company culture or not!

One of the most important aspects of any organization is the quality and dedication of its employees. Employees who are highly motivated, efficient and hard-working help in improving productivity and performance of an organization. An employee can be considered as a good internal auditor if he shows his interest for working and completing tasks on time. The good internal auditors may not be the best in their field, but they do know how to work efficiently with minimum efforts and are willing to take responsibilities on themselves. A good audit can only be provided by a good internal auditor who is sincere, honest and has the ability to perform his tasks well. The following are some of the qualities that make an auditor a good one.
They must have a wide range of knowledge of their field as they need to understand all aspects of the subject. They should be able to comprehend any information easily in order to perform their work effectively and efficiently.

They must have a strong will power that would enable them to complete their tasks on time without seeking help from anyone else. The audit needs to be completed within the specified deadline or it may lead to an increase in costs. They should have good communication skills so that they could explain any complications easily with clients and other employees of the company.
They must show dedication towards their work by putting all their efforts into performing tasks on time without seeking help from anyone else. A good internal auditor has a strong will power, determination and desire to complete his task within the specified deadline so he is able to perform better than others who lack these qualities.

Weakness of an internal auditor:
Audit is a systematic approach to obtain the independent and objective information on effectiveness of internal control. The weaknesses of internal auditing may be classified into four broad categories, as follows :
1. Lack of objectivity: This may arise when there are too many competing demands upon an auditor's time. Therefore, audit may not be able to devote sufficient time for the assignment or may not be sufficiently detached from the activities being audited so that it can obtain necessary objective evidence as a result of its work.
2. Lack of expertise: This problem is often encountered in the absence of an adequate staffing structure and inadequate training to meet changing needs of auditing. The internal auditor may not have enough knowledge or skills in relation to a particular area, for example, computer operation or cost accountancy.
3. Lack of resources: Internal auditors are required to obtain evidence for their work through various means such as observation, interview with clients etc. and they also require an adequate information system to maintain records of all the transactions which will facilitate in preparation of reports. The audit staff may not have sufficient time or facilities to collect necessary data from various sections of the organization, thus hampering their ability to give reliable opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
4. Lack of independence: Auditors should not be too closely connected with an organization so that they will be free from undue influence and can maintain objectivity in the performance of their duties. However, when audit is performed by a staff member of the company who reports to someone else within the same hierarchy, it may give rise to conflict between the interest of internal auditor and those of management and this may lead to compromising audit work.
