You push your way through the doors into the hospital. You spot Vanessa on a bed in a room off to the side, surrounded by medical staff. She's pale and clammy looking with her hair matted down to her head. The only other person you see is Kieran sitting next to her.
The door slams shut behind you. It startles both of them and they look up at you. Vanessa has an expression on her face like she's in the middle of a nightmare, while Kieran just looks worried.

>**What do you say to Vanessa?**

### **A. "I was scared."**
You approach the bed and kneel down on one knee in front of her. Her eyes meet yours, but she doesn't speak. 
"Vanessa," you start off with. She just looks at you, almost unblinkingly. You continue speaking. "I was scared."

### **B. "It's okay to be scared. But I don't think it will kill you."**

[Instead of going to work that day (Wednesday)][NEXT DAY 2][R]
You walk into Vanessa's room. She's sitting on the bed with a tissue in her hand, crying and looking miserable.[R]

[Go back and do something else in your day - you can skip to Day 3 if you want.]

Vanessa: [NEXT DAY][N][R] I don't understand why you won't just stay at home with me.

You: [N][R] Well, it's not that easy for me.

Vanessa: [N][R] Why not? You don't have to go to work! I want to spend as much time with you as possible before we die!

You: [N][R] Hey Vanessa. It's okay, okay? Just try to calm down a bit, it'll be okay. I'm sure everything will turn out fine.[R]

Vanessa: [N][R] Everything always turns out fine when there isn't anyone to die!

You: [N][R] We can go see a doctor again if you want... I can just call them and ask for an emergency appointment.

Vanessa: [N][R] That won't work, because they won't be able to help me. Nobody will be able to!
