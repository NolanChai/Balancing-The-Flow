As an indie game developer from Paris (FR) , I am working for 3 years on my first project: a 2D puzzle platformer video game. It's a project that started with the creation of an art style in the colors of the 80's, and it has been published on Playstation 4 on August 1st, 2017.
I am also working for 6 months on another game project to publish on Steam (PC). It is a retro-puzzle platformer with an art style like the 80's video games.

I connect Youtube and it start play. I don't want this because I connect youtube only to download video. When I try to disconnect, it just stop. I have to reboot the server. Is there a way how to disconnect properly?

We're currently having some technical issues with our servers that we've been working hard to fix. To get a glimpse of what's going on (and not to worry) here are the latest updates from our team:
We have had to do an emergency upgrade of our software in order to prevent any further downtime, but this has caused some issues with file permissions and folders that have been causing intermittent problems since we performed it. We're doing everything we can to remedy these issues and expect to resolve them shortly.
The server upgrade is done and we are now working through the permission and folder issues related to that. We have not resolved all the problems, but things seem to be getting better as we go along. As soon as those problems are sorted out, we'll get back to our usual business of adding new features and improvements!
Our team has been able to resolve some of the permissions issues from earlier today. However there is still another set of issues with permissions that have surfaced in a different directory on the server. We will continue to work through these problems and we appreciate everyone's patience as we do so.
All technical issues should be resolved by now, but if you notice anything strange going on, please don't hesitate to let us know. Thanks for your support!

I'm currently testing this out, and I have to say, the only thing I do not like so far is that it is not possible to change the "Default" Facebook page on a per group basis. I created 5 groups (i.e. 5 facebook pages) within my website, however each new page is set to display the default Facebook page.
As the main goal of this is to have only one page visible for logged in users, and not all possible pages at once, it would be nice to have the possibility to choose which Facebook page is displayed (on a per group basis).
I've created a feature request ticket: https://community.metricool.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360035981472--Connecting-multiple-facebook-pages-within-Metri...

I was going through the same issue a couple of days back. In that case i found that it is due to some old image on your profile and you need to delete them.
Try deleting all images from the profile and then check again. I am sure it will fix the problem.

Hello,  how's "shine on" works? Is it print on demand jewelry good business?
Printed On Demand jewellery is a fantastic way to generate income while also expressing your creative side. Here are some pointers for getting started:
1. Investigate the market
Before starting anything, you must investigate what's out there and whether it's lucrative enough for you to put in the time. There may be some rivals already operating in this sector if there is a lot of printed on demand jewellery on sale on Etsy or Amazon. But if that is the case, you should consider designing your own distinctive designs and products rather than copying those from other artists.
2. Conduct market research to determine the ideal product to sell
It's crucial to conduct extensive study before beginning a printed on demand jewellery firm because it might be challenging to locate an audience for each item you create, especially if there are already many similar things available. Therefore, it is essential that every design decision made has been properly thought out and that there exists some actual potential customer base who would purchase such items in order for your venture to succeed financially speaking.
3. Create designs that are distinctive and eye-catching
It's crucial to create unique, original designs rather than copying what other artists have done because it might be challenging to locate an audience for each item you make if there are already many similar items available. Therefore, it is essential that every design decision made has been properly thought out and that there exists some actual potential customer base who would purchase such items in order for your venture to succeed financially speaking.
4. Decide on a niche and focus your efforts accordingly
It's crucial to specialise in a specific kind of jewellery if you want to become an expert at it, so be sure the designs are focused on this particular item type before going any further down this path (e.g., only selling pendants). This will allow you to concentrate your efforts and develop into an authority in one field instead of spreading yourself thin across many different types of jewellery.
5. Use social media to get the word out about your business
The next step after launching a website is promoting it via social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., as they will provide an excellent platform for exposure and growth in the number of sales made over time if done correctly. Social media has been shown to be successful at attracting customers from all over the world, so take advantage of this opportunity by advertising your company there!
6. Use print-on-demand services like Printify or Printful (depending on which country you live in)
These two firms will provide access to their networks of suppliers who can fulfil orders for any kind of printed product that you decide to sell through them, so they're fantastic tools for newcomers trying out the market before committing too heavily into it.
7. Examine your competitors and see what kinds of products or designs they have on offer
Doing this will let you know how much money there is in the sector and if there's still room left over for somebody else with new ideas to come along, which could potentially make them more successful than their rivals.
8. Determine a fair pricing strategy for your printed jewellery items (for example, setting a margin of 10% or so).
9. Start creating designs and uploading them onto the platforms that you've chosen to use as outlets (i.e., Etsy or Amazon)
This is an important step because once done properly, it will enable people across different areas in the world who are looking for unique gifts to locate your products quickly and easily by simply searching through their respective search engines!
10. Start selling as soon as possible after launching your website, social media accounts, etc., so that customers can begin placing orders immediately if they find something interesting enough in what you have available right now.

The first thing that came to mind is Jewellery by Susan. The .com name is available and the .net version of your name could be used if you decide not to use it or are unable to get it.
Your logo should reflect the name of your business so I would suggest using a stylized "S" for Susan or some other unique symbol that can be incorporated in the logo design. You might want to include a jewelry box in the logo and a diamond cut out of the letter S?
A logo designer like LogoTalk could help you create a fabulous logo.

Hello, my name is Gregory James and I am the founder of my own company called "IAMFRESH" which specializes in selling men's apparel including clothing, accessories and many other items. The brand name has a lot of meaning to me so we would like to see it be known as more than just an online store but as a movement. I am trying to think of names that have a playful appeal to them and something that will stick in people's minds because this is the first step towards making a successful company out of our ideas for men. If any ideas or feedback on these concepts are given, it would be very appreciated!
Name: "IAMFRESH"
Logo Design: A playful font with the I and FRESH in a bubble type glowing with color. (Give me ideas please!)
Brand Name: I'm looking for some feedback on this name idea called "Own Your Style." Please let me know what you think! Thanks everyone!!!

I've tried to make a high level account without using instagram bots, just working hard and buying some likes from time to time. The only problem is that i don't know what should i do with the new followers, i would like to have at least 5k or more so maybe there are a lot of things that i can do to earn more money (adsense, affiliate etc).
Any thoughts? Also, how many times per month you check your insta?

ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to generate human-like text based on the input prompts given to it. The ChatGPT Ai model can be used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more.
What is Cavana?
Cavana is an online scheduling platform that helps businesses manage their customer appointments and bookings. It provides users with a centralized platform to schedule appointments, track availability, and communicate with customers in real-time. Cavana also offers a range of features such as automated reminders, payment processing, and more.
The integration of ChatGPT Ai and Cavana can be beneficial for small businesses that rely heavily on customer appointment scheduling and social media posting. For example, using the power of ChatGPT, users can create customized responses to frequently asked questions about their services or products, which they could then post in social media channels like Facebook or Twitter with a single click from within Cavana's interface. This would save time for both businesses and customers alike by automating much of the process without sacrificing quality control over content generated by Ai models like ChatGPT
Benefits Of Integration Between Chat Gpt + Cavana For Small Business
Chat Gpt + Cavana integration can be beneficial to small business owners in a number of ways:
Saving time and effort: By automating certain tasks, such as scheduling social media posts or responding to customer queries, the integration can free up valuable time for other important activities.
Improved communication: With real-time updates from multiple channels, businesses are able to communicate with their customers more effectively through a unified platform that makes it easier to track conversations and respond accordingly.
Enhanced efficiency: By streamlining workflows and leveraging AI-powered insights, business owners can save time and money by eliminating redundant tasks or processes that take up too much valuable resources.
Increased accuracy: With integrated tools like ChatGPT, small businesses are able to access accurate information quickly without having to manually search for data across multiple platforms or sources – providing a more reliable source of intelligence at their fingertips.
Overall, integrating these two technologies has great potential for improving productivity and efficiency while helping business owners stay ahead in today's competitive marketplace by utilizing cutting-edge solutions designed specifically for small enterprises looking to scale up quickly yet efficiently without sacrificing quality or performance levels along the way!

A few books have been written on cavans, but there's only one website devoted to the study of it: http://www.cavanetics.com/. The author is also a forum member (as is Dwight).
You could also find something in books about 20th-century American occultism like "The Master Key" or "Fundamentals of Thought Power". Those books are also very good for getting the fundamentals of this kind of thinking. There's even some "cavans" in them, although it is not described by name.
In some ways cavans could be considered as the same thing as "thought force", and both are mentioned in those books I listed.
I have not read much about cavans but one book that i did read was The Cavanetics of Alphonse M. Bottman, in it there is a chapter dedicated to the theory behind the cavans (i think) , its called "The Laws governing the Cavans". Its a very good book by the way and will explain alot about this topic.
The only other books i have read about are those that deal with the 19th century occult, most of them involve the works of Blavatsky & Steiner, so if your not familiar with the works of these two authors then you wont find much useful information there as they were more into a type of esotericism.
I don't have any of these books with me now but i think in some of them the Cavans are described by another name and called Thought Forces, The Laws governing the Cavans are probably those which describe the laws that govern thought forces (i hope im not mixing the terms here). If your looking for more information about Bottman then i would suggest you look into a book called The Mind of Reason and The Mind of Imagination by J.W Dunne.
I'll leave it with this, i think if your willing to learn more about Cavans then go study the works of people like Steiner & Blavatsky.
Hey there, I had a copy of that book but it was stolen when my house got broken into back in 2005 so I don't have access to it anymore. Anybody know where they can be found for sale online?
There is some good info on the cavans by John Searl. It is called the Power of the Cavan:

When you come to the point that your project needs more than a basic, stock photo and text, then it’s time to look into graphic design. A good designer will take your vision for your website and bring it to life with logos, color schemes, fonts, etc.
Fortunately, there are many resources available today (both paid and free) that make hiring a graphic designer easy! Here’s what you need to know about choosing the right one for YOUR project:
Why do I need a professional graphic designer?
Who is the best graphic design company in 2017?
How much does it cost to hire an agency or freelancer?
What should be included with my new logo package/website design?
If you don’t know what your brand is yet, then it would probably make sense for a graphic designer to help you figure out who you are first. They will take into account things like: what type of business or industry do you represent; how old is this company and where did they start from; what does their logo look like (if any)? If these questions can’t be answered easily by looking at some samples online, then it may be time to hire someone who specializes in branding strategy so that everything flows together properly!
You also might want someone else on staff to handle certain aspects of this process because design isn’t always easy or straightforward. For example: when I was working for a large retailer (who shall remain nameless), their brand guidelines were very strict about what colors could be used on their website homepage, but there was nothing stopping me from using any color combination that seemed appropriate based off of my research and intuition—and they had no problem with it!
If you need help developing your logo or designing a new website for your business, we can do that too! We offer full service graphic design services at an affordable price point. You won’t have to worry about anything else while working on creating something beautiful with us because our team of talented professionals has years of experience under their belts and knows how to get the job done right every time around.
The best graphic designers are those who can take your project from concept through completion, while also being able to help you market it effectively along its way! We’ll work closely together throughout this process so that everything runs smoothly—and without any hassle whatsoever—from start until finish (or whatever point feels natural).
We offer competitive pricing for our graphic design services, which means we can work within your budget. You may not be able to afford the best in class but with us, you will receive quality and value-for-money solutions that meet all of your needs. The prices vary depending on what type of service or product you require.
We offer a wide range of graphic design services including logo development and branding packages as well as website designs for small businesses such as restaurants, retail stores, spas and salons etcetera! If you’re looking to hire someone with more experience than just doing simple projects then please feel free to contact us anytime at [email protected] or 021-15328393
Graphic designers are creative people who work on projects related to visual communication. They may be involved in the creation of logos, brochures, posters and other graphics that help companies communicate their message effectively with customers. Graphic artists are responsible for making sure these messages get across by using images rather than words or numbers alone because they know how to use colors wisely without being overbearing about it while still getting their point across clearly enough so someone could understand exactly what’s going on here without having any problems at all!
Logo Design: $50-$200+ per logo
Website design: $1,000-3,000+ for a new site or redesign (plus monthly maintenance fees)
Brochure design: $200-$1,500+ per brochure depending on size/complexity of project
