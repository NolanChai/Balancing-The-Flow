What happened to Susan Schmidt?
In the beginning of 2010, Ms. Schmidt began having a problem with her left hip which caused pain when she walked. She saw Dr. Smith who recommended that she undergo x-rays as an initial diagnostic procedure. The results of the x-ray indicated that there was a defect in the hip joint and it appeared that some fluid had leaked out and settled behind her pelvic bone, which is known medically as “retroperitoneal”, or “RP” for short. In this case, RP simply means that something has leaked and settled under her pelvis.
The next step in treatment was to have the fluid drained from around the hip joint which would hopefully alleviate the pain and discomfort Ms. Schmidt had been experiencing. Dr. Smith performed a procedure where he inserted a needle into the area behind her pelvis and removed the fluid. This procedure was repeated twice but did not provide relief to Ms. Schmidt’s symptoms.
Her primary care physician then referred her to an orthopaedic surgeon who recommended that she undergo surgery for the removal of the bursa, a small sac in the hip joint that normally produces fluids which lubricate and cushion the joint but had become infected and was causing Ms. Schmidt pain.
The procedure consisted of an incision behind her knee to access the back side of her femur where the fluid had settled, and then the surgeon removed a small portion of tissue from the bursa. The surgeon stated in his report that he was able to visualize all of the joint space through the surgery and there were no other signs of any underlying disease or damage to the hip itself.
Ms. Schmidt continued to complain about pain in her left leg as well as a decrease in mobility and range of motion due to discomfort with walking and sitting down. She also reported that she was experiencing a constant ache in her neck which radiated into her arm, shoulder and hand.
The next step for Ms. Schmidt’s treatment plan was to consult with an internist who would perform tests such as bloodwork, urine analysis etc., in order to rule out any other diseases that might be causing these symptoms. The results of these tests were all negative so the doctor ordered a CT scan of her head which showed no signs of tumors or other abnormalities in that area but did reveal an increase in fluid volume behind both sides of Ms. Schmidt’s pelvis indicating “retroperitoneal” fluid collection (RP for short). The radiologist who performed the test stated in his report that this was a common finding in patients with bursitis or other joint problems and did not indicate any serious disease process.
The internist recommended that Ms. Schmidt undergo an ultrasound to determine if there were any masses present behind her pelvis which could be causing discomfort due to pressure on surrounding organs such as the kidneys, liver etc., but no masses were found in this test either. The next step for treatment was recommended by both Dr. Smith and his orthopaedic surgeon who felt that Ms. Schmidt should undergo another procedure where fluid would be removed from behind her pelvis again by a needle inserted into the area through her skin and subcutaneous tissue (the layer of fat below the skin) to drain out some of the excess fluid buildup which was causing discomfort for Ms. Schmidt’s legs as well as arm pain, neck radiating pain etc., all related directly back to this one spot where fluid had leaked from behind her pelvis and settled on top of the other organs in that area such as her kidneys and liver making them more likely to get infected or develop disease which could have led eventually to cancer if not treated properly right away.
After having two more procedures performed where Dr. Smith inserted a needle into this same location behind Ms. Schmidt’s pelvis (one time he removed fluid and another time he put in antibiotics), the pain subsided but not completely gone, so we will have to wait until after surgery before knowing how much better she feels overall because there is still some discomfort that could be related directly back here due to these previous two procedures where fluids were removed by needle from behind her pelvis.
The final treatment recommended for Ms. Schmidt was a procedure called “arthroscopy” which involves making an incision near the knee joint itself and inserting small instruments (a camera, light source etc.,) through this same location so that Dr. Smith can look inside her hip joint to determine if there is any damage or disease present.
He also stated in his report that he could remove some of the excess fluid from behind Ms. Schmidt’s pelvis by making another small incision here at surgery and draining out this fluid with a syringe connected to an IV bag filled with saline solution which is then infused back into her body through another catheter placed in one of her veins so she does not lose too much blood during the procedure itself.
Ms. Schmidt has been experiencing pain and discomfort related directly back to this same spot where fluid had leaked from behind her pelvis for about six years now but was not diagnosed until last summer when Dr. Smith finally decided after looking at all of her records over time (including previous x-rays taken many years ago), that there might be something wrong here so he referred Ms Schmidt’s case to an internist who ordered blood work etc.,, in order to rule out other diseases that might be causing these symptoms instead of just assuming they were related back here because this was where all previous treatments had been performed without success.
After consulting with Dr. Smith and his orthopaedic surgeon about possible treatment options for Ms. Schmidt’s condition which involved two different procedures performed by an internist who ordered blood work etc., in order to rule out other diseases that might be causing these symptoms instead of just assuming they were related back here because this was where all previous treatments had been performed without success and no one could ever really tell exactly what was wrong with her legs or arm pain/neck radiating pain etc.,, the final treatment recommended for Ms. Schmidt was a procedure called “arthroscopy” which involves making an incision near the knee joint itself and inserting small instruments (a camera, light source etc.,) through this same location so that Dr. Smith could look inside her hip joint to determine if there is any damage or disease present but also remove some of excess fluid from behind Ms. Schmidt’s pelvis by making another small incision here at surgery and draining out this fluid with a syringe connected to an IV bag filled with saline solution which is then infused back into her body through another catheter placed in one of her veins so she does not lose too much blood during the procedure itself.
