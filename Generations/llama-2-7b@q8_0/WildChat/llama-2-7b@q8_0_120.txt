Today we will learn how to design a year-end function invitation. In our last tutorial, we designed an event ticket for an award ceremony. The next step is to create an invitation card. We will design this card for an office party and make it look very formal. We will be using the latest version of Illustrator CS6
We have used a few readymade templates from Creative Market:
Event Ticket Template (Dark) by Boutique Pixel – $7.00 | Creative Market
Invitation Card Templates (A4) by Pixel Art House – $12.00 | Creative Market
Let us get started with the tutorial on how to create a year-end function invitation:
Open up the document in Illustrator CS6. You will see an empty canvas, which you can download from here
This is what we are going to design:
You can download it as well here
Step 1. Creating the Invite
Download our readymade template that contains some pre-built elements like the background image and a table with text boxes on top of it. You can find this under the Resources tab in this document. Download and place this template into your Illustrator workspace. Make sure you scale it up to fit the canvas dimensions, which are 580px x 421 px
You may want to select all the text layers in the table first before editing them later on so that you can select more than one layer at a time when aligning and positioning things. To do this, simply hold down the Ctrl key while selecting any of those objects in your document. Now that we have selected everything, let’s move on to designing it
Step 2. Add Text
In the first step, I used the font “Venus” from Google fonts. This is a very simple font and does not have much variety but will do just fine for our purposes here so I won’t be changing anything about this one too much other than adding some color effects later on when we get around to designing everything else
I am going to use another font called “Avenir Next” which comes with Illustrator CS6 itself or can also be downloaded from Google Fonts website (http://www.googlefonts.com/ ) There are a lot more options available than what’s included in the default install of Illustrator though so feel free
Step 3. Adding The Logo
Now that we have added all our text and made some changes to it, let’s go ahead and add the logo for this event invitation card design. I chose an image from Creative Market called “Office Party Invite Logo” which was designed by Boutique Pixel Design Agency – http://www.boutiquepixeldesignagency . com/
If you don’t have access to this kind of design resources then feel free to substitute whatever else works best for your needs here but just remember that whatever icon or image ends up being used in place of the “Office Party Invite Logo” will need to be sized appropriately so as not to look too small or too big
Step 4. Adding More Text
I am going to add some more text into this design now by using another font called “PT Sans” which also comes with Illustrator CS6 itself or can be downloaded from Google Fonts website (http://www.googlefonts .com/ ) I have chosen to use the font color and background color of #000000 so that everything appears black but feel free
Step 5. Adding Images
Next, I am going to add an image into this design which will be used as a background for one side of our invitation card. You can find an image called “Office Party Invite Background” on Creative Market – http://www.creativemarket.com/boutiquepixeldesignagency/142845-office-party-invite-background?u=169009
I have chosen to use this image because it looks like a photo of people dancing together at an event which is what we want our design to convey so feel free
Step 6. Adding The Table Backgrounds
Next up let’s go ahead and add some more text onto our table backgrounds in order for them to be visible through whatever object ends up being used as their backdrop later on down the road when we start adding things like logos or other images into this design. I have chosen two different colors – one light gray color which can
Step 7. Adding The Text Box Backgrounds
Next let’s add another set of text boxes onto our invitation card so that they can be used for adding things like addresses, phone numbers and any other information needed when sending out these types of correspondences with clients or friends who might receive one of these cards later on down the road as well! I have chosen two different colors here – a light gray color which works very nicely when combined together with another darker shade
