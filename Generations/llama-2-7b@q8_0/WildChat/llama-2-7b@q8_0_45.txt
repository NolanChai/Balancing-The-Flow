I am highly committed to upholding patient confidentiality in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines, which is a federal law that establishes national standards for protecting certain health information. To ensure compliance with these regulations, I always log out of electronic platforms such as Medi-Map and Vcare after using them to administer medications or document nursing care, ensuring the utmost protection of patient confidentiality. Furthermore, during my time on the unit, I consistently utilized these software applications for medication administration and documentation purposes, always taking great care to log out from these platforms diligently, maintaining accuracy for future reference and safeguarding patient privacy. On one occasion, I conducted a blood sugar level check for a resident and administered the required insulin as per the instructions in Medi-Map, all under the supervision of my preceptor. The blood sugar level was within normal limits. Following the procedure, I recorded the details in the patient's electronic file with date and time, and counter signed by the preceptor, ensuring accuracy for future reference and maintaining patient confidentiality. In summary, I am committed to upholding patient confidentiality and complying with HIPAA regulations, and have always taken great care to log out of electronic platforms after using them to ensure the utmost protection of patient privacy.

Throughout my clinical placement, I have consistently upheld the principle of patient confidentiality, never disclosing residents' details outside the clinical facility. During handovers to the next shift, I encountered a situation where a family member entered and inquired about the patient's progress. In response, I promptly paused the handover process, attended to the family member's inquiry, and resumed the handover once they had left the room. I have always made it a practice to discontinue endorsing when anyone enters the nurses' station, ensuring the maintenance of patient confidentiality. Then, the nursing handover sheet was safely returned to the secured cabin in the nurses station. This approach allows me to simultaneously address the family member's needs while safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of our patients. This commitment to confidentiality is a fundamental aspect of providing quality patient care and maintaining trust within the healthcare setting.

I agree with your assessment of this resident’s knowledge deficit regarding their treatment regimen. During an interaction I recently had with a resident, she asked me about the significance of taking Levodopa, a medication in her treatment regimen. I took the opportunity to provide her with a clear explanation. I conveyed to her that Levodopa plays a crucial role in replenishing her dopamine levels, addressing and potentially alleviating the symptoms she experiences, including tremors, stiffness, and slow movement. Additionally, I discussed the potential side effects of the medication and how it contributes to the improvement of her overall health condition. I ensured that my explanation was comprehensive, and patient took the medication as ordered under my preceptor’s supervision. Following our discussion, the resident expressed her understanding of the information provided.

I am going to do an intervention if there are signs of aggression, for example if the patient will punch me or bite me, I need to document this in my notes so that the next shift can be aware of it. Also, in the event of aggressive behavior, I will make a note on the nursing progress note, not the med chart as its already there and I do not want to have too many notes on there.
