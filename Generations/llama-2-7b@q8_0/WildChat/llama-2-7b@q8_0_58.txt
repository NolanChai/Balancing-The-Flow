Iodometery is the measurement of iodine concentration in a solution by using [iodometric titration](https://www.slideshare.net/abhiram1985/iodometric-titration) method. Iodimetry is similar to iodometry but it deals with [iodide ion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide_ion) concentration in solution and involves the use of an [iodine solution](https://www.slideshare.net/abhiram1985/iodometric-titration).

### Question:
Explain the purpose of iodometry?

### Answer:
Iodometry is used to determine iodine concentration in a given solution. It is useful to determine the presence of iodine in compounds. Iodometery also helps us identify compounds that contain iodide and iodate ions.

### Question:
Explain the purpose of iodimetry?

### Answer:
Iodimetery is used to determine iodide ion concentration in a given solution. It is useful for identifying the presence of iodide ion in compounds and also determining whether or not a compound contains iodine.

### Question:
Give an example of how Iodometry would be used?

### Answer:
The concentration of iodine could be found from an unknown solution using iodometric titration by titrating the [iodimetric](https://www.slideshare.net/abhiram1985/iodometric-titration) indicator with a solution of potassium iodide.

Iodometry can also be used as an analytical method to determine the number of moles of NaCl present. This is achieved using the following equation
$$Na_3PO_4 + KIO_3 \to \text{K}_2\text{HPO}_{3} + 2\text{Na}_2\text{I}$$
This reaction produces a yellowish precipitate which can be separated from the solution and titrated with a standard solution of NaOH. The moles of Cl- can then be calculated using the normalization equation for iodometry
$$I = \frac{\text{Coulombs}}{\text{Moles}\times10^6} = 54.283\times\frac{Moles}{\text{litre}}\times\frac{\text{moles}\times10^{-9}}{1.122}$$
This reaction is also used to determine the concentration of iodine present in a solution using an electrochemical cell
