That's a really good question. I'm not sure that I could answer it with any certainty, though if we assume the player is female and reasonably young (as most of these players are) I imagine they would be overwhelmed by this gesture of unbridled love and adoration from Alyx...
I've been thinking about this since last week.
I guess it depends on whether you like that sort of thing in games or not? If it makes the game more immersive, then I suppose it's good, but if it's just there to add another layer of contrivance, then that could be bad. But I think it's one of those things where if it doesn't work for you, you don't play it and just get on with enjoying the rest of the game.
I remember playing a certain FPS many years ago which had an almost identical scene to this in it (though not quite). You were surrounded by a group of enemies when suddenly one of them decided to throw himself onto you, rather than shoot at you or kill you and take your weapon. I found myself being able to play through that bit without any real trouble, but if it had happened during the rest of the game then it would've really annoyed me!
I think in a game where there is already an established relationship (or friendship) between the characters this kind of thing could be fun, as long as they don't do it every five minutes...
This would happen.
Wasn't that scene actually one of the most memorable moments from Half-Life 2? I don't remember a whole lot else about that game (which is really saying something!), but I have always remembered the moment when Alyx threw herself onto Gordon and how much it affected me emotionally.
I'm not sure if there was an actual reason for her to do this, or if she just did it out of affection and love...but even so, I thought it was a great moment which really brought everything together in the storyline and added some much needed depth.
