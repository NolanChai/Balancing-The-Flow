I think there is a way but I am not sure what you are looking for. There may be some interesting things to do with the "body" of an electric guitar, maybe something involving piezos and transistors?
But the sound itself comes from the pickups (which have magnets in them) and the strings.
Astronauts do experience a lot more g-force than you can get on earth. I guess they are using some kind of drugs to enhance the feeling, or there is something special about their bodies? But I dont think it would be possible to replicate that just by making an electric guitar louder.
Maybe if you could play fast and loud for long enough without any pain, and then gradually increase how hard you were playing? But maybe your hand will give out before the adrenaline does?
That's a good question about astronauts. They're probably in some kind of drugged stupor or something. I don't know that much about astronautics though, so I can't really comment further than that.
But it doesn't need to be amplified and loud either. It just needs to sound the same when played very softly as well as with more force (but not too much force).
I thought it would take a long time to build up but maybe you could get there quicker by gradually increasing the tension on the strings?
