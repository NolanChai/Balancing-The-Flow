superheat = (C*10)/(273+R) ; C=compressor suction temp, R=refrigerant temp 

### Note:
the formula above assumes isentropic compression; if the compressor is not running in isentropic conditions, then one should use the equation below (thanks to Yakov Shtraizl):
superheat = C*(10-273)/((R+1.5)*10)

If you are using the turbocharger with a piston engine, your engine has insufficient power. You can choose bigger turbo or add more fuel/air mixture at high rpm to increase efficiency and power of engine. If there is too much air, it will reduce the compression ratio and efficiency of engine.

**1. What are the conditions of maximum efficiency?**
*  **E=24087.65 - 1.9718T^3 + 328.052T^4 - 680.842T^5  

*  **2) What is the difference between the E_max and the E_ref (ref being the reference efficiency)?**
E_max-24087.65=1.9718T3+328.052T4-680.842T5
*  

### Step 3: Increase in Efficiency with Tube Diameter:
