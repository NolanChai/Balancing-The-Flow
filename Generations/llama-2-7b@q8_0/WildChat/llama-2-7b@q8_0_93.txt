In order to be able to describe the learning myth, it’s necessary to first understand what memorization really is. Memorizing can mean remembering something or repeating something over and over again to finally remember it. It is a technique that allows you to remember information for short periods of time (the so-called “short term memory”).
According to the researcher Daniel Willingham, it has been proven that learning by repetition works in only two cases:
Learning material that is easy to understand;
Learn simple facts.
But how can we find out if something is simple enough or not? Let’s say for example, a student who studies for his/her exams and repeats all the things he/she read in the textbooks and during classes for months. It sounds like this repetition method would be really good to help him remember everything. However, it does not necessarily mean that he will retain all the information for later on. Why? Because at some point or another, he might get confused with similar topics that can make him have a hard time distinguishing one from the other and thus cause the loss of all the work done throughout these months (Willingham, 2010).
Another case would be a student who does not understand well what his professor explains in class, so he ends up taking notes but doesn’t really know how to use them. He then goes home and tries hard to remember everything by repeating it over and over again (in fact, this is called “overlearning”) until finally being able to memorize all the information. However, what happens after that? The student has studied well in order for him/her not to fail his/her exams but unfortunately won’t be able to apply any of it during their daily life because they don’t know how to use these notes outside classrooms (Willingham, 2010).
It is easy to see that memorization cannot work in all circumstances. There are even times when using this method makes students more confused and causes them to fail exams or tests. So why do we continue teaching by repeating things over and over again? This myth started appearing around the 19th century thanks to educators like Friedrich Fröbel, who believed that if children were taught everything at once instead of gradually learning about each subject separately (like today’s schools), then they would be able to learn faster and more effectively. However, this theory is not true because even though kids can remember facts better when they are told them all in one go, they still need time to process what has been said or shown before moving onto another topic (Willingham, 2010).

This is an example of a high band 9 essay. Note the range of vocabulary used throughout.
The diagram shows the number of people using six different types of public transport in two cities in North America and Europe over a period of thirty years from 1970 to 2000. [/EXAM]
The given graph compares the numbers of passengers travelling by bus, underground, plane, taxi, bicycle and car in both New York and London from 1970 to 2000. It is clear that there were more people using public transportation in London than those doing so in New York, with the exception of the use of bikes which was higher in NY. [/EXAM]
In 1970, more than half of the people in New York commuted by taxi and a quarter travelled on foot or cycle; while slightly fewer than 25% were using public transportation (mostly underground trains) and fewer than ten percent travelled to work by car. [/EXAM]
The situation was almost reversed in London where only about ten percent of the people commuted by taxi, as many as half walked or cycled to work while a third used public transportation (mostly buses), although less people than in New York travelled by underground trains. [/EXAM]
It is clear that in both cities, there was an increase in the use of car and plane from 1970 to 2000, with nearly 40% more passengers travelling by car, and double as many people using planes. In London, however, underground trains were still popular despite an increase in their number from three million passengers a year to almost five million. [/EXAM]
In New York there was very little change over thirty years with more than half the population commuting by car, bus and taxi while the use of public transportation dropped slightly but remained high. However, the bicycle became popular in NYC during this period although there were only 10% fewer people using it in 2000 compared to 1970. [/EXAM]
In conclusion, both cities saw an increase in car and plane use over time, while bus travel decreased slightly in London but remained popular with its citizens. The underground trains also increased from three million passengers a year to five million in the same city, although bicycle use rose more dramatically in New York. [/EXAM]

[EXAM]The diagram below shows the worldwide sales in millions of dollars for five different types of toys between 1980 and 1992. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.[/EXAM]
There is a bar chart showing sales figures (in million dollars) for five categories of toys between 1980 and 1992. The data shows that, in terms of yearly sales, dolls were the most popular; however, dolls also enjoyed a decline in demand by the end of the period under review while other toy types, such as action figures and board games experienced steady growth. [/EXAM]
In 1980, dolls were the best-selling toys with over six million dollars worth sold. However, sales decreased from approximately five million to slightly less than three million during the following decade. Conversely, other toy types such as action figures and board games showed increasing trends in sales, from approximately four million dollars a year in 1980 to nearly seven million dollars by 1992. [/EXAM]
The data for all five toys show the same pattern of declining doll sales and rising demand for other types over the twelve-year period. In general, the trend for all categories was upward, with the exception of dolls in the final year under review.[/EXAM]

[EXAM]The table shows the percentage of women who were in work during selected periods between 1975 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.[/EXAM]
There is a bar chart that gives percentages for female employment from 1975 to 2008 in different periods. [/EXAM]
The graph shows that female workforce participation was low between 1975-1980, increased to a peak level at the beginning of the nineties and decreased since then. [/EXAM]
From 1975 until 1980, female participation in the labour force declined from 42 percent to 36 percent, which was lower than in any other period. In the year 1981, the percentage rose sharply and reached a peak of 54 percent by 1987, but it went down to 51 percent until 1990.[/EXAM]
However, after that the number started to decrease again and remained at the same level for the next six years. In the last period analysed (2006-2008) only 46% of women participated in the workforce.[/EXAM]
In conclusion, there was a steady rise in female employment rates between 1975 and 1990, but it fell sharply after that and is currently lower than any other period. [/EXAM]

There is a bar chart that gives percentages for female employment from 1975 to 2008 in different periods. [/EXAM]
The given graph compares the participation of women in four different periods (between 1975 and 2006) and shows the percentage change of participation since the previous year. Overall, female workforce participation has increased from 1975 to 2008 with a small fluctuation after each peak period. [/EXAM]
The data shows that in 1975 only about forty percent of women participated in the labour force which was lower than any other time period until 1983. However, female participation in employment increased rapidly over the next three years with a sharp rise from 42% to 50%. [/EXAM]
The figure rose again in 1986 and reached its peak at 54 percent before dropping back down to almost 53 percent in 1987. However, there was an increase of about five percentage points the following year which then remained relatively stable until 2008.[/EXAM]
In conclusion, overall female participation has increased over time; however, the number decreased after every peak period, with the exception of a slight fluctuation between 1975 and 1983. [/EXAM]

[S]1. Describe a time that you took a new perspective on an old problem. Explain why you changed your perspective and describe what happened as a result of doing so. [/S]
[P1]It is common for us to have many perspectives about our problems in our mind. For instance, when we are faced with the same issue again and again, we may have different perspectives from time to time according to the circumstances or the situation we were facing. These perspectives can be positive or negative that leads us to act differently.
[P2]When I was in year 10 of primary school, my teacher asked us to do an experiment on planting a seedling and taking care of it. We were allowed to use a water pump and a timer to adjust the timing when we gave water for our seedlings. My group decided to give them water as soon as the meter showed that they are not in the danger zone (that is, no need to worry). After a few days of doing this, my group’s seedling started to wither off and die. Our teacher asked us why we were doing so. We told him our reasons which all were positive ones. The teacher pointed out that it was because we always gave them too much water in a short time and the seedlings could not absorb the excessive amount of water and they will suffer from root rot. Hence, he advised us to give less water at once and do this several times each day so that our seedlings can have sufficient time to absorb the nutrients they need and recover from the damage of the previous overdose.
[P3]As my teacher explained to us the cause of our mistakes, we understood why what we did was wrong and I realised that not all positive perspectives are correct ones. The way I dealt with this problem is that I took his advice to improve upon it by doing less watering for a while so that my seedlings can recover. In addition, I also learnt from him that even if we believe our actions are right and have no bad impacts, sometimes the outcome may not be as expected due to circumstances or situations and we should keep an open mind for other opinions in order to improve ourselves.
[S]2. How do you use your curiosity to solve problems? What challenges or obstacles might get in the way of using this strategy and how did/could you overcome them? [/S]
[P1]I am a curious person by nature. I like to look for things that can satisfy my curiosity and often come up with different ways to approach an issue so as to find answers. For instance, when my teacher asked us to do some experiments in class, I would try to get all the information or instructions from him and then think of ways to solve the problems according to his explanations. This is because I like to understand things by myself rather than relying on others. However, sometimes I have a tendency to ignore other people’s opinions that may lead me into some troubles. When this happens, it would help if I could listen to them and consider their suggestions first before coming up with my own way of doing something so that there will be a higher chance for things going well.
[P2]In year 6 when we were studying English, the teacher asked us to write a book review about a popular children’s story “The Wizard of Oz” by L. Frank Baum (1890). I had read this book before so I was looking forward to writing my own review based on my own point of view. The classmates were also assigned with the same task and they did their reviews as well. The teacher asked us to present our reviews in front of everyone after reading them aloud to one another so that we could understand what other people thought about this book from different perspectives. When I was done writing my own review, I decided not to make any changes because I thought it would take too long if I had to start over again. As a result, when I presented my work in front of everyone else, some classmates told me that they could not understand what point of view my story was based on since there were many different perspectives written by other students and mine looked very similar compared with others’ reviews. This made me feel ashamed because although I had tried to be creative while writing this review, it ended up being too generic in the end which led people to misunderstand what point of view my story was based on (which actually had nothing related).
[P3]The situation above taught me that not all creativity is good when we try to solve problems or come up with solutions. If one does something without considering others’ opinions first then it might lead into some troubles in the future so I learnt from this experience and started listening more closely what people say about issues instead of ignoring them completely as before which has helped me become less stubborn when dealing with things nowadays.
[S]3. Explain how you use creativity to solve problems (or take perspectives on a problem). How do your approaches differ from the ways in which a team would normally approach solving a problem? [/S]
[P1]I like to think outside of the box when it comes to solving problems or taking perspectives on them. I believe that if one just sticks with what they know and follow their intuition blindly then it won’t be easy for them to come up with creative solutions because this is where most people struggle with problem solving which leads me into thinking about how other people might tackle these problems differently compared with myself since we all have different ways of looking at things from different perspectives.
[P2]In year 7 when we were studying English, the teacher asked us to read a book called “The House on Mango Street” by Sandra Cisneros (1984). The story is about Esperanza who lives in an apartment building with her family and friends. She wants to move out of this house one day but there are many obstacles stopping her from doing so because she does not have enough money for rent nor can she find another job after quitting her current position as a waitress at a restaurant due to some unfortunate circumstances happening while working there which made me think about why Esperanza wants to move out of this house in the first place if it was such an awful living environment? I believe that when people are faced with difficult situations such as those experienced by Esperanza they will try their best to find creative ways or take perspectives on problems so as not only survive but also thrive.
[P3]Whenever we face challenges, whether it is personal or professional in nature, one should always try his/her hardest to come up with new ideas that may help solve the issue at hand by thinking outside of our comfort zone because this could lead us into finding solutions which were never thought before but now can be implemented due to these innovative approaches.
[S]4. When you are working on a project, what do you value most in your team? Why is it important to have diversity within a group? [/S]
[P1]I like having different perspectives within a group when I work on projects because this can lead into more creative ideas being generated which ultimately results in better outcomes since everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses that they bring along with them.
[P2]In year 6 when we were studying English, the teacher asked us to do an assignment where she would give us some instructions regarding what we had to do as part of this activity then it would be our responsibility for figuring out how exactly should these tasks be performed in order achieve success? I always like working with others because there is a chance that their different points view or ways of thinking might help me find solutions which were never thought before but now can be implemented due to these innovative approaches.

[S]5. Explain how you work on a team and what impact your contribution has had? What kind of contributions do you most value in yourself or other members of a team? [/S]

My topic is : "Memorization is the key to successful learning". I want to suggest a more evidence-based and accurate (e.g., more precise or nuanced) position/conclusion and make practical recommendations logically based on that conclusion.
You can't just change my suggestion to whatever you like, as you did in your other INST questions. You have to do the work yourself.
SOURCE: Memorization is not always effective but it does help a great deal if done correctly.
TARGET: Memorization is not necessary and effective learning doesn't require memorizing things.
Your suggestions are based on that premise - which is inaccurate - so your suggestion isn't accurate either. You have to do the work yourself, don't expect others to give you the answer.
SOURCE: Memorization can be very useful for learning new material.
TARGET: Memorizing things does not lead to long term knowledge and skills acquisition but it is a useful tool for short term memory
The best way of teaching kids is through games and role playing, as kids have vivid imaginations which help them visualize the learning content. Teaching by reading from textbooks will cause many students to lose interest in the material, and most likely forget what they've learned in the first place.
SOURCE: Memorization can be useful for improving long-term memory retention of a topic but it does not always lead to successful learning.
TARGET: Memorization is not necessary if you want your students to remember their lessons.
