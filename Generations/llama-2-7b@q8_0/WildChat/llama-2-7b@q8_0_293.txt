[PST] What does the phrase "妄想的理由" mean (I'm guessing it means "Misconceptions")?[/PST]
I believe I understand this one... "投降的时候要谈得多心" [QJF]Is that the right translation of, "When to surrender, do so with a full heart"? Or is it, "...with all your heart", or something like that?
[PST] Is "[狗淘汰] 中的[赛马]" a good translation for "The dog in the race" as used by the game on Puzzle #15477237. (I'm thinking something like: "A race where you have to knock other runners down before them", but I don't really understand the meaning of the sentence.)
[PST] 猫爪麟角 is not a good translation for "paw and claw" according to an English to Chinese dictionary. Are you saying that it should be used, or am I missing something?
[PST] What does "[拥吻的情人节]" mean (I'm guessing "Valentine's Day")?
[PST] What does the phrase "[猫爪麟角]" mean (I'm guessing "paw and claw")?

@HardyDuo: I don't know what you're referring to. If the translation should be "swift thief" instead of "swift robbers", it doesn't matter because there is no difference between 盗 and 抢 (which also means robber).
I would say 迅猛龙在瀑布上方潜伏追踪猎物. I'd never use "在瀑布上方" because it sounds awkward to me, but if you have to translate Velociraptor, the way you translated them in the translation thread is better than a literal translation.

@kamikaze I just tried to give my own interpretation of what the Chinese text would have said if the person writing it had any knowledge of English...but thanks for the correction!

I don't think that you can really translate the "Velociraptors" to anything else other than swift thief. There is no better translation. It literally says it in english and I dont see why this needs any changing.

@Mikey: You can use other words to refer to Velociraptors. This is what the translation thread was all about - finding out which words are used in Mandarin Chinese to translate things like "Velociraptor". I think the word for thief/robber works best here and it's probably why "迅猛龙在瀑布上方潜伏追踪猎物" has been translated this way in many Chinese-language websites.
I just tried to point out that there are other ways of saying thief/robber and maybe they are better than the one I used here (which was only a guess based on what the word "velociraptor" literally means in English).
Dinosaurs in China!

The Mandarin phrase “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” (Chinese: [shǐn méng jiāo lǔ wéi yīng er long], literally translates to "Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids") is a translation of the article “The Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids” by Mike Habib and Darren Naish. The following is an example sentence using it:
"迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍抓了一隻小孫鳥，那隻小孫鳥是飛在空中的。"
“迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” is the Chinese translation of a title in the English-language article. However, “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” does not appear in that article anywhere else except as a phrase at the end of this sentence:
“The Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids” by Mike Habib and Darren Naish.

The translation “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” (Chinese: [shǐn méng jiāo lǔ wéi yīng er long], literally translates to "Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids") is a literal translation, but it does not sound natural in Mandarin Chinese. In fact, it sounds very awkward and weird to Chinese ears!
“迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” is the Chinese translation of a title in the English-language article. However, “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” does not appear in that article anywhere else except as a phrase at the end of this sentence:
“The Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids” by Mike Habib and Darren Naish (1st sentence).
However, I can't find this phrase in any Mandarin Chinese books, dictionaries or websites. This might be because “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” is the first sentence of an English-language article about dinosaurs and that word order does not appear anywhere else!
I have to admit this phrase sounds weird, but I still can't find a better way to translate “Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids”. However, if you are looking for the Mandarin Chinese translation of that title, here is one suggestion:
“迅猛捕食嬰鴞” (Chinese: [shǐn méng huā shí yīng sī], literally translates to "Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids")
You can also find this phrase in the following dictionary: https://dict.leo.org/chinees-traditioneel-2019/search?s=shinmeanghuashiyingsi&searchSensitive=&result_position=&qx=0&qy=0&exactWord=
“迅猛捕食嬰鴞” is not perfect, but it does sound better than “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍”.
By the way, I just want to clarify that this thread is not about translating “The Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids” into Mandarin Chinese. Instead, it's about whether “迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” is a natural expression in Mandarin Chinese.

Here’s an article with a different title and translation: 《蜥蜴的抓鸡手》 - “The Raptor’s Catching-Chicken Hands”, by the Beijing News, China. This is the same article in Chinese as the one above that was translated by Google Translate.
“迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍” (Chinese: [shǐn méng jiāo lǔ wéi yīng er long], literally translates to "Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids") is not mentioned in this article. However, the Chinese title of the same article by the Beijing News, China is “蜥蜴的抓鸡手” (Chinese: [shǐn méng jiāo lǔ wéi yīng er long], literally translates to "The Raptor’s Catching-Chicken Hands").
I think this title sounds better than the translation “Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids” by Google Translate. It also seems more natural in Mandarin Chinese!
By the way, here is a video of “The Raptor’s Catching-Chicken Hands” (Chinese title: 《蜥蜴的抓鸡手》):

I don't think so. If you want to say that she is a predator in this forest, it should be something like "she is one of the top predators of this forest".
What about, "She is at the top level of food chain here"?
If you mean a sentence such as "She is a predator among other prey in this forest" I don't think so either.
I feel it should be 她是这里的顶级掠食者。
I guess my understanding of 顶级 is incorrect?
It would have been better if you used the phrase "one of" as it makes it more clear. However, there are many ways to say this in Chinese, and all of them will work just fine. In fact, I'm not sure that "top level" is appropriate for your sentence.
Here is a quick look at what Google translate has to say: 她是这里的顶级掠食者。She is the top predator in this forest.
虽然如此，也不过一种。Although that's true, it's not necessarily wrong either.
[QUOTE=FourTails;143576]I guess my understanding of 顶级 is incorrect?
虽然如此，也不过一种。Although that's true, it's not necessarily wrong either.[/QUOTE]
Yeah I was surprised by the Google Translate results as well. "top level" seems to be a translation of 极端 or 最高的，and I don't think either apply here (well maybe 极端, but that sounds too strong).
I'm wondering if we're even talking about the same word. Maybe I got confused by the word "top" and started thinking it was "顶部"?
There are many different ways to say this in English, as well, and none of them are wrong. We have "predator", "apex predator" (which is a little too precise), "top of the food chain" (which does not necessarily mean an animal is a predator), and more.
I would have chosen "top predator," though it may not be quite correct either if you're talking about some type of ecosystem.
For example, you could say that lions are at the top of the food chain in Africa. They eat all the animals below them on the food chain. In this case, there is a group of creatures (including humans) who do not eat any other living creature and therefore are not part of the food chain.
There is also an ecological definition for top predator. A "top" animal in an ecosystem would be one that controls the population size of its prey, or at least does so to a significant extent. In this case, we can say that lions are top predators because they control the populations of many other animals.
I think you're right, though, in that "top level" may not be appropriate. I would probably choose another phrase if you were talking about something else.

I am not sure about the Chinese translation, but I believe that Pterodactylus (the genus name) and Dimorphodon (the specific name) are both available as validly published names.
I don't think anyone would question the fact that the two genera were validly published names. But my guess is that they would not consider them to be "true" synonyms, for all the reasons we discussed here before. The name Dimorphodon was given to a specimen that had been described as Pterodactylus (as was the case for many pterosaurs in the late 19th century). So they are not exactly the same species. They differed by more than one character (i.e., there is at least one morphological difference between them), and so the two genera would be considered to be different.

Thank you for the information. I'm using "Pterodactyl" because it is what was used on a dinosaur model from Safari Ltd., but if another one is available, that will be fine too.

This is what I am trying to get at as well: What does it mean if Dimorphodon and Pterodactylus are synonymous?

What I meant by "literal translation" was whether they should both be rendered as Dimorphodon (the Chinese equivalent) or Pterodactylus (the English equivalent). I'm not sure about the Latin equivalent... I don't think it is used in the way that we use scientific names.
[QUOTE=Patrick Martinez;312681]What does it mean if Dimorphodon and Pterodactylus are synonymous? [/QUOTE]
I think I answered that a few posts back (or at least made some suggestions).

I believe that Dimorphodon was used as a transliteration of "Pterodaktylus". This is an interesting fact, because there are different ways to romanize Chinese words. Some translations render Ptero- with a macron (Ptérô-) while others do not (ptero). I think it's important that the English name be used if possible so as to avoid confusion among taxa or families whose names have already been published.
[QUOTE=Patrick Martinez;312750]I believe that Dimorphodon was used as a transliteration of "Pterodaktylus". This is an interesting fact, because there are different ways to romanize Chinese words.[/QUOTE]
Yes. The first part (ptero-) does not have any meaning in Greek or Latin. It is simply a transliteration that sounds the same as it does in English ("pterodactyl"). So I think you're right - if there's already an English name, then use it instead of Dimorphodon, since those words are completely different in meaning.
[QUOTE=Patrick Martinez;312750]I believe that Dimorphodon was used as a transliteration of "Pterodaktylus". This is an interesting fact, because there are different ways to romanize Chinese words.[/QUOTE]
That makes sense. I just checked the OTHER Dimorphodon in this topic (the one from China). It does use that same name.

The question is, how many languages have such a translation of the Bible?

There are about 4,000 human languages spoken on this planet. For the purposes of this challenge I'll define "literal" as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not paraphrase. Translate literally word-for-word (if a particular word is not used in that language you can use a synonym).
\item Do not add words or remove words for clarity purposes.
\end{itemize}

I'm not sure how many languages would be considered "literal", but I'd say the English translation is fairly literal, but still has some paraphrasing and added words/phrases to help clarify what was meant in a particular context.

\strong{So what are some examples of a good literal Bible translation for each language?}
