#### Section 3.1 Rational Decision Making Process:
1. Identifying the problem or opportunity - The problem is that the chapter is a little long and difficult to understand so I want to reduce it in terms of pages. 
2. Generating alternative solutions - The solutions are (a) reducing page count by removing unnecessary sections, (b) using more graphical data to visualize concepts. 
3. Evaluating alternatives - In this case I need to compare the 2 solutions with each other and choose one solution from two solutions. 
4. Making a decision and taking action - I want to make it clear by showing my thoughts about my decisions. This is one of the most difficult parts for me because there are many alternatives that can be done but only few are important so that I cannot show all of them. Therefore, I need to choose only the most important ones to explain and others I will keep inside my mind. 
5. Reflecting on and learning from the decision - As you know, we have a habit that we always learn from our previous mistakes by making new plans for the future or just repeating ourselves again in this situation. In this case, I think this part is important because there are many decisions which can be made if we consider all of the points above and they will affect each other so we need to reflect on them carefully.
#### Section 3.2 Intuitive Decision Making Process:
1. Emotional influences on decision making - I am going to show my emotions about this chapter because I think it is important for me to feel how people usually make decisions in real life and what they can do when facing problems or opportunities as well as how their minds work while solving the problem with different approaches. 
2. The role of emotions in shaping decisions - In this case we need to look at all types of emotions like happiness, sadness etc because every single one has a different meaning for people when they are making decisions and it will affect their thoughts about those situations too which means that these things have an effect on our choices.
3. Emotional contagion in group decision making - If we take into account what I said before, then this point is very important because sometimes we may experience some problems with other people when they are not happy or sad due to different reasons but it does not mean that we should do something bad towards them because there will be consequences if someone does not like their actions and feelings as well.
#### Section 3.3 Group Decision Making Process:
1. Recognizing patterns and using heuristics - Heuristics are some rules that people use to make decisions without any knowledge about what they do because these things work for them so they think it's fine when someone else uses it too since everyone has different experiences during their life which means every person will have his own set of rules depending on his age, education etc. 
2. Use of intuition in expert decision making - In this case I am going to show how experts usually make decisions because they know what they want and how it should be done so they do not need any information from others but if someone else has some problems then he can ask them for advice since these things are very important when you have no idea about your problem or situation. 
3. Group dynamics and decision making - In this case people may think that it is not a good idea to share their feelings with other people because they feel ashamed of doing so but if they want to make decisions together then there should be no secrets between them since everything has its consequences whether positive or negative ones.
4. Challenges and benefits of group decision making - This part is very important for me because it helps me understand what kind of problems could occur when people try to do something with other people who have different opinions about their own goals so you will never know if they will agree on everything even though there are many ways how you can solve this problem but it's still better to talk first before doing anything else. 
5. Techniques for effective group decision making - In this case I would like to show all techniques that could be used in order to make decisions together without any problems since everyone has his own opinion and point of view which means sometimes they may disagree with each other so these things will affect their final choice if they do not have a plan beforehand because some people do not know what kind of decision should be made until the last moment when it is already too late to change something.
