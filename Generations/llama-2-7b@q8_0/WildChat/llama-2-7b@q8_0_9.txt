I'm still trying to decide on which medium I want this to be. For now, it's the classic "let's go for it" medium.
Re: Come up with a Stranger Things scene in which Max gets possessed by The Mind Flayer

Max is walking through the school hallway when she sees Dustin and Lucas sitting on lockers. She stops to talk to them for a while. Meanwhile, Nancy is also passing through the same area and comes into view just as Max finishes speaking to Dustin and Lucas. Max continues walking, but Nancy calls out her name and asks if they can talk later. Max turns around and looks at Nancy, who tells her to meet her in the library after school today.
As she walks away from Lucas and Dustin, Max thinks about what happened with Steve over the weekend. She thought it was cute when he asked her out, but then realized that he's a jerk. As she reaches the stairs leading to the next floor of the building, Max starts thinking about Nancy again as she walks up them.
When Max arrives at the top of the stairwell and enters into the hallway on this level, she sees Eleven coming out of her classroom door with a backpack over one shoulder. When they pass each other, Max stops and asks if Eleven wants to grab some lunch together after school today like they do sometimes.
Eleven looks at Max curiously for several seconds before finally saying yes and walking away from Max without responding verbally. As Eleven heads down the hallway toward another classroom door on this level, Max goes inside her own classroom and closes its door behind herself while still standing in front of it with her backpack slung over one shoulder just as she did before entering into Eleven's room earlier today after school began an hour or so ago.
Max is sitting at a table in the library reading a book when Nancy walks up to her and asks if they can talk for a few minutes. Max looks up from her book with an uncomfortable expression on her face, but then says ok, let's go somewhere private where no one else will overhear us talking about what happened between Steve Harrington and me last night after school ended yesterday afternoon...
Nancy leads them out onto a balcony overlooking some nearby streets from above it all looking down at everything below them as they stand there quietly staring off into space while thinking about their next move forward together. After several minutes pass by without speaking to one another, Nancy breaks the silence by asking Max what she thinks happened between Steve Harrington and her last night after school ended yesterday afternoon.

I'm sure there are many more ways of doing this scene than just the one I came up with earlier today, but it seemed like a good starting point for now and something worth sharing on here before moving forward from where we were at in my last post. Hope you all enjoy reading about what happens between Max and Nancy after school ended yesterday afternoon!

Max is sitting at her desk working on an essay she needs to turn in today when suddenly a loud banging sound comes from behind her. She turns around and sees Nancy standing there with wide eyes, holding onto something that looks like an empty wooden box which has been torn open along one side revealing its contents inside of it - two small pieces of paper folded together into triangles containing information written on them both in black marker ink.
Nancy holds up the papers for Max to see before walking over towards her desk and placing them down on top of it while saying, "Max, these are important." When Nancy says this, Max looks at him suspiciously as if wondering what's going on here or why he would give them to me like that since she hasn't done anything wrong yet (as far as she knows).
After a brief pause between them both, Max reaches out toward one of the papers with her index finger while asking Nancy about its contents before taking it from him and starting to read through what was written down on there - which happens to be a list containing all kinds of random information ranging from names & addresses for people living nearby (which might come in handy later), street maps showing where certain things are located relative to each other, phone numbers belonging either directly or indirectly toward some kind of business establishment.
Max reads through everything that was written down on these papers before asking Nancy what they're all about and why he gave them to her (since he didn't seem very happy when doing so). Nancy replies by saying: "These are important, Max - I don't know exactly what they mean yet either but whatever it is probably won't be good."
Max nods his head in agreement before standing up from where she had been sitting and taking one step closer towards Nancy while looking at him closely with a concerned expression on her face as if trying to figure out whether he might be lying or not since there's no way of knowing what kind of person this guy really is - especially after seeing how he acted earlier when they were talking together outside the classroom where I first met Eleven back then last year.
Max looks up at Nancy and asks him once again if everything on these papers was written down accurately before saying: "Yeah, I can see why you gave them to me - thanks a lot!" Then she turns around while walking towards her desk once more where she starts reading through what's been written down there too...

Max is standing in front of her classroom doorway holding a metal lunchbox that contains something inside which looks like it might be food (although I doubt anyone would actually want to eat any kind of meal at this point since we're already talking about how things are getting worse here). Meanwhile, there's also another person standing right next to Max while looking at her curiously before finally saying: "What do you mean 'you've gotta come with me now'?"
Max turns around slowly while smiling slightly as she replies with something like: "Hey man! I don't know what happened there or how long ago it was but if this is about me then yeah - I gotta come too." He nods his head in agreement before saying something else along those lines once again before adding that they need to get out of here fast because people might be after them for whatever reason now (which would probably explain why someone would want Max's help).
Max walks over towards Nancy who's standing right behind her holding onto some kind of weapon which looks like it could easily kill him if she ever decided to use it on somebody else while saying something along those lines as well - "You don't really have to worry about me anymore since I'll be protecting both you and Eleven from now on." Max turns around once again before nodding her head slightly in agreement with what he had just said before saying: "Yeah, maybe - but what if it happens again? Like last time where those people tried breaking into our home?" He looks at her with a worried expression on his face while asking:
"You think they're still out there after us?" Max shrugs slightly before answering back by saying that she doesn't know for sure but something tells me that maybe they are...
Max is walking through the hallway of her school with Nancy close behind her when suddenly someone bumps into her from behind. She turns around to see who it was, but there isn't anyone there - just a few students passing by and one of them saying "sorry" as she walks past Max without even looking at him or apologizing for what happened before moving on down the hallway towards another classroom door while laughing loudly as if nothing had actually happened.
Max turns back around and sees that Nancy is still standing there waiting patiently for her to finish walking through this area of the building until she eventually reaches Eleven's classroom door where he has been standing since earlier today. Max walks into this room without saying anything first before closing its door behind herself while thinking about how strange things have become lately - especially after everything that happened yesterday night during our talk outside your house when it was snowing heavily...
Max is sitting at her desk looking down towards one of the papers which had been given to her by Nancy earlier today after he spoke with us both privately in the library. She thinks back on what this guy said before taking out a pen from inside her pocket while asking him if anything else happened between them once again since there hasn't really been much information provided yet - even though I know exactly where most everything was located relative to each other during those few minutes ago when it started snowing heavily outside our house yesterday night (which made me feel pretty lonely for some reason).
Max turns around while looking up towards Nancy who's standing right behind her with a worried expression on his face as he asks: "What's wrong?" She shrugs slightly before saying something along those lines again: "I don't know - maybe you should tell me yourself since I was the only one here when everything started happening yesterday night?" Nancy nods his head in agreement before speaking up once more while saying something like:
"I just want to make sure that nothing else happened between

"The Mind Flayer is still out there," said Max. "We have to stop it." She looked over to Mike, and then down to Billy. "What are we waiting for?" she asked them both at once before turning back to Sam. "Come on," she urged him. "You're the only one who can make a portal big enough to take us all through."
"But what about the other people? There will be more kids, won't there? More parents and teachers?" said Mike. His eyes darted between his friends. He had never felt so helpless in all of his life. He didn't want to go back into the Upside Down. "We can't leave them," he said.
"But they will be fine here for a little bit, right? It won't hurt for us to leave and then come back to check on them. Right?" asked Billy.
Max shook her head. "I don't think it works that way," she told them all. She was looking at Mike more than anyone else, trying to reassure him with her eyes. But he had never felt so small in his life and he didn't want this fight anymore. He wanted his friends to be safe. And now he knew there wasn't anything they could do for that. "I don't think we can save everyone," he admitted to them all.
"We have to try!" Sam yelled at him, taking a step forward in fury and frustration. But Mike shook his head again. "Sam," said Max. She tried to sound soothing but she couldn't hide how upset she felt with her friend. He was usually the one who kept it together in these situations. Now he was having a complete meltdown.
"The only way we can save everyone is if I close this portal for good," said Mike, turning back to Billy and Sam. "It's too big for us to all go through at once." He looked down to the floor again with his hands clenched into fists. "I can do it though. We should probably put an end to this now before we end up on top of each other in the Upside Down."
"What?" asked Billy, raising his voice to be heard over Mike's words and Sam's gasps. He stepped forward, a look of determination spreading across his face as he spoke. "That's crazy! You can't close it. That would kill everyone in here!"
"We can't risk it," said Max, walking up to her friends. She took Mike's hand in hers and held tightly to it before turning back to Billy. "But you know what else could? The Mind Flayer. We have no choice."
"Wait a minute," said Billy, looking down at the ground as he spoke. He was quiet for a moment but then his head lifted up and he nodded slowly in agreement. "We can't do this alone. There are still other people we need to save. We just don't have enough time."
Max looked around at her friends, all of them looking at her expectantly. She couldn't believe the situation they were all facing. The only way out was by closing the portal and that meant everyone would be trapped in the Upside Down for good. "We should do this," she told them, looking first to Mike before turning back around to Billy and Sam. "I don't want to lose anyone else."
"What? No! Are you crazy?" shouted Max as Mike stepped forward into the portal. He had taken her hand in his own again and was walking slowly but steadily towards it. His eyes were trained on the darkness that lay just beyond, but he didn't hesitate for even a moment before stepping through.
"I told you this was the only way!" said Billy to Max. "Mike will be fine. He's strong enough." But she couldn't help it. Her eyes followed Mike until they were swallowed up by the darkness beyond the door. She held her breath, not daring to speak as a wave of terror and helplessness washed over her.
"Please, please be okay," she whispered before turning back to Billy and Sam. "What are we supposed to do now?" she asked them both at once, her voice breaking as the tears came flowing down her face. "We can't just leave him in there!"
