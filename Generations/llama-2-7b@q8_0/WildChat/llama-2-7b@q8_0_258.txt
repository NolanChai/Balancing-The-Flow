I think it would be more interesting to have an application that you can use on a Mac, Windows, or Linux. Something that does not require any of the three operating systems to have Java installed. There is also an issue with the fact that there are many different versions of Java. In order for this idea to work, there needs to be some kind of standardization.
I think that the best way to go about doing this would be to develop a cross platform application using Javascript and HTML5/CSS3 (which runs on all major browsers). I believe that this is doable because of how many different operating systems we have out there. The main issue here is the fact that you don’t want your application to run in Internet Explorer, as it isn’t supported by IE10+.
This is a project where people are encouraged to submit their ideas for features and design elements they think would make an ideal PowerPoint presentation app. I believe this will give us more insight into what we should be focusing on when developing our own applications in the future, since it’s always better if you have something concrete in mind before starting development.
In addition, you can also suggest new features and ideas here for how we can improve upon existing tools or create something completely new altogether! We hope that this will encourage people who may not be familiar with software design principles or coding practices but still want to contribute back into their community by making an awesome app they feel passionate about creating themselves.
