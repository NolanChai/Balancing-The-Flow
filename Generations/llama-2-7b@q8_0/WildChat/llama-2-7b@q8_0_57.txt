Institute for the Study of Religious Cultures (ISRC) 2014.5 3:30pm-5:00pm
Presented by Dr. Dharmachari Lokeshvara
During a recent trip to India, Dr. Lokeshvara was invited to offer the closing talk at a meeting of 70 Buddhist scholars and practitioners from many Asian countries in Sarnath on “The Place of Ritual in Early Indian Buddhism.” In this talk he will discuss an important point that came out of this gathering. While rituals, such as bowing to images and invoking the power of Buddha’s names are not seen today in the mainstream of Western Buddhist practice, they were extremely widespread in early Buddhism and were one of the ways the Buddha’s teachings spread throughout India. In fact, in some cases, rituals were considered to be more effective than sermons for people who had not yet heard any teaching at all.
Dr. Lokeshvara received his doctorate from Columbia University in New York and has taught Buddhism at the University of Chicago, Wesleyan University and elsewhere. He is now a senior student (shramanera) in the Dharmachakra order of nuns and monks headed by Venerable Thubten Chodron.
Dr. Lokeshvara will also be leading meditation sessions throughout the day. No prior experience necessary! Please email us at info@buddhistcouncil.org for more information

We have seen this in the past with science. The more we learn, and the more sophisticated our technology becomes, the less we seem to know about things like how life originates. We are still learning more now about the microcosmos than the macrocosmos because of its complexity. It seems we may be in the same situation where we have to wait until humanity evolves enough that a future race will be able to explain what happened.
I'm not sure about this, but I am sure that people tend to believe things which fit with their beliefs and disregard those which do not. The more sophisticated a person is in one area the less sophisticated they are in another. For example, many atheists have trouble understanding why religious believers cannot understand science because they know nothing about it and never took any courses to learn more. It's really no different than someone who doesn't believe in evolution having difficulty grasping how life could possibly form from non-life. They just do not have a good foundation or education on the topic.

You said this better than I did. This is true.
