The two soldiers were sitting in their car, smoking and drinking coffee while waiting for the signal to go. Suddenly one of them spoke, "Man I'm not looking forward to this." The other man shrugged his shoulders, "I don't know why we even volunteered." His friend replied, "Because our jobs depend on it! And you know how hard it is to get a new job in the city!" The second man nodded and took a drag of his cigarette.
After some silence, the first man asked, "You have any kids?"
The other shook his head no, "Neither do I." He continued smiling and shrugged his shoulders again. The first man responded with an uneasy smile and looked at him straight in the eyes, "I think I'm going to cry when they come for my daughter."
"Don't worry about your daughter," said his friend, "Your wife will be there to take care of her." He then finished his cigarette.
A couple minutes passed, and then a Metrocop car turned the corner and headed toward them. They both got out of their vehicle and ran behind some bushes, keeping a lookout for more police officers. As they were hiding, the first man thought to himself, "If I don't make it back alive, my daughter is going to be so sad." He then began crying as he waited for his death.
### Discussion:

Alyx had just finished cleaning a house when her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and saw Gordon was calling from a public payphone. "Alyx, it's me. I need your help."
"Gordon!" Alyx exclaimed with relief, "Thank goodness you called me! What is it?"
"I don't know if I can make it out of here alive," Gordon said weakly through tears. Alyx was stunned by his tone of voice and asked him what he meant by that. He explained about being trapped in an elevator with two Metrocops, how one had tried to kill him when the power went off, then told her about seeing them come back for more men at a nearby factory while they were trying to escape through its ventilation system.
Alyx quickly composed herself before replying, "Okay, calm down, we'll figure this out together."
"I need your help," Gordon repeated desperately into the phone, his voice rising with panic as he spoke faster and louder than ever before: "There are five thousand people still trapped in here! If I don't get out of here alive, they'll all die!"
