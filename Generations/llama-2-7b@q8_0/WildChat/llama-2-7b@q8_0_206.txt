If this is not clear, I will try to make a more detailed explanation.
[EDIT]: This problem is from an introductory course on mathematical logic and so it deals with intuitionistic logic, where all logical connectives have truth values. The notation is (¬∃xP(x)) and the proof is supposed to be using FOPL and natural deduction, where ¬ represents NEGATION, ∀ is universal quantifier and ∃ is existential quantifer and P is propositional function.

$\begingroup$ Are you sure about the statement? In classical logic (and therefore FOL) we have $(¬∃xP(x)) ⇔ (\forall x.(¬P(x)) \leftrightarrow ∃x(¬P(x))$ $\endgroup$ – user32195 Sep 1 '15 at 3:40
$\begingroup$ @user32195 Yes, that is what I meant. Thanks for the clarification! $\endgroup$ – Ewan del Rio Sep 2 '15 at 6:57
The main tool here will be double negation elimination (DNE): $$\vdash \neg\neg\phi\quad\text{for all}\quad\phi$$
Note that in intuitionistic logic, the universal quantifier is read as "there exists something..." rather than "for every...". Therefore you need to interpret your problem as follows:
For any x (not x) there is a p such that x ≠ p.
So what do we have? The two sides of the equivalence are both equivalent to saying that for all x, if P(x), then not Q(x). And DNE says that not $\neg\phi$ implies $\phi$. So we can conclude that for every $x$, if P(x) then ¬Q(x). But this is exactly what you want!
$\begingroup$ Thanks. The only thing I don't understand is, how does DNE lead us to conclude that for all x (not x) there is a p such that x≠p? $\endgroup$ – Ewan del Rio Sep 1 '15 at 2:39
$\begingroup$ @EwanDelRio It's not clear what you mean by "there is a p such that x=p". In classical logic we would say, "for every x, there exists a P(x) if and only if...", but in intuitionistic logic this isn't true. The closest thing to the above formula is "For any $x$, for all $P$ with $x\neq P$, ...". $\endgroup$ – David Sep 1 '15 at 2:46
$\begingroup$ I guess that the problem is, how do we make a valid conclusion from (∀y(P(y)⇒¬Q(y))→∃x((P(x)∧¬Q(x)))) to (∀x(P(x)→¬Q(x)), so as to use DNE? $\endgroup$ – Ewan del Rio Sep 1 '15 at 2:48

Answer: HINT:

$$\exists x \bigl(\color{blue}{P(x)} \vee Q(x)\bigr)$$ $$\iff  \begin{align}\exists x\color{blue}{(}P(x)\vee Q(x))\wedge \forall x \left ( P(x) \lor Q(x)\right )\\
\end{align}$$
