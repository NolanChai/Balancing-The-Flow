"Hello, little one!"

[CAMERA PAN to Amber, then zooming out to show Amber holding her tummy and smiling.]

"I hope you can hear me. You might not know this yet, but your mommy is the most talented musician in all of Mondstadt. Everyone says so."

[CAMERA PAN to Amber's tummy, showing a tiny hand waving around]

"Although I don't want you to be as loud as me."

[CAMERA PAN back to Amber, and her face turns serious for the first time today. She looks worried.]

"I hope everything will be okay when you're born. That you won't have to experience pain or sadness like your mother did, but I just can't help being worried."

[CAMERA PAN back to Amber's tummy, showing a tiny foot waving around]

"But, even if things don't go according to plan...at least you'll have me. As long as we have each other, everything will be fine. I promise."
