It has been an amazing start to the new year and a wet one for us in Guangzhou. Even with the rain the K2 classes have had a great start and month. September saw our kids returning with great energies, happy faces and settling into school life with ease. We are really happy to have them back with us.
This year has had a few changes in both staffing and academics but through all we have seen a positive attitude flowing in classes and students. We have merged classes and our kids have enjoyed making new friends and adapted well with new teachers. We also see them enjoying the new STEM lessons where this month we made Candles, built 3D Cubes and made our own play dough.
The topic of the month was ‘’All about Me’’. Our kids enjoyed the topic as they learnt about their Birthdays, homes and more about themselves. We spoke about what they want to be when they grow up and about being different and how it is beautiful to be different. As always, they enjoyed the crafts and art the most where we made birthday poppers, portraits of our selves and friends and built our own homes. We also explored how to take care of our selves and more about Germs.
As we have now entered K2, we have also started Phonics as part of the curriculum. Our kids have taken well to phonics learning the sounds and building their vocabulary with new words. Together with sounds, song and movement they are learning well and enjoying phonics lessons. We are confident to see good improvement in phonics this year.
The month of September is the month of Adaptability. All our students have shown to have this skill as all have settled and adapted back into school life with little hesitation. This month we have awarded with Beatrice, Daniel, Sky, Yanhong, Chase, Renie and Louis the Certificate of Adaptability as they have overcome challenges and adapted the most. Great work and well done. We also would like to say a Happy Birthday to Daniel and Louis as they celebrated their Birthdays in the Month of September.
As we are now at the end of September, it is also the mark of our first break and Mid-Autumn Festival. We would like to take the opportunity to wish all parents and students a Happy Holiday and hope that you and your families have a great and restful holiday together. We also would like to thank all parents for their support and efforts in the first month of school.
