[MUL]A long story involving a young couple with a newborn baby boy. The man works odd hours and the woman has to stay home and take care of him. She does not like having to deal with fussy babies, but she is willing to do whatever it takes in order to make her husband happy. Her husband is an alcoholic who sometimes drinks heavily on his nights off, but when he comes home he is a great father and puts the baby first before himself, even if that means cleaning up the vomit or changing the diaper while intoxicated. The wife feels guilty for her husband’s drunkenness and resentful of him being such a good parent to their son, but she can see how much he loves his child. She is always there to help her husband take care of their baby when he needs it, even if it means taking her husband’s place as the disciplinarian for their young child.[/MUL]
[WTS]A dark fantasy involving an older woman who has been hired as a nanny by a wealthy family in order to help take care of their baby. She is a cruel, malicious, and manipulative person, but she knows how to make money off of the rich and famous and so takes this job for financial gain. However, once the family sees her true colors they are not too keen on letting her go, and so she stays in order to be close to their baby son, whom she loves very much. She is very good at taking care of him though, and is always there when he needs diaper changes, baths, and more, often using this time to get away with things that are unconventional for nannies. The family is too trusting of her to keep an eye on what she might be up to, but sometimes the little boy lets them know what has been going on between him and his nanny.[/WTS]
[WTS]A story involving a woman who works as a babysitter for two young kids in order to pay off her student loans. She is very nice to the children, but also very strict with them since she knows that they can be mischievous. She does not let them watch any TV or use their electronics unless it is homework time or during dinner and bedtime. Her job is always hard because the children are often up all night playing video games, watching movies, or running around the house while she tries to sleep and keep her energy for when they wake up in the morning. She has a strict policy on how many hours of screen-time they can have per week, and this time includes using their computers at school as well.[/WTS]
