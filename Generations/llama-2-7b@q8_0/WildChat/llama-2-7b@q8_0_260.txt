[INS]Recommendations
You should provide recommendations based on your findings from the risk assessment; these could include anything such as security controls that should be implemented, how cybersecurity risks can be mitigated and whether the digital transformation program should continue. Your report should also include a summary of your key findings and any recommend

The following is an example of how you should write your requirements:
(Candidate name) has to make a reservation for a dinner at (restaurant name). The system needs to validate that the time and date specified are valid. Criteria 1: (restaurant name) must be in the list of restaurants available on the system.
The system should notify the candidate when the booking is successful by sending him an SMS containing the following details; (time), (date), (restaurant name), and (seats). The notification needs to be sent to the candidate’s mobile number specified in the reservation form. Criteria 2: The system should only notify candidates whose mobile numbers are in the list of mobile phone numbers registered with the system.
The system must send an SMS to the candidate every hour on the day of the reservation to remind him that it is his turn to have dinner. Criteria 3: The notification should be sent at (time).
Criteria 4: (restaurant name) can only notify one user for a given time and date. If another candidate makes a booking for the same time and date, then the notification must not be sent.

If you can answer all of these questions, then your team could be a great candidate for the AWS DevOps Challenge 2015!
The AWS DevOps Challenge is a competition to find the best AWS based DevOps solutions from around the world. We’re looking for teams with a good understanding and use of Amazon Web Services (AWS), who can demonstrate how they have developed an innovative solution using these services, and are able to tell us about their experiences in doing so.
The competition is split into two sections:
A written submission describing your project (350 words)
A live demonstration on the day of the conference showing off your project in action – see below for details

-[INSTR]The proposed SOAR solution includes the following components:
-[INSTR]- The first component is the [http://www.xsoar.org/ XSOAR tool], which acts as a virtual operator console (VOC). It allows analysts to collaborate and share information while conducting investigations. XSOAR comes with several out-of-the-box capabilities, including an automated incident response orchestration engine.
-[INSTR]- The second component is the [https://github.com/CISA/Risk-Mitigation-Planning-and-Assessment-Tool Risk Mitigation Planning and Assessment Tool (RMPAT)], which assists analysts in planning their activities by providing guidance on possible tasks that can be performed, the resources required to perform these tasks, and the risks associated with performing each task.
-[INSTR]- The third component is the [https://github.com/CISA/Governance-and-Implementation-Tool Governance and Implementation Tool (GIT)], which assists analysts in creating a plan for implementing SOAR within their organization. GIT provides templates that can be customized to fit each organization’s specific needs, as well as guidance on how these plans should be implemented.
-[INSTR]- The fourth component is the [https://github.com/CISA/Community-of-Practice Community of Practice (CoP)], which provides analysts with an opportunity to connect and collaborate with other SOAR users. This CoP includes several forums where analysts can ask questions, share information about upcoming events or conferences related to cybersecurity incident response, discuss best practices in conducting investigations, and more.[/INSTR]

1. I'll give you a short list of things to do this week. You should be able to get them all done if you make an effort (and ask for help if needed).
2. You will write a list of 4 SMART goals that you want to achieve by the end of the summer. Remember they should have:
S - Specific, M - Measurable A - Achievable R - Relevant T - Timely.
You might also like to ask your class teacher or another adult in school for advice if necessary. You may prefer to use your Google Classroom.
3. This week we will look at how the story of Pinocchio was created and some of its important themes. We will then work on writing our own 'how to' stories. I will give you some examples and you can ask for help if needed. You might like to write your story using the 'write out loud' strategy.
4. Next week, we will look at how to change a story. So, if you have written a 'how to' story already this would be a good time to put that knowledge to use and see if you can find another way of telling the same tale. You might like to write your own version of Pinocchio.
5. I hope you enjoy learning about Tinderbox today! Remember to ask for help as needed and to try your best.
1. What is an oxymoron? Find some examples in the poem 'Pinnochio' and add them to our book. You might like to use a thesaurus or the dictionary too. If you are stuck, look at this website: https://www.oxymorons.org/
2. Today we will be writing some more sentences with oxymoron words in. I suggest you do this in your best handwriting (with pencil if needed). You may like to use the 'write out loud' strategy too! Remember not to just write lots of sentences that say 'the soft rough dog'. Look at these examples instead:
a) "I am a hard soft ball" b) "The dark light room is my favourite place to read." c) "Her strong weak voice fills the hall". You could try writing some more phrases and sentences with oxymoron words today. You may like to do this on your Google Classroom if you prefer?
3. Next week, we will be thinking about how to change a story from the point of view of someone who likes books or enjoys reading. So, have another think about what you want to do with the story of Pinocchio and write some ideas in your journal. I am hoping that some of you might like to rewrite it (but make sure it stays funny). You may also like to use your Google Classroom?
4. Can you think of any other books where the main character changes or improves? Perhaps you can look on YouTube or your library and find one! You might need to ask for help from an adult if needed, but do try to research it yourself first.
5. I hope you enjoyed learning about Tinderbox today! Remember to ask for help as needed and to try your best.
