(At 8 pm, Natsuki walked into the Supernatural Clubroom after school, accompanied by her friends. When she saw Sayori, she said "Sayori-san! You look absolutely gorgeous tonight!" As a matter of fact, Sayori had dressed up for this night's meeting with her dress and makeup. She replied "Thank you Natsuki! I didn't want to disappoint my supernatural club members who are also expecting twins anytime soon." Then, she turned her attention to Monika.)

(Sayori asked Monika: "Monika-chan, are you looking forward to your human-phoenix hybrid baby anytime soon?")

(Monika said: "Yes Sayori-san! I'm almost 4 months pregnant with my twins right now. My babies will be born on the same day as Yuri's and Natsuki's." After Sayori saw that, she smiled at Monika and then asked her.)

(Sayori asked: "What are you going to name your newborn baby?")

(Monika replied: "I don't know yet! But I'll let you guys know when it comes time." She had been thinking about that question for a while now. Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri were all excitedly waiting for her answer.)

### Conclusion:
(Yuri said: "Well then, let us start this meeting! I have some great news to share!" Then she asked Monika.)

(Yuri asked: "Monika-chan, what do you think about having a phoenix-human hybrid baby?" After Yuri finished speaking, the other club members turned their attention to her. They were all excitedly waiting for Yuri's response.)

### Conclusion Response:
(Monika answered: "I don't know what I want to call my newborn babies but they will be born on July 17th, just like you said earlier. If it is okay with everyone here then I would love for them to have the same name as me." She didn't want her kids to be called something else.)
