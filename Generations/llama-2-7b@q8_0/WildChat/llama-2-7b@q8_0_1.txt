I want to introduce a new accessory which will be used for your remote key.
It is made by 3mm acrylic sheet and with it you can change your remote key color.
The size of the shell is 26mm(L) x 105mm(W). It has 3 buttons.
Inside, the circuit board is attached to the front side. The back side will be stucked to the remote key's case.
It is very easy and only 4 steps for you to install it on your Mercedes Benz.
1. Remove the battery cover. (Please do not pull too hard.)
2. Use a suction cup to fix the shell on the rear of the key case. (Please be careful)
3. Place the circuit board inside and use adhesive tape to fix it tightly.(It is suggested that you should stick one side first, then paste another side of it to make sure that it sticks well.)
4. Remove the suction cup from the rear shell. Then install your new shell on your remote key case.
The 3 buttons on the shell are connected with the key case which can be turned by a simple switch inside the circuit board, so you don't need to use any external device for it. The shell is made in China and is with OEM quality.
Please note that the shell is not waterproof or dust proof.
