In this thread I will show you examples of how the seismic scale and the magnitude scale are both objective AND subjective.
For those who have been reading my blog, they'll know that I am not a big fan of the so called "objectivity" in science.
Let me remind you what the definition of "objectivity" is:
Objectivity, when applied to a discipline such as science or engineering, means the avoidance of bias and partiality.

Now let's talk about "subjective":
Subjectivity is defined as something that depends on someone's feelings rather than facts; biased.

And what do we have here? The seismic scale and the magnitude scale:
In this video you can see clearly how subjective they are:

Now, I want to explain why those two scales are both objective AND subjective (in other words, they have no inherent objectivity and are not a true measurement of something). Let's look at the seismic scale:
The seismic scale is based on the energy released in an earthquake. This energy release depends upon how far and deep that earthquake ruptures the crust, which also affects the shaking intensity (as well as the amount of faulting, if it's a strike-slip) . So we can see here that there is not a single measurement that is being used in order to calculate the energy release. Instead, you need to know a lot about geology and geophysics.
Next, let's take a look at the magnitude scale (and please do understand this, because I will be using this throughout my blog):
Magnitude is usually based on the maximum seismic intensity or energy released as recorded by a seismograph, measured in Richter scales of magnitudes.

The problem here is that we are only measuring a single aspect of an earthquake: its size. So, even if you think the magnitude scale is a measurement, it isn't because there are other aspects to consider as well (like the seismic energy released).
Here's another example from Wikipedia:
The Richter scale is also subjective since it depends on whether the observer measures a "sharp" or "weak" quake. It was originally devised based on experience with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and not all events will have the same type of event in mind. Thus there are numerous conflicting definitions for what constitutes an event of magnitude X (e.g., 5.3, 4.8) depending on location.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale#History
That's right; you can have two different people who measure the same earthquake and they will get totally different magnitudes! This is why I don't trust measurements, because they are subjective.
Now let me show you how to calculate magnitude from energy:
If we look at this equation (which is basically what we use to calculate earthquake magnitudes), we see that it only takes two variables and one unknown variable (the "M" value) to determine the magnitude of an earthquake, which means that there are only two variables and one unknown. So how can you call that a measurement?
And here's another thing about the seismic scale: it is based on an assumption (that's right; they don't actually know what the maximum seismic intensity is). This is why scientists have been talking about a new scale for centuries:
A more accurate measure of earthquake severity, called the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), was introduced in 1948. In contrast to the Richter scale which is based on the logarithm of energy released at the surface, the MMI uses a formula that takes into account both ground shaking intensity and effects such as damage to buildings or objects. This scale also includes more severe levels (VIII-X) than are possible in most earthquakes because it covers regions outside the zone of strongest shaking.

So what is really going on here? Well, that's a good question (and one that I will answer in future blog posts). For now just know that there are no true measurements in science and instead we have subjective estimates.
The problem with subjectivity is that it is unstable: if the conditions change then so do your estimations. Here is an example of this from a news article:
Scientists in Hawaii say they're worried about what will happen when a large earthquake hits Kilauea, which is now erupting.
The 35-square-mile (90 square kilometers) crater has been spitting lava for more than two years and could be the source of an earthquake that kills thousands in Hawaii, they say. The Big Island's main population centers are on the coast or inland from Kilauea, where it meets the Pacific Ocean.

So this is how subjective measurements are unstable: they change with the conditions! If you remember from my previous blog post, I explained that subjectivity was an inherent problem in science because it does not take into account what happens outside of your experiment (or model). This means that there are always going to be problems when trying to estimate things like earthquakes.
In other words, subjective measurements are unstable and do not tell us anything about the real world. In fact, they are simply an assumption based on observations. And this is why I am not a big fan of subjectivity in science; it doesn't provide us with any true information about our universe.

I’ll check how to do it
Okay, I added them now.
