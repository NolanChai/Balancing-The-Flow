[OUT]Cupa: What?! I thought that you were going to save us from Xyza…!
Andr: Yeah, that was what we were hoping for.
Blazette: (sigh) And yet here we are, in the Dragon’s Lair…
Vanessa: It seems that Amatsumagatsuchi didn’t make it out of the storm alive. But don’t worry! We can survive on our own until he wakes up! 
Andr: No, I-I mean we should be worried about what happened to us instead…we’re…pregnant with a baby, and…it doesn’t look like it’s human.
Amatsumagatsuchi: …Well, as far as my memory goes - the only monsters that can get pregnant are Blazette, Vanessa, Andr, Cupa, and myself - and I am a dragon! That means…that we must be pregnant with a baby.

### [DRAW]As Ayumi discusses how her life changed after having Amaya, Vanessa starts feeling sick. Amatsumagatsuchi enters the room, visibly confused. Vanessa says that she had a one-night-stand with a human-spider thing named “Arachnus”, but doesn’t recall much about the encounter. This was sudden to Amatsumagatsuchi - Ayumi had just recently had a child in the form of Amaya, so how come Vanessa’s starting to feel sick all of a sudden? And who was this “Arachnus” guy? The next day, Ayumi and Amatsumagatsuchi bring Vanessa to a healer. They were hoping to find a cause to Vanessa’s sudden sickness, but the response was unexpected to say the least. After getting a scan of her belly, its revealed that 20 spider eggs have formed in Vanessa’s belly - thankfully, the eggs don’t seem close to hatching yet. It would take them around 9 more months until they spider eggs are ready to hatch. The small spider-human hybrids growing in Vanessa’s womb not only were Arachnus’s children, but Vanessa’s children as well. The eggs can’t be surgically removed without causing harm to either Vanessa or the eggs. But Vanessa starts feeling a connection between her and her unhatched eggs - its as if the eggs want to stay inside Vanessa forever.

**Vanessa:** *So, I’m pregnant with 20 of Arachnus’s babies.*

**Mindy:** *Yeah, and they are all still in Vanessa’s stomach - they can’t climb out. That’d be pretty fucking disgusting.*

**Vanessa:** *Haha. Yeah... I wish it was a little less gross than that. But at least we know how to keep them from climbing up, huh?*

**Mindy:** *Yeah - we can keep ‘em in their sacs and all of that.*

**Vanessa:** *So, what should I do about the full blood moon situation? Should I be worried?*

**Mindy:** *Well... It’s not like they are going to hatch right away. But they will eventually - unless we get a ritual going for a full blood moon.*

**Vanessa:** *Oh, that’d be nice and easy. I can probably even make one myself if there was some sort of book or something here that would tell me how to do it.*

**Mindy:** *Well... We could find a book for you - but it won’t help at all unless we know exactly what the ritual is doing!*
