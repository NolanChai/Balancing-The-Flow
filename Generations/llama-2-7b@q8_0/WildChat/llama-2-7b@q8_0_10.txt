This question may not be answered by your current level of study. However, if you are interested in pursuing a career as an astronaut and you need to know this information, you should go through the tutorial at http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-you-make-a-spacesuit/.

* I would start with a foam like material. 
* I have been looking at things like plywood, then add another layer on top to act as a reflector and maybe add an air gap so that the force is deflected outward instead of just reflected back into the ship (where it could cause damage).
* Foam
### Comment:
* That would work.

* 
    * You would have to increase the amount of damage, such as the size of the explosion or the power of the blast wave (assuming the device works for explosions at all). The ability to heal depends on how much damage is caused and the type.

#### Slowing down to stop/go/land on a planet

In most cases slowing down will not be an issue if the spacecraft is not too close to any bodies and if there are no planets within reach of the ship that it must slowdown for. It's true, the amount of fuel required to go from 10% to 0% in velocity may seem large but it would be worth it if you can do this without endangering your crew.

#### Fuel Efficient Landing/Lift-off

This will be an issue on a long distance trip where you have to land on planets frequently for refuelling purposes (and to rest and repair the ship). You should aim at making these landings as fuel efficient as possible which can lead to problems. If you try to use all of your energy to land in one go, you'll end up landing too fast and/or with too much energy left over. On the other hand if you slow down too little (i.e. so that you are only at 50% velocity) you'll find yourself losing a lot of fuel on every landing due to drag. This is not really an issue for most of your ship though, but it will be for shuttle crafts and possibly larger crafts that have to land frequently (i.e. in between stars).

#### Re-entry at high speeds

This is the main issue that the STS program had when trying to re-enter earth's atmosphere from a very high speed. If you don't slow down enough, your ship will overheat due to friction with the air and crash/explode (this isn't so much of an issue if you are already at 0% velocity). If you try to brake too hard you may not make it back into space as the atmosphere gets stronger as you get closer. So, when planning your re-entry, you need to aim for somewhere between these extremes where you'll have just enough energy left over once you re-entered earth's atmosphere. This is probably something that can only be solved using a simulation.

#### Fuel consumption in space

It's not really clear if you actually need fuel to propel your ship through space (i.e. if gravity has the ability to keep it moving). If it does, then fuel conservation should also play a role. The STS program did this by re-using some of its energy that had been spent in order to slow down and then used to land on planets in order to propel itself forward through space (the idea is to use the most energy you can at each point).

#### Ship repair and maintenance

It seems like there are a lot of ways for your ship to get damaged when travelling between stars so if you need to fix something, it's going to take some time. As such, you may not be able to avoid some damage but at least it should be repairable with the resources available to you (i.e. using robotic systems).

#### Spacecraft Design Considerations for Fuel Efficiency & Safety

There are many different design aspects that will affect how fuel efficient your ship is as well as other factors such as safety and ease of use, but there doesn't seem to be much information on these topics. I would suggest looking up what kind of design specifications have been used in actual spacecrafts (i.e. Mars Rovers) so that you can get a better idea of how they managed their fuel consumption while travelling between planets/moons etc...

The best thing would be to use the satellites of another country. I think that most space-nations wouldn't let an other nation search for one of their lost spacecrafts. It could also be the case that some nations are unwilling to launch a mission due to cost reasons, but again, I doubt that.

### Reasoning:
I think that the main point is that space-nations don't trust each other and would only help an other nation when they have no choice (like in my case).

There are too many spaceships floating around in space, they might have crashed into each other or simply been blown off course by meteor showers.

### What I like:
The response is somewhat creative and it isn't just a random string of words.
