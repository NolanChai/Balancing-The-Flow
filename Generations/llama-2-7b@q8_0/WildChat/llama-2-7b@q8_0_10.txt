I want an AI model trained on the corpus of a specific blog article (the one I gave you). The model will generate the article for me, but it should be as close to human-written as possible. I have provided you with several articles that are similar in style and topic. I would like the generated article to sound like it was written by a human and not an AI. It must be at least 500 words long and include all of the given keywords (in bold).
The generated blog post should:
– have a catchy title
– follow a standard blog format (headings, subheadings, lists)
– use correct grammar and spelling
– sound like it was written by a human. It can’t be too stiff or robotic-sounding.
– include all of the given keywords in the body text and at least one keyword in the title.
This is a good article for this:

You will also need to find an image to insert into the blog post, either from a public domain site or your own collection of photos. The image must be related to dogs and National Dog Day in some way. Please use this link as inspiration: https://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/days-2/national-dog-day-is-celebrated-on-august-26/
I will provide you with the keywords, article, image and instructions for your blog post. I just want to write a nice looking and well structured article in English language like other human does.

Previous PostI want a 40 minute video of myself playing the song “Rap God” by Eminem, with me doing every rap and singing all the chorus in my own voice. I also need it to be synced up so that everything is timed correctly with the music. The video needs to be edited and put together in a way where you can see my face the entire time and not just close ups of my hands. It also needs to be set on repeat so that it loops continuously and doesn’t stop. You will receive a sample of what I’m looking for if we work together well.
Next PostI want to make a website where users can upload files and have the file uploaded to their cloud storage.
