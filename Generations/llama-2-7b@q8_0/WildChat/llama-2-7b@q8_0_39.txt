The Cavs‚Äô star point guard has been sidelined since mid-December after suffering an ankle injury in a game against the Clippers. The team hopes to have him back soon, but his status remains up in the air. Cleveland is currently without two key players ‚Äì center Tristan Thompson and forward Larry Nance Jr., who are both injured ‚Äì so Bronny James‚Äô return would be welcomed by fans and pundits alike as they look for a spark from somewhere on the court this season (which has been disappointing thus far).
The Cavs have been struggling in recent games, with James missing his last two appearances due to ankle issues. With him out of commission once again, Cleveland will need someone else who can step up and take charge at point guard if they want any chance of winning without him on the court for long stretches of time this year (and next).
In conclusion, while James is an exceptional player who has helped his team win championships in recent years ‚Äì he should return soon! That said there are still questions surrounding how much impact he will have once back from injury because after all these things happen during games not just before them so keep up-to-date with news about when/where possible etcetera üôÇ
The article

The Cleveland Cavaliers' superstar and his wife are taking their son Bronny, 14, and daughter Zhuri, five, to Paris. They will be accompanied by a security detail of at least six people including Bronny's personal trainer, Mike Mancias. The family will stay in a hotel close to the Eiffel Tower for seven days between November 5 and 12.
Bronny, who is tipped as one of the NBA‚Äôs top prospects, has already attracted interest from college basketball programmes including the University of Southern California (USC) and UCLA in Los Angeles, who have reached out to his family directly. It comes after a source close to the family told The Sun that Bronny had been offered the opportunity to join NBA stars like LeBron's former teammate Dwyane Wade's son Zaire on an AAU basketball team.
"LeBron wants him to experience what he and his sons are enjoying," the source said. "LeBron has been so impressed with how Bronny has developed as a player that he has offered advice. He's told him to enjoy this period of his life because it doesn‚Äôt last long.‚Äù
Bronny was the number two ranked prospect on ESPN's list of rising high school basketball stars in 2019, but the report suggests he is yet to make a decision about his future as he tries to get used to life away from home.

I can do this. But I have one question: what's the point in making the labels? Are they going to be used or just for show? If you don't mind me asking, that is. :3
The point was just to look nice and help add detail to the project, but it doesn't really matter whether it's used or not! I could have left them out of the design entirely if I wanted!
Okay then~. Sorry for asking too much~.
That's all right ^_^
I think that you can make a label which says "Bronny James" on the front and then draw the details from here. (http://www.bronnyjames.net/bust.jpg) I hope this helps.
Ohh, thank you so much! That is exactly what I needed to know!! <3
I'll post it in my next update ^_^

Bron is the reason this team had an identity in the first place. I don't get how you can say we have no identity with him and not without him

Its funny because Lebrons whole career has been about "me" but when he goes back to the team that made him a legend and wanted to take less money for the team they have zero identity. Its an organizational problem that started with Lebron, Bosh and Wade leaving for their own selfish reasons

We had no identity last year without Bron and still ended up going to the finals because of it. Now this year we're 1-9 since his comeback and the team has no direction whatsoever. You can only say that if you have never been a fan of Lebron James and don't know who he is as a player or how much he means to this franchise.

This team needs a leader, we're too disjointed at the moment and don't have any sense of direction or confidence on the court. We've lost 4 straight games, let's hope we turn it around in Denver tonight.

It's always fun to see the best players from different generations play each other, and that is exactly what we got on Sunday. Two of basketball's biggest names stepped onto the court with much at stake-their legacy, their team's hopes for a championship run, etc.. This was a game between friends as well: they grew up together in Northern California (both were born there).
The NBA is always looking for ways to create more buzz around its games. One way they have done this is by creating rivalries between players from different generations who are also on different teams but share similar qualities - such as skill level or physical attributes like height and weight etc., so they can compete against each other in contests such as these ones which will be held at the NBA All-Star Weekend next month!
In conclusion, bronny james vs steph curry is a great example of how rivalries between players from different generations are still relevant today. The competition was intense and the outcome was uncertain until the end. Both James and Curry are great players with many years ahead of them to continue competing against each other in various events such as these ones which will be held at the NBA All-Star Weekend next month!

How would you rate Brandon?

Just want to get an idea of how much people actually liked his performance tonight. I thought it was amazing and gave us a good chance at winning against a tough team on the road without our best player (IMO). He led the league in scoring before this game which is really impressive, but he can be so much more than just an offensive catalyst. His defense and passing are top notch as well, and that makes him a well rounded player I think.
I thought his performance tonight was great! I hope it gets him more minutes!
Posted by: Hokies2015 January 3, 2020 11:37PM
He should have been playing in the second half all season. That‚Äôs how good he is. I want to see more of him now that we are healthy. I think he can be one of our best players with the right minutes and attention from the coaches.
Posted by: bobolive0291 January 4, 2020 12:16AM
I agree, it‚Äôs crazy to me how many games he hasn‚Äôt even played in this year! He has been our best player when on the floor and I hope we see more of him in the future.
Posted by: CvilleHokie January 4, 2020 12:36AM
I was pretty excited after Brandon came out as I thought we‚Äôd take advantage with his athleticism on both ends. He got some good shots and created for himself a few times early but then disappeared in the first half. I didn‚Äôt know he had that many points at halftime - I think I was more impressed by what I saw of him as a defender tonight, which isn‚Äôt something I usually notice much.
Posted by: gtownhoke January 4, 2020 10:51AM
I don‚Äôt get the whole ‚Äúwhy not play Brandon‚Äù thing. He was playing great when he came in and it wasn‚Äôt as if he was lighting up the nets. He would have been a perfect compliment to Wade last night, but I can live with the decision to not play him for the most part.
Posted by: CvilleHokie January 4, 2020 11:07AM
I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just what people think or if we are even playing better without Brandon but it seems like everyone was high on his game last night. I would love to see him get more minutes in the future.
Posted by: hokiehog January 4, 2020 11:35AM
I think he needs some time as well and then he can get a shot at a starting spot and be effective if the starters are struggling.
Posted by: cville_hokie January 4, 2020 12:00PM
He‚Äôs been playing solid D for most of the season and his athleticism is great on both ends (when he gets the ball to the rim). I would like to see him play a lot more minutes because it seems like we are struggling at times when Wade/Mack get tired. It could be a nice spark to have in the rotation if they are playing well and can rest Brandon for short stretches or let him come in to help the offense with some quick shots.
Posted by: hokiehog January 4, 2020 12:05PM
He‚Äôs a great player but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs ready to be our starting pg and we have such a crowded backcourt.
Posted by: cville_hokie January 4, 2020 1:28PM
I think the whole Brandon-is-the-best-player-on-our-team sentiment is exaggerated but I do believe that he has been under utilized for much of the year. At times we have played with Wade as our point guard, at other times with Mack (with JUCO point guards behind them) and at still others without a true point guard. It would be nice to see him get more minutes in the backcourt but I don‚Äôt think he can play pg for us consistently.
Posted by: hokiehog January 4, 2020 1:35PM
I just hope we keep developing all of our players and that they are getting better over the course of this season.
Brandon has to be able to create his own shot for me to consider him a starting PG. He‚Äôs been playing solid D most of the year, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to start him against teams with good guards. He does have potential if he continues to get better though and could develop into a solid starter in a couple years
Posted by: hokiehog January 5, 2020 11:57AM
I agree that Brandon is not the best pg on our team (Wade for me). But he‚Äôs so athletic and fast and I think he can be an incredible compliment to a team with two good point guards. If he is our starting PG, we have to make sure there are enough ball handlers/playmakers on the floor at other positions.
Posted by: hokiehog January 6, 2020 1:50PM
I‚Äôd like to see him get some more minutes this year in an effort to develop and keep him from transferring but I also understand it is hard with such a deep back court.

Cleveland Cavaliers forward Lamar Stevens is making his case to join the team's rotation, especially after big performances against the Pacers and Nets in recent days.
Stevens scored 17 points with five rebounds, four assists and two steals on Monday night in Cleveland's win at Indiana. He also played well during a season-high 23 minutes on Sunday versus Brooklyn. In the two games combined, Stevens is averaging 14.5 points per game while shooting 80 percent from the floor.
Stevens has been very active with his shot in recent games as he's made three of his last six shots beyond the arc. He scored at least nine points in back-to-back games for the first time this season.
"Lamar Stevens, I thought played really well again," Cavs head coach JB Bickerstaff said on Monday night following the win versus Indiana. "He's been a guy that's really been locked in at both ends of the floor and he continues to show why we brought him here."
Stevens has seen his minutes increase over the past two games, playing 23 and 18 minutes in those contests. He's played under five minutes three times this season with no more than 16 minutes logged against Oklahoma City back on Nov. 6. His 21-minute performance last Thursday versus Golden State is the most he's played since the opener.
The Cavaliers are also starting to get healthy again as Evan Mobley, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro all returned from injury on Monday night. That will help Bickerstaff continue to shuffle his rotation, which could lead to Stevens getting more playing time. The 23-year-old is making a push for a spot in the regular season rotation with the team heading into the playoffs soon and if he's able to maintain these performances then it could make things difficult for the Cavaliers coaching staff to leave him off of the roster.
The Cavaliers have until 3 p.m ET on April 7 to finalize their playoff roster.

And I'll be there in spirit.
I think Bronny will put up some huge numbers next season for Sierra Canyon (or whatever name they pick).
Bronny James is just another player and will not make it to the NBA as a lottery selection
He might become a star in college if he goes to Duke or Kentucky, but that‚Äôs it. I doubt he makes an All-American team and I don‚Äôt think there are 25 guys better than him at his position in the country next season. He‚Äôll be the best player on a good team (probably not even #1)
If he wants to have a shot at being a high NBA draft pick, then he needs to be putting up huge numbers like Lebron did as a sophomore and junior in HS.
I'd love to see Bronny put up 70-80 points per game this season with his own teammates but that would be an uphill battle considering he won't play for Sierra Canyon anymore
That‚Äôs the point of being a freshman at Sierra Canyon. They have NBA talent already on their roster, plus they will get another year under Coach TJ Walker. He knows how to get guys ready for college and pro ball, so he will be able to prepare Bronny more than any other HS coach in the country
You have to remember this is the same guy that played with 3 current NBA players (including a #1 overall pick) as a sophomore at Sierra Canyon. The only reason he didn‚Äôt do it his junior year was because he was playing with younger teammates. He will be surrounded by guys who can score again this season, so I expect him to put up 60-70 points per game easily
The biggest difference between Bronny and other top prospects is that they are going to play in their own games against other high schoolers. They won‚Äôt have NBA talent on the court with them. That will definitely make it harder for them to score, so I expect their numbers to be down a little bit this season
I don't see why you guys are saying 60-70 points per game is too much. It's not like he'll be going up against other top prospects or anything. There will still be plenty of other guys on the court who can score, so I think it would actually be easier for Bronny to put up 50+ points with his own teammates rather than playing with other guys at Sierra Canyon
I'd say there is a chance that he could average over 70 ppg next season (in HS) if they have good players around him on the roster and Coach TJ Walker does another great job preparing them for college/pro ball. The key thing will be seeing how much playing time everyone gets each game because it wouldn't surprise me if some other guys on the team want more than others, so we won't know until after games are played.
You do realize that you can put up numbers with your own teammates in HS right? I mean you don‚Äôt need to be playing against NBA talent (like Bronny will) for that to happen. If anything it should make it easier since he won‚Äôt have to worry about defending them as much or having to help guard other players on the floor who are better than him

I think Bronny is going to put up 60-70 points per game this season. That‚Äôs a good amount of points but not too many for him to be considered one of the best players in his class. I don‚Äôt see why people would say it‚Äôs unrealistic or that he needs to do more than just average 25 PPG with his own teammates
He is going up against a lot better competition in high school and college, so if you want him to put up numbers like Lebron did then I think it's realistic. He might not reach those heights though because there isn‚Äôt anyone else on the court who can defend against him or help guard other players as well as Bronny does

I think 60-70 points per game is a good number for a freshman at Sierra Canyon and it's not unrealistic or out of his reach. I don‚Äôt see why you guys would say this when he was already scoring 25 PPG last season with other players on the court that are better than him.
I think people just want more points from Bronny because they know how good Lebron is and think that makes him a sure thing for an All-American team or something like that, but it's not true in my opinion
Lebron averaged over 20 PPG as a freshman in HS. He was one of the best players on his own team so if he put up 60+ points then I don‚Äôt see why Bronny can‚Äôt do the same thing this season even though it would be against better competition than what Lebron faced back when he played high school basketball
He is going up against a lot better competition in high school and college, so if you want him to put up numbers like Lebron did then I think it's realistic. He might not reach those heights though because there isn‚Äôt anyone else on the court who can defend against him or help guard other players as well as Bronny does"
I don‚Äôt see why people would say it‚Äôs unrealistic or that he needs to do more than just average 25 PPG with his own teammates. I think you are right in saying there isn't anyone else on the court who can defend against him or help guard other players as well, which means Bronny will be able to score at least 30+ points every game if not more
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more likely that he puts up big numbers with his own teammates rather than playing against better competition. If anything it should make things easier because there won't be any defenders who can stop him from scoring or help guard other players on the court as well. It wouldn't surprise me if some other guys on the roster wanted more minutes but I don‚Äôt think that will happen often
If he wants to have a chance at being an All-American then it would be unrealistic for him not to put up 50+ points per game in HS. It‚Äôs not like there are going to be any other top prospects on his team so if you want him to reach that height then you better hope he plays with other players who can help guard and score as well, or at least have someone else do all the work while Bronny just scores
I don't know how many points he will put up this season but I think it's realistic for him to average 25+ PPG. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are playing against other top prospects in high school or college because Bronny is going to score more than anyone else on his own team, whether it‚Äôs by himself or with help from his teammates

Essay Topic: Free, Agency[/ESSAY]
In a few years time, Bronny James will be entering the NBA draft. However, if he wants to play basketball in the NBA league, there is no guarantee that he can succeed and have a successful career like his father Lebron did. In my opinion, I feel that Bronny James should wait one year for free agency because it would be beneficial to him by giving him the time to develop into an overall player.
[MKW]write a bronny james free agency[/MKW]
There are a few reasons why I think he should wait and not enter the draft at such a young age. First of all, Lebron has mentioned that he wants him to get a good education first and have fun playing basketball in college for a year or two before joining the league. The second reason is because Bronny is still very young. He just turned 16 and is not fully developed yet physically. And lastly, there are plenty of other players who will be entering the draft at the same time as him so it might give them an advantage over him if they had more experience playing against college athletes or pro-athletes in general.
