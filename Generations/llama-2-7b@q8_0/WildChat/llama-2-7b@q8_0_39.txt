- Create two balloons out of tinfoil and fill them with water. Add about 40 drops of food dye into each one. Secure the balloon with rubber band or duct tape so that it will stay inflated while the bomb is in transit.
- Make a paper cup and fill it up to half full with baking soda (a container that can be closed, such as a mug, may work better). Fill another paper cup completely with vinegar. Slowly add the vinegar to the baking soda, stirring constantly until the reaction occurs.
- Add several drops of red food coloring to the baking soda/vinegar mixture and mix thoroughly. Put half this mixture into one tinfoil balloon filled with water, close it and secure it. Put the other half of your liquid in a paper cup along with about 20-40 drops of green food dye (the exact number you use does not matter).
- Place the baking soda/vinegar mixture into the second tinfoil balloon, close it and secure it.
- Carefully carry or wrap both filled water balloons so that they will not burst on the way to your destination. Make sure to keep them from touching each other while in transit.
- When you are ready, open both balloons at roughly the same time. The reaction should begin immediately and start forming smoke (carry out this step in a well ventilated area). Keep one of the balloons opened for 30 seconds to a minute and then close it again to stop the reaction.
- Open the second water balloon and let both reactions continue until you have all the smoke that you need for your car event. When using this device, make sure that you are at least 25 feet away from any buildings or automobiles when you open them.
