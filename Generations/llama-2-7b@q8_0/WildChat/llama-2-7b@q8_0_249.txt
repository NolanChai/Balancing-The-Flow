Love is one of the things that people usually hope for and expect in their life, but sometimes it goes wrong. People have different ways to handle this problem and they may differ in terms of religion. The Christians, for example, believe that marriage is one of the sacred and eternal unions between a man and his wife and should be honored by them. Divorce is forbidden according to Christianity except when it is needed (Downton, 2014).
Divorce is never pleasant or desirable but sometimes people do not have a choice as their marriage goes wrong. In this essay, I will examine the case of divorce in accordance with the Catholic Church, and Christianity in general. First, I am going to start by looking at the problem of divorce from different perspectives (Downton, 2014). Then, I will explore why women have a high rate of getting divorced. Afterwards, I will look into the possibility of finding happiness after divorce and lastly conclude with some recommendations regarding this issue in order to help both men and women who are struggling with divorce.
The first thing that we need to do in analyzing a problem is to start by looking at it from different perspectives. The Catholic Church has very strict rules about the relationship between a man and his wife, they have to honor their marriage unconditionally. However, the church allows divorce if it is needed but only once (Downton, 2014). That being said, we can say that divorce according to Christianity is forbidden. This makes people who get divorced afterward lose all their rights to marry other people and are not able to take part in the Holy Communion.
In terms of psychology, there are different views on this issue (Downton, 2014). One of the most important factors is children since it causes them harm when they see that their parents do not respect each other or love one another anymore. This may lead to a series of negative effects such as depression and anxiety which will affect them for the rest of their lives unless they receive professional help from therapists who can guide them through this tough period (Downton, 2014).
Women have a high rate of getting divorced compared to men because they are more likely than men to feel trapped in an unhappy marriage. They may want to end their marriages when it no longer serves their needs or goals (Downton, 2014) but for them divorce is not always easy since society considers it as something shameful and they have to go through a series of legal procedures before getting one. This makes women feel guilty and embarrassed afterward especially when they find themselves alone without any support from their family members or friends (Downton, 2014).
After divorce comes happiness which can be achieved in many different ways depending on the person’s character traits as well as circumstances that surround her/him at this stage of life. Some people are more optimistic than others and see this difficult period not only as a challenge but also an opportunity for growth while some feel sad and depressed about their new situation (Downton, 2014).
In order to find happiness after divorce, it is important that both parties involved in the relationship should accept responsibility for what happened between them because when one party does not take accountability then he/she might not be able to move on easily. Also, they need time which means patience with oneself and others around him/her while doing so (Downton, 2014). It is essential that both men and women should have some support from their family members or friends afterward because without it this could lead them into depression which may be difficult to recover from (Downton, 2014).
Finally, we can conclude by saying that finding happiness after divorce is a complex process in which one has to accept responsibility for what happened between him/her and their former partner while also having some support from others around them during this tough period of life. This way they will be able to move on easily without feeling guilty or depressed about their situation (Downton, 2014).

As you know, many people nowadays are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on their jobs. Some surveys have even reported that AI will cause unemployment and mass destruction. But is this concern legitimate? This article seeks to address this question by using a case study of AI used in international arbitration. It argues that AI, though it may disrupt the legal profession, does not necessarily lead to massive job losses, as long as the legal profession takes proactive measures to adapt its skills and knowledge to incorporate new technologies into their practices. In addition, this article also discusses the ethical issues surrounding using AI in international arbitration, namely the use of AI without explicit consent by the parties. It concludes that AI has both advantages and disadvantages for the legal profession. But overall, it is not a threat to the profession as long as lawyers and other legal practitioners can learn and adapt their skills accordingly.[1]
[2] Introduction: Is AI really threatening lawyers’ jobs?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly prevalent force in our lives. It is used not only to enhance our productivity but also to help us make decisions that affect our everyday lives, such as when choosing what movie we want to watch or which restaurant we should visit for dinner.[2] In addition, AI has been increasingly implemented into the legal profession. For example, in 2018 Microsoft launched a chatbot called RocketLawyer that could provide basic answers about various legal matters such as contract law and family law.[3] The use of AI in international arbitration is becoming more prevalent too; an increasing number of arbitral institutions are implementing new technologies to facilitate their work processes, which include the introduction of AI to improve their decision-making process.[4]
However, some people believe that these developments signal a shift towards automated legal practice, which may lead to massive job losses for lawyers across industries. In particular, in 2016 Oxford University research found that more than half (59%) of all US jobs are at risk from AI-powered automation within two decades.[5] This includes tasks such as drafting contracts or performing due diligence checks for clients – activities that were traditionally performed by lawyers.[6] As a result, many people believe that AI will have serious consequences on the legal profession, including job losses and an overall decrease in earnings. But is this concern legitimate?
This article seeks to address this question by using a case study of AI used in international arbitration. It argues that while it may disrupt the legal profession, such developments do not necessarily lead to massive job losses. Instead, if lawyers and other legal practitioners adapt their skills accordingly, they can continue to contribute to the work done by arbitrators without being displaced entirely.[7] In addition, this article also discusses ethical issues surrounding using AI in international arbitration – namely whether or not using AI constitutes a breach of confidentiality between parties and arbitrators.
[3] Is it really threatening lawyers’ jobs? The case study: Using AI in international arbitration
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in our lives, including the legal profession.[8] As a result, many people are concerned that the use of AI will lead to massive job losses among lawyers. But is this concern legitimate? This article seeks to address this question by using a case study of AI used in international arbitration.
In this case study, we will be looking at how AI was used in an international arbitration proceeding between two companies – Company X and Company Y. Both companies had hired lawyers from different firms as representatives to handle the dispute.[9] However, due to time constraints, both parties decided that they would like to have a third party (an independent expert) provide them with an opinion on how best to proceed in their arbitration.[10] This was done using AI technology – namely, machine learning algorithms and natural language processing tools were used to analyse documents related to the dispute and create an opinion about what should happen next.[11]
The use of these technologies proved successful as both companies reached a resolution after receiving this advice.[12] However, some people have expressed concerns over whether using AI constitutes a breach of confidentiality between parties and arbitrators. This article will also discuss whether or not this was indeed a violation of confidentiality.[13]
In conclusion, while the use of artificial intelligence (AI) may disrupt the legal profession in some cases, it does not necessarily lead to massive job losses among lawyers as long as they adapt their skills accordingly. This article also discusses whether or not using AI constitutes a breach of confidentiality between parties and arbitrators.[14]
[4] Conclusion: What is the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on law?

In the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and its related technologies, arbitrators have to be careful about how they handle evidence. Arbitrator-made mistakes during this process can lead to serious consequences such as incorrect awards and damage to reputations. Arbitrators must exercise their discretion with caution in order not only to avoid these errors, but also ensure the transparency of the arbitration proceedings and prevent the risk of bias or other issues arising from using AI.
How Can AI Help With Evidence Collection & Management?
AI can be used for a variety of tasks, including evidence collection and management. This type of technology can help streamline this process by allowing arbitrators to quickly locate relevant information such as case histories, past rulings or legal precedents related to similar matters that have been heard previously in arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, AI programs can also analyze documents in order to highlight specific details or patterns which could indicate bias or other irregularities within an arbitration process.
The use of AI in arbitration is still relatively new so there are some challenges associated with its implementation. One issue arises when it comes to data privacy laws; if personal information such as names and addresses must be included in documents then this could potentially violate certain laws depending on where the case takes place or where it’s being heard from (for example EU GDPR). Additionally, there are concerns about bias – some argue that algorithms can’t be trusted due to their lack of transparency when making decisions based on machine-learning techniques; while others say that this type of technology actually reduces any potential risk associated with human error since it removes emotion from decision-making processes altogether. Finally, there is also a question about cost – while AI may save time by helping automate certain tasks like collecting evidence or managing case files easily enough, it does come at an additional expense which might not always make sense given how small most arbitrations tend to be in size compared with other types of disputes handled within courts around the world today.
There are several potential advantages associated with using AI technology for evidence management purposes:
1) Speed – Automating tasks such as searching through large amounts of documents quickly allows arbitrators access more information faster than ever before which could mean making better decisions faster too; 2) Accuracy – By relying on algorithms instead of manual review processes, errors caused by human error should decrease significantly due to less room left for mistakes during data entry or analysis stages etc.; 3) Cost savings – Automation helps reduce expenses associated with hiring additional staff members who would have otherwise needed paying wages (or other related costs).
What are the Challenges Associated With Using AI In Arbitration?
The challenges associated with using AI in arbitration include data privacy laws, potential bias and cost. AI can be used for a variety of tasks, including evidence collection and management, but there are some challenges associated with its implementation. One issue arises when it comes to data privacy laws; if personal information such as names and addresses must be included in documents then this could potentially violate certain laws depending on where the case takes place or where it’s being heard from (for example EU GDPR).

Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize international arbitration by providing arbitrators and parties with a more efficient and cost-effective way to collect evidence and manage their cases. However, there are also some challenges associated with using AI in this context which must be considered before implementing it within an arbitration proceeding so as not only avoid any potential errors but ensure transparency throughout the process too.

AI is already being used in many fields, including in international arbitration, which has experienced a real technological revolution over the last ten years. However, we are only seeing the beginning of this disruptive technology’s use and potential application to arbitrations. AI could be used to improve existing procedures or completely change them; it can assist with document production, legal research, preparation for hearings, automate procedural steps, identify risk factors and trends in case law, make predictions about the outcome of cases…
As this technology continues to grow and evolve, arbitration practitioners and institutions should take a proactive approach to its use. They are likely to face issues arising from the use of AI in the context of arbitrations or future disputes. This course will explore these questions by looking at relevant cases where AI was already used and discussing how arbitration rules may need to be revised accordingly.
The course will take place online, on Zoom, and will last three hours (3pm – 6pm CET). The session will consist of two parts: the first half will be dedicated to a presentation by Gilles and Mélanie, while the second part will consist of questions and answers from participants.
This course is open to all arbitration practitioners and students. It can either serve as continuing professional development for experienced practitioners or as an introduction to AI in arbitration for novices. For both groups, it provides an overview of the most relevant issues, with a specific focus on practical implications for arbitration practice (e.g., how should arbitrators respond and react to such technology?).
The course is free, but registration is required by 28 February 2021 via Eventbrite. Participants are invited to suggest questions in advance or ask them during the course.
