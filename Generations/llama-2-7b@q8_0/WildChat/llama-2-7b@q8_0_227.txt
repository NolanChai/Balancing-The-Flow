[INT](YURI’S BEDROOM)

(The three girls stand in silence as they look at the unconscious body of their friend and clubmate.)

Monika: “What happened? Why is she like this?”

Natsuki: (taking a closer look) “Her skin…it looks like it’s rotting.”

Sayori: “And her eyes…they’re all black, like charcoal.”

Monika: “This can’t be real. How could this happen?”

(They turn to Yuri’s desk and see the open book lying on top of it.)[/INT]
