(Meanwhile at school…)

Natsuki: “Oh my gosh! Sayori and MC have a baby?! That is soooo cool!”

Monika: “Yeah, I know, right?” (Monika takes out her phone from her pocket.) “I’m gonna message them ASAP. What about you, Natsuki-senpai?”

Natsuki: “I dunno…”

Yuri: “Huh? Why don’t you?”

Natsuki: “Well, it might be a bit strange to say congratulations for someone who isn’t even in our class.”

Yuri: “But you know Sayori and MC!”

Natsuki: “I know…but I still feel awkward sending her a message like that. What do you think, Monika-senpai? Should we send them something?”

Monika: “Honestly? No.”

Natsuki: “Really!?” (Natsuki turns around to face the rest of our friends.) “Well, I guess it’s not that big a deal after all. Still…it is so cool though!!”

Yuri: “I think you’re just jealous.”

Monika: “Hahaha. You got me there, Yurikawa-san!”

(And with that, our conversation comes to an end.)
