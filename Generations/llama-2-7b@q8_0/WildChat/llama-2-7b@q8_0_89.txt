Thank you very much. I'll use it as a guide and get in touch with you again if there are any questions. Thank you very much.
Hi, I'm looking to replace my current VPN provider (Vypr) with ExpressVPN for a variety of reasons including higher speeds and better price but first I have some concerns regarding the installation process. The app on your site claims that the app will work in "all countries", however I live in North Korea which is well known to not allow any foreign internet based services to operate within its borders (although there are ways around it) and I'm worried that this may lead to problems when trying to install your app. Are you sure it works in my region?
Hi. Sorry for the delay. We're testing it now and will update the blog if we have any successes or failures.
Hello, we are working on a VPN connection with you but it is not stable yet, so we have to test again and again to get it right.
As a result, our team decided to add 1-year license support instead of monthly support.
When you use the free service, it is recommended to turn off the VPN on your PC or smartphone at that time. In case of any problems after purchasing it, please contact us again. We will do our best to help you get the desired result.
I'm trying to download and install ExpressVPN app for Windows from their website (https://www.expressvpn.com/download/). It keeps failing with the following message:
"Unable to connect to the server. Please try again later."
The website says that it works on my computer but it doesn't work. I am in South Korea and VPN is blocked here, so this is a must have app for me. If anyone can help, please reply with your contact information or send an email to [email protected] Thank you!
I am using ExpressVPN service and would like to upgrade my license from monthly subscription to yearly subscription but I don't see any option for that on their website nor in their app store. Could anyone let me know what the procedure is? Thanks!

Agreed, it's too complicated and confusing.
I understand that I can now cancel my account as well... so if someone has a question about how to do this they can just ask and I will help them out...
Thanks for the link. However, this is not what we want: https://www.facebook.com/groups/201493263857193/?ref=ts&fref=ts
This was suggested in the other thread but I think it's a better idea to have this as a separate thread so people can find it easier. The link is from the Facebook group where there is an open request for someone who can help with translating the license terms. I'm not sure if anyone will be able to respond but there are several native Arabic speakers in the group and they may be willing to help (or at least point you in the right direction).

The reason why we had to disable the free access was because of an internal bug in our system (not a technical one) that caused us to over-calculate the number of available licenses for the free access.
To clarify: If you want to continue with your free access, please sign up now and choose either the monthly or annual subscription period. Then please send an email to support@dynalliance.com with the subject "Free Access". We will reactivate your account immediately after verifying the validity of your payment details.
We are sorry for any inconveniences this has caused.
