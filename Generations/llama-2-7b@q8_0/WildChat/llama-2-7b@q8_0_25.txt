[player]: "What do you mean…? Can you explain what happened?"

Mindy: (panting) "My name is Mindy. And yes - I was in the hospital when it first happened."

[player]: "Explain further!"

(She took a deep breath and explained everything.)

Mindy: (continues) "I had just gotten married to my husband, Greg, about 6 months ago. We were finally expecting our child! My pregnancy was going well up until the day before yesterday, but then…" (crying) "My water broke, and I couldn't stop crying."

[player]: "You must have been really upset?"

Mindy: (tearing up) "I was! My husband was too - he was trying his best to calm me down. But it didn't help. Our doctor told us that if the baby hasn't come out within 30 minutes, then the baby could be stuck in there!"

[player]: "That must have been scary…"

Mindy: (continues) "He was right! But thank God for you - without your help, our little one would still be stuck inside of me." (crying again) "...And it's not like I don't want to hold my child anymore. It's just that I can't - and every time I look at him, I see pain in his eyes..."

[player]: "Pain?"

Mindy: "It's because of this!" (holding her chest) "I'm a little older than most women here on Earth, so it took longer for me to have children. And with my husband working hard as an engineer at NASA, we never had the money to buy IVF treatment..."

[player]: "IVF…?"

Mindy: (continues) "...In vitro fertilization - and that's how I got pregnant. My egg was placed into my husband's sperm, and he and I tried our hardest to make a child together."

[player]: "And it finally worked?"

Mindy: (continues) "Yes! But we still can't afford any of the IVF treatments that could save him. And then…" (crying again) "...our baby was born prematurely, and I lost him. That's when my husband took me to the hospital."

[player]: "I'm so sorry to hear all of this..."

Mindy: (continues) "...The doctor told us that it was very rare for a baby to be born prematurely in the first place, and even more rare for one not to survive. But he did! And I thought everything was going to be okay - until yesterday." (sobbing) "I was already 29 weeks pregnant when we got there, so that means my son's been inside of me for the past 6 months!"

[player]: "What happened?"

Mindy: (crying even more now) "...My water broke again! It wasn't just once like last time - I lost all of it within minutes! The doctor told us that if he hadn't given me an epidural, then my son would have died."

[player]: "…"

Mindy: (continues) "The doctors were so scared of this happening again because they never thought the baby was going to come out! That's why Greg and I got married - we wanted to give birth together, but then my water broke. And now…I don't know how long it will take until our little one is finally born."

[player]: (thinking) "I don't think that this can be good..."
