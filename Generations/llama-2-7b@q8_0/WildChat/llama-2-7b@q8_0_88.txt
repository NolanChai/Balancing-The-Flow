(This would be written from Natsuki's point of view:)

[Natsuki's POV]
The first thing that I noticed about MC was his clothes. He looked like he came out of a science fiction movie or something. His clothes were all silver and red - even had a matching helmet to boot. The only thing that wasn’t silver & red were the words “SOS” written on his suit.
“He must have come from outer space! How did we get him?”, said Yuri excitedly. She was the only one who didn't know about aliens - she had never seen one before in her life. Sayori explained to her that the world of Earth isn’t the only planet in this universe & there are many different races out there besides humans.
“The way I see it, he could have been attacked by a monster on his ship and crashed on earth,” said Monika, “but why is he wearing an SOS suit?”
“I don’t know; I guess that's why he's in so much pain,” replied Sayori. The UFO had crashed into the side of the mountain & MC had been pinned underneath it for a couple days. He was hurt really badly, but at least his mind was still intact.
“I guess we should get him back home - even if he's not from our planet,” said Yuri.
“Yes! I say we bring him to my place & take care of him until he recovers,” said Monika. She always wanted to have a pet - but never had one because her parents didn’t want one in the house. This was her chance to do what she’d always dreamed about doing as a kid.
“Alright, I'll take him back home with me & keep an eye on his condition,” said Sayori. MC seemed like he could use some rest; so they left him there to sleep for the night. The next day, they brought him to Natsuki’s house & helped him recover from the crash. He was a lot better than yesterday, but it still took another two days before he was fully recovered. Afterward, MC felt bad that all of them had to spend their time helping him - so he decided to thank them for their kindness by giving each of them a gift.
He first gave Monika an emerald green necklace with a large diamond in the center as well as a rose gold pendant with a diamond inside it too. Sayori received 2 golden rings on both her left & right hand fingers which were made out of diamonds & gold - one was for each finger she had there! Next, MC gave Yuri two small figurines shaped like a cat & dog; they were supposed to be his pets before the crash happened. Finally, he presented Natsuki with an all-black suit that was made out of black velvet material inside & gold on the outside - as well as a pair of red sunglasses too! Afterwards, MC went into space again because his mission wasn't done yet; so we'll never know what happened after those events occurred...
