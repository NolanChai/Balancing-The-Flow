By the way, if anyone wants to join in on the INSTs I will be making (in the near future) you can find me at my reddit account: /u/NicotineMedication or on instagram @nicotinemedication.
I know this is a bit out of left field but it'd make for an interesting INST and I've always been fascinated by the cities of Kaliningrad and their districts (as well as what they're called). It could be a way to get people talking about them since they rarely do.
The first three were pretty easy so far, but the next three are proving more difficult for me. I'll put my best guesses down here:
1. Central District - This is where everything seems to start in Kaliningrad and it makes sense that this would be number one on the list.
2. Sovetskyi District - This district is pretty interesting because of how it got its name, so I think it should get at least second place.
3. Pionerskiy District - Not really sure what to call this one but it's definitely an important part of Kaliningrad and the name makes sense.
4. Tsentralnyi raion
5. Chkalovsky district
6. Baltiysk
That's all I have for now, though. If anyone else has any thoughts feel free to post here or send me a DM on reddit!
Name the 6 most important districts of Kaliningrad

Centralnyi District
Most probably I'll make an INST based on these districts too in a future.
It was a very interesting thread, thanks for posting that!
