I am sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused. This is a precautionary measure as we do not allow to withdraw cash from the card through an ATM. Kindly contact our Customer Service team and they will be happy to assist you.

What I am missing? The translation looks correct to me...

Answer: It's not the most elegant thing, but this is what I used for my insta-translations when working with Microsoft Word and translating from English into French.

Open your English Word document, in Tools -> Options -> Language, switch to the drop down box labeled "Word Options". Scroll to the bottom of the list on the right side of that page under "Advanced" and check the box for "Use grammar checking as you type."

It's not perfect and will miss some things, but it'll be better than nothing. And you can always use spellcheck later to catch any spelling mistakes after translating it.

[ENST]Hello support team,

Iâ€™m experiencing an issue with my Visa card. I have attempted multiple times to withdraw funds from various ATM machines as well as making online transactions, but all of my attempts have been unsuccessful. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this problem.

Thank you."[/ENST]
