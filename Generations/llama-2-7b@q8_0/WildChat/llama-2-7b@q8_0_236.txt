[INS]2.4. The political system is anarchic and insecure: Second, after the establishment of Political Advisory Council and Grand Councilors’ Association, the political structure became more complex: the supreme executive organ (the Grand Council) was separated from the legislative body (the Political Advisory Council), but there were still two chiefs with contradicting interests and positions. If not controlled by a stronger core (Supreme Emperor or an appointed emperor), the competition between these two institutions would turn the entire system into a mess. “The political structure is too complex, with the Grand Council, the Political Advisory Council, and the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government all possessing legislative power, so how can the executive sanction be issued?” (Li, 2011, p. 234).[/INS]
[INS]2.5. The lack of clear definition of the scope of responsibility: Third, “the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government is responsible for the compilation of legal codes and important matters that shall be decided by the Political Advisory Council” (Grand Secretariat, 1979). However, no clear distinction was made on what an important matter meant in Article 2. If all “important matters” were submitted to the Grand Councilors’ Association for discussion as stated in Article 11, this would cause confusion. More importantly, there is a loophole in the above statement: “the other documents to be examined and compiled shall be submitted to the princes and grand ministers of the Grand Council for review and approval” (Grand Secretariat, 1979). This provision was an invitation to the legislator-executive organ to usurp more power. In a constitutional system, a clear division between legislation and execution should be made in order to prevent the legislative body from taking over executive functions, which is called the “separation of powers.” The establishment of the Political Advisory Council as a legislator with full authority was the implementation of this principle. This provision also shows that there was no consensus on whether or not to establish the political system in a constitutional form or a monarchical form. If the decision was made to establish a constitutional regime, it should be separated from the executive organ and prevented from usurping any power. It would have been better if this provision had been changed according to the provisions of Articles 2 and 11 to read as follows: “The other documents to be examined and compiled shall be submitted to the Political Advisory Council for review and approval.”[/INS]
[INS]3. The establishment of an empowered political institution is not conducive to strengthening the power of the Political Advisory Council: Fourth, after the establishment of the Grand Councilors’ Association in 1907, “the Executive Council was transformed into the Supreme Emperor’s Deliberation Hall” (Li, 2011, p. 234). The legislative power of the Political Advisory Council, which was established through political struggle, was weakened further by this decision.
[INS]3.1. The Grand Councilors’ Association has too much power: Fifth, “the establishment of a legislature with no executive function is not in line with the demands of our times” (Li, 2011, p. 248). It was argued that, since political struggle and war are common phenomena in this era, a nation must have an institution to cope with such emergencies and safeguard its security and interests. The Political Advisory Council was set up for just such purposes; however, the Grand Councilors’ Association was established simultaneously, which caused confusion on whether it was to be a legislator or not. A system of two-chamber legislature was supposed to have a legislative body with executive authority (the Executive Yuan), and vice versa.[/INS]
[INS]3.2. The establishment of the Grand Councilors’ Association is disadvantageous to the Political Advisory Council: Sixth, according to Articles 25-27 of the Charter for Study on Constitutional Government (the Grand Secretariat, 1979), if the executive sanctions issued by the Political Advisory Council were not approved or vetoed within 30 days after its submission, they would be deemed as approved. This provision was intended to speed up decision-making; however, this short time limit meant that if there was an emergency in a foreign country or in an internal political struggle, the Political Advisory Council would not have sufficient time to deliberate and make decisions. Therefore, the establishment of the Grand Councilors’ Association as the supreme executive organ was supposed to relieve some of the pressure on this institution.[/INS]
[INS]3.3. The establishment of the Grand Councilors’ Association is disadvantageous to the Political Advisory Council: Seventh, “the Executive Yuan shall be established as a legislator with executive power. The executive sanctions issued by the Executive Yuan after deliberation in accordance with the law are final, and only those that violate the Constitution may be vetoed by the Emperor.” This provision was intended to make the Executive Yuan responsible for making decisions on emergencies, but it did not take into account that the Executive Yuan would soon have an institution to cope with such situations. If the Grand Councilors’ Association was established as a legislative body with executive power at the same time, who was going to be the final decision-maker when the two were in conflict? In addition, the Emperor had already been designated as the “final arbiter” (Grand Secretariat, 1979).[/INS]
[INS]3.4. The establishment of a legislature with no executive function is not in line with the demands of our times: Eighth, since the Grand Councilors’ Association was set up as a legislative body, it should have been granted full authority to make decisions and execute them. If this provision were made, “the Executive Yuan would be dissolved; however, since no such law has been passed yet, the Executive Yuan still exists today” (Li, 2011, p. 247).[/INS]
[INS]3.5. The Grand Councilors’ Association is not as strong as a legislative body with executive power: Ninth, the Political Advisory Council was established to deal with emergencies and political conflicts that occurred during war times; however, according to Articles 2-6 of the Charter for Study on Constitutional Government (Grand Secretariat, 1979), “the Executive Yuan shall be set up as a legislature with executive power. The executive sanctions issued by the Executive Yuan after deliberation in accordance with the law are final.” It was stated that only those that violate the Constitution may be vetoed by the Emperor; however, no such provision was made on how to deal with emergencies and conflicts outside of the Constitution or how to make executive sanctions. “The establishment of an institution without any power is not conducive to maintaining order in society” (Li, 2011, p. 248).[/INS]
[INS]3.6. The lack of a system for making decisions: Tenth, according to Article 5 of the Charter for Study on Constitutional Government, “the legislative body shall consist of two houses, namely, the Political Advisory Council and the Grand Councilors’ Association.” This provision made it impossible for either of these institutions to make a decision since there was no provision in place regarding what to do when they disagreed. The only thing that could be done is to refer the case to the Emperor for final arbitration, which was also provided in Article 7: “The Legislative Yuan shall not pass any legislation or executive sanction without the approval of the Emperor.” However, since the Political Advisory Council was established as a legislator with full authority, it should have been granted full powers to make decisions on emergencies. Otherwise, there would be an endless cycle in making final decisions and referrals.[/INS]
[INS]4. The establishment of the Grand Councilors’ Association was not conducive to strengthening the power of the Political Advisory Council: Eleventh, according to Articles 26-30 of the Charter for Study on Constitutional Government (Grand Secretariat, 1979), if there were any disputes or conflicts in making decisions between the Executive Yuan and the Political Advisory Council after the latter made its decision, they would be submitted to the Emperor. This provision was intended to strengthen the power of the Emperor; however, since the Emperor had already been designated as the “final arbiter” (Grand Secretariat, 1979), this provision did not add any new power to the Emperor. More importantly, in a constitutional regime, an executive institution should be separated from a legislative body for the following reasons: (1) it would prevent any attempts by the Executive Yuan or the Grand Councilors’ Association to usurp legislative powers; and (2) it would ensure that each institution has equal authority. “This provision is in conflict with Article 7 of the Charter for Study on Constitutional Government, which states
