I am looking for a script that can tell me how many tokens (and thus time) were used up by the last request. I know about the "get-content" command, but it does not work properly in this scenario. It just returns what was left when the page loaded or did not load. The token is reset to 0.
Does anyone have a script for this? Or do you think there is no such thing (and that I should use a different technique)?
I tried the following (in PowerShell), but it doesn't work either:
$req = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers @{Authorization = "Token token=$token"}
$resp = $req.ResponseStream | Out-String
#$resp | ConvertFrom-Json
