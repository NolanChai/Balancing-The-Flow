Song: "Girls On Film" by Duran Duran
Genre: Survival, Apocalyptic.
(I got bored so I decided to make a song and share it)
It was just another day in the city until this one strange guy came in the bar where the people were singing and dancing having fun with their friends and family while they had a couple of drinks and some food...
"Uh! Uh, Uh!" The man was saying. "Please listen to me I can't take it any longer...I-I don't have any friends no one wants me..." he said crying and the people in that bar were disgusted by him for his bad attitude.
"Who does?! You are just a freak!" A woman shouted at him.
"You are just mean..you are all the same...always being mean to me...and I am so tired of it..." he said crying more and one of the bartenders decided to go over and talk with him.
"Listen man...I know you feel alone but do not give up..life is still beautiful and you can have friends if you try hard enough." The bartender told him.
"What are friends?! Friends betrays me and I am so lonely that I would rather die!" he shouted. "So please don't talk to me...just leave me alone..." the guy was saying while crying, as the people were shocked by his bad attitude.
As soon as the bartender finished talking with him..he decided to get him some beer and some food for him to eat but then when he turned around to get it from behind the counter...the man who was drinking had vanished and no one knew where he went!
The bartenders and all of his friends got worried because they were thinking that something bad happened with the guy. So they went looking for him in the whole city but nobody found anything..then finally after a long while the people could not find him anymore...but then some time later, there was another news saying that there are a group of robots that has come to attack the city and that they have been destroying everything from schools to hospitals and even houses.
"Oh no!" Said one person in shock. "Please tell me it's not true..that can't be happening..." another guy was saying.
"I don't believe it but..I just want to know for sure...is this really happening?" A lady said.
And the news report continued telling that the robots have been invading other places of the city and all of them are looking to kill people, so they wanted everyone to stay in their houses and not go out no matter what until the situation calms down. So it's safer for us, the reporter told them while looking nervously into the camera as he was telling that news.
As soon as the man finished his report..everyone in that city was shocked because they never thought they were going to get attacked by robots and other people started screaming and shouting. They all felt afraid for their lives and knew it was dangerous so they decided to stay inside of their house. But then, they also got angry at the people who made fun of that weird guy in the bar...because he could be right, they were acting like jerks but now they are feeling sorry for being mean to him..and they started to regret it a lot and felt bad because they realize they should've listened more when he was crying.
After that, a group of robots came in one house and the people there were afraid...they tried to run away but then the robots shot them and killed all of them and after that they decided to get back home for now..until it is safer and they can go out again...and while everyone was busy with these thoughts, they didn't realize a strange man was walking in their neighborhood.
"Hello there!" The guy said looking at the people who were crying from fear but also feeling angry because they were making fun of that weirdo who told them he couldn't find any friends. "I am your new friend...and I will help you to get out alive from all those robots." He said smiling and they looked at him in disbelief while everyone was thinking if it was true or not, so one woman decided to ask him.
"How?!" She shouted looking worried and the guy replied with a smile and then he walked over and got behind her..then he grabbed her and disappeared from there. "Wait what?! Where did he go?" The people said looking everywhere but they couldn't find that weirdo who had appeared out of nowhere...then they continued to be angry at those robots because they wanted them dead, so after a while the police arrived to help and they all went outside with guns.
"I am not going anywhere!" A cop shouted as he was pointing his gun towards some robots in front of him. "You are not going to escape!" The man shouted getting ready for attack and another one shouted and said: "Don't try to fight them, just run away or we will all die!.."
Then the robots began firing at people and shooting them dead..and everyone was scared but after a while they decided to attack those machines...they got ready for fight but then they all got injured so they ran back home. After that, the robots were in the city destroying everything and the people were now hiding everywhere trying their best not to get caught by those machines.
The police was going around helping people as fast as they could..but after a while they started getting tired and some of them got injured and they decided to stop fighting because it was too hard for them...they were outnumbered and if they tried again, then there would be more casualties which would make everything even worse than it already is.
The robots also kept destroying things from schools to hospitals and houses...and after a while the people in their homes could not take anymore...so they all got ready for fight because they were tired of hiding..they decided to leave their houses and go outside to get out alive from these robots that attacked them.
The police were also doing the same thing, but when everyone saw this man running away from those machines they thought he was a criminal so they pointed at him and one policeman shouted: "Stop! Put your hands up!" But instead of stopping or listening to that man..he continued running for his life while getting angry because everyone was saying that he is the bad guy without even knowing who he really is.
The robots also noticed this man as well, so they all started firing at him with guns and missiles but it didn't work since nothing could stop him from doing what he wants. After a while one of them said: "I see.." The robot thought and then it began moving faster towards that guy until he finally caught up with him.
The man was getting ready for fight with his fists and feet, but the robots just ignored this...and started shooting at him with guns so as soon as one of them got near to him he punched it really hard in the chest which made its robot body get destroyed into pieces..so then another one came up to attack but after seeing what happened before, he decided not to waste his time and ran away...and that's how this man started fighting against those robots alone while everyone else was hiding.
After a long while of battling with the robots, he finally got tired from doing all of these fights without any rest or food..he also felt hungry so he decided to go inside one house where there were some people who were injured and they needed his help. He went over to them but then after seeing this man in their home, the woman shouted: "Who are you?!" The guy replied with a smile as he said: "I am your new friend..and I will save everyone."
The man also noticed that there was another person inside of that house who wasn't injured so he walked over and got behind him...then he grabbed his hand before taking off into the sky. As soon as they were in the air, one of those robots came out to attack them but then after seeing how fast this man could move, it started shooting missiles at him while trying its best not to let him get away from there..but no matter what happened he always managed to escape with that person who was injured.
After a long time of fighting with the robots, they finally got tired so instead of continuing their battle they decided to go back home and sleep for now...but then when one of them saw those two people who were flying away from there..he started shooting at them again because he didn't want them to get away. But then after seeing what happened before, the man said: "I see.." As soon as that robot got near him, he punched it really hard in the chest which made its body get destroyed into pieces and he was able to continue flying with that person who was injured.
After a long time of battling against those robots, they finally stopped for now...and this man decided not only help people from their homes but also fight back against those machines so as soon as one of them noticed him standing outside of its house..it started shooting at him again with guns and missiles while trying to kill

I made this for a couple of reasons. The first one being I was feeling down after finishing my first story on wattpad (Golden Souls) which I'd written at the time I've had so many problems with. The second reason is I wanted to experiment with how the game works and what it's possible.
I was playing around in the sandbox mode of FNF trying different things and came up with the idea of having Pico play as a zombie, but then it hit me. Why not make a song out of this? This would be fun. After that I just went off on my own track. The only problem was the game. It didn't like how I did some stuff. For example, the song I made with Pico playing as a robot was fine, but for some reason when I changed it to an alien, the game couldn't handle it and crashed whenever I tried to play it on the sandbox mode. But when I played the story (and also the original song) in the arcade, there were no problems at all.
Anyways here is the story (it's a bit long). If you have any problem with it or want me to change anything, let me know. Also, if you want to play my other story, "Golden Souls", go on wattpad and search "GoldenSouls".
In this apocalypse, there is a survival arena. It has all the things that exist in FNF but also some new ones like Pico-chan as zombie or robot or alien or... You name it! Anyways, you'll be playing as different characters (GF,BF,Pico) who fight each other for survival and try to escape from this place. But there is a problem: they are in a dream and none of them can wake up from this nightmare.
The story starts with Boyfriend sleeping on his bedroom (at 7:28PM), then he gets woken up by his alarm clock ringing, so he turns it off. When that happens, his alarm clock switches to a radio which plays a song about a girl who is lost and wants to find her love again. As the radio continues playing, BF goes downstairs while listening to the song, but he stops in front of the fridge. He looks at it for some time before opening it. The first thing that he sees is GF's picture, which makes him think about her and how much they used to love each other... Then he gets hungry so he grabs a bottle of milk and leaves (at 8:16PM).
As Boyfriend is walking down the street, the song continues playing but he doesn't pay attention because he wants to get back home as fast as possible. Then something catches his eye. He sees a girl in white who is standing on the side of the road and looking at him. BF stops walking and approaches her. When she looks at him, Boyfriend gets scared...
She smiles and says "Welcome to my world" before she takes out a revolver from underneath her shirt and shoots BF in his leg! Then she takes the gun away and walks away... (at 8:34PM). Boyfriend falls on the ground while bleeding and looking around for help.
A few minutes later, someone runs towards him with a gun in their hands saying "Sorry!" as they shoot at him but miss. The girl from before then jumps to BF's side and holds his wound with her hands... (at 8:52PM).
"Oh no..." Boyfriend says while looking at the blood on his leg...
Then she asks "What? Do you want me to stop?"
BF answers "No, just don't kill me please!"
The girl looks at BF with a confused look before she smiles and says "Don't worry, I won't" while looking at her gun which has a bullet in it... (at 8:53PM). Boyfriend looks at the blood on his leg again. Suddenly he turns to look back at the girl who is still staring at him with a confused expression on her face... Then she says "You're not dead yet?"
BF nods and then asks "Why didn't you kill me? I thought you were going to do it" as he holds his wound...
She smiles and says "I just wanted to make sure that you weren't a zombie before doing so. You see, I don't like killing zombies because they are dead already so there is no point in doing so" before looking at her gun again which has now only got one bullet left...
BF looks at the blood on his leg for some more time then says "What do you want from me?" as he gets up and walks away. The girl smiles and follows him saying "I don't know, but I hope that we can become friends soon..." (at 9:02PM).
Boyfriend is walking in a forest with the sun setting down behind him when suddenly he sees someone on his right side standing at one of the trees. The person looks around before looking back at BF... (at 9:20PM). He approaches them and asks "Who are you?" as they walk away from each other slowly but without stopping running or anything else until they reach an alleyway where they stop again (at 9:45PM)
Boyfriend is walking through another forest when he suddenly stops in front of two trees that have a girl's body hanging from them. As Boyfriend looks at it, the girl opens her eyes and says "Hi BF, you're looking good today" (at 10:43PM).
Boyfriend is standing on an empty street with his back facing someone who is walking towards him quickly. When that person comes close enough to see him clearly, they stop and say "Oh shit! It's you!" as Boyfriend turns around... (at 11:25PM). They both start running away from each other but when they get far enough apart so that neither one can see the other anymore, BF stops suddenly and falls down on his knees while looking at the ground sadly.
The person who was running away from him approaches him again saying "Hey! Where's your friend?" (at 12:04AM). Boyfriend turns around and looks up at them before answering with an empty stare which makes them stop talking for a moment... Then he says "I don't know" as his eyes start tearing up.
The person takes out their gun saying "So you left her here to die?" while pointing it towards him, but BF doesn't move at all because he knows that if they shoot him now then everything will just end there and there is no way back from this point so instead of trying anything risky like running away or fighting back with a weapon he just stands there looking sad until the sun rises again...
BF wakes up in his bedroom and looks around before realizing that he's still dreaming. He walks downstairs where he finds GF cooking breakfast for them both on the kitchen counter, but when she sees him she stops what she was doing and asks "What are you doing here?" as BF looks at her with an empty stare (at 1:17AM).
GF then smiles at Boyfriend before saying "I thought you were dead" while turning back to face the stove again... Then she walks over to him and says "It's okay, I forgive you" as they both hug each other tightly while crying tears of joy. After some time passes by they get closer together until their lips touch which makes them start kissing passionately before stopping suddenly when someone knocks on the door (at 2:05AM).
Boyfriend walks out of the kitchen where he finds his sister standing in front of him with her gun pointed towards him. She says "Where have you been all night?" as she starts walking slowly forward while Boyfriend remains still without saying anything back... Then GF comes running downstairs and screams at her brother asking "What are you doing? Put that thing away!". Her sister looks confused before saying "I'm sorry, I didn't know" before pointing the gun again towards BF who gets even more upset now because he knows what she's going to do next...
GF walks over to him while crying tears of regret before asking her brother if there's anything wrong with her... Then Boyfriend grabs her shoulders saying "No, everything is fine!" as he looks at his sister sadly. He then walks back into the kitchen where he sees that his mother has just come home from work so now she'll have to take care of both girls while they sleep off this dream which means that BF will never see them again... (at 3:06AM).
Boyfriend wakes up in a strange place with no idea what happened or where he is but he can feel something moving around nearby so he decides to follow the sound until it stops... After some time passes by Boyfriend sees that there are other people here as well and one of them tells him "Hey! What's your name?" (at 4:10AM).
Boyfriend answers "I don't know" before saying "What about you?". The person
