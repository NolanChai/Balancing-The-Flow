Caballut Lita is an artist from Spain, her artworks are very popular in many countries. She has been studying the art since she was a child. When she was 17 years old, she got into the fine arts school of Barcelona which is also known as the “Escuela de Bellas Artes”. This is where she became interested in painting and started to learn how to paint by using her own hands. The painter has been famous since she graduated from this art college and she had a very successful career in Spain after that. In 2014, Cabellut Lita was invited to participate in an exhibition of Spanish artists who were working on their latest projects at the time. At this event, she showed one of her paintings which depicts a scene from a movie called “The Dark Knight”. The painting shows Batman standing next to a car with two police officers in front of it while they are trying to stop him from leaving town.
Lita Caballut is an artist from Spain who has been creating art for more than 30 years now and she is very famous around the world because of her unique style which combines surrealism, cubism and pop art with a touch of humor that makes it so interesting to watch how these artists use their paint brushes when they are painting on canvas. Lita Caballut also has a website where you can find out all kinds of information about herself including biography, awards received by her paintings etc., but what I really want to talk about today is why Lita Caballut was able to become successful so quickly after starting her art career at such an early age without any training in painting or any kind of formal education at all.

Lita Cabellut was born on September 15th, 1967 in Barcelona (Spain). She grew up there until she moved out when she turned 20 years old to start studying architecture at the University of Barcelona which lasted for three years before moving again this time back home where her parents lived with their two daughters whom also happen to be twins like Lita herself who has two younger brothers called Fernando (the oldest) and David (the youngest).
In 1985 after graduating from college, she had her first solo exhibition at an art gallery called “La Galeria d’Art” located in Barcelona city center which displayed her work for several months until they closed down due to financial difficulties caused by recession during that period of time (the early 90s).

In 2015, after being selected for another exhibition at an art gallery called La Casa de la Cultura which also happens to be located inside Madrid city center, Lita started painting again as she wanted some space away from all those people around her who were constantly asking questions about why or how did this artist do that thing over there like drawing lines on paper instead of writing them down on paper first before even starting with any kind of sketching process.

This event was called “La Casa de la Cultura” which means house for culture in English so it sounds like an art gallery but actually it’s just one floor inside this building where everyone can come and see how artists create their work without having any distractions from outside world such as family members or friends who might interrupt them during their creative process by asking questions about why did you choose to draw something like that instead of drawing something else like what happened last time when I visited you at home? This kind of thing happens all too often so Lita decided she needed some space away from everything going on around her where she could just focus solely on painting without having anyone distracting her at any given moment throughout the entire process!
