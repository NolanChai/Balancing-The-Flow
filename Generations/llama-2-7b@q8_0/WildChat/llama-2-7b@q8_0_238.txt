Achievements in 2021
In 2021, the plant’s production capacity increased to 5 tons per day. The output of PAW solutions was 400 bottles per shift (48 m3). At the same time, it should be noted that this is only the beginning and the volume will increase in the future, as well as there are plans for export.
In 2021, there were difficulties in supplying PAW solutions to customers due to insufficient production of PAW solutions and a shortage of plasma treatment equipment in Uzbekistan. In this regard, it was decided that it is necessary to increase the production capacity by investing in new equipment and technologies.
In 2022, there are plans for an increase in the plant’s production capacity to 10 tons per day, as well as an increase in productivity and the introduction of modern scientific achievements into practice.[/INST]
