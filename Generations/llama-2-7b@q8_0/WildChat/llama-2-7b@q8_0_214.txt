Why does this happen? If you combine any amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen, it will always create water. I can't figure out why that is unless we are referring to a different chemical equation.

I think you might be getting your hydrogen and oxygen mixed up? The chemical formula for water is H2O.
That's a pretty basic reaction, it'll give you an idea of what this site can do.
