"She's a big girl, she can probably take it. I think that she would be happy to take it on behalf of Gordon, if you know what I mean." - [Carolyn](2017)   
"Probably not. But I don’t really have an opinion about that because there are so many things about this game that I love and am grateful for." - [Stephen](2018)  
"I think she’s a big girl, but she is still a woman and a lot of people would see it as a form of abuse if she were to throw herself on Gordon. Personally, I would like the game to be more about their relationship rather than just them being good friends." - [Steve](2017)  
"I think Alyx would protect Gordon in this situation. She’d do it because he asked her to, and she knows that if anything happened to him then that’d be the end for humanity." - [Ethan](2018)   
"If I had to choose between the two, Gordon would definitely have my vote." - [Kate](2017)
