> Memorization can help, but it's not enough. It takes more than memorization of facts and figures for a student to succeed in school. A good education requires critical thinking skills as well as an understanding of how knowledge is organized so that students learn how to apply what they know.

Memorization can be an important tool for learning but it does not mean that memorizing information will result in better understanding of concepts. Memory recall is dependent on the ability to encode, store, and retrieve information which requires attention to detail, processing fluency as well as the capacity for recollection (Baddeley, 2012). This suggests that a short-term memory that can retain information may not lead to long term retention. 

One study found that learning styles have little effect on students’ success in college science courses and therefore should not be used in course design or teaching methods (Fitzgerald & McMullin, 2013).

The myth of “memorization” is that by memorizing the information without any context or connection to it, then you will retain more knowledge. This is simply false! Memory only lasts so long when there isn’t a mental connection, and not all information can be retained in our short-term memory at once. For example, imagine trying to remember your entire phonebook with every number, address and name. You could try and memorize the numbers without any connection or context, but it will be much harder for you to retain that knowledge than if it was organized into categories like home, business, or cellphone. If we want students to learn better they need not just know information but understand how it fits together and why is matters!

There are three important concepts I would like my future students (or anyone) remember: **Context**, **Connection**, and **Complexity**. With these 3 pieces, I think we can make a difference in the way students learn by changing our methods of teaching instead of expecting them to change their brains overnight.

#### Contextualization:

If you are going to teach something like calculus, for example, then it is important that your student understand why they need this information and how it relates back into reality outside the classroom setting! For example when teaching derivatives I would first have them think about what we mean by change in one variable relative to another; secondly show them an everyday context where those concepts make sense (like walking speed vs jogging speed); third explain why this concept is important for them beyond just knowing that 35 meters per hour is faster than 28 meters per hour; fourth describe what happens when things aren’t linear so they have more of a grasp on what derivatives really mean.

#### Connection:

The second component is connections between ideas/concepts/facts within lessons as well as from one topic into another subject area which may seem like two completely separate topics but can actually be connected through logic reasoning skills that are taught at the same time such as math classes where students learn addition and subtraction then move on to multiplication tables before moving back towards fractions etc.

#### Complexity:

The final component I want my future students (or anyone) to remember is complexity which means teaching them how things work together by using more than one concept at a time like saying “this equation represents what happens when two objects are interacting with each other” or showing them how one thing works by looking at another example of something similar but not exactly the same so they can see the connection between what is happening in front of them and what they know already from past experiences.

The notion of memorization being the key to learning has been one of the most common ideas since ancient times, with philosophers such as Socrates and Plato expressing it. However, contemporary research suggests otherwise. A meta-analysis of 70 studies involving over 15,000 students found that rote memory alone does not lead to lasting retention or transfer to novel situations. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of memorization on student motivation and engagement.

Therefore, it is more accurate to say that successful learning involves a combination of strategies rather than solely relying on memorization. This conclusion is supported by research in cognitive psychology, which has shown that memory is not a passive process but an active one that requires attention and mental effort. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that metacognition (thinking about thinking) can enhance retention and transfer to novel situations.

To make practical recommendations based on these findings, educators should prioritize strategies such as retrieval practice (re-learning information after forgetting it), spaced learning (distributing study sessions over time), interleaving (mixing different types of topics), elaborative rehearsal (adding meaning to the material through reflection or discussion) and metacognitive monitoring. These strategies have been shown to improve retention, transfer and overall performance in students.
