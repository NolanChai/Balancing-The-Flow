Detailed Description of Respectful Men
This is one of my favorite missions in the whole game. It's not too hard, and you don't need to go out of your way to do it. I love how after Carl blows up that car at the end, he gets out, punches a guy who insulted him (by saying "Hey man" when talking to a gang member), kills 5 people, then finds and talks with his girlfriend. Then later on, she says, "Do you love me?" And he replies, "Yes."
Here's the mission:
1. The mission starts with you going to your house after completing Reuniting the Families. You enter, grab a gun from underneath the couch, and head out onto your roof to check things out. After you do this, you will see a guy in a gangster's jacket walking around on his phone with ear buds in. You can shoot him if you want (he is pretty much just there as an NPC), but it isn't necessary. If you don't kill him, he will come over and say "Hey man!" I personally prefer killing the guy before he says that so it doesn't happen again later on. You can shoot his phone while he talks to it to distract him (and if you have a silenced gun like me, then this is even more useful), but either way, when he leaves, he tells another gangster that there are two guys "looking for trouble." If they come looking, just run away and they will give up.
2. Now you're probably wondering what the gangster was talking about. This part of the mission is in the game, but I have never seen anyone mention it before. There are some guys on a street corner who keep saying "Hey man!" When you hear this for the first time, run over to them (be sure that you're not spotted by any police officers or gangsters) and shoot them all in the head. After shooting all of them, they will stop calling each other "Hey man." Now if you don't want to do it this way (I guess some people prefer not having to kill), then wait around for a bit longer until more come over and tell you that you shouldn't be there. You can run away from the police in any car, but I suggest driving one of your own cars instead of stealing one so no wanted level will come up on you later.
3. Now comes my favorite part of this mission. If you didn't kill the guy at the beginning or don't kill him if he calls you back here (if you killed his friend earlier), then after your first conversation, he will come over and say "Hey man!" When he says that, Carl will punch him in the face. If you didn't kill his friend, he will call you a f*ckin' punk for punching him. Now Carl can do what he wants with this guy at this point (he may not get anything from it, but I always like to kill everyone I come across). After you are done doing whatever you want with him, leave and then come back. This is a good way of avoiding any police trouble later on in the mission.
4. If he doesn't call you back here, or if you killed his friend at the beginning, this part will start. He will come over to your house and say "Hey man!" Carl will then kill all five gangsters who were coming after him with no problem, so you can sit back and watch them die if you want. After he kills them all, they will run away. When the mission is finished (which it should be after killing everyone), your girlfriend will come out of the house to greet Carl and you can talk to her if you like.
I hope that was helpful! I know this is a long read, but I love this mission. If you have any questions about what I said or anything else in this walkthrough, feel free to PM me (if you haven't already) and ask away. Have fun with the game everyone!
