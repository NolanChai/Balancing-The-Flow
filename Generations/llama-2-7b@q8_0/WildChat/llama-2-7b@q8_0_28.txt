In order to answer this question, one needs to read the introduction carefully and understand what it is trying to achieve. The most important part of an essay introduction is the thesis statement; which provides a road map for the rest of the essay by defining the scope of your topic. The second most important part is the background information; it provides context about your topic, helps you to provide credibility and validity in the arguments you make, as well as justifies why you are interested in this subject or field.
