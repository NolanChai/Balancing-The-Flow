Limone Piemonte, Piedmont. Limone is a town and comune in northern Italian region of Piedmont. It was called Villa Sirai when it was first settled. Limone was once an important stronghold on the way to Turin and became one of the favourite places to live for Turinese families as a weekend or summer holiday resort. The village is at 843 metres above sea level, in a beautiful mountain valley between Mount Vessiolo (1,506 m), Monte Moro (1,829 m) and the main peak of Mount Cermis (2,280 m).
Rocca Canavese is a comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont, located about 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Turin. Rocca Canavese borders the following municipalities: Castellamonte, Montaldo Torinese, Pavone Canavese, and Vaie.
Asti is a town and commune in northern Italy, in Piedmont region, capital city of province with the same name, and located about 50 km (31 mi) east of Turin along the Tanaro River. The Asti territory was inhabited by Ligurian tribes before it became Romanized from the first century BC. The town was declared a free municipality in 1277.

Driving from Pinerolo to Turin is a bad idea. Apart from the fact that it takes about two hours, you can't see anything but fog and snow when you drive at nighttime. The road signs are not always helpful either. I've been driving in Europe for many years (and lived there), so my sense of direction has gotten somewhat better than your average Joe who is only in Turin on vacations.
Still, every time I go to Italy and don't plan well, I end up taking this route. It's just too tempting: you can take the A5 motorway until Venaria Reale (the tollbooth at the highway entrance), then follow signs for "Pinerolo" and "Savona".
It seems that when it comes to roads in Italy, less is more. After Venaria Reale you don't see any road sign indicating Pinerolo or Savona. The only signs say "A5 Aosta-Savona". But that's enough: the motorway will take you straight through Turin, no stops needed.
Of course, if you look at a map, you can see that this route is actually a big circle around Pinerolo and Savona, but who cares? The idea here is to drive from one city to another without making any stops or using any other roads than the ones you're told about. If you were driving from Turin to Rome (or vice-versa) and want to avoid the toll road (A1 motorway), then this is an alternative route that you could use. But this trip should not be done if it's raining heavily or snowing, since it's a two lane road that is barely maintained.
After reaching Turin, I stopped at "Ristorante Lupetto", located on the right side of Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. The restaurant was packed with people who were having dinner there. My friend and I sat down in one of the small tables at the entrance and ordered an espresso each.
The next day, we woke up early because we had to catch a train that was leaving from Porta Nuova station. We walked for about 15 minutes and reached our destination: Ristorante Lupetto (the place I mentioned in my previous post). The restaurant is located on Via Sant'Antonio di Ranverso, which runs along the Navigli Grande river. It's a tiny street that can only be accessed from Porta Nuova station.
The entrance to the restaurant was almost hidden behind an iron gate (which had "Ristorante Lupetto" painted on it). There were no signs indicating the name of the place, so I didn't know what to expect inside. Once we went in, however, there were plenty of signs and menus everywhere: they must have been trying their best to attract customers!
We sat down at a table near one of the windows facing Via Sant'Antonio di Ranverso; my friend ordered an espresso while I had some water (since it was still early morning). Then we both went out again for another coffee break before lunch: we had some time left until then anyway, so why not?
The restaurant itself looked really nice inside too! There were lots of wooden tables and chairs around the room, which made me feel like being back home in Italy. There weren't many people eating here yet though; just a few more arrived shortly after us.

I'm looking for a place where I can rent an apartment or house. I would prefer one with some space, and maybe a garden too. I want to be somewhere that has the city, but also nature nearby. I think it is important to have some parks around you when living in a big city.
I don't mind if its not in Italy proper, because I really do love the Italian cities, and would like something outside of them.
I am looking for a place that I can afford with my current job, preferably one where rent is less than €700 (USD 850) per month, but I'm willing to pay up to €1000 (USD $1260).
Also if anyone knows of any places in Germany or Austria that would be appreciated too.
You must have been a big fan of the show 'The World's Most Expensive Cities'.
Nope, I don't know about it, but I do live in a very expensive city (it's one of Europe's most expensive cities).
It's not just me who's having problems finding an affordable place to live. I've been looking for over 2 years now and am currently living with my parents so they can help out financially, but once my lease is up in March it will be very hard to find a new place that I can actually afford.
I know you said "I would prefer one with some space, and maybe a garden too" but do you really want to live somewhere where the rent is going to cost you more than half of your salary?
That's not an issue for me because I have family who support me in my living expenses. But I know it is something that people take into consideration when looking for places, so I wanted to include this info too.
I know I said 'I don't mind if its not in Italy proper,' but I do! I really want to live somewhere with a garden and some space (not as much space as in America or Australia). Also since you mentioned the expense of living in your city, that may be why there aren't many places available for rent.
I just wanted to make sure everyone knew my situation too so that they could still answer the question if it is outside what they are willing to pay for a place.
Well I'm sorry to say this but Italy is one of the most expensive countries in Europe and it seems that it has become more so lately, especially with all the problems we have had over here. So if you want an affordable rental, then my suggestion is that you try looking for something in other parts of Europe where there are still some reasonable prices to be found (and don't forget about Germany).
Thanks for your help I do appreciate it.

I read that Turin is the darkest city of Italy, with more than 120 rainy days and less than 3.000 sunny days (from January to December).
In Italy, where I live nowadays, I saw in some places many sunshine days per year. How do you think it is in Turin?
Re:

The only thing I can think of is Milan.
That's one of the biggest cities in Europe, and has all you need...
Not so good idea to choose Italy though because it costs a lot compared with other places in Europe.

Congrats on the promotion!

I wish I had a suggestion that didn't involve moving away from Italy, but unfortunately there are no other major cities besides Rome that meet your criteria. Maybe you can find something in one of the southern regions? I know Sicilia is warm enough and has hospitals, though it doesn't really have the kind of cultural activities or educational opportunities you're looking for.
You might try checking some of Italy's less-populated areas that are off the beaten path a bit...like, say, in the Abruzzo region...or in Puglia. I know there are definitely hospitals and schools, but it would depend on what kind of activities you like to do--maybe these places wouldn't appeal to your kids or spouse if they don't have any sports teams or clubs for them? But some people really like the idea of moving out to one of Italy's smaller, rural towns. I know a few who have done that successfully...though, again, it probably doesn't have quite as much going on culturally and socially as you want.

You should definitely check out Sicily next time you are in Italy, it is just as beautiful but with more affordable prices. I love Palermo, and the whole island has such an interesting history!

I can speak Italian but prefer to live near English speaking expats as well.

Greetings! My name is David, and I am looking for a place to rent close to the city of Bari. The house must be within 15 kilometers from Bari (so not too far away). It's better if there is a bus line near by, because I will have my car, but not all day. Thanks for your help!

Burlington, Vermont: This town is located in the northwestern section of Vermont and has a population of around 9,000 people. The city was originally settled by Europeans in the early 18th century and became known for its industrial production during the latter half of that century. Today, Burlington is one of America’s best places to live if you want access to nature while still being close enough to civilization so as not to feel isolated from everything else going on around it—and there are plenty more reasons why this city might appeal to your tastes!

The gelato company is a popular choice among students for part-time jobs. In fact, it has recently been added to the list of companies that allow you to work and study. But before going into its details, let’s look at some of the pros and cons of working at this company.
There are many reasons why gelato is a good choice for students, including:
The cost is relatively low compared with other food items in your area. This means that it can be easily afforded by most college kids who need to make ends meet while studying full-time or attending classes part time.
It’s easy to find someone willing to buy from you because people love gelato! If no one wants your product then chances are something else will sell better than what you offer—which could be anything ranging from candy bars at school clubs (that’s another thing worth mentioning), etcetera…

I had a great conversation with my boss today (who is also the CEO). I am about 18 months into this job, and am still very happy here.
I was having some "imposter syndrome" moments wondering if I belong where I am - which isn't an issue at all, but I wanted to ask for my boss's opinion on it. He said that he is proud of what I have done in my time there (he didn't use those specific words) and that it took a lot of work, focus and intelligence to do the things I did.
I asked if he would be happy to promote me anytime soon or in the next few years, and his answer was "I will not do anything without your approval - but yes you are doing very well here and you will get promoted". He said that I'm the most hardworking person he has ever met.
I wanted to share this because it made my day and also as a reminder to other people to ask for feedback from their boss/manager or peers if they are unsure of how things are going, because often people don't know.
