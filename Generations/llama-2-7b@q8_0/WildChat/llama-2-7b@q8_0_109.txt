**Challenge #1**: The Chessboard Challenge

**Steps**:

1. Choose a chessboard.

2. Place the board on a flat surface and set up all of the pieces.

3. Sit down at your side of the board with your legs crossed or stretched out in front of you, whichever is most comfortable for you.

4. Take off all of your clothes except for underwear.

5. Place a towel on your lap so that no one can see anything but your head and hands from behind as you play chess.

6. Sit back in your chair with your feet up on the board if possible or place them flat against the wall behind it (no sitting directly next to someone else). If there isn’t room for both legs at once, alternate between them every few moves until each side has had time to move its pieces around a little bit first!

7. Take off your underwear and put on some comfortable pajamas or shorts (no sleeveless shirts).

8. Sit back down again with both feet flat against the wall behind it while keeping one hand on top of one leg so that nobody else can see anything but your head from behind as you play chess! If there isn’t enough room for both legs at once, alternate between them every few moves until each side has had time to move its pieces around a little bit first!!
