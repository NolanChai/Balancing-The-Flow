### Submission Requirements

The submission consists of:
- The prompt generator (python file)
  - The name should be something like “promptGenerator.py”
    * Avoid names such as “examplepromptsgenerator.py” or any other word than “PromptGenerator”.

* The image prompts you created for this challenge (4 examples).

The submission will be evaluated by the following metrics: 
- The content of the prompt generator - If the prompt generator is not structured correctly, if it uses any sort of automated or spam methods to generate prompts and if it doesn't follow the requirements.
- The quality of image prompts you created - If they are relevant to the challenge topic, they are well written and use the appropriate style.
