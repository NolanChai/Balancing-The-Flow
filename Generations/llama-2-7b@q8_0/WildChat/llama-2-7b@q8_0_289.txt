Day 1(Naruto is stranded on a desert island and loses his memory)
InuYasha had a lot of fun. He enjoyed the swimming and snorkeling. He also took some pictures of all the things that he did. The sun was going down now. InuYasha wanted to make sure that he went back home before it got too dark so he decided to go back on his boat and start to head home. He was heading off in a different direction this time.
A giant wave had swept Naruto and Freedom Planet off the beach. They were still holding onto each other tightly as they rode along with the waves for about 3 hours. Then another big wave crashed into them sending them flying through the air. It was now nighttime.
Naruto and Freedom Planet ended up on an island somewhere in Japan. They looked around and saw a lot of plants, trees and flowers. It wasn't a desert like they expected but it was nice to see something other then water and sand for once. There was also an ocean that they could swim in as well.
Freedom Planet woke up first and she felt very disoriented. She looked at Naruto sleeping next to her and thought to herself "Where are we?"
She stood up and started looking around the island. She saw a bunch of flowers, trees and plants all over the place. There were also some animals as well. It was like being in an actual forest. Then she remembered that they had been swept off their boat by a big wave earlier that day. They had ended up on this deserted island somewhere in Japan.
"What are we going to do?" Freedom Planet asked herself. She looked at Naruto sleeping next to her and then realized something "This is nice right? It's kind of like a dream."

"What are we going to do?" He asked himself. He looked at Freedom Planet sleeping next to him and thought to himself "I wonder if she remembers anything yet."
