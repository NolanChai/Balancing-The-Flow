Slendy can play Starcraft 2, he just needs to be a little bit more creative on how he does it.

*Starcraft 2 is currently available for macOS, Windows and Linux!*

> _I was doing research on the "backrooms" for my race's history, when I found out about a new portal that just opened up. I went through it to see what is there._

### What I Found:

* There are three types of creatures living in here. They all look similar, except they differ in skin color and eye shapes.
- *White Eyes* (white)
- *Brown Eyes* (brown)
- *Red Eyes* (red)
* One race has a distinctive shape to their eyes; they have two distinct holes for each eye with red circles surrounding them. This race is also known as the *Human race*.
- The humans are hostile and aggressive, always searching for other lifeforms to kill or enslave.
  - When you come into contact with a human, they will attack immediately unless they have something better to do (such as being distracted by another threat).
  - Humans also like to take captives from other races; these prisoners can be used in slave markets if they are not killed first.
* There is one species of *humanoid*, but they aren't very common here compared with the rest of The Backrooms. These creatures look similar to humans, except for having no eyes and an elongated jaw. They usually walk on two legs like we do; sometimes three or four if needed though!
- *Humans* are not aggressive unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, humans may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them. If this happens then all bets are off! The humanoids do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid* here, and it's called the *Oni*. These creatures have multiple heads, arms, and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Oni are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The oni do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
- Oni can also use magic, which makes them even more dangerous than usual. They might be able to teleport away if you try to attack one of your friends who has been captured by an Oni! This could potentially save his life depending on what happens next...
  - However this doesn't mean that he won't get hurt during the fight; after all there is still danger involved with fighting off multiple foes at once! So think twice before trying anything risky because chances are good that something bad might happen if you don't pay attention!
- Oni have a special ability called "The Call"; this allows them to summon creatures from other dimensions into ours! This means that even if someone escapes their captivity they may still be able to find help nearby since there are so many different kinds of monsters living here together now.
- The Call also works in reverse: it allows Oni users access to any place within this dimension without having actually been there before (and vice versa). This means that if someone wanted revenge against another person who had wronged them, then they could easily locate their enemy and attack them wherever necessary - even if it meant traveling thousands of miles away!
* There is one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Crab People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Crab people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The crab people do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Fish People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Fish people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The fish people do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Mantis People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Mantis people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The mantis people do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Snake People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Snake people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The snake people do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Spider People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Spider people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off! The spider people do not trade prisoners like other races do; instead their captives usually end up being used in labor or experiments after they die from whatever fate awaits them within these places (usually death).
* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Bat People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Bat people are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other). However, they may be hostile toward nonhumanoids if they come into contact with them! If this happens then all bets are off!

* There is also one species of *nonhumanoid*, called the *Zombie People*. These creatures have multiple arms and legs; sometimes more than two of each! They usually walk on all fours like other nonhumanoids do but can stand up if needed as well.
- Zombies are not hostile unless provoked by another race such as yourself (they won't attack each other
