> In the midst of the fight, Mishaali attempts to escape her rival’s clutches by performing an acrobatic jump over Kareen's shoulders with an elegant, powerful flip in mid-air that lands on her feet. The landing is jarring and Mishaali winces in pain as she quickly gets up again. She tries to attack, but Kareen is quicker and catches her by the arm with a strong grip before swinging around for an attack of her own. Mishaali frantically attempts to wiggle her free and fails, sending her opponent into a fit of anger as she throws punches at her rival's face.

The room echoes with the sounds of grunts, screams, groans, clashing blows, and broken bones. Mishaali charges Kareen and lands a series of powerful punches. Kareen dodges most of them, but one lands on her ribs. She cries out in agony.

Mishaali is undeterred; she keeps coming at Kareen with fists flying. The sound of bones shattering fills the room as Mishaali unleashes a relentless assault. 

Kareen tries to block the blows, but her body trembles under the onslaught of brutal attacks from Mishaali. She cries out in pain and frustration. Mishaali is relentless, not even pausing for a breather between strikes. Kareen tries to get back up, but she's too battered and bruised to continue.

Mishaali taunts her, "You think you can take me? Think again! I'm the one who is going to win this fight." 

Kareen looks at Mishaali with hate-filled eyes, but she knows she's outmatched and defeated. She sinks down to her knees, too exhausted to continue. Her body is a bloody mess, and she can barely breathe from the pain. 

Mishaali stands over Kareen triumphantly, "This fight is mine!"
