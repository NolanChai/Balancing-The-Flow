This recipe is for a challenge where you play chess while trying not to wet your pants. It involves learning how to control your bladder while playing chess, and can be used as a form of training or simply for fun. 

Before beginning, make sure that you are comfortable with the idea of not going to the bathroom during this challenge. 

1) Start by reading up on some basic rules of chess, so that you have an understanding of how the game is played and what your goal should be in each turn of the game. 
2) Once you know the basics, set up a game with yourself or another person who knows how to play chess. This will help familiarize yourself with the gameplay and ensure that both sides are on equal footing when playing against each other. 
3) During your turn in the game, try not to think about going to the bathroom as much as possible – instead focus on thinking strategically about where you should move next and how best to trap your opponent’s pieces while protecting yours from being captured too quickly by them! If possible keep track of time during each turn so that if anything does happen it won't distract too much from what needs to be done during that moment in the game. 
4) Once both sides have completed all moves on their turn (and no one has yet gone over time limit), try again without thinking about going to the bathroom – instead focus solely on playing well within your own mindset! Remember though: if anything does happen and you find yourself becoming too distracted by thoughts of going outside or using other facilities then simply take a break from playing chess until things settle down inside yourself once again; this will help ensure that neither party becomes frustrated unnecessarily due solely to something happening unexpectedly during their turn while they were focused solely on playing well instead of thinking about what they had planned beforehand!
5) Repeat steps 3&4 over until everyone has finished playing through all possible outcomes without needing access any outside facilities – this should take anywhere between 10-20 minutes depending upon how much time each player has left within their current turn (including any extra moves they may have made due being behind schedule). If at any point during these steps someone does indeed go overboard with how long they've stayed away from using an outside facility then simply give them one final warning before taking away all privileges including access even just once more until they finish playing through their turn without needing anything else other than what was already provided earlier in this challenge itself! 
6) Congratulations – you have now completed our very own “chess” omorashi challenge!!!!!!!!!!!
