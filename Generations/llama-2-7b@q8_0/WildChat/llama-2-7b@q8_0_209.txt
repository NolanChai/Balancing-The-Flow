The only thing I can see is the use of microfarads. I think you should use millifarads instead and add a unit conversion factor in brackets.

Yeah you are right!

I did a quick search and it doesn't look like microfarads is used in EE. All I see is "µF" (with an upper case u) which looks correct to me, so I think that's the convention.
There are various conventions for units of measure, but some conventions are more accepted than others. See this page for further information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_%28metric%29#Practical_conventions

I have also seen other conventions that are used in EE. For instance in a post here, I saw the following: "For example, 6.8 × 10⁻⁹ C is written as 6.8 fF" So there's not a definitive answer.
