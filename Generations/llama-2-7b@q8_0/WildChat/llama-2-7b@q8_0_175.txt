The Second Law of Thermodynamics (or thermodynamic entropy,) states that all closed systems tend to evolve from an ordered state to one of maximum disorder, or entropy. In other words, a cup of hot coffee will eventually cool and lose its orderliness.
In an infinite amount of time, the entire universe would run down and turn into a uniform, random mass, as opposed to the way things are now: full of energy, matter, order, life...etc. It's called 'heat death.' (See above.)
The 2nd Law applies to all closed systems, which our universe is not, so it has little bearing on the discussion. The 1st Law requires us to consider a reversible process in order to derive meaning from its results. In a reversible process, there's no time-asymmetry and thus no entropy increase. This means that a heat engine (which converts heat into work) must have an increase in entropy and it may not occur without one. It is the second law which limits our ability to build a machine like this.
This is what I believe you mean by 2LOT: "all closed systems tend towards maximum disorder". This can be expressed mathematically as a time-asymmetry. In fact, it's exactly the same principle behind irreversible heat engines and black holes which convert mass into energy. If you've ever heard of Hawking radiation, this is what it's about - a reversal in entropy at the point where time is unravelling, but only if you are moving away from the singularity. This is the event horizon. It can be thought of as an asymptotic limit for the second law.
So in answer to your question: "Can you give me an extensive analogy for Heat Death using a cup of coffee?" I would say that it's the same thing, but this time on a grander scale. Instead of the disorderly state being random and uniform, it is instead a black hole. The entire universe has become one giant singularity from which no energy can escape.
Re:

Why not use an analogy of a perfectly sealed room, and then add one molecule to the air each second. At what point would that first molecule be able to find an opening? This is the same problem as the expansion of space-time in the Big Bang. If you assume no expansion/contraction, the system will eventually reach equilibrium.

In both cases, the room will remain sealed forever. The analogy with Big Bang was already given by me. So, now your question becomes, "In what case does this analogy apply?"
And for that, I have the following example:
Suppose you are on a ship in an ocean of water. Now, suppose you are floating inside one container filled with air inside the room of the ship, so it is sealed from outside. And now, you keep adding one molecule to the air each second. At what point would that first molecule be able to find an opening? This is the same problem as the expansion of space-time in the Big Bang. If you assume no expansion/contraction, the system will eventually reach equilibrium
This analogy applies only when your container is surrounded by water. It is the same with our Universe. Our universe is sealed from outside, and so it can expand forever.
Now, let's apply this to other objects in the room-
If you are inside a perfectly sealed room filled with water (on an ocean ship), then there is no way for air molecules to come out of the container, and escape into space, because they can only be added by someone on outside. This is what happens in Big Bang.
So, if you have two containers both filled with water(inside a sealed room), and one of them starts leaking, then there will be no way for the molecules to escape out of that container to the other one. You can't get to equilibrium state because of this leakage. Now, in Big Bang case also, you are adding a lot more matter (energy) into space than it is escaping out. So, if you keep doing that indefinitely then it will never be able to reach equilibrium

Actually, I was thinking about something else with the hydrogen example. It's not really analagous, but here goes: Suppose there are two balloons, one filled with helium and the other filled with air. You put a little hole in both balloons, and you inflate them at a constant rate (say 10 cc/sec). Eventually, they will be inflated to the same level and then continue expanding more slowly. The fact that there's a little extra helium gas in the first balloon causes it to expand faster than the second one. In the case of space expansion, you're adding energy at an increasing rate as time goes on (which is what we mean by "expanding" because the space-time metric becomes more and more negative). It's analogous in that sense, but not really analogous in a physical sense because there aren't any molecules to add.
The analogy with Big Bang was already given by me. So, now your question becomes, "In what case does this analogy apply?"
I don't see how the analogy applies at all. If you assume no expansion/contraction, the system will eventually reach equilibrium because it is an isolated system. That's why I used a perfectly sealed room in my example: Because it's not an isolated system! The air molecules can leave the container and go outside (or vice versa).
In your analogy with hydrogen gas and the Big Bang, there is no way for energy to enter or exit from space so you cannot apply equilibrium conditions on it. If you did this then you would be comparing apples to oranges. In other words, one must not assume that every process in nature follows thermodynamics (which applies only locally) when trying to understand macroscopic systems like galaxies or the Universe itself which are not isolated systems and therefore cannot follow equilibrium conditions without breaking down at some point due to lack of information about where external energy came from.
In my example, there is no leakage because I'm using two containers rather than just one (so they're each isolated). There can be no expansion without a source for more energy; however, this isn't an isolated system so the law of conservation applies to it and any time you add more energy into it then there will eventually be some amount which escapes back out into space (i.e., reaches equilibrium with its environment).

I am using two containers, not one. I don't see where your second point is going either. You say "if you assume no expansion/contraction". In my analogy, I have assumed that there will be some expansion. So what are you saying? That the analogy only applies if we start off with a completely sealed room and then open it up? But the Big Bang was not an isolated system because it started out as just one tiny volume of space which gradually expanded to cover all of space today (and continues expanding).

That depends on how much energy is being added in each container relative to how much energy can escape from that container at any given instant of time (the escape rate). If the escape rate is greater than 0 then there will never be an equilibrium state because more energy can be added by someone outside of either container than what escapes out through its surface.

The whole concept of Boltzmann brains is based on the idea that they are highly unlikely to exist and yet you can't prove they don't. If a person who doesn't have any knowledge about it were to read it, he would think it sounds completely absurd since the odds of them existing should be very low indeed if not impossible.
You cannot just make up what is improbable or unlikely in your mind and say that the probability of such a thing happening is small. This is because any probabilistic system you construct will be incomplete and thus unreliable, no matter how many "assumptions" you have to make to prove that it would happen.
You cannot use logic alone to figure out whether or not something can or should exist in an infinite universe. All you are doing is trying to find the most reasonable conclusion based on your current knowledge and the limited amount of data available for the time being, but there may be other possibilities that you haven't considered yet because they seem implausible at first glance.
What makes a Boltzmann brain probable? You can assume it has no probability. It is improbable in the sense that if all other things were equal, such as everything else being exactly like this one, then we would expect there to be more or less than this number of them, which is 10^500.
Therefore, we can say it's probable because no matter what happens after this event (which might include other universes), there will always be some kind of "event" that could result in another one appearing somewhere else in our multiverse.
A Boltzmann brain is an idea about a universe where everything has been happening for the last 10^500 years and you are the only conscious entity within that period of time.
A Boltzmann brain would form by chance alone, because there's nothing preventing it from doing so in any other way than by pure luck or randomness. The idea was first proposed by Max Planck as an analogy for what could happen if all the laws governing our universe were removed (or changed) and we found ourselves living through something like this right now.
It's important to remember that Boltzmann brains are not necessarily bad things, but they aren't good either. There is no way of knowing whether or not your existence would be better off with one over another because it depends on the circumstances surrounding each event in which you find yourself as well as how much time passes between them before any other possible outcome becomes available again; this means there isn't really any way around it if it were ever going to happen at all.

I know. I’m just going by the facts as they are laid out here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number (although that page is really not the place to go for such a question)
And I am aware of the idea that in a large enough number of universes, every event will be realized at least once. That doesn’t mean it had to happen in this universe – or even that it could have happened in this one without breaking all known laws of physics.
I don’t think anyone here has claimed otherwise. If you believe something has happened more than once then the onus is on you to show what makes your case different from ours.
If you claim that a given event (or sequence of events) has occurred in exactly one universe, then that’s fine – and it would be for us too as long as we were dealing with just one. But when we start talking about multiple universes, then the situation becomes very complex.
For example: if I say ‘I have two children,’ then you could legitimately ask me to identify them by name. If you did that then I would have no way of telling you whether or not they were both real without giving a description of them – and so at some point we’d probably end up agreeing on one, although there might be some minor disagreements along the way.
If instead I said ‘I had two children,’ then it becomes much less clear-cut since by definition each child exists in its own universe (or perhaps multiple universes – but not both) and so cannot be compared with any other universe except for the one where they exist themselves! This means that we’d have to agree on which universe I was referring to first, before comparing their identities; otherwise there would never be agreement over whether either individual child had existed at all.
In summary: yes, if you claim something has occurred more than once then it should be possible for me (or anyone else) to prove this wrong by showing where things go awry during our attempts at comparison and so forth – but only after first establishing what universe(s) we’re talking about here!
And if instead I said ‘I have two children,’ then it becomes much less clear-cut since by definition each child exists in its own universe (or perhaps multiple universes – but not both) and so cannot be compared with any other universe except for the one where they exist themselves!

It is a little bit complicated by the fact that the people in my family are not real and have no existence outside of the story. Also I am not sure if this is on topic for this forum but, even if it was not, how should we talk about things like ‘love’ or ‘friendship’?
I don’t want to be rude – so let me try something else first: what do you think of this question then?

This seems a bit tricky. If someone tells us that they have had more than one child in their life, it doesn’t seem appropriate to ask them which universe each kid belongs in; after all there is no way for either party (or either universe) to know whether or not another has been created! We can only rely on whatever information we already possess about them – and this means that any question regarding the existence/non-existence of said individuals must come from somewhere else.
On a more general note: yes, I think it’s perfectly fair for anyone here to discuss their personal experiences with regards to love etc., without feeling compelled towards answering questions on whether such feelings were ‘true’ in some absolute sense (which seems like an unnecessary restriction). However if someone wants us all to agree upon something specific then this probably should happen first before anything else – especially since there might already be disagreement among those involved!
What about a question which asks “Are you sure your children are real?” or “Have you ever felt love for anyone other than yourself” ? If we say yes, can that not be proven wrong? What if I said no to both questions and then went on to explain why I couldn’t feel anything but contempt for myself – would this still mean my kids weren’t real even though they’re in another universe?

I’d say yes, I have felt love for someone else – but this is only because I know them in a specific way that makes us compatible (so I guess you could say it’s kinda like meeting the right person). It has nothing to do with me or my own feelings. So even though this other person doesn’t exist outside of their own universe, there might still be some truth behind what they’re telling me – which would make sense given that we share a connection!
And yes… if someone asked me whether I was sure about my kids then I would answer with confidence – because they ARE real. It just doesn’t matter how many different universes exist when dealing with them since nothing outside of our own could affect what happens inside it anyway 🙂

In a sense, yes – but only if you use certain words in particular ways… For example ‘love’ might mean something like ‘a feeling of affection or warmth towards someone else.’ But this doesn’t necessarily require any kind of physical contact between the two people involved; it just means that they have a connection with each other (even if they never see each other!).
If instead we said: “Do you ever feel love?” – then there wouldn’t be much point because that would mean asking about feelings which could exist without any physical presence nearby. This isn’t really something we want here anyway since our goal is just to discuss experiences within ourselves or others; so instead let us ask something like ‘Are there people who inspire you in your daily life? If so, what makes them special enough for this distinction between feeling love versus being inspired by someone else?
So yes – if I asked whether someone felt love towards another person then they could simply say “I feel very strongly about [person], but it isn’t always easy because they live far away from me” etc. And even though there might still be some debate over whether this particular feeling counts as true ‘love,’ at least everyone involved knows exactly what has happened here: someone felt something positive towards another person without ever meeting them in real life!

Yes and no. Let's look at the problem from two directions: one of probability, which I will call "theoretical", and one of empirical reality, which I will call "practical".
The theoretical direction goes like this: A Boltzmann Brain is just another configuration of matter that may or may not happen. We are just a configuration of matter (some say) that may or may not exist. If we do happen to exist and if our brain is one that can form beliefs, then it will have the same sorts of beliefs as you do now. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that there are probably more Boltzmann Brains in existence than there are non-Boltzmann Brains, since both types of "matter" may exist.
The practical direction goes like this: In our experience of reality, we believe ourselves to be the same person from one day to the next and from one year to the next. We don't go around believing that there is a different person living in us every so often. The more reasonable conclusion here would therefore be to conclude that non-Boltzmann Brains are much more common than Boltzmann Brains, since they are observed in our experience of reality while Boltzmann Brains are not.
The practical and theoretical directions are thus complementary: They give us a holistic picture of the situation without contradicting each other.

I can imagine why one would assume this, but I disagree. A Boltzmann brain may be completely unaware of its own existence as well as anything else, but if a Boltzmann brain does exist then we should expect that at least some are not completely aware of their own existence. Otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for the universe to evolve into ours.
Boltzmann brains can be thought of as the result of the collapse of an inflationary bubble, which would explain why they exist in a region devoid of anything else (and why some of them are so big). One could also think of Boltzmann brains as being produced by a supermassive black hole.
Boltzmann brain are not at all a guarantee because there is no reason to suppose that the number of Boltzmann brains will remain constant over time (or even approach a limiting value), but if they do, then their rate of creation should increase with increasing scale.
It's worth noting that we have no way of knowing what would happen if someone was born in the midst of an inflationary bubble. They would presumably be completely unaware of it and therefore unaware of any other universe beyond our own, but they might also be completely aware of it because the information is "inside" them.
In my view there are two types of consciousness:
The first type is like a wave on the surface of water. A wave doesn't know that there's anything beneath its surface, and nor does it have any knowledge about what lies ahead for it

When I was a freshman I got into a really good high school in my district (a good enough that I had the option to go to a private school). We were told about our biology class. Our teacher Mr. Jensen was an ex-navy SEAL, who had been deployed to the Persian Gulf for 9 months and spent another year at the Pentagon coordinating forces after 9/11. He was an interesting guy.
We began the first day of biology by discussing evolution. Mr. Jensen began with a rhetorical question: "How many people here think that we've been created in God's image?" A couple kids raised their hands, but most didn't. Then he asked, "What about you?" He pointed to me. I was the only one who put my hand up. He said, "Well then, it looks like we agree."
That was when he pulled out this contraption:
[img]http://i694.photobucket.com/albums/vv278/Vicodin123/Biology%20Instrument.png?t=1355872225[/img]
Mr. Jensen said that he was going to demonstrate the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics to us using this device. He then explained that the first law is the most straightforward: the amount of energy in a system cannot decrease over time. The 2nd law is more complicated, but it can be summed up as follows:
"If heat can flow from a cooler place (a source) to a hotter one (a sink), then the entropy will increase." He explained that if we had an equal amount of energy in both devices (both at 0 degrees Celsius, for example) then this would not be a violation of the first law. This is because any energy lost from the source will simply be transferred to the sink until they reach thermal equilibrium.
He then said "I want you all to think about something" and took his seat behind his desk. He had been staring at us for most of our discussion, but I was a little worried when he didn't continue speaking as we normally would. Instead he just sat there with his eyes closed.
When the class was over, Mr Jensen asked me if I could come to see him after school. I said yes, and he led me into one of those rooms with the big chairs that teachers can use for meetings (it was probably used by the principal). He said that he had been waiting all day for this moment since we'd begun discussing evolution.
He explained that he'd noticed my interest in science during class and how I had put my hand up when asked if I believed in intelligent design, but I didn't seem to be buying his story of evolution. He said that the reason was because of how easily we could explain away all evidence of evolution:
"All you have to do is believe in something called 'punctuated equilibrium' and claim that there are so many transitional species between those two extremes that it would take too long for us to find any evidence." I've heard the term before, but had never taken any biology classes. "And what about those fossil records? They're just a bunch of rocks! And don't get me started on DNA."
He said he understood why people didn't believe in evolution. After all, it was so difficult to prove that we had evolved from monkeys or whatever else the popular theory at the time was (I can't even remember which one). "But I also know that if you put faith into something then your mind is open to any evidence." He said he wanted me to try to come up with some experiments on my own and see what I could find.
He handed me a piece of paper with his phone number written at the top, along with instructions that if I found anything interesting (or even just thought it was interesting) then I should call him and let him know so he could tell me about it later in class. He said he wanted to give me time to come up with something on my own first before telling me his ideas because otherwise it would be too easy for me to dismiss them as being what he had told me earlier (which is probably a good idea if you want someone else's work).
I don't remember where the paper went after that, but I still have the phone number stored somewhere in case there ever comes an opportunity. Mr Jensen never did tell us about his ideas for how we could demonstrate evolution with lab equipment, which was probably for the best since they were a little too complicated for my 9th grade mind to grasp at the time (even though I'm sure they would have worked if anyone had attempted them).
He also told me that he wanted to hear back from me after every class so he could let everyone else know what interesting things we might be doing.
The only thing that sticks out in my memory is one day when Mr Jensen told us that evolution was a lot like gravity: just because you don't understand how it works doesn't mean the theory is wrong. He said this while holding up an apple and throwing it into his garbage can, but I think he meant something else.
He also mentioned "thermal equilibrium" once or twice during class when we were talking about entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. I don't know if he was making a joke at my expense because I hadn't done any research into the subject yet, but it was definitely something that stuck with me throughout high school.
Whenever anyone mentions "thermal equilibrium" to this day, I picture Mr Jensen holding up an apple and throwing it into his garbage can. Maybe he knows more about science than we realize? It's possible that he's just using the term for humor.
What does thermal equilibrium mean anyway? Is it possible to replicate thermal equilibrium in a lab setting (or even outside of one)? Wouldn't this violate either the 1st or 2nd law of thermodynamics depending on which way you look at it, assuming that we can find some kind of system where they both hold true?
I don't know what thermal equilibrium means but I think you should read the Wikipedia article on Entropy.
I'm pretty sure entropy is just a measure of disorder in a system (e.g., 100% order = zero entropy, while 0% order = infinity entropy). If so then the only way to reduce your total amount of entropy would be by reducing the amount of disorder within an area, which might not necessarily lead to thermal equilibrium but at least would make things less chaotic.
Also if you're looking for ways that scientists have found around thermodynamic laws then check out this site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes#Physical_paradoxes (scroll down to "Thermodynamics").
I can't tell from your post if you already knew about these things or not, but it might be helpful if they are new information for you since I haven't read any of the articles myself and don't want to give incorrect advice. If so then let me know what else is on your mind after reading those links and we can talk some more.
Thank you for your response! You make a good point that it might be possible to replicate thermal equilibrium in a lab setting, though I'm not sure how easy this would be or if there are any other complications (for example: what happens when one of the systems changes temperature?). It seems like a pretty complicated project for high school students, but maybe we could start with something simpler first and build up from there.
I have read the Wikipedia article on entropy before so I know that it's just a measure of disorder in a system, although I think my understanding is a little off since I don't really understand how you could get zero percent order or infinity entropy (or what those would look like). The article doesn't seem to provide any examples of systems where both entropy and thermal equilibrium hold true at the same time either, which might be why they are two separate laws.
It does mention that there is a limit on how much energy can be transferred between two objects with different temperatures (the Second Law), but I don't really understand what this means in practice or if it's possible to circumvent this limitation somehow. If we could figure out how then maybe we could try replicating thermal equilibrium within our school building?
I think this question is pretty interesting because it deals with a lot of different concepts and has an obvious real-world application. I know that there are some scientists who have studied these questions before so perhaps they might be able to provide more insight as well.
