I'm not sure if this is related, but the link below says that there are rumors going around of Naruto being reanimated. It also mentions about how the Hidden Leaf Village may be getting its own movie. http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/01/18/naruto-rumors-spread-that-it-could-be-reanimated-plus-movie-news-from-the-hida I'm not sure if the movie would be a new series, but it wouldn't hurt to hope for one.
Naruto could be reanimated? Well that's nice of them! They have waited too long.
I saw this on Crunchyroll and it got me so excited as well. I think they should do more movies since it has been a while since the last movie was released. I really liked the Shippuuden Movies, but I'm hoping that this new movie is not based off of fillers.
I love Naruto to death, but it can't be reanimated like Pokemon (it would need to take on more than just the manga plot for me to watch).
I feel bad if you guys didn't like the manga that much and I think it has a lot of potential. But you could always try another manga to fill in your free time. Naruto is something that will be great as long as they keep making movies, games etc.
Naruto was very entertaining at times but there were quite some draggy arcs for my taste. If it's really going to get reanimated then I hope they only do the manga parts and skip everything else (that includes fillers).
I agree with you on that. But you can never say never, right?
Yeah I would love it if it got reanimated too since I want to see what happens next in Naruto's journey but also not seeing him end up alone all by himself. I really hope they don't start off with a filler arc either. That would just be disappointing.
I'm sure Naruto won't end that way, if it is reanimated that is...
I wonder how this will turn out. It seems like everyone loves the anime but I know there are people who don't care for the manga much and vice versa with some fans who love the manga but aren't really interested in watching the anime series. Either way, I am really excited to see what comes next since we haven't gotten anything from Naruto in a while.
It's been so long since there has been any new news on this and I hope that it does get reanimated! It would be nice for me because the manga is still going but it has been quite some time since they have updated it. The last update was back in 2013 if I remember correctly.
I don't know about you guys, but I am really excited to see what comes next with Naruto. It would be nice for me too because the manga is still going and they haven't updated it since 2013 which was when I started reading it. The last update that came out was back then so this has been quite a while!
I can agree, but it's not like there hasn't been any new news on reanimating the manga series either. There is also another movie coming out soon called "Naruto Shippuden: Road to Ninja" that should be interesting as well! The last update for the manga was back in 2013 so I'm hoping they start updating it again soon because there hasn't been any news on what happens after that point.
I hope Naruto gets reanimated because I would love to see how it all ends up. It has been a while since there has been any new information about the series and with another movie coming out as well, I am really hoping that things will start picking up again!

I don't know how long it will take them to get everything figured out but hopefully we won't have too much longer of a wait for some sort of news about this series. I think it would be great if they start updating again soon because there hasn't been any new information coming out since 2013 when they last updated!
