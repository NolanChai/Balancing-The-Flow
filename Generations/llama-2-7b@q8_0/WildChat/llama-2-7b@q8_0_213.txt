This is a game of trivia. The object of the game is for each team to correctly answer a question in as few tries as possible, and the first team to get their answer correct wins that round and gets points. There are no losers in this game. There are many games on here like this already, so I thought I would post another one since they can be fun! I don’t mind if you change my questions at all….I just want the answers to be accurate. If anyone wants to make their own quiz, feel free.
