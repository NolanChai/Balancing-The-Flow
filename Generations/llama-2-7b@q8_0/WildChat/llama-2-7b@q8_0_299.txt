Water is wet. Water is also cool and refreshing on a hot summer's day, but that isn't the topic of this quiz. Water has its own unique properties that distinguish it from other substances such as air or rocks. It can be found all over planet Earth and is essential to life for animals including humans. This quiz will test your knowledge about water!

What does the prefix 'hydro' mean?
When was water first discovered?
The sun heats up water in lakes, streams and ponds so that it evaporates into the atmosphere. What is this process called?
When ice melts what happens to its volume?
It increases in size.
It decreases in size.
When water freezes it becomes......
A solid (ice).
A liquid (water).
A gas (steam).
A powder (snow).
What is the name of a body of water that connects to an ocean?
Water is a...
The water cycle occurs when....
Precipitation falls onto land.
Water evaporates from oceans and other large bodies of water, forming clouds, and eventually falling as precipitation again.
Air condenses into water droplets.
Clouds are formed by the collection of moist air particles in the atmosphere. When these particles condense (turn into tiny drops) they form clouds that we see in the sky! The more humidity there is, then more likely it will rain or snow! Water can also evaporate back up into space as well.
Why does a person float in water?
Water's buoyancy pushes him/her upwards.
Water has less density than the body of a person.
The person is floating because of gravity pulling down on his/her weight, which pushes against something denser like ice or rock (which would sink). As for why it does not affect things inside an object like boats and ships - there's no buoyancy involved with those objects!
Why do most people drown in a pool?
They have trouble swimming.
The water is too deep.
Because the person doesn't know how to float in the water, he/she will sink and die of drowning due to lack of oxygen supply (since there isn't enough time for them get out). This happens when someone goes underwater without knowing what they are doing--they may not be able to breathe correctly or keep their mouth shut if it's full.
How much water does Earth contain?
There is no way to know how much exactly, but we can estimate that there are around 1 billion cubic kilometers (about half an Olympic swimming pool) of liquid on our planet! This means there's enough for everyone living here today - including those who live in cities where every drop counts.
What percent of Earth's surface is water?
70-75% [1]
What percentage of the human body consists of water?
Between 65 and 78%.
Between 20 to 30%.
The human brain alone contains approximately 94% of our total amount, while skin tissue has less than 5% with hair being slightly higher at about 10%.
What color is water?
It can be blue or green.
It appears clear (translucent).
Water's colour depends on lighting conditions; it looks red when seen through a prism of sunlight shining onto clouds over an ocean at dawn but turns pale blue later in the day because there isn't much sunshine left!
What is the name for the process by which water is evaporated from the earth?
Evaporation (or vaporization) is the process of turning liquid into gas, as when you heat up your soup. This can happen on land or at sea--both have their own unique set of conditions that make them suitable for this particular phenomenon! It's also important because it helps regulate climate change by removing excess moisture from our atmosphere so more rain doesn't fall during hurricane season (or anytime).
What is a 'fountain'?
A fountain is an artificial source of water, such as the one you find at a park or in your backyard. They can be small or large and may also have decorative features like statues or lights that make them more appealing!
What do we call a body of water that flows into an ocean?
Water is important to humans because...
It's essential for life.
We use it for cooking, cleaning and drinking.
The Earth would be uninhabitable without water.
It helps us grow crops on farms that produce food we eat every day!
What does the word 'hydrogen' mean?
A molecule containing two atoms of hydrogen.
Water is formed by hydrogen bonding with itself to create a liquid state which can then form ice crystals in cold temperatures (below 0Â°C). This means that all liquids are made up entirely out of this substance! The more we understand how our bodies work, the better off society will be because there won't be any diseases left untreated due to lack of knowledge about them anymore--we just have no idea what causes certain illnesses yet.
What does the word 'percolate' mean?
To drip through a porous material like sand or soil and escape into another area of that material.
Percolation is an important process in water distribution systems, because it helps move clean water from its source to where people need it most--usually right inside their homes! The term has also been used as metaphor for how information flows through society (e.g., "I've been percolating on this idea all day," etc.).
What does the word 'condensation' mean?
The formation of clouds and fog from water vapor in the atmosphere.
Condensation occurs when warm moist air meets a surface that is cooler than it, such as cold nighttime temperatures or ocean water. As these molecules collide with each other they form droplets which eventually fall back down into liquid form (rain). This process happens all over Earth during different seasons depending on where you live!
What does the word 'evaporation' mean?
The change of a liquid to its gaseous state.
Evaporate means to change from solid to gas by heating, but there are other ways too! Evaporation is one way that we use heat energy; another method uses electricity instead (which can be done using electrolysis). It's also possible for some substances like alcohol or acetone--two chemicals found in many household cleaners--to evaporate into vapour without needing any external source such as sunlight/moisture etc...
What does the word 'dew point' mean?
The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor.
Dew is a thin film of water that forms on surfaces when humidity levels are high enough for condensation to occur (and then evaporation). The dew point is a measure of this "point," which can be calculated using basic physics formulas like those found in every science textbook out there today.
What does the word 'saturated' mean?
A liquid that has reached its maximum capacity for water vapor; i.e., no more solvent molecules will fit into solution with this substance because all available binding sites are filled by existing dissolved compounds within said solvent system or mixture thereof! This term is used to describe how much space something takes up--like a glass full of milk would be considered "saturated" after filling it completely (and no more) while leaving only room enough left over so we could add some more if needed but wouldn't overflow due either being too full already or having too little material left untouched inside before reaching maximum capacity again!
What does the word 'hydrophobic' mean?
Having a strong dislike for water.
In chemistry, hydrophobicity is the tendency of molecules to avoid contact with other substances that are soluble in water (i.e., hydrophilic) such as oil and grease-based products like olive oil or butter! This property arises because these materials repel each other due their different chemical structures which makes them unattractive choices when it comes time for cooking meals together at home--unless there's plenty available supply available already though so everyone can enjoy themselves fully without worry about running out before finishing eating everything else first!
What does the word 'hydrophilic' mean?
Having a strong affinity for water.
The opposite of hydrophobic, these types of molecules are attracted towards other solvents such as oils or fats because they bind them together better than other substances do! Hydrophilicity makes some substances more difficult/costly when trying cleaning tasks (like removing grease stains from clothing) while also helping us understand why certain materials don't mix well with water (e.g., oil spills).
What is the name for the process by which clouds form?
The process by which clouds form is called condensation. It happens when warm air rises and cools, causing water vapour to con

Saber: That's why I was in the bathroom. To talk to you!
Raven: So, how did you know where I would be?
Saber: Well... I got this from one of my friends who knows where all the girls go. It's not that hard, really...
Raven: (blushes) Uhhh... Thanks for being so nice and friendly with me Saber~! You know I can't be very talkative, right?
Saber: Oh, don't worry about it at all. We should get going now. My mother is worried that something bad happened to me while we were gone.
Raven: Really...? She seems like a nice lady.
Saber: Yes she does... I think you will also love her too once you meet her~! But before we do so, you should first tell me your name. (She smiles at Raven)
Raven: Uhmmm... My name is Raven~.
Saber: Okay then, let's go home and talk more about ourselves to my mother~!

I have not been diagnosed yet but I was referred to a rheumatologist because my family doctor thought it could be lupus. My rheumatologist did a biopsy and found no evidence of lupus or scleroderma. She said she is concerned with the results and thinks she should refer me to another specialist for further evaluation, which would mean more blood tests, an MRI and/or an ultrasound on my hands (I don't have any swelling but I do have stiff fingers).
What bothers me is that since the beginning, all I've heard from everyone here on this forum is that we can't be sure until we get a diagnosis. My family doctor didn't want to refer me to another specialist because she thought it was lupus and she knew how expensive those tests could be so she only did the biopsy. If I end up not having scleroderma, my insurance will most likely not cover any further testing/treatment which is why I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.
I am a little confused about what kind of doctors are best equipped to make diagnoses. My rheumatologist seemed pretty sure that there were no signs of lupus in my blood test and biopsy but she also said that scleroderma can often go undiagnosed for many years before someone finally gets a correct diagnosis so I don't know whether or not to trust her. I do have high blood pressure (and an enlarged heart) which could be caused by scleroderma, so I'm considering a referral to a cardiologist and/or endocrinologist, but again, it seems like the more people who are involved in your diagnosis process, the higher your chances of not getting the correct one.
So my question is this: what do you think? If the results from blood tests and biopsy don't show signs of scleroderma, should I trust that the specialist thinks they don't exist or should I still consider myself a possible case of SSc until there are no longer any doubts?
The truth is that we just don't know. For example:
1) A patient can have "classic" CREST (or other autoimmune disease), but if she has been on immunosuppressive therapy for years, her antibodies may be masked or low enough not to be picked up by a test.
2) On the other hand, a patient with early SSc can have very high ANA, and we think that it is reasonable to consider them a scleroderma candidate until the ANA comes down significantly (and in some cases even then).
3) The biopsy result depends on the expertise of your doctor as well as the histology specimen. My understanding from my surgeon who does lots of biopsies, is that you can have a very high probability of getting an accurate diagnosis (if there are enough samples available to do appropriate studies).
4) Other patients with advanced SSc will go for years without any definitive diagnoses because their physicians may not be aware of the latest testing/diagnostic methods and/or they don't know what they're looking for. I believe that my original rheumatologist (who was an expert in lupus and vasculitis) was fairly certain that it wasn't SSc, but he couldn't say for sure until the biopsy came back.
5) Doctors are human beings, with all of their strengths and weaknesses like us. So they can miss or misinterpret things as well!
It sounds to me like you have a good doctor who is following your case closely - maybe she would be willing to ask another expert (via e-mail) for more specific information? In other words, you may not need an additional specialist appointment just yet. But if that doesn't work out, then I hope someone else can help me understand what steps to take next...
I guess the question is: if there are signs of scleroderma but your blood tests don't show it, would this be enough for a correct diagnosis?
My rheumatologist said she couldn't give me an official answer because we're not 100% sure that I have SSc. She did say there is a high probability and that it could only mean one of two things: either the blood tests were wrong or something else happened, like damage to my kidneys from the medication for lupus.
I don't know how accurate a biopsy would be because I haven't had one yet but since she said there is no evidence of SSc in my body, it seems like either:
a) Something else is causing these symptoms and we just can't diagnose it properly or
b) There are no signs of scleroderma anywhere in my body.
She was very clear that we can't be certain without more tests but she also said we have a good chance of finding out soon enough with the MRI/ultrasound and other blood work (they want to check for things like lupus, Sjogren's and gastritis).
The most frustrating part is that I was told not to expect any answers until May but now my doctor wants me to have more tests done so we can find out what's wrong.
I guess the main thing is that I don't want to waste time or money on a specialist if I have no chance of being diagnosed correctly because it seems like there are some things that you just won't be able to figure out without a biopsy (like the involvement of my kidneys, for example).
I guess this is why I was thinking about going ahead with the MRI and/or ultrasound but maybe that's not necessary at all. If it turns out there are no signs of SSc, then we would have to accept that it's something else or that my doctor missed the diagnosis somehow.
Anyway...thanks so much for your help!

The future of work: how AI could give us all 4-day weekends
January 15th, 2021 by John Chow in Artificial Intelligence
In a world where the machines have taken over our jobs, we may only be working three days a week. While itâs possible that many of us will be unemployed because thereâll be fewer jobs, this future will also look pretty good for everyone who is employed as their work day will likely be reduced by 50% or more.
We are on the verge of something called âfull automation,â a point where machines do everything for us. AI will replace humans at every job and the human race will spend most, if not all, its time relaxing and pursuing hobbies and other enjoyable activities.
Full Automation is not that far off as robots are already doing many jobs previously performed by people. This has been happening for decades now. In 1983, there were 2 million factory workers in the US. Today there are half-a-million and half of those jobs have gone to machines.
Automation is here, itâs real, but we havenât seen any of its full potential yet. If you go back to the 1983, there was a lot more work that could be automated if only we had access to the technology and know-how we have today. We are still in the early stages of what AI can do for us.
Someday weâll have machines doing everything from cooking our meals to cleaning our houses, taking care of our kids, and even providing sexual pleasure (if you count sex robots as âmachinesâ). Once we get machines doing all these tasks for us, we will be able to do anything else we want. Weâll have the time to read books or write a book; paint a masterpiece; or invent another robot that can build more robots.
That future sounds great, right? It does, but it doesnât mean our lives will be better in some ways. Many of us are afraid of this kind of change because we know what it means for the workforce as well as society and the environment. For example, if machines do everything for us, who is going to pay taxes? Will governments survive without tax revenue? What about pollution since we wonât need cars anymore (or planes) or even electricity?
We arenât there yet but it doesnât mean we canât see a glimpse of what the future holds. Elon Musk, for example, is already talking about a four-day work week and how machines will help make that possible in our lifetime. While his ideas are just theories today, we know from experience that there wonât be any shortage of people who want to make them happen.
In the meantime, let us all hope for a world where automation leads to more leisure time for everyone and not a dystopian future ruled by robots and AI.

What about a religion where you get to go into the afterlife and live a life of eternal happiness and joy that never ends. I wouldn't be religious though but it would be nice to be able to choose what religion i was.
