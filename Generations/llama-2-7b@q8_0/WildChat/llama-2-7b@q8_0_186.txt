Comment: This is not a place to ask for homework help. What did you try so far, and why didn't it work?

Answer: There are multiple ways of doing this. Since I don't know what your PowerPoint version is, I will assume the simplest one.
\begin{itemize}
\item Open \em{Insert -> Pictures}. From there find an icon that you can click and drag to the canvas (in other words you need to be able to highlight it by clicking on it).
\item Click on the image in order to edit its properties, and then in \em{Format -> Layout -> Flow -> Left}.
\end{itemize}

Comment: yes i know how to make flow but when i am creating a slide i have to write and there is an option of bulleted list but there i dont find any way to make it as i want can you help me with that.

Answer: You might be able to use PowerPoint's built in SmartArt feature, which is located within the Insert ribbon tab.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computer resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. Cloud computing can also be divided into private, public, hybrid and community clouds.
Cloud Computing Characteristics:
The following are the five important characteristics of Cloud Computing which makes it unique in itself.
On demand self-service provisioning of cloud resources is a key feature of the cloud model. In this service model, the customers can request for resources from the cloud provider at any point of time without any prior notice or even contacting to the concerned authorities. The providers will have to provision the required computing and storage services within minutes (or seconds). This is possible because of the highly automated self-service portals, which allow users to configure and launch instances on their own.
The next important characteristic of cloud computing is the broad network access capability. It allows multiple customers to access the same infrastructure resources from anywhere in the world at any point of time using internet. They can use a web browser to log into their account and control the resources. In other words, these resources are always available and highly accessible because they are connected with the Internet.
The third feature of cloud computing is the pooling of shared resources. This characteristic helps in increasing the efficiency of utilization of computing resources by allowing multiple customers to share a common set of computing resources. All these resources can be scaled up or down based on their requirements. For instance, if one customer uses 20% CPU resources while another is using 65%, then there will be a possibility that the latter may have to wait for some time before acquiring those resources. But with cloud computing model, it is easy to share the unused portion of resources among different customers thereby increasing overall utilization and efficiency.
Fourth characteristic of cloud computing is rapid elasticity or auto-scaling capability. This means that when one customer is using 100% CPU resources while another customer requires only 5%, then they both can get equal access to the same resource without any waiting time at all because these resources are allocated as per their requirements automatically by an auto scaling software component which is built into each instance created within cloud.
The fifth characteristic of cloud computing is its metered usage model where customers pay for what they use. The providers bill their customers based on usage such that if a customer uses more than 1GB data then he has to pay extra charges but otherwise he does not have to worry about anything else except the amount paid by him according to his usage which can be tracked easily with the help of billing systems available with cloud computing providers.
Cloud Computing Service Models:
The three service models that are commonly used in the Cloud Computing landscape are Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SAAS). These models provide different levels of abstraction, allowing users to focus on their business rather than worry about infrastructure or software development.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): This model is also known as “the utility computing model”, which means that companies can purchase only what they need and pay for it based on usage instead of owning servers, network devices etc.. IaaS providers offer their customers access to a variety of resources such as servers, storage systems, networking equipment and applications.
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): This model allows users to develop applications without having any prior experience or expertise in web development technologies like Java or PHP etc.. PaaS providers offer their customers an environment where they can deploy applications easily with just a few clicks of a mouse button. The platform also provides tools for managing user accounts, security features and application hosting capabilities that allow developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with the complexities involved in setting up infrastructure or maintaining it.
Software as a Service (SaaS): This model is also known as “the Software-as-a-Service” or “SaaS”. It allows users to access software applications via the Internet without having any hardware installed locally at their end which makes them very convenient for companies who want to save money by outsourcing their IT operations.
Deployment Models of Cloud Computing:
There are three deployment models that cloud computing providers use, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The three deployment models include private, public and hybrid clouds. Private clouds provide services over a single network to a specific organization or user while public clouds allow multiple organizations or users access the same resources at once over the Internet. Hybrid clouds offer both private and public cloud solutions under one roof.
The following are some of the pros and cons associated with each deployment model:
Private Clouds are more secure than public ones because they only have restricted access to their servers; this means that there is less risk of data getting stolen or leaked out due to lack of proper security measures such as firewalls etc.. Private clouds also allow organizations/users complete control over the resources being used so they can choose what type of applications should run on them and when they need them most (which helps improve efficiency). However, one disadvantage is that private clouds require higher initial investment compared with public ones because it involves building an entire infrastructure from scratch which includes buying new hardware like servers etc..
Public Clouds allow multiple organizations/users access the same resources at once over the Internet; this means that you can save money by sharing resources instead of purchasing them individually. However, one disadvantage is that public clouds offer less security compared with private ones because anyone who wants to get into your system can do so easily because they only need an Internet connection which makes it harder for companies/individuals who want more privacy about their data being accessed by others without consent (such as government agencies). Another problem associated with public clouds is that they don’t offer complete control over what type of applications should run on them and when; this means that if a company uses one application on its server at 1 am then it cannot stop other organizations/users from using their servers at 2 am.
A hybrid cloud solution combines both public and private clouds under one roof; this means that organizations have complete control over how much data they want to share with others while still having access to shared resources if needed (such as storage space). However, this also leads to more complexity compared with other deployment models because it requires managing multiple networks at once which can be difficult for smaller companies/individuals who don’t have enough staff members available 24/7.
The cloud computing is a model in which the applications and services are delivered through remote servers and data centers over the Internet. The Cloud Computing Characteristics, Service Models, Deployment Models and Examples of IAAS, PAAS and SAAS solutions are explained in detail above with some examples to help you understand them better.
