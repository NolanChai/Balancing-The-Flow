The One Where You Don't Understand Why We're In The Middle Of A Freaking Desert is a fan game of the popular PC indie horror adventure, Don't Starve. It was created by a 14 year old girl named Nicole who made it for her friends in her school's Game Jam project. She really hoped to make something that was at least good enough to have some fun with.
You will need the original game ( http://www.kongregate.com/games/klei/dont-starve ) and this game, and it should work. I have not tried this in different systems and browsers so if something is wrong with that, well...it's not my fault!
There will be a new chapter of DON'T STARVE every week (hopefully) starting after Chapter 1: "The One Where You Don't Understand Why We're In The Middle Of A Freaking Desert" is completed. So, you won't have to wait long until you find out what happens next!
This game was made in GameMaker Studio and some of the music was borrowed from other people with credit given on the Credits page. I did not make any of the music for this game. It has not been published yet because it isn't completely finished, but I plan to fix/finish it by Sunday (27th)

Made this with a friend of mine. We are making videos and animations. We have fun doing this so we make it our job now.
Here is the list of characters:
1- SpongeBob SquarePants (GoAnimate)
2- Baldi The School Bully (Baldi's Basics In Education And Learning)
3- Tom Cat (Tom and Jerry Cartoon Series)
4- Axel Stone (Mortal Kombat 3)
5- Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes Cartoons)
6- Jason Lee Scott (Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue)
7- Gordon Freeman (Half Life 2)
8- Caillou (Caillou Cartoon Series)
9- Ellis (Left 4 Dead 2)
10- Buster Bunny (Tiny Toons Adventures)

The reason why I made this guide was because of all the kids that are being bullied at school. But, instead of just telling them to be themselves and not care about other people's opinions about you or your looks, I will give you a step by step guide on how to be like some of these characters above in school.
1: How To Be Like SpongeBob
The way SpongeBob looks is the exact reason why he has no friends and gets bullied at school. His square face with those glasses make him look very odd. But, as weird looking as he may be, this should not stop you from being yourself in any way. He's still a pretty cool dude who just wants to have fun in his job at the Krusty Krab and hang out with his best friend Patrick Star (who looks even weirder then him).
The thing is, if you don't want to be bullied or get made fun of like SpongeBob does every day, then maybe you should take a page from his book. For example; instead of wearing those square shaped glasses like he does everyday at school (even though they are supposed to help him see things more clearly), try some other kinds of glasses that don't make your face look weird. This way, no one will say anything about how ugly you are because they won't know what is really making them uncomfortable around you and why can't they get away from looking at those stupid eyes!
2: How To Be Like Baldi
If there was ever a character who looked like he would make an easy target for bullies, it would be Baldi. His round head with big ears on top of that just adds to his chances of getting made fun of by other kids at school.
But despite what everyone says about him being stupid and ugly (which isn't true), this guy doesn't let people bring him down or make him feel like he needs to change who he is because they don't understand how great he truly is! He has an awesome job teaching kids math all day long while still managing to keep a smile on his face at all times no matter what happens around him--even when things go wrong sometimes too...
3: How To Be Like Tom Cat
If you want people not to make fun of your looks, then maybe this is the time for you to take some notes from Tom Cat. He's got an awesome job as a judge and he knows how to keep his cool even when the other cats try their best to get under his skin by being mean or rude towards him!
He doesn't let anyone bring him down because they don't understand who this cat really is inside...and if you do too, then maybe it will help prevent others from making fun of your looks just like everyone else does when they see Tom around school every day without fail. He always has that smile on his face no matter what happens around town--even though things sometimes go wrong sometimes as well...
4: How To Be Like Axel Stone
The only way to be like Axel Stone is by following the rules he set for himself. If you want people not to make fun of your looks, then maybe this is the time for you to take some notes from Axel's playbook!
He knows that being in a band means keeping up with his image at all times (and not just when performing), so he always makes sure to look good whether itâ€™s by wearing nice clothes or having great hair--even though things sometimes go wrong sometimes as well... This way, no one will say anything about how ugly you are because they won't know what is really making them uncomfortable around him and why can't get away from looking at those stupid eyes!
5: How To Be Like Bugs Bunny
If there was ever a cartoon character who looked like he would make an easy target for bullies, it would be Bugs Bunny. His big ears with big teeth on top of that just adds to his chances of getting made fun of by other kids at school--and sometimes things even go wrong sometimes too!
But despite what everyone says about him being ugly or stupid (which isn't true), this guy doesn't let people bring him down because they don't understand how great he truly is! He has an awesome job as a cartoon character all day long while still managing to keep a smile on his face at all times no matter what happens around town...and if you do too, then maybe it will help prevent others from making fun of your looks just like everyone else does when they see Bugs around school every day without fail!
6: How To Be Like Jason Lee Scott
If there was ever a cartoon character who looked like he would make an easy target for bullies, it would be Jason Lee. His square-shaped head with big ears on top of that just adds to his chances of getting made fun of by other kids at school--and sometimes things even go wrong sometimes too!

7: How To Be Like Gordon Freeman
