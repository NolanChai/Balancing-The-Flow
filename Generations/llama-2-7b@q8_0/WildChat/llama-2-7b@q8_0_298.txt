[INSTRUCT]Strategies of engineering for two-dimensional materials as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide[/INSTRUCT]
Prof. Sara Gozzi
The present research is based on the development and optimization of the electrocatalytic performance of novel nanostructured Pt-based bimetallic hetero-structures for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2R), by means of computational modeling and experiments. This catalyst class has been proposed as a promising candidate to face the energy crisis due to climate change, thanks to their unique features in terms of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2R into value-added chemicals, such as syngas (CO + H2) or methanol. The research activities were focused on two main topics:
• the rational design of the catalyst geometry aiming at the maximum enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2R in alkaline media;
• the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of the designed structures in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity under operating conditions.
The novel Pt-based heterostructures were synthesized by a self-assembly approach, through the anodic oxidation of two different carbon electrodes (i.e., graphene and boron nitride) with cobalt acetate precursor at different temperatures. The optimization process of catalyst geometry was carried out by combining density functional theory (DFT) based calculations and experiments on a set of sixteen heterostructures with increasingly complex architectures. The DFT simulations were performed to assess the electronic properties of each nanostructured electrode, including the band gap, work function, density of states at Fermi level, charge transfer, ionization potentials, electron affinities and the polarization induced on each electrode by the electrical bias. These parameters were used as input in the catalytic simulations aimed to investigate the effectiveness of different geometries for CO2R in terms of mass transfer of reactants towards the catalyst surface.
Experiments were conducted using a micro-electrochemical cell, where each nanostructured electrode was assembled with an atomic layer deposition (ALD) prepared Pt counter-electrode to simulate the real situation of CO2R. The results showed that the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity were significantly enhanced for some geometries compared to those found in literature. Specifically, the highest electrocatalytic activity was achieved by the structure with a single layer of Pt atoms grown on the graphene surface (Cu-Pt@G), which can be considered as the optimal design according to our simulation results. The most promising performance was also obtained for the 2-dimensional heterostructures based on boron nitride and Pt (BN-Pt@G) and copper atoms (Cu@BN-Pt@G), which can be regarded as a prototype of a multifunctional electrocatalyst.
The activity enhancement of the novel catalysts was explained by the better accessibility to CO2R of the reactants in the vicinity of the Pt atoms, thanks to the surface roughness of the nanostructured electrodes and their enhanced geometric features as a result of the self-assembly process.
The results of this study can be considered as an innovative contribution to the development of multifunctional CO2R catalysts that could potentially have a significant impact on global warming mitigation strategies. In fact, the developed strategy to enhance electrocatalytic performance of two-dimensional materials based on Pt nanostructures is scalable and can be easily applied to different carbon-based electrodes by adjusting the synthesis conditions, such as temperature, reaction time or precursor concentration. This methodology allows to develop CO2R catalysts with an enhanced electrocatalytic performance that can contribute to overcome the energy crisis due to climate change.

The conversion of CO2 to methanol is a highly desirable reaction from the environmental point of view since it can be achieved at room temperature and pressure using abundant and inexpensive materials as electrocatalysts. Among them, 1D nanostructured transition metal oxides (either bulk or thin films) are among the most promising catalytic systems. The aim of this review is to discuss how the use of a different approach, i.e., the control and manipulation of thickness in two-dimensional materials, can be exploited to achieve high activity, stability and selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into methanol or formaldehyde.

The main goal of this project is to develop and test a new approach to the production of biobased polymeric materials from carbon dioxide. The proposed strategy is based on a novel concept of using nanoscale building blocks, obtained by breaking the larger molecules that constitute polyethylene glycols (PEGs) into their elementary parts through catalytic routes.
Nanodiscs are disk-shaped nanosheets consisting mainly of linear alkane chains, whose dimensions range from 10 to 25 nanometres in diameter and 20 nanometers in thickness (Figure 1). They can be produced by the self-assembly process using the PEGs as precursors.
This project focuses on the design of catalytic routes for the production of nanodiscs that allow them to form nanoscale building blocks from CO2 and other monomers. These will then be used as molecular bricks to assemble into polymeric materials. The obtained nanosheets can serve as precursors for the synthesis of biobased materials such as biopolymers, coatings and membranes with high performance properties.

Nanodiscs can be produced from PEGs through self-assembly processes. These are a special type of molecular assembly in which small molecules organize spontaneously and form nanosized building blocks, without the need for any external intervention. For nanodisc formation, a mixture of 10 to 25% PEG (depending on the desired final properties) is prepared in water with an excess of a surfactant that stabilizes the assemblies against dissolution and aggregation. The solution is then poured into a container and left to rest for a certain time, until nanoscale building blocks form.
This project focuses on the synthesis of catalytic routes that allow obtaining nanodiscs from PEGs in which the building blocks are made up of CO2 molecules obtained by means of selective chemistry with other monomers. The produced nanosheets can then be used as precursors to prepare biobased polymeric materials such as biopolymers, coatings and membranes with high performance properties.
The project has a transversal character since it integrates different lines of research (nanochemistry and catalysis) together with the design of advanced molecular systems that can be used in other fields of engineering.
To achieve this goal, the following objectives will be pursued:
1-Development of a strategy for the selective disruption of PEGs into building blocks using CO2 as one of the components.
2- Design of routes for the preparation of nanoscale molecular bricks made up of CO2 and other monomers in different ratios.
3- Preparation and characterization of biobased polymeric materials obtained from nanosheets based on carbon dioxide produced with the developed catalytic routes.

Nanosheets have a unique dimension, which makes them distinct from other materials. These sheets are only 1 nanometer thick and can be of any length, depending on the size of the parent material, but they can also be very large (up to several centimeters). They possess extraordinary electronic properties that make them ideal for applications in energy, medicine, or electronics. However, their large surface area, which is 10 times larger than a flat sheet made from the same material, makes them difficult to isolate and purify.
This project seeks to develop novel methods to synthesize and process high-quality nanosheets using top-down approaches, in particular by combining mechanical grinding with chemical or physical preprocessing. These new processes will be used to manufacture thin films of graphene, silicon carbide or other materials. The approach is expected to enable a significant increase in the quality and quantity of processed nanosheets, as well as to significantly reduce production costs.
The project is led by Dr. Héctor Martín-Palma at CIC energiGUNE with participation from Prof. Francisco Rodríguez-López (CSIC) and Dr. Mikael Pettersson (TU Berlin). It will be developed in collaboration between the CSIC, the Technical University of Berlin, and CIC energiGUNE’s industrial partners.
The project is funded by the EU program “Horizon 2020” through the SME instrument phase II call.
