What do you think is the most important thing to consider when planning a healthy diet? Is it to consume less fat, sugar and salt in food or eat more fresh vegetables? Or should people make sure they get enough energy from their meals? How can fitness instructors encourage clients to have a good diet?
The main emphasis on diets these days is about reducing the intake of fats, sugars and salts. However I personally believe that eating fresh vegetables is equally important, if not more so. These are naturally low in fat, salt and sugar and are essential for healthy body functioning.
I would suggest that people eat at least two servings a day (about 30g per serving). Some examples of common fruits include:
Tomato, apple and banana are high in carbohydrates which the body uses as its main source of energy, so it is essential to have some type of carb rich food each time we eat. Onions, garlic, broccoli and carrots are very good for our eyes.
We should also try to include a little protein in every meal, preferably from fish, meat or eggs as these contain important nutrients like vitamins, iron, calcium etc.. Foods containing dietary fibre are also essential such as oats and bran which help the digestion of food.
Of course it is not enough to just eat a healthy diet. Exercise should be incorporated into everyday activities. Walking upstairs instead of taking the lift, or riding a bike rather than driving, can make a significant difference to our bodies over time.

Ans:In 1985, Florida enacted a statute which allows patients the right of access to their own records. However, there are certain limitations on this right. For instance, information cannot be disclosed if it would be considered harmful or detrimental to the patient’s interests (e.g., information that could be used by the patient’s family to physically, emotionally or financially abuse him). Additionally, information can be withheld if release of the records would jeopardize a criminal investigation.
In addition, HIPAA regulations require that health care providers make reasonable efforts to provide patients with their medical records upon request. These requests may be submitted in person or in writing and must include certain information such as the patient’s name and address. A record may not be disclosed without this information.
