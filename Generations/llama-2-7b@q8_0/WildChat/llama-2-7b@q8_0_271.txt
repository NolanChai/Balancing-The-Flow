The only part that worries me is how the hell Hitler got off the island when he was shot. He must have had some kind of backup plan in place.

Yeah, I think the same, Hitler's a clever bastard but I don't know what he was planning when the war started, or even during the war, it is possible that he died and they replaced him with one of his doubles.
What do you mean? The island?

Hitler supposedly left some instructions in a safe place before the fall. If we assume this is true then there is no reason why Hitler wouldn't have left similar instructions for an escape should his situation turn dire.

Hitler was taken to a hospital in Argentina after the war, and died there of a heart attack. So what happened between him being shot on his boat and then dying in Argentina some years later? Did he escape? Did someone take his body away to be buried somewhere? Was it even actually him who died there?

I thought he died in Germany, but that's only a theory.
That could be true but I don't think so because his body was never found and there are no real proofs to confirm or deny it.
I think the same as you about his death in Argentina and some theories say that his body was transported to Chile after Argentina closed their borders, but there is also a theory that says that Hitler survived by being hidden with someone's family for years, the most credible are the ones who said he spent time in South America.
