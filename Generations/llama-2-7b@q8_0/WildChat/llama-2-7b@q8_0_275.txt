The Empire of the Known Universe is a galactic empire spanning several thousand sectors in the Milky Way. It's origins date back to the interstellar wars between the Human-dominated Earth Alliance and the Terran-dominated Galactic Council, when humanity was divided into two major groups over how to handle the alien presence they had found throughout the galaxy: those who believed in cooperation and peaceful coexistence with other cultures, and those who were afraid that these other races would exploit and destroy humans. These conflicts culminated in the Human-Terran War and the creation of two separate human empires on Earth: the United Human Government (UHG) on one side, and the Terran Empire on the other. The UHG eventually collapsed into anarchy during a period of intense xenophobia known as "The Great Rejection", while the Terran Empire expanded rapidly thanks to humanity's technological and military superiority, and soon absorbed all of the Terran-dominated sectors of the Galactic Council. By 2190, however, these two empires had begun a slow process of integration, leading to the formation of the United Earth Federation in 2198, which then became the Empire of the Known Universe in 2199 and remained so until 3457, when it split into three separate successor states. The Empire would once again form on a smaller scale in 4016 as a federation between the Terran Union and the Earth Alliance, which joined together to defend against a hostile alien invasion force. When this invasion was repelled, the two governments agreed that the Empire should remain, although it has only held power over the combined sectors of the former Galactic Council in the following centuries, leaving the other parts of the galaxy untouched.

Several thousand sectors? Do you mean the Milky Way, or some galactic cluster in a wider area?
The Milky Way Galaxy (the one with the Solar System) has about 175,000 stars and at least 2.6 quadrillion planets (and possibly up to 1 septillion). It's a rather small galaxy compared to others in its cluster; our closest neighbour is only about 3 million light-years away.
The Known Universe isn't any smaller, but it also has several orders of magnitude more stars and planets. For example the Magellanic Clouds alone have a few tens of billions stars and almost as many planets (with a little help from the Milky Way).
Earth Alliance? The Terran Empire already used that name in 2198, so it would be pretty confusing to use it again. Perhaps you mean "Terran Republic"?
I'd also recommend changing the name of the new empire that forms in 4016; I'm not sure why anyone would choose to call their nation an "empire", especially if it only has control over a fraction of one galaxy and none of its neighbours. Perhaps you could use another word such as federation?

I meant that the Milky Way Galaxy is within a cluster, not that it's itself in a cluster. If I had meant to suggest that then it would be misleading because we don't actually know what clusters look like, since there are no galaxies with similar masses around us and we can't really detect the Milky Way from outside due to it being so small relative to others.
The Empire of the Known Universe is a federation between the Terran Union (the successor state of the Terran Empire) and the Earth Alliance, which join together to defend against a hostile alien invasion force. When this invasion is repelled, the two governments agree that the Empire should remain, although it has only held power over the combined sectors of the former Galactic Council in the following centuries, leaving the other parts of the galaxy untouched.
Okay, I'll keep your suggestions in mind for when I get around to revising this article. Thanks for your input!
