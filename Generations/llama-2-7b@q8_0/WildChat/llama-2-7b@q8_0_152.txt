[/TITLE]Management approaches can be defined as methods and strategies of decision-making and problem solving in order to achieve organizational goals. There are two types of management approach, i.e., Scientific Management Approach and Bureaucratic Management Approach (Chowdhury 2014). Both the approaches are effective but some factors such as a situation or environment have a significant impact on their effectiveness. For instance, scientific management is appropriate in case when tasks require less human skill such as mechanical activities whereas bureaucratic management approach is suitable for complicated tasks and processes (Clegg, Kornberger & Pitsis 2015). Therefore, it can be said that both the approaches are appropriate in their respective situations but scientific approach is more appropriate because of its practical application in a situation.
The most appropriate approach for managers to deal with modern environment is Scientific Management Approach (SMA). The main idea behind this management approach is to improve efficiency by eliminating wastage and inefficiency (Daft, Marcic & Willard 2017). In other words, the key concept of SMA is to divide a work into separate tasks which can be completed easily with the help of technology. This approach is effective because it focuses on dividing complicated tasks into simple steps and then performing these steps one by one in order to complete the task (Hung & Wei 2016). These small steps are easy to perform for managers as compared to complicated tasks so this management approach can be considered most appropriate for today’s managers.
Scientific Management Approach is effective because it helps managers in performing their tasks with the help of technology and machinery (Chen, Chen & Chen 2014). The main benefit of using SMA is that it provides a simple and logical way to divide complex tasks into small steps so that they can be performed easily. It also reduces wastage as well as inefficiency by dividing complicated jobs into separate parts which are easier to perform (Chowdhury 2014). In addition, it helps in achieving organizational goals efficiently because managers do not need to waste time on doing complicated tasks (Daft et al. 2017). Therefore, using scientific management approach is more effective than bureaucratic management approach.
The major reason behind choosing Scientific Management Approach as most appropriate for today’s managers is its practical application in a situation. This means that SMA can be applied anywhere and in any workplace without facing any difficulties because of its simplicity (Wang & Tong 2015). In other words, this approach works well for all types of jobs such as simple or complicated ones; this is why it is more appropriate than bureaucratic management approach which has some limitations when applied to different types of tasks and situations (Daft et al. 2017). For instance, in case of a manufacturing company where most of the work involves mechanical activities then SMA would be effective because these activities do not require much human skill so they can easily be performed with the help of technology (Clegg et al. 2015).
Therefore, it can be concluded that scientific management approach is more appropriate for today’s managers because it helps them in achieving organizational goals efficiently by using technology and machinery without wasting time on complicated tasks or situations which require human skill (Wang & Tong 2015). In other words, this management approach can be used anywhere without facing any difficulties because of its simplicity so it is most appropriate for today’s managers.

[MUSIC] I'm really glad you brought that up because I think it's so important. It's about recognizing that we are not always going to be experts in every single area. And as soon as you start working with someone else, who's an expert, you want them to take the lead and tell you what they need from you. Because then you have a really great collaboration. And I think this is one of those areas that we could easily get lost in because it's so complex. And I know it's a lot for us to absorb just being students, right? So thank you again for helping me understand some of the other things that are going on and what the challenges might be as well. >> Yeah. It was my pleasure. [MUSIC]
