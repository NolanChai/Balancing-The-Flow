The following is a response to the story from my perspective as a chess player (an amateur one, to be clear). This story was written by 🐀, who is an aspiring author and writer of stories on the social network Xiaohongshu. The story itself is a piece of fiction with no real events or facts. It was originally published in Chinese under the name "谁是最强的小熊".
