1. Create an email from scratch, and create a reply template in Outlook/Thunderbird(whichever you use). The template should contain all of your contact information as well as your hours, availability, etc., so that you can copy the whole message into the outgoing mail.
2. In the subject line, include the name of the client and the purpose for writing (e.g., "Request for RFP").
3. Write a short introduction about why you are contacting them in the body of the email.
4. Include the full name and title of whoever is replying to this mail along with their contact information, so they can write back to you. 
5. After explaining the purpose for your letter/email in a brief paragraph or two, write down any additional information you think they will want to know (e.g., if it is an RFP and there are certain requirements) and ask them to let you know if there are any other details that you need to provide.
6. Then end with something like "We appreciate your time, attention, and consideration of our proposal."
