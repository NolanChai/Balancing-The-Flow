The scene from “Jane” begins with Jane sitting on a bench at the edge of school grounds as her friend Sam and their other 14 year old friend Aaron Ling approach the bench. As they walk over to the bench, Aaron starts to talk about an important announcement that everyone had to hear in the auditorium. “We’re going into the school,” said Sam.
Jane was slightly nervous and she sits up straight as her friend Sam and their other 14 year old friend Aaron Ling walk up to the bench. Aaron was tall and muscular, he had curly brown hair, a pair of square framed glasses with light coloured lenses, green eyes, his face is a little bit pale and his skin colour is slightly yellowish because he has mild jaundice (jaundice is where your skin has a yellow tinge to it), the yellow comes from the bile in your body going through your liver. “They said that all the students have to go into the school auditorium,” said Aaron as his friend Sam sat on a bench next to Jane.
As Aaron was talking about the announcement, he had to keep looking at something down his shirt. After a while of this, it finally clicked and he took off his shirt, revealing that he has a red birthmark across his stomach which is slightly raised. “Oh my god,” said Sam as she looked at Aaron’s birthmark with surprise.
Aaron’s face turned beet-red when Sam made that comment about his birthmark. “I was hoping you wouldn’t see it!” exclaimed Aaron, then he put his shirt back on and he sat down next to Jane. “Hey,” said Aaron, looking at her, “Have you ever seen my birthmark?” asked Aaron with a smile.
“Yeah,” replied Jane as she looked at the red mark across Aaron’s stomach, “it’s pretty bad.” said Jane as she sat back on the bench with a small laugh. Sam gave Jane a strange look when Aaron made that comment about her birthmark. “What do you mean by it being pretty bad?” asked Aaron, concerned because he thought his birthmark looked horrible but he didn’t know what to say in response to this so he just said nothing, then after a short pause, he changed the subject of conversation and started talking about how everyone has been looking at Julia Fairbanks since she walked through the school gates.
Julia was standing in front of the auditorium as Sam, Jane and Aaron walked up to it. “Is that the new girl?” asked Sam with a smile. “I don’t think so,” said Aaron, “she looks familiar.” Aaron has had his hair cut recently so he is looking much more handsome than usual in his freshly cut blond hair as he looked at Julia Fairbanks and she was looking back at him, they were both wearing their school uniforms.
As Aaron spoke, Jane turned to look at Julia too. She recognised her from somewhere but she didn’t know where, then after a few seconds of this, it finally clicked and she knew where she had seen her before, Julia Fairbanks was on the TV advertisement for “Fairbanks”! In that advertisement, there was an old man wearing a white shirt holding onto a shopping bag with one hand while he held onto his daughter’s arm with another. He looked like someone who just walked out of a hospital because he was wearing hospital socks which were made from cotton, the socks had two parallel lines on each side to make them easier for doctors and nurses to identify what floor they are on, but even though these lines helped them to find their way around the hospital, it also showed that this man is a patient at some point. In the advertisement, Julia was walking alongside her father down a corridor with a set of stairs to their right and a large window in front of them, there were four other people on this same level who were walking past Julia’s family towards the left, it was difficult for all five of those people to walk side-by-side because they didn’t know what floor they were on so that meant they had to keep switching places with each other until one person made their way up onto a different level.
Julia and her father walked into another room which is where the advertisement stopped, then after Julia’s family entered this new room, Aaron Ling started talking about how she looks just like her dad! “I know who you are!” exclaimed Aaron with excitement as he ran up to her and gave her a high five. Then while Aaron was giving her a high-five, Sam noticed something strange about Julia’s face, it seemed that there is something wrong with it…but what could it be?
Julia’s eyes were wide open and she had an expression of shock on her face as everyone in the school auditorium stared at her. “We’re here to welcome you!” said Sam as she walked up onto a podium that was set up against one wall near where Julia stood with her father, “I hope that you will have a great time here.”
As Sam was talking about how they were there to make sure that all of the new students would enjoy themselves at school, Jane turned to look back at Aaron and Julia. She felt a little bit guilty for saying that she recognised Julia from something before when she really didn’t know where she had seen her from, but now it finally clicked as soon as Sam started speaking in front of everyone so she quickly apologized by telling him “Sorry!”
“What was that?” asked Aaron with confusion. Jane looked at Aaron and she said “I don’t think we should be standing up there right now.” Aaron looked at her puzzled and he replied “Why not? What is it?” but before he could get any further, the auditorium went dark for a few seconds as someone flicked off the lights. When the darkness disappeared and the school returned to being fully lit again, all of the students who were standing on stage turned back around to look at Julia who had an expression of shock across her face once more due to everyone staring at her after what just happened with Sam saying that she recognized her from something before.
“I’m sorry if I sounded weird,” said Jane as Aaron, Sam and Julia were walking away from the school auditorium and heading towards their next class. “It was nothing.” replied Aaron with a smile before he looked back at his friend Sam who was still standing near him waiting for them to catch up.
Aaron’s face turned beet-red again as they walked through some corridors until finally reaching their next classroom which is where the scene from “Jane” ends, but there is more to come because this episode isn’t finished yet!
