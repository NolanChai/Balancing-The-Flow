I will give a short response to you after your video.

1. Look around to see if a teacher is present. If they are not, act like nothing's happening!
2. Walk down the hall and find a classroom. You can walk straight through the walls with no problem.
3. Enter the classroom you have chosen. The only classrooms available to you are Math, Science, English, History, and Art. Each of these classes has its own teacher: 
- Math is taught by Mr. Rat. He doesn't really teach much math though; instead he spends most of his time reading comic books in the corner while students cheat on tests.
- Science is taught by a wacky, mad scientist named Professor Monkey. He tends to experiment on himself with disastrous results (he has turned his face into an octopus).
- English is taught by a beautiful woman named Mrs. Snail. She's always reading romance novels and doesn't pay attention to the students.
- History is taught by a grumpy old man named Professor Croc. He usually ignores what he teaches, as it's really just a bunch of facts that are unimportant in his mind.
- Art is taught by an obnoxious boy named Mr. Skunk. He's always bragging about how cool he is and shows no respect to the students.
4. Now for the important part: cheating! There are a number of ways you can cheat on tests in each class. They differ from teacher to teacher, so choose accordingly. 
- Math: Ask your friend to write down the answers to the test while he/she is taking it. This method only works if both of you know what's going to be on the test; otherwise, it doesn't matter how hard you study!
- Science: Try to steal some chemicals from Professor Monkey. If you do so before he notices, then you'll pass the class with flying colors!
- English: Talk to Mrs. Snail about her love life and tell her that your friend is single. This will help keep her attention focused on what she wants to hear rather than what you want her to teach.
- History: Find Professor Croc's prized possession, the Nintendo Entertainment System. This may take some time because he keeps it hidden in his office, but once you get a hold of it, just plug it into an outlet near him and play a game for as long as possible. You can even use the D-pad to move around onscreen if necessary!
- Art: Cheat off of Mr. Skunk's paper while he is taking notes during class or ask him what grade you need in order for him not to fail you (usually it's an A). Then just do whatever it takes so that you get those grades, and voila - instant passing!

1. Be like Spongebob:
Do you need to say more? You already know what to do, right? Just act and talk like a sponge bob square pants character!

2. Be like Baldi's basics:
Be very curious about the world around you, ask questions about every single thing, especially if it is an object or something you don't know yet.

3. Be like Tom Cat (TUFFCAT):
Well, talk and act as a cat would! I guess this means that if your in class, you should be scratching the chair and walk around. You can also meow or hiss at people. You could even pee on them while they aren't looking.

4. Be like Axel Stone (Street Fighter II):
Well, talk to everybody! If you can do it, try talking to each of the students in class and tell them that their so cool, but make sure not to be to loud, or else the teacher will get mad at you. You can even dance if your in a party. But don't forget to wear a red and blue suit!

5. Be like Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes):
Be very hyperactive! Always walk around in class with a rabbit ear on. Also, be nice to everybody!

6. Be like Jason Lee Scott (Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers):
Talk about everything! Like your favorite foods, the weather and other stuff. If you can't think of something else, then just say "Hi" or "Hey". Also, be very active in class!

7. Be like Gordon Freeman (Half-Life 2):
Always keep a helmet on your head, so that when somebody throws things at you, it won't hurt as much, and if they do hit you, you can always just throw the objects back at them. You should also be very good at solving puzzles!

8. Be like Caillou (GoAnimate):
Well, you could be like him by acting all cute or you could pretend to be sick in class and say that your mom will come pick you up, but she's actually not coming for a long time. If you can do it, make sure to bring some snacks with you so that everyone else gets jealous of you.

9. Be like Ellis (Left 4 Dead):
You could be like him by doing the following:
-Walk around in class as if your having a panic attack or something
-Tell people how much you hate everybody and that they should kill themselves, but do not do it in real life!
-Always tell people that their a zombie.
-If there's nobody to talk to in class, then just scream at everyone and hope someone will talk to you.
10. Be like Buster Bunny (Tiny Toon Adventures):
Well, you can be like him by talking about anything with anybody, even if they don't care! You could also act all cool and tell them that you know a lot of things and you have a huge brain.
