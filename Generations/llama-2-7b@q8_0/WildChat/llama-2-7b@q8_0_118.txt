MC: (holding Sayori’s hand) “What is it?”

Sayori: “That was Sachiko moving!”

(I look down and see my daughter, Sayori, wiggling around in her belly.)

Me: “Wow…she can feel us already?! That’s amazing.” (I start to hold on tighter)

Sayori: “Yes, MC. I think she wanted me to tell you that she’ll be coming soon!”

Me: “That sounds great, Sayori. We’ll welcome Sachiko into our hearts with open arms.”

Sayori: “Thanks, MC.” (I feel Sayori’s hand squeeze mine)
