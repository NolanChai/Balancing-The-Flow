I want you to create fiction TV series reviews. This unusual mystery TV series with strong romantic comedy elements focuses on beautiful, elegant, independent, confident, always calm and collected, but very private and solitary young woman Celestine who is adjusting to being a wheelchair-bound high-level paraplegic, paralyzed from her chest down, while undergoing rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center. As she adjusts to her condition, Celestine also starts noticing strange and suspicious things, trying to figure them out. She also takes on the corruption withing the healthcare system and covertly investigates her fellow patients and staff. Meanwhile, Celestine also experiences romantic entanglements with patients and doctors alike. Other prominent characters include Sophia, a quadriplegic woman several years younger than Celestine, developing a bit of hero worship as her, multiple amputee Karen who is a former military nurse, shell-shocked by her experience, and Matilda who is remarkably similar to Celestine, even having the same disability, but way more fiery and aggressive. Matilda and Karen are notable for bickering and even having physical fights due to radically different political ideology, providing both poignant conflict and comic relief. The series somewhat resembles various TV series about high schools and private schools, but with adults and without boring lessons, a fact which the characters themselves call out and comment on. Write long, detailed, original and interesting mixed IMDB review of this series, highlighting its good and bad elements
