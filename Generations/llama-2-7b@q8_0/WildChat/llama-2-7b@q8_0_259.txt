[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy][B]EPISODE: THE CURSE OF BENJAMIN JENKS (Season 3)[/B][/COLOR][/FONT]
[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy][B]SCENE: The Gutter’s basement, which has been converted into a workshop to make weapons and such.[/B][/COLOR][/FONT]
[COLOR=#663399]Cutscene: Raph is working on a table saw, while Mikey works on an assembly line that’s making ammo. Zack is on a computer, looking for more information on Benjamin Jenks and the history of him as an infamous thief who was executed in 1847.[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#663399][FONT=Times New Roman]Raph: (Murmurs) “Got it. Now, if we can get the other three to do their parts of the script.”
Zack: [Mumbles and shrugs his shoulders as he scrolls down a website.]
[COLOR=#663399]Cutscene: Donnie is sitting on an old chair looking through a microscope. He turns around, looking at Raph and Zack.[/COLOR]
Donnie: (Looking over the microscope) “Well? Do you guys need some help?”
[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy]Mikey: (Looks up from his work. He is wearing a brown wig, and a mustache.) “Sorry fellas. I’m in character.” Mikey gives a bow and goes back to working on the assembly line.[/COLOR][/FONT]
[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy]Raph: (He is wearing a cowboy outfit, hat, boots, etc.) “Huh? What part are you supposed to be?”
Donnie: (He is wearing a doctor’s coat.) “You guys want to know how I do it? It’s quite simple. A good script and a lot of acting talent.”[/COLOR][/FONT]
Raph: “Alright. Let me get this straight. The script for your part is on that table over there, and your character is…” (Points to the wall with the picture.) “That guy?” (Gestures to the photo of Ben Jenks) “That guy?”
Donnie: “Exactly.” Donnie starts to walk away.[/COLOR]
[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy]Raph: (Screams) “DONNIE! DONNIE!” Donnie stops in his tracks. Raph walks up to Donnie and smacks him on the shoulder.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Raph: “Don’t you see it? It’s easy, just like I said.” (Pounds fist into palm.) “Okay.” (Stomps back over to Mikey) “Alright. That guy is your character too. You can use him for practice if you want.”
Mikey: “I don’t need no practice! My lines are memorized!”
[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=navy]Raph: (Points to Donnie.) “Then why won’t he do his?”
Zack: (Stands up from the computer, rubbing his neck) “I don’t know.” Zack walks over and picks up the script on the table. “It doesn’t have anything that can help us.” He looks through it again.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Zack: (Looking at Raph, Mikey, Donnie) “You guys are missing something important.”
Mikey: [Crosses his arms and folds his legs.] “Huh? Like what?”
Zack: [Reads from the script.] “‘The Cursed Talisman. What is it? How does one obtain this rare trinket?'” (Zack puts the script down on the table.) “It’s a curse.” Zack walks over to where Raph and Mikey are standing.[/COLOR]
Raph: [Crosses his arms and folds his legs.] “We knew that. It curses you, but we can fix that.” He picks up the script and starts to read.[/COLOR][/FONT]
[COLOR=#663399]Zack: (Reading from the script.) ‘I have heard tales of the curse for decades now. This is why I was drawn to it.’ Zack looks at Donnie, who is looking through his microscope.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Donnie: [Still reading.] “‘I sought to possess this talisman not so that I may be cursed but rather that my curse will serve me in life. You see the world as it is, a world of greed and hunger for power.’ Zack walks over to Raph and Mikey.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Zack: [Reading.] “‘This talisman is meant to be possessed by one who will use it to seek the ultimate power. The curse of this talisman has been passed down through generations, always in search of its rightful owner.’ Zack walks over to Mikey.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Zack: [Reading.] “‘It is time that I take what is mine and seek out the one who will be blessed with this talisman. The curse does not matter to me; it serves as a reminder of how far I’ve come in my quest for power.’ Zack walks over to Donnie.[/COLOR][/FONT]
[COLOR=#663399]Donnie: (Reading.) “‘This talisman has been passed down through generations. Now it is mine!’ Zack picks up the script and looks at Raph and Mikey.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Raph: [Crosses his arms and folds his legs.] “Look.” (Picks up the script and hands it to Donnie.) He turns around. “This guy’s talking about himself, but he’s also talking about someone else who is seeking this talisman for power.”
Raph: [Reading from the script.] ‘I will be blessed with great power, that which others could only dream of.’
[Zack and Mikey are staring at Donnie. He turns around and hands the script back to Raph. Donnie looks at his microscope again.] “‘I shall become more than just a man, I shall be all men!’”
Raph: (Reading from the script.) “I will be blessed with great power. That which others could only dream of.” [Looks up and stares into Mikey’s eyes]
Mikey: [Gives an awkward smile.] “Uh… thanks for helping us out, Donnie. We got it from here!”[/COLOR][/FONT]
Donnie: (Crosses his arms and folds his legs.) “It’s my pleasure.” Donnie turns around and walks back to his microscope.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Raph: (Turning to Mikey) “You got that?” (Looks at Zack) “Right, Mikey. You can stop doing your part of the script now.”[/COLOR][/FONT]
Zack: [Walks over and picks up a book.] “This is what we need to get rid of this curse.” He looks through it, then turns around.[/COLOR][/FONT]
Mikey: (Stops working on the assembly line) “What? You guys gotta help me out here. I don’t know any of these curses or spells!”[/COLOR][/FONT]
