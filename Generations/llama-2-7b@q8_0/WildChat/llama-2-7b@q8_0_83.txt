- A dark alley with many strange things coming out of the buildings and walls. It feels like you can't go straight without getting lost in all of these streets. There is a smell that comes from somewhere and makes your skin crawl.
- A long street with large houses. The first one is covered in ivy, the second one has a broken window which looks into the living room, where there are no people. There's a door on the right side of the house. It's locked but you can see that it's been used recently.
- A street with many shops and restaurants. Some of them look old and run down while others look brand new. The smell of food coming from every direction makes your stomach growl. You wonder what kind of cuisine they sell in this city?
- There are trees everywhere on this street; some of them have branches reaching out into the road or onto buildings nearby! You feel like you're being watched as you walk down it by someone hiding behind one of these branches...

The following is an excerpt from [this](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/07/what-went-wrong-in-istanbul) article which describes what went wrong in Istanbul and how it became the way it is today:
> At the beginning of last century, Turkey was one of the most advanced societies on earth. Its capital – Istanbul – was a city where many new ideas from the West were being introduced. By 1950, however, the population had nearly halved and it has declined further since then.
> The decline began with an urban planning disaster that decimated neighbourhoods on the European side of the city to make way for a grand boulevard that was never completed: the “Sixteenth Avenue”, later known as Atatürk Boulevard, is today one of Istanbul’s most notorious traffic hotspots.
> It led to the construction in the 1970s and 80s of more highways which destroyed residential areas on the Asian side, including a large swath of historical buildings in Üsküdar.
> The city’s population grew faster than its transport network could keep pace with it; this was exacerbated by an increasingly car-centric lifestyle and an obsession with motor vehicles which led to many Turkish cities becoming more and more congested.
### Comment:
The history of Istanbul is a sad one, it started off as one of the greatest cities in the world but has now turned into one of the most congested places on Earth. The main reason for this decline is that their urban planning was never good enough to keep up with population growth and it led to massive traffic problems and overcrowding in many parts of Istanbul today.

- The Church was an institution with the power to enforce morals and social order; it also had control over education and literacy and therefore, access to knowledge. The Church influenced social norms and public values, and promoted the spread of Christianity. 

- The guilds were economic institutions that regulated production processes within a craft or trade, and they established standards for the quality of goods produced by their members; the guilds had also an important political role in medieval cities, and were often involved in conflicts with other social groups.

- The nobility was made up of landowners who held power and influence through their ownership of land and property; nobles were also involved in military activities, such as fighting for control over lands or serving as knights. 

- The city council was the central authority of medieval cities that managed public affairs, such as organizing markets, collecting taxes, maintaining law and order etc.; it was often made up of members of the nobility and/or wealthy merchants.

- The merchant class was made up of business owners who traded goods internationally to make profits; merchants held power through their wealth and influence on trade networks, but were not usually part of political decision-making processes like other social groups mentioned above.
