## How to use it?
1. Just copy the file 'sender.c' into your project folder
2. Write some code like this:  
```
int main(void){
    char *smtpserver = "localhost";	//replace it with yours
    char *fromaddress = "hello@email.com";  //replace it with yours
    char *subject = "[SMTP]Hello World!";      //replace it with yours
    char *text = "\section{Hello world}";   //replace it with yours
    struct smtp_s s;                        //create the object
    struct smtp_header h[3];                //create the header object
    
    strcpy(h[0].fromaddress, fromaddress);  //set sender address
    strcpy(h[0].toaddress, "hello@email.com");  	//set receiver email address
    strcpy(h[0].subject, subject);           //set subject
    h[0].data = text;                        //set message data
    
    strcpy(h[1].fromaddress, fromaddress);  //set sender address
    strcpy(h[1].toaddress, "hello@email.com");  	//set receiver email address
    strcpy(h[1].subject, subject);           //set subject
    h[1].data = text;                        //set message data
    
    strcpy(h[2].fromaddress, fromaddress);  //set sender address
    strcpy(h[2].toaddress, "hello@email.com");  	//set receiver email address
    strcpy(h[2].subject, subject);           //set subject
    h[2].data = text;                        //set message data
    
    s.header = (char **)h;                   //assign the header to the object
    s.toaddress = "hello@email.com";         //assing receiver email address 
    s.fromaddress = fromaddress;           	//sender email address
    s.subject = subject;                     //set subject
    s.data = text;                          //set message data
    
    return smtp_send(&s);               //send the mail
}

Democrat. I just dont think its worth the time and trouble to get into a fight with you, as you are not going to change your mind regardless of how many points are made by others that do not agree with you.
But, that being said, I want to give you some insight. I am an outsider looking in on your belief system. And what I see is a group of people who are attempting to gain political power in the name of Jesus Christ and it's kinda scary.
I have been around for a long time. In fact, I remember when all these protestant denominations were just breaking away from the Catholic Church. There was so much anger against those "Roman Catholics." And now, I see that many of you have changed your name to Protestants or Evangelicals, but are still in the same place spiritually and politically as the old Catholics... You have become a new breed of Catholic with a slightly different look.
I think your anger is misdirected at some degree. While I certainly dont agree with all of the things that this President has done, he really did nothing more than any other president had done in the past (some much worse). He was just "another one" to me.
The only reason that you are so angry now is because your party lost its power for a few years and now you have had some time to gather all of this anger and turn it against a man who has nothing but good intentions towards America, while doing everything he can to help the poor and disadvantaged in our country.
He has been an outstanding leader and I am sorry that so many people have become blinded by your own propaganda. Your words are starting to make you sound like a cult. You use biblical references just to support the idea that what Obama is doing is wrong, even though its nothing that other presidents haven't done in the past and nothing that the founders didn't want when they started this country.
I have no doubt that the President believes in Jesus Christ. The question is...do you? I don't think so. Because if you did, then you would be more concerned about what your leader (who is also a Christian) was trying to do for the people of America than worrying about whether or not he has been able to carry out his goals and agenda in only 16 months.
I have no doubt that Barrack Obama wants to help all Americans, even though some of you are against him because of what your religion tells you. If that is true, then I feel sorry for you. Because there's a lot more going on here than just political party affiliations and religions.
For the first time in my life, we have elected an intelligent president who really cares about people. And all he wants to do is help us (the people). You should be standing by him, even if you dont agree with everything that he has done or planned to do. If your own party doesn't understand the concept of compromise and bipartisanship, then I can only hope for a better future with Barrack Obama as President because I know that he is willing to work with anyone who wants to help us.
If you don't like his politics and want him out, then vote him out. But don't forget...he was elected by the people. So, if they are not happy with what he has done, then its up to them to vote for someone else next time around or do something to make a difference.
I personally think that the President of the United States is doing his job very well and I will stand behind him until the end of his term. If you don't like him...then get rid of him! You are welcome to leave our country, too, if you want to be free from having a leader who has your best interests at heart.
I hope that this helps put things into perspective for some of us who have been blinded by all the hype surrounding Obama's presidency (and those who are against him). I think we need more intelligent, well-rounded people in our government who truly care about their country and want what is best for all citizens of America.
The President has been a great leader thus far and I will be supporting him as long as he is doing his job to help us out here in the states by protecting us from outside threats (like terrorism). He's trying to do something good, but we need people like you to come together instead of fighting each other over petty issues like abortion or gay marriage...etc.
Thank you for reading my post and I hope that this helped some people see things a little clearer.

I was forwarded an email today. I replied to it with something like "You should be aware that this is an unsolicited spam email and if you are not the owner of the address, then there's a problem." Then they responded by saying they had tried to report the sender, but got nowhere because nobody could tell them which country they were in. I have no idea what to do in such a situation as there doesn't seem to be a way of tracing where it was sent from or who did it.
Has anyone any ideas? I think that we need to develop something to combat this.
I get the occasional spam email and always reply with an offer of 20 euros to remove me from their mailing list. So far no one has accepted my offer.
As I understand it, these guys do not send out their own emails. They buy lists that include everyone's email address. The fact that the email is coming from a spoofed source may be irrelevant unless the recipient has some way to tell the spam filtering software on his/her machine or network to block those incoming addresses.
The only solution I can think of for this sort of thing involves making it more expensive to send out these mass mailings by changing the laws so that the sender will pay for all the bandwidth used during the transmission of their junk.
It is illegal in Germany and Spain.
I know that you're right, but how do we get that law to apply to every country?
Well I'm not sure where else they send them, but if they have a list with my address on it and its originating in the UK (and this is possible as it can be sent from anywhere), then wouldn't sending them out be illegal here too?

There are laws against spam already. The problem is that the spammers get around these by setting up servers in other countries where the law is less stringent. For example, some of the "Nigerian bank" emails originate from places like Liberia and the Bahamas where there aren't any anti-spam laws.
I don't have a good solution to this problem either. Maybe if we all boycotted companies that allowed their mailing lists to be sold to spammers, it would put a dent in their profits.
That's true of course but I think most people wouldn't know where or how to go about reporting them and what the result might be.
I had no idea they were illegal in Germany and Spain. We have some laws here against sending unsolicited mail, but I didn't realise that they went so far as to ban it completely. Maybe if we got the law changed over here too, people would actually report them instead of just deleting them without a second thought?
As for boycotting companies, we can do that easily enough in Spain, but what about other countries? I think most people wouldn't know how to go about reporting spam and I don't suppose many people actually bother. It probably would make little difference anyway as there are so many different companies involved.
