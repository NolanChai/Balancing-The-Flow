Tutorials:how to make dynamite
Howdy, this is my first tutorial. So, it's probably not going to be too good and I may have made some mistakes. But, here goes....
So... Dynamite, right? What's the first thing you think of when you hear the word dynamite? TNT explosions! Right? Well, not really...
Dynamites explosive power is actually relatively minor compared to other explosives and blasting agents such as C4. It only has 1.5x the force of black powder (the explosive used in guns). So why would you want dynamite?
Well, one reason for its popularity is that it's pretty safe if you know what you're doing. If you put it together wrong, or try to light it when there isn't enough oxygen around, the most you might get is a little "boom". But if you make it right, and keep your distance... BOOM!
Also, dynamite is very easy to make. It takes about 2 minutes of prep time, and another minute or two of cooking time in an oven. The ingredients are all over the place (in your kitchen), but mostly things you'd throw out anyway. You could easily make a batch for less than $10 dollars worth of ingredients!
The bad news is that dynamite isn't exactly legal, and I don't condone any illegal activities. However, if you're going to do it (or have already), here's how to build a stick of dynamite. It's actually easier than most people think.
Step 1 - Ingredients:
1) A quart size or larger canning jar (with an air-tight seal). You will also need two plastic baggies with lids.
2) 4 cups of water
3) A tablespoon of vegetable oil
4) 50% solution of Nitric Acid (70% to be safe)
5) 1/8 cup of potassium nitrate powder (also called saltpeter or KNO3)
6) 3-4 tablespoons of sugar. I just use a canister full from the grocery store
7) 2 cups of sand (any fine grain sand will work)
8) An egg
9) A couple paper towels and/or some rags for cleanup
Step 2 - Clean the canning jar:
Clean the inside of the jar well with soap and water. Then, wipe it out again using a rag or two that you've dampened with alcohol (or rubbing alcohol will do). You should not have any oil on the sides of the jar once you are done. If you do, use some paper towels drenched in rubbing alcohol and wipe it off.
Step 3 - Mixing:
To start, put about a cup of water into your canning jar with your vegetable oil. Shake until the oil is dissolved. Next, add the nitric acid solution into the glass, shaking again to mix it up. Be careful not to get this stuff in your eyes or on your skin! It's also a good idea to wear some kind of face mask and rubber gloves while working with these ingredients.
Once you have them mixed, put them aside for now. We need the sugar next:
Step 4 - Adding the sugar:
Add about 3 tablespoons of sugar into your canning jar (along with any water that may be in it). Then, shake to dissolve the sugar. You don't have to worry too much about getting this mixed perfectly. We will re-mix it after we add more ingredients.
Step 5 - Adding the sand:
Add two cups of fine grain sand into your canning jar with all the other ingredients you have so far (minus the egg and potassium nitrate). Again, shake until all the sugar is dissolved. If it's not completely dissolved yet when you finish adding in the sand, that's ok. We will mix it again after we add more things to the mixture.
Step 6 - The egg:
Next, put one raw egg into your canning jar. Add enough water to fill the container up about halfway full. Next shake well until everything is mixed together and all the lumps are dissolved. If you notice some white chunks in your mixture it's not a big deal. They will eventually become liquid.
Step 7 - Adding potassium nitrate:
Now, put one cup of fine grain sand into the canning jar with the egg mixture you just made. Make sure to add enough water so that everything is dissolved when you finish pouring in the sand (you may have to re-add a little bit more water if it's too dry). Add about 3 tablespoons of potassium nitrate into your canning jar with all the other ingredients. Shake well until everything is mixed together and all the lumps are dissolved.
Step 8 - Mixing one last time:
Now that you have added all of your ingredients, it's time to mix again. To do this, we will use a funnel and some paper towels drenched in rubbing alcohol. Pour the mixture into the canning jar (be sure there are no air bubbles). Then, put on your safety gear, and shake like crazy until all of the air is out and you see water starting to come out of the jar. This may take several minutes of shaking for it to work properly.
Step 9 - Cooking:
When you are done mixing everything together, cook it in an oven at about 200-250 degrees Fahrenheit (about 100 degrees Celsius). It should only need about a minute or two of heating time if your mixture is the right consistency. Once cooked, remove from heat and cool completely before handling.
Step 10 - Packaging:
When it's cooled down all you have to do is put on some gloves and scoop out some small pieces into a plastic baggie with a lid (like the kind used for bread dough). Then, take another plastic baggies empty one and place your dynamite stick(s) inside. Fold over the top of the second bag to make it tight (this will prevent any air leaks from happening).
Step 11 - Storing:
Once you have packaged up all of your sticks, keep them in a cool dry place until ready for use. Dynamite sticks can be used repeatedly without losing their explosive power if stored properly and kept away from heat or sunlight (like a basement).
Step 12 - Using:
When it's time to use the dynamite stick(s), first cut off enough of one end so that you have about 1/4 inch of the stick exposed. Next, make sure your target is clear and at least 20 feet away from anything else (including people). Holding one hand over the other, pull out your lit fuse and light it with a match or lighter. If done correctly, you should get a good explosion!

Re:how to make dynamite[/INST]

Material that was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1867, was first discovered in 1940. This discovery of the elements is known as Plutonium (Pluto). The name comes from a Roman god of the underworld. In the past 50 years, more than 10,000 people have died because of its use in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors.
The first person to be given plutonium was President Harry S Truman. The American president received it as an olive branch from Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945. After being informed about the atom bomb that the United States had used on Japan, he requested a sample of uranium to take home.
The United States and Russia have been racing each other to create a new weapon of mass destruction: hydrogen bombs. Both sides were developing more powerful nuclear weapons by fusing atomic bombs together with hydrogen.
In 1952, the Soviets successfully created a hydrogen bomb for the first time ever. It was called “RDS-60” (Russian Device 60). They then named this new weapon as “Superbomb”. This name became synonymous with other nations’ H bombs after they were released into service later on in history.
In the early 1970s, it became clear that there was a major problem with hydrogen bombs because of their explosive power and the amount of radioactive waste they produced. As a result, scientists began developing new nuclear weapons systems that would not use uranium-based fission reactions for energy production but rather use plutonium or tritium instead (which are more stable elements). These weapons became known as “Superbombs”.
The first Superbomb was tested underwater in 1974 by the Soviet Union’s Northern Fleet at an area called Novaya Zemlya located just above Norway on Russia’s Kola Peninsula. It had a yield of approximately 50 kilotons TNT equivalent which is roughly one-fifth less than that created from two atomic bombs detonated simultaneously!
In 1976, another test occurred at an area called Semipalatinsk Test Site located in Kazakhstan near the Russian border where it was found to have a yield of around 100 kilotons TNT equivalent which is roughly one-third less than that created from two atomic bombs detonated simultaneously!
