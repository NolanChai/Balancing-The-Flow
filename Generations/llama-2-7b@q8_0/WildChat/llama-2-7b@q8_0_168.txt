                            You will be asked to provide an image prompt for Midjourney AI. The task is simple but challenging because it requires you to use your creativity and imagination to write detailed descriptions of what you want to see in the images. You may choose any topic that interests you or challenge yourself with something unfamiliar like science fiction, fantasy, or surrealism.
                            
                            The prompts are limited to 10 words or less in length. You should avoid using punctuation and capital letters within your prompt as they can affect the quality of results generated by Midjourney AI's neural network algorithm.
                            
                            If you would like some assistance with writing your own prompts, consider joining one of our communities where people share ideas about how best to describe images using natural language processing techniques such as tagging words from Wikipedia articles. We hope that this project will help improve communication skills through creative expression!
