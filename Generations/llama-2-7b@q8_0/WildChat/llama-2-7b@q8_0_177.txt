Hi there, I was just wondering if you could help me with something. I am not sure what exactly is causing my low potassium. I have had this problem for many months now.
I've read that sometimes high blood glucose can cause the body to retain water, which then causes a drop in sodium and an increase in potassium. However, I also know that if you are taking insulin as an anti-diabetic drug, hyperglycemia (high BG) can be caused by the insulin itself.
My question is, what happens when high blood glucose is caused both by increased levels of insulin and by dehydration? I take a lot of water and have been trying to drink even more lately. My kidneys are also supposedly not functioning properly so they retain water easily.
Is it possible that my low potassium could be the result of both high blood glucose as well as an increase in insulin? Is there some way to determine which is the main cause? Or will it have to be determined by trial and error (i.e., try to keep your BG down for a period of time, then check if the potassium levels go up)?
Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated! I've been really frustrated because my doctor is telling me that this condition is "not serious" yet it has caused so many problems with my heart.
I'm not sure about insulin, but I know the hormone aldosterone helps your kidneys maintain potassium levels in your body. When you have chronic renal disease and your kidney function is impaired, aldosterone can be over-secreted leading to low potassium.
This article says that a person with normal glucose regulation will excrete 50% of their total daily insulin in the urine when they are dehydrated. Is this right? I am not sure how this is calculated, but it sounds about right to me (based on the fact that I used to drink about two litres and now I only drink half as much).
If 50% of insulin is excreted through urine when dehydrated, does that mean that my potassium levels could be low because too much is being lost in my pee? If so, does this mean that I should try to increase the amount of water I drink even further?
If the reason for my low potassium is an insulin overdose, will it go away if I manage to keep blood glucose levels down and only have small amounts of urine excreted every day?
Sorry, I'm not sure if any of these questions make sense. If they don't please feel free to ignore them or to tell me that I should ask my doctor about this stuff instead! Thank you so much for your help :)
You are asking some pretty good questions here. I would like to offer a couple comments on your first two:
1) The amount of water you drink is not going to affect insulin levels and how the kidneys excrete it. Insulin is excreted via glomerular filtration (kidney function). If you have CKD, then you are already at a disadvantage as your kidneys aren't working properly and don't filter insulin efficiently so there's more of the stuff hanging around in circulation.
2) You are right about high blood sugars causing dehydration due to urine output. But, this would only cause a transient elevation in potassium levels. I can't speak for how insulin might impact this but it's probably not an issue for you or anyone else with CKD and chronic hyperglycemia unless they are losing enough fluid to get into hypovolemic shock.
3) This is a good question that I don't know the answer to. My guess would be "no" - unless there was some other underlying cause of your low potassium.
I hope this helps and thanks for posting!

It's actually a good idea to know what causes the rise in potassium in cases of diabetic ketoacidosis. It has to do with gluconeogenesis (the generation of glucose from non-glucose sources). When your body is running out of glycogen and other carbohydrate sources, it will try to find them elsewhere.
In response to the lack of glucose in your bloodstream, your liver starts converting amino acids (proteins) into glucose - which are then used to replace lost glucose. This is what's going on during DKA. When this happens, there tends to be a rise in potassium.
You can read about it here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2751386/#:~:text=DKA%20is%20a%20classic%20example,protein%2Dbound%20to%20glucose)

DKA can also cause hyperosmolar hypoglycemia - which is a higher blood sugar level (hyperglycemia) but lower potassium level. It's very rare though, and it's more common in people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. I found out about this from the following article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5881924/#:~:text=Hyperglycemia%20(elevated%20blood%20glucose)%2C,hyperosmolar%20hypoglycemic%20syndrome%20(HHS).

If you are having an episode of DKA and have a low potassium level, that's likely what caused your elevated blood sugar levels. You may need to take some potassium supplements to get back into the normal range - depending on how high it is. It would be best to consult with a healthcare professional if you are having trouble maintaining stable glucose and ketone levels while being treated for DKA.
If your potassium level is elevated because of a different cause, then taking too much supplemental potassium can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) or even death - which is why it's important not just to know what causes the rise in potassium during DKA.

A. The diagnosis was correct and timely, leading to a patient outcome of no residual problems after surgery for trauma.
B. No other information is necessary in this scenario.
C. The physician should have ordered a CT scan of the lumbar spine with contrast in addition to the MRI that was done as part of his routine work-up.
D. The physician should not have ordered a chest x-ray because it was unnecessary for the patient’s presentation.
E. The patient has no risk factors for heart attack; therefore, no other tests or consultations are needed.
The correct answer is: C [Instructors may wish to give additional details of the scenario, such as the patient had a 10/10 pain on straight leg raising].
Pain after trauma can result from a number of causes, including fracture and disc injury. The most common cause for traumatic spine pain is contusion or hematoma (bruising) of the intervertebral discs. Intervertebral discs are located between each vertebrae in the spinal column. These pads act like shock absorbers to prevent too much stress from being placed on the spinal column. They also provide movement of the vertebrae, and allow for some flexibility of motion. When a trauma causes bruising or tearing of an intervertebral disc, the result is often a condition known as herniated disc disease (ruptured disc).
After such injury, the soft interior portion of the disc begins to protrude through the exterior wall. This usually occurs in the lower back because the intervertebral discs are thinner and have less supportive ligamentous tissue than do the upper spine discs. The pain from a herniated or ruptured disc is typically aggravated by activity, with relief being obtained when the patient rests or places pressure on the affected area.
A herniated or ruptured disc can also press upon and irritate nearby nerve roots that emerge from the spinal cord to innervate various parts of the body. This is known as a radiculopathy. If this occurs in the lower back, it is called lumbar radiculopathy (lumbar means “of the low back”). A lumbar herniated disc can cause symptoms such as numbness and tingling into the leg or foot along with pain radiating down to the buttocks and thighs.
The most common diagnostic test for lumbar radiculopathy is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lumbar spine, which allows visualization of the soft tissues as well as bony structures. A CT scan of the lumbar spine with contrast will also demonstrate any pathology in the bony structure or in adjacent ligaments.
Evidence from multiple studies suggests that screening patients who are undergoing hip surgery for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis can help identify those at risk for stroke and improve outcomes. (Level of Evidence = II-1A) [Instructors may wish to give additional details, such as the patient had a 4/5 pain on straight leg raising.]
The correct answer is: E [Instructors should add that this patient has no risk factors for heart attack; therefore, no other tests or consultations are needed].
Lumbar radiculopathy is typically treated with a combination of rest, anti-inflammatory medication, and physical therapy. If the symptoms persist after 4 to 6 weeks, the patient should consider seeing an orthopedist for further treatment. An epidural steroid injection (ESI) may provide temporary relief from lumbar radiculopathy pain and can be repeated if needed. A surgical procedure known as a discectomy may also be considered in patients who do not respond to nonsurgical treatments, but the decision should be made on an individual basis after thorough discussion with both the patient and the patient’s primary care provider or specialist physician.
In conclusion, lumbar radiculopathy is a common condition that can lead to significant pain if left untreated. The diagnosis of this condition typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, imaging studies such as an MRI scan or CT scan with contrast, and sometimes further testing such as ESI or surgery. In this scenario, the correct answer is that the patient’s diagnosis was correct and timely, leading to a good patient outcome after surgical intervention for trauma.

A 12-year-old male presents to your clinic with complaints of a cough, runny nose, rhinorrhea, sneezing, headache, low grade fever, sore throat and a productive yellow nasal discharge. The patient states that his symptoms began four days ago and have been worsening over the past 24 hours. He denies any nausea or vomiting as well as abdominal pain.
The parents of the patient are divorced, and the mother reports that her son is an “average” student in school. The father has a history of alcoholism and he was not available to provide information regarding his son’s health. Both parents deny any drug or tobacco use. He lives with his mother, but frequently visits his father on the weekends.
The patient is alert, oriented, conversant, and cooperative throughout the examination and interview process. He denies any visual problems. Physical findings include a low grade fever of 98.6°F (37.0°C), tachycardia at 120 beats/minute, blood pressure of 115/85 mmHg and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a normal capillary refill time, and there is no edema or rash present on the skin.
The lungs are clear to auscultation with no wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, stridor or other abnormalities heard on examination. The heart exhibits an S1 + S2 sound without a murmur and normal rate and rhythm. There is a palpable thrill at the point of maximum impulse in the left second intercostal space that can be felt with one finger.
Palpation of the abdomen reveals no tenderness, masses or guarding. No organomegaly is noted during auscultation. There are no palpable superficial lymph nodes or hepatomegaly. The remainder of the neurological examination is normal with a non-focal headache and negative cranial nerve signs.
The patient’s complete blood count (CBC) reveals white blood cell (WBC) count 16,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils, red blood cell (RBC) count of 4.2 million / mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) is 14 g/dL and hematocrit (HCT) is 38.6%. The patient’s platelets are normal at 245,000 cells per cubic millimeter. Serum electrolytes including sodium 149 mmol/L; potassium 5.2 mmol/L; calcium 9 mg/dL and phosphorous (P) 4.9 mg/dL are all normal.
A urinalysis was performed to determine the presence of blood, protein, sugar or pus cells in the patient’s urine sample. The urinalysis is completely negative aside from a slight increase in white blood cell (WBC) count, which is normal with only trace amounts of bacteria found in the specimen.
The C-Reactive Protein (CRP), an acute phase protein marker that helps to determine levels of inflammation in the body was tested at 25 mg/L which falls within the normal range of 0–6 mg/L. Serum Electrolytes are normal aside from a slight increase in potassium, which is considered clinically insignificant and not related to his symptoms of fever or coughing. A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities on the image.
Blood cultures were taken after a preliminary diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was made based off patient history and physical examination findings. The blood cultures are pending at this time.
After performing a thorough interview, physical assessment and laboratory studies, what would you conclude regarding the diagnosis? What other tests do you need to perform to confirm or rule out your suspected diagnosis? How would you treat the patient for pharyngitis if confirmed? Provide evidence to support your answer.

The following are appropriate treatment plans for a patient with heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is to help in reducing the complications that may occur during the hospital stay and also after the discharge. The patient should be treated accordingly and with respect.
Patients diagnosed with heart disease require special care since they are at risk of contracting infections. They should have special care that will see their condition stabilized so that they can be released from the hospital without any complications. In such cases, doctors should develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the needs of each patient (Baldwin et al., 2014).
The following are some of the appropriate treatments for patients diagnosed with heart disease:
Education about their health and dietary changes that will help prevent complications associated with the disease. The doctor should make sure that they get a clear understanding on how to take care of themselves so as not to aggravate the problem. For instance, the patient might be required to stop smoking since it can worsen their condition or increase risks of stroke and heart attack.
Treatment with medications such as aspirin that will help prevent clots from forming in blood vessels and reduce chances of having a stroke or heart attack (Powers, et al., 2015). The doctor should be able to assess whether the patient needs this treatment before prescribing it.
Patients with pulmonary embolism require special attention so that their condition does not worsen and cause complications in other parts of the body. These patients need to be hospitalized for monitoring purposes which includes checking on how well they are breathing, whether there are signs of swelling or pain at any point during treatment (Baldwin et al., 2014). The doctor should also check if they have any signs of bleeding in the lungs so that this can be prevented before it worsens and becomes fatal.
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need special care because their condition is not curable but manageable with medications or other treatments such as oxygen therapy which helps them breathe more easily (Powers, et al., 2015). It is important for doctors to make sure that these patients know how to use their inhalers correctly so they don't suffer from respiratory problems after being discharged.
In conclusion, the treatment plan of any patient depends on various factors such as age and health status which should be taken into account when planning treatment options (Baldwin et al., 2014). The above information is a summary of what doctors need to know about each patient before prescribing them medications or other forms of therapy so they can provide proper care during hospitalization and after discharge from the hospital.

What are some of the most common indicators or red flags in assessment? What does each indicate, what are its limitations and how can they be used together to come up with a diagnosis.
How do you decide which tests to order and why? Why is it important that we ask patients about their medications when taking history?
How do you interpret test results? What are the normal ranges for some common blood tests? Which one of these parameters should always be interpreted in context of another?

The problem that the judge had to solve in the case was to determine whether the plaintiff, who was a businessman, would be able to file his complaint for an unpaid debt. He was also concerned with determining whether or not he could sue him for it.
[FIN]what is the primary impression of this case[/FIN]

I found that the answer is NO. However, I did not understand why can't we consider it. According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (p136) , a person with a major depressive disorder has at least five of nine symptoms, including either 1 or both of the following:
(i)depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities; and
(ii) markedly diminished activity or fatigue (including feeling tired all of the time).
The first two symptoms are not present. Also it should be noted that there is a symptom about suicidality which could be due to depression, but we can't use it for diagnosis as this symptom is required only if a person has been experiencing any depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks. So in my opinion, if the patient experiences at least five of nine symptoms, including either (i)depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities; and
(ii) markedly diminished activity or fatigue (including feeling tired all of the time). then we can diagnose him with a major depressive disorder. But if not, the answer is NO.
