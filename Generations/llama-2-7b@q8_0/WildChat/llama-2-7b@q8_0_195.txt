Welcome aboard the ship! It’s a little messy as there is no one to clean it up right now. There are some robes hanging in the corner of the room, but they look really dirty and torn apart. A small bed sits in the opposite corner of the room; it seems that you slept here last night. In the center of the room there’s a wooden stool which looks like it has seen better days.
You are currently at the deck on top of a large ship, the ship is named Gigant-X and is owned by the pirate captain Monkey D Luffy who resides here on the boat with you. You look around, but there’s nobody in sight right now, not even Monkey D Luffy himself.
