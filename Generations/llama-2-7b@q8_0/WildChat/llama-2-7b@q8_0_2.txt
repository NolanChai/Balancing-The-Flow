- Dave gets his head down. His body becomes pliable like a puppet. He can barely speak & is almost paralyzed from the neck down…
- She tells him to close his eyes and she begins telling him to follow her commands, one at a time.
- As each command is given he obeys instantly.
- The commands start out with small things like closing/opening his hand, then get increasingly more complicated until Dave can barely obey anymore…
- She makes him stand up and walk in a circle around the room as she tells him to... 
- She gets him to count from one to five backward while he is walking… 
- When he finishes counting backwards, she stops him in his tracks by saying "Stop!" & making him freeze. He obeys her completely. He can't move.
- He starts falling asleep but he doesn’t have the willpower to resist any longer, so when she tells him to lie down on the floor… he does! 
- She has complete control over his body and mind by telling him to do things. It becomes a real power play between her and Dave.
### Consequences:
- His legs are weak & it’s almost as if they have no willpower of their own. They start shaking uncontrollably in some parts but Megan quickly takes control over them again by giving him another command... 
- She makes his body do whatever she wants until he is completely obedient to her commands. He can barely move… it’s like his entire body has become a puppet.
