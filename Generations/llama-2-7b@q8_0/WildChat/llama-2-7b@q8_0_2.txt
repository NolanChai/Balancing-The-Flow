Megan (19), Dave (20)
[Dave sits at his computer.]
Megan: Hey Dave! Have you seen the new trailer for that hypnotism movie?
Dave: What hypnotism movie?
Megan: The one with that girl in it, you know. The one who was in that other thing.
Dave: Oh yeah. Yeah, I’ve seen it. It looks interesting. I’m going to watch it when it comes out next week.
Megan (teasing): Hmmm… Do you think they’ll be able to do hypnotism on camera? I wonder how well they can hide the camera if they have someone under hypnosis, and they use their eyes and stuff to direct them. It’s probably not possible to hide it that much, but I don’t know.
Dave: Oh man, I bet it would be a cool effect though. But I think you’re right. The camera would have to stay out of the shot pretty often or it might give away what was going on.
Megan (teasing): Sooo… How could they get around that?
Dave: What do you mean, “how?”
Megan: I don’t know – I guess if they had some kind of special effects they could make a fake eye for the camera to look at when it needed to. Or maybe they would have someone else direct the subject from off screen and not use their eyes at all… Yeah, that would be cool!
Dave: Well Megan, if you want to see how hypnotic suggestions work, you can try them on me right now. I bet I could be hypnotized just like in the movie trailer – but by someone who doesn’t even have any special effects or anything! (teasing) You’re a good actress Megan… You should be an actor for real.
Megan: Well, we can find out if you want!
Dave: What? Are you serious?
Megan: Yeah, why not? I guess I could give it a shot. (teasing) If we do this right, when we get done with the hypnotic induction… I bet you’ll have no idea what’s going on and won’t remember any of this conversation! You’re gonna be in so much trouble!
Dave: Oooh… You sound serious now Megan. But how could you possibly do it? This is just an internet chat, there isn’t a camera or anything to hypnotize me with!
Megan (teasing): Oh come on Dave, you can trust me, I won’t hurt you. And if it doesn’t work at all then no harm done. Right? You never know unless we try though!
Dave: All right… Do your best Megan! I wanna believe that hypnotism works in real life too – but so far no one has ever convinced me of it. Let’s see if you can prove me wrong and convince me this time. I guess you can be my first test subject for hypnosis online – without any fancy cameras or anything!
Megan: Okay… It’ll be a little bit awkward but let’s start now… (teasing) Are you ready? Here we go!
[Megan looks at Dave, and says slowly, in her normal voice:]
Dave (in a trance): Yes. I am. Very much so.
