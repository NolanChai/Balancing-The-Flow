[b][u]The Races of Starcraft II[/u][/b] The Protoss: Protoss is one of the three main races featured in Starcraft. They are a humanoid alien race, and they stand around 6 to 7 feet tall with four limbs. They also have two eyes set into their head. They are also very agile and are able to climb up walls. The Protoss can also fly on wings that are built right into them, and can use their wings to glide from great distances. Protoss are one of the most advanced races in the Starcraft universe and are capable of developing technology far beyond any other race. This has led to a superiority complex among many Protoss. The Terran: A Terran is a human being, but they are not Earth-humans. They were first encountered by the Protoss on their home world Char in 2049. During this encounter, Protoss and Terrans learned how to communicate with each other. However, most Terrans were hostile towards the Protoss, and thus a war began between the two races. The Zerg: The Zerg are the second race featured in Starcraft. They are made up of various different alien species that have been conquered or absorbed by the Swarm. Most zergs are also mutated humans known as Terrans who were experimented on and infected with a parasite called the Overmind, which is responsible for turning Terrans into Zergs. The Overmind has since split itself in two and now resides in two different bodies. One of these beings is located inside Kerrigan's body while the other one was destroyed by Jim Raynor. The second being can take control of any mind that it desires, and uses this ability to control its zerg swarm. In addition, the Overmind has been known to use its ability to project illusions as well as creating new lifeforms. [b]Slenderman:[/b] Slender is a tall humanoid figure dressed in a black suit who carries an umbrella with him at all times and can move through walls, floors, ceilings, etc., at will. The creature has long limbs with fingers that are far too long for his hands. His face is featureless but he does have large eyes which seem to stare endlessly into the distance. [b]Human Characters:[/b] Any human character you want to put in here, I'll probably allow it unless it's a copycat of one of my characters already on the list. [u][b]Rules:[/b][/u] 1.) No godmoding or controlling another players character without their permission. If someone gets a hold of your character and does something you wouldn't do, contact me and we will come up with an agreement between us. 2.) All powers are allowed (super strength, invisibility, etc.), but be reasonable about how the power is used in game play. You don't want to have a character that can destroy everything in sight. This RP may change over time as I figure out what works and doesn't work. Feel free to add any suggestions or changes you would like to see. The most important thing is to have fun with this and don't worry about trying to win an award for best role player, just go in there and enjoy yourself. Also feel free to ask questions if you need help understanding something.
The Halo Wars 2 RP Thread
Jinjo posted a topic in Role Playing Games
Hey guys! This is my first rp thread I've ever made so it might be a bit rough, but I hope that you will like this anyway! To get started with the story, you play as an elite on Reach. Your team's mission is to find and capture a UNSC scientist by the name of Professor Ellen Anders who is working for Jul 'Mdama' Covenant forces. After successfully capturing her, she asks to be taken back to her base in order to keep researching, but it turns out that she has been infected with some sort of alien parasite which makes you question what is going on at her facility! Rules: 1.) No godmodding or controlling another players character without their permission. If someone gets a hold of your character and does something you wouldn't do, contact me and we will come up with an agreement between us. 2.) All powers are allowed (super strength, invisibility, etc.), but be reasonable about how the power is used in game play. You don't want to have a character that can destroy everything in sight. This RP may change over time as I figure out what works and doesn't work. Feel free to add any suggestions or changes you would like to see. The most important thing is to have fun with this and don't worry about trying to win an award for best role player, just go in there and enjoy yourself. Also feel free to ask questions if you need help understanding something. 3.) Please do not copy my characters and make a new one. I will be doing the same with yours so please respect that.
Elder Scrolls RP: The Age of Rebellion [IC]
Gladius posted a topic in Role Playing Games
The Year is 4E 201, and the Aldmeri Dominion has taken to claiming lands and villages for their own use as they expand ever outward. In response the Empire has raised an army of thousands to fight back against these aggressors that they may not even have to be a part of, but are simply here to protect their own homeland. The Thalmor, the ancient elven society who worships the Daedric Prince of Destruction and Madness, Molag Bal, has risen from the ashes of civil war with the Aldmeri Dominion and are attempting to take back the entire continent for themselves using magic to aid their armies. This is a massive conflict that is already affecting millions of lives, but what does it mean for you? That question will be answered by this role play. [b]The Age Of Rebellion:[/b] A world torn asunder and fighting for its very soul against the oncoming darkness of Molag Bal. This is a massive conflict that threatens to dwarf all previous wars combined, yet one in which you can find yourself involved in at any time. You could be a farmer who decides he wants to protect his family from an invading army or you could be a soldier fighting to defend your homeland from those who would seek to claim it for themselves. Or maybe something else entirely? The choice is yours, and this world will take what it needs from each of us in order to survive. The Empire: The empire is the most powerful force on the continent, having already conquered much of the mainland and is now looking to expand even further. They are a diverse group that includes people from all walks of life with one thing in common; their loyalty lies with the Emperor himself who has ruled for over 20 years without fail or fault. The Aldmeri Dominion: The aldmeri dominion is made up of elves who have banded together to form a new empire that seeks only power and wealth, and will stop at nothing until they have achieved their goals. They are led by Queen Ayrenn who has declared herself ruler over all other nations on the continent with no regard for those around her except for what benefits them personally or politically speaking. The Thalmor: The thalmor is an ancient elven society that worships Molag Bal, and seeks to take back everything from the aldmeri dominion as well as any other land they may find themselves on. They use their powerful magic to aid in combat against those who stand between them and their goals of conquest for power alone with no regard for life or death along the way if need be! Thalmor Society: The Thalmor are a secretive society that has been around since before recorded time. Their leader is known only as Molag Bal, and they have been working behind-the scenes to bring about their own goals of power and wealth through conquest across Nirn without regard for anyone else living there or any other race except themselves. The Daedra: The daedra are creatures that exist within the dreams of mortals, but can also be found in reality if you know how to look for them or are willing to go into a realm beyond this one where they live freely amongst each other without any problems because it's not their home after all. You will never see a Daedra unless you seek him out yourself first before entering his domain though!
CYBERPUNK 2077 Rp(open)
Cyborg posted a topic in Role Playing Games
[b] Cyberpunk 2077 rp [/b] Cyberpunk is the best story of the game, where the player can choose their own destiny and what will happen in this world. You will play as a character who lives on Earth in a futuristic setting that has been ravaged by nuclear warfare, with its environment becoming increasingly chaotic as it descends into lawlessness. Your goal is to survive at all costs while also making choices that impact how you'll be remembered in this world after everything goes down (

If you don't know what star craft two is, its a RTS game (real time strategy) that had some good races in it. I have seen some people create characters for them, so I thought i would try to do the same with some of the races and maybe even characters from the first one.
So here are my first 3 for the Zerg:
Mutalisk:
Very big mothership, that shoots plasma balls at you. It can also create smaller flying creatures (called broods) out of it. When they get close to the ground they split in two and shoot a laser beam at you while flying. These beams are not very powerful but they are very fast, so when you are hit by one its too late.
Zerg Queen:
She is your main base that produces many other creatures to attack you. She can also produce new Mutalisk's from time to time. This is her base building.
Zergling:
This is the most basic of all creatures in star craft, and probably my favorite one. Its just a big lizard man that shoots 2 laser beams at you when it is close enough. When they are close together its very easy to hit them with your weapons (and i am using a flare gun).
Here's another Zergling. I will try to do all the ones that appear in the game and see how they turn out.
Also here is a Hydralisk:
He looks like an octopus/worm mix, that can swim underwater or walk on land. He can also shoot laser beams at you from his mouths and he is very fast so it's hard to avoid them if you are not close enough with your weapons.
And here is the last one of Zergling, he is a bit more advanced than other zerglings since he has 3 eyes instead of 2. The red ones are only for protection and have no attacks.
