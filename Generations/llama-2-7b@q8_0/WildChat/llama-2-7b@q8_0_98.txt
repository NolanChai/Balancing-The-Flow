The USDA was the first organization to approve genetically modified crops for human consumption because of their expertise in plant pathology and pest management.

Correct Answer - C. False

The answer can be narrowed down to just the first line in the prompt. The USDA does not have jurisdiction over pests. Instead, that falls under the purview of the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Since it is not mentioned that the investigation would fall under the purview of USDA's Agricultural Research Services (ARS), or any other department within the agency, we can be confident that this answer choice is incorrect.
