We’re looking for a Product Manager that has:
5+ years of experience in digital transformation. You should be able to demonstrate your ability to identify opportunities and execute on them successfully, working with stakeholders across all levels within the organization.
Proven track record of launching successful products/solutions by collaborating with various teams like sales & marketing/customer success, product development and engineering while maintaining an open line of communication between yourself and your team members. This will allow us all stay on top our game by sharing knowledge with each other during meetings where we discuss how best achieve objectives set forth at the beginning stages before diving headfirst into any given task without knowing what lies ahead!
The ability to think quickly, analyze large data sets and make strategic decisions with speed. This means that you need to be able understand the different types of information available in order for us to reach our goals together as one team - whether it's finding new ways around challenges or simply coming up with better solutions!
Being able to work independently but also collaboratively across departments such sales & marketing/customer success, product development and engineering so everyone knows what’s going on at all times without having any confusion about their roles within the company. This means that we don't have someone managing everything from top down while another person takes care of every little detail underneath them - we just make sure everything gets done in a timely manner!
Flexibility - As you know, things can change at any moment so having flexibility with your schedule is essential for being able to do this job well. You might find yourself working longer hours than normal one day or less another depending on what comes up during the day itself which makes sense since there's always something happening around here!
The ability to think outside of the box and come up with creative solutions that will help us reach our goals together as one team - whether it’s finding new ways around challenges or simply coming up better solution!

This means that we don't have someone managing everything from top down while another person takes care of every little detail underneath them - we just make sure everything gets done in a timely manner!
Excellent written and verbal communication skills - This is key when it comes to communicating with your team members about what they need or want from their job descriptions. You should be able speak clearly so everyone understands exactly what needs done without getting lost along the way while also being able write reports/memos etc., which are important documents that can help guide us all through tough times ahead!
The ability to handle stress - As a Product Manager, there will always be things happening at once and sometimes they'll get out of hand quickly depending how well organized everything gets done beforehand. This means being able stay calm under pressure while still finding time for yourself when needed because no one can work 24/7 without getting burned out eventually - even if just temporarily!
The ability to prioritize and delegate tasks effectively in order make sure everything gets done on-time without sacrificing quality. This means being able identify which projects need immediate attention while also taking into account how much time each one takes before assigning them accordingly so nothing falls through the cracks!
An understanding of how a SaaS product works - It's important that you know what your customers want from their products and services, but more importantly why they want it in order for us to reach our goals together as one team. If we don’t understand this then there won't be any progress made towards reaching those objectives because no matter how much effort goes into making something better than before - without knowing what people need from their software solutions first hand (which means understanding its purpose), then nothing will change!
The ability to work with limited resources while still achieving goals set by upper management within time constraints imposed upon us all at once. This can be challenging sometimes but if we don't have enough manpower available on staff then things won’t get done correctly - even though everything might appear fine from afar until someone starts complaining about something being wrong later down the road after looking into details ourselves first-hand before reporting back what happened during those times where people felt like something wasn't right but couldn’t figure out why until now?
The ability to identify and communicate with stakeholders within your department or other departments. This includes understanding their needs, concerns, and priorities in order for us all reach our goals together as one team - whether they be customers/clients who need help using our software solutions effectively enough while still providing quality service every step along the way without sacrificing anything else like speed etc., which might seem unimportant until something goes wrong later down this road!
Experience managing cross-functional teams, such as sales & marketing/customer success, product development and engineering.
A high level of empathy for others' feelings is essential in order to understand what they're going through at all times without judging them based off personal preferences alone because there will always be different opinions on how things should get done best when it comes down making decisions about projects/tasks during these busy periods ahead!
The ability to work well under pressure, especially if you’re faced with challenging situations or unexpected obstacles that can throw everything for a loop. This means being able adapt quickly while still keeping calm and collect yourself so nothing gets out of hand without any warning signs first-hand before things start spinning out control which could lead us into chaos later on down this path - even though everything might seem fine from afar until something goes wrong somewhere else along our journey towards reaching goals together as one team!
