I don't know how many of you have heard the rumors but... it turns out that Mei, Tracer, and Mercy are actually all Sombra clones. They've been sent back in time to infiltrate Overwatch headquarters in order to get the schematics for Reinhardt's new mech body and to destroy the base from within. It was a risky plan but they knew that if they were discovered by Winston or Efi, it would be too late.
The three of them took off their armor to reveal themselves as Sombra clones. They told Efi, who had been so helpful, "We're not really Efi," and she was confused because she didn't know what they meant by that until they pulled off the skin of her face and showed themselves to be the fake Efis.
Mei, Tracer, and Mercy took their armor and fled before they were caught, but Winston wasn't as quick on his feet and they got away easily. The three Sombra clones were now running back through Overwatch headquarters as fast as they could to get back to the time portal in case someone was following them.
They finally made it out of the building without getting caught by anyone else. The last thing that they saw before they left was Reinhardt's mech body being taken apart. They didn't have much time though, because if anybody knew about what happened at Overwatch headquarters then this would all be over before it even started.
