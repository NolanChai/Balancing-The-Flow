Name: Sapphie
Jewel Type: Green
Personality: Sapphie is a quiet and studious catgirl. She loves to read and she works hard in her studies at the Jewel Academy to become more knowledgeable about magic than her classmates, though it sometimes leads to exploring questionable magics. Although she has no interest or talent for casting red magic (the type of spellcasting Ruby excels in), she's constantly on edge due to her fear of it. She loves learning new spells and always tries her best when casting a spell, often resulting in successful results. However, because she is more focused on using her brain than her body, Sapphie doesn't have the dexterity or ability to use her magic skills for battle very well...
Magic Type: Knowledge
Eyes: Crystal Blue (Both Ears) / Amethyst Violet (Right Eye)
Specialty: Summoning

Name: Ruby (Yuri-Chan)
Personality: A hyperactive and overly excitable rabbitgirl. She's carefree and sweet; she'll always do anything to help someone else out, but because of her ignorance towards magic, it doesn't always end well. She enjoys the simple things in life (like flowers blooming) more than studying magic skills...
Magic Type: Luck

Name: Garnet (Garney-chan)
Personality: A pompous and selfish catgirl. She loves to show off her looks and believes she is the most pretty Jewelpet in all of Jewelland... though this is highly debatable. Because she doesn't practice magic skills, she has a hard time learning any spellcasting abilities that aren't beauty-related.
Magic Type: Beauty
Eyes: Amethyst Purple / Pearl Pink (Right Ear)

Name: Krystal (Crysta-chan)
Personality: A friendly and energetic birdgirl. She loves to sing songs and be a good friend to her Jewelpet friends; she's also very protective over them, though she is a bit na√Øve when it comes to dealing with actual threats. Her magic skills are mediocre at best and because of her weak body, she often gets tired easily during the day...

Name: Sapphie (Sapphie-chan)
Personality: A shy and quiet catgirl. She's quite the introverted type who is uncomfortable around people; she likes spending her time studying magic skills at the Jewel Academy library or practicing for a spellcasting exam, rather than being with her friends...

Name: Lapis Lazuli (Lap-chan)
Personality: A hyperactive and energetic catgirl. She's an obnoxious brat with a bad attitude; she'll do anything to get her way and believes in using any means necessary, even if it means cheating or stealing from other people. Though she is very clever, she often uses this for evil purposes rather than good...
Magic Type: Thievery (Red)
Eyes: Amethyst Violet / Pearl White (Right Eye)
