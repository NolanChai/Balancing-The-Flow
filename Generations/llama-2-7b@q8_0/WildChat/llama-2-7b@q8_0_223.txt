Leads and sales are the two main metrics that businesses measure in order to evaluate their marketing campaign effectiveness, yet only one of these leads to revenue—the latter can be measured by lead conversion rate. Both lead generation and ABM use lead generation tactics to drive awareness of a brand and engage potential customers, but they differ in their focus and purpose.
Lead generation is focused on generating more contacts while account-based marketing (ABM) is focused on delivering relevant, high quality interactions with decision makers within an organization that are likely to convert into revenue. ABM’s purpose isn’t just to generate leads but rather increase the value of those accounts by creating engagement and a trustworthy relationship. This is why ABM has proven successful in driving higher revenue as it increases the number of qualified opportunities for sales teams to close deals with.
With this in mind, we take a look at how you can leverage account-based marketing (ABM) tactics and strategy into your lead generation efforts:
What is ABM?
ABM focuses on identifying key decision makers within an organization as well as their needs and pain points before they become aware of the product or service being offered. Once identified, marketers use these insights to target them with more relevant content in order to establish trustworthiness between both parties which helps convert prospects into customers later down the road when it comes time for sales teams take over from here on out!
This approach differs significantly from traditional B2B lead generation methods that focus solely on volume rather than quality; however, this shift has been proven successful in helping companies increase their revenue by up to 3X according to some studies done by Forrester Research.
How is ABM different from Lead Generation?
Lead generation tactics are used for a specific purpose: generating more contacts within your database and increasing the overall number of potential buyers you have access to. However, this approach can lead to wasted time and effort if not executed effectively as leads generated in this way may not be qualified or ready for purchase. That’s where account-based marketing comes into play! ABM focuses on identifying key decision makers within an organization before they become aware of the product or service being offered, allowing marketers to target them with relevant content so as to establish trustworthiness between both parties which helps convert prospects into customers later down the road when it’s time for sales teams take over from here on out!
What are some key benefits of using an ABM strategy?
The most notable benefit is increased revenue, as research by Forrester Research indicates that companies who use account-based marketing strategies can increase their revenue by up to 3X. Other benefits include improved customer experience and better alignment with sales teams for faster decision making and faster close rates!
How to implement an ABM Strategy?
The first step is to identify key decision makers within an organization before they become aware of the product or service being offered, allowing marketers to target them with relevant content so as to establish trustworthiness between both parties which helps convert prospects into customers later down the road when it’s time for sales teams take over from here on out! Once you have identified these individuals, work closely with your sales team in order to develop customized messaging that speak directly towards their needs while also being mindful about how each message is delivered – whether through email, social media platforms like Facebook & Twitter etc., or even via personal meetings at trade shows & conferences!
ABM’s purpose isn’t just to generate leads but rather increase the value of those accounts by creating engagement and a trustworthy relationship. This is why ABM has proven successful in driving higher revenue as it increases the number of qualified opportunities for sales teams to close deals with, while also reducing customer acquisition costs associated with traditional methods such as cold calling & emailing campaigns!
What are some common challenges when using an ABM Strategy?
The most significant challenge is determining which accounts should be targeted; this requires marketers to have a deep understanding of their buyer personas so that they can identify who these key decision makers might be within each organization (i.e., C-suite executives). Another challenge is ensuring that every interaction between customers and brands remains authentic throughout its lifecycle – whether it’s through email, social media platforms like Facebook & Twitter etc., or even via personal meetings at trade shows & conferences!
Account-based marketing (ABM) can be a great way to generate leads by focusing on key decision makers within an organization. It also helps improve customer experience and align sales teams for faster decision making, which results in increased revenue when compared with traditional lead generation methods that focus solely on volume rather than quality. ABM strategies also allow marketers to reduce customer acquisition costs associated with these campaigns as well! However, there are some common challenges such as determining who should be targeted or ensuring authentic interactions between customers and brands throughout the buyer lifecycle which needs careful consideration before implementation so make sure your team has done their research first!
