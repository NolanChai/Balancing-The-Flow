Just uploaded the new version (v5.1). It now has a capacity of 20000 and it is named "jamey chadwell stadium" with a name of "Gator Bowl" (which i didn't change because it's a better name). The stadium has a seating capacity of 45k+ but as i said in the original post, i haven't added a supporters section.
You can get the stadium on this link: https://mega.nz/file/h1Qi0C5T#pJWfjG-FqdEf2g4Z_KLv7Ql8B5Y6VaIr07X3t4kDnwA
