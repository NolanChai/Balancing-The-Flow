Supreme is not a brand, they make clothes. You have to understand this to get them.
Wanna know why Supreme is so successful? Well, firstly there's the fact that they are a small brand and make a relatively tiny amount of stuff compared to other clothing companies out there - this means that anything they do releases feels fresh because its such a rarity. And secondly, it helps that people who buy Supreme have a certain mindset about them...
Most of the people who wear Supreme are into streetwear and skateboarding (and hip hop) so they're always on the lookout for things that will make them stand out from other skaters/hipsters. And Supreme makes it easy by releasing only a limited amount of product, which makes those products highly sought-after and valuable to their core consumers - who have the money and sense of style to buy into what they do.
And thirdly: Supreme is cool because they don't care if you like them or not! They are unapologetically themselves; they will never change their ways in order to appease others who might not understand them at first glance - this makes them more authentic than most brands out there today (and it also means that those who do get what Supreme is all about tend to be even more invested into the brand).
I know I've said a lot but this was just one of my favourite articles on the internet recently, so hopefully you enjoy reading it too! Thanks for checking out our post :)
Supreme is known as the most sought-after skateboarding and streetwear company in the world. The company began in 1994 by James Jebbia. Today they are a global brand that has become synonymous with the hip-hop lifestyle, but how did this happen?
Supreme has been around for over two decades now and during that time they've had some big names work alongside them like Kanye West who created his own line of clothing in collaboration with Supreme back in 2013 called "Yeezys" after himself. This was an incredibly successful venture for both parties as it showed how much people wanted to wear products from brands such as these two companies - especially when they were working together!
In fact, so much success did this collaboration bring about that other artists like Pharrell Williams followed suit by creating his own line too called "Billionaire Boys Club" (BB&C). He also released an album called "G I R L," which featured collaborations with several other musicians including Andre 3000 and Usher.
Supreme is a brand that's all about the hype - they don't care if you like their product or not, they just want people to know who they are and what they do! If someone likes your stuff then great; but even if someone doesn't like it (or maybe even doesn't know anything at all) that still means something special because it shows how much work went into creating these items in order for them to reach such a high level of success.
This article will show you what makes Supreme so popular and why so many people love their products despite not having any connection with skateboarding culture!
