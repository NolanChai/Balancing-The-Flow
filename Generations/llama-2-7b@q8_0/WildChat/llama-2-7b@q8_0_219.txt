[FONT="Courier New"][COLOR="Navy"]"You're a genius!"[/COLOR][/FONT]
[FONT="Courier New"][COLOR="RoyalBlue"][B]"Thank you."[/B] He said with a smile on his face as he stood in the doorway of her room. She was sitting on her bed, reading a book with a smirk on her face and the sound of a clicker came from behind her when he had walked into the room.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"Your welcome." He said again as he took his jacket off. "Are you studying too?" She asked him with her hands folded on top of the book she was reading, as if waiting for an answer to a question.[B]"I can't believe I actually studied this hard today!"[/B]
"Yeah," He replied before taking his shoes off. "What did you have?" he asked her with curiosity. "Oh, ummm....Maths...English....." She was unable to say what she had been studying but he didn't seem bothered by it and he gave a laugh at the end of the list.
"Those are easy," He said with a smile on his face as he walked over to where her desk was, leaning against one of the chairs in front of it.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] "I had Maths too." She answered while putting away her book.
"You did? Oh that's cool," He said as he nodded his head at her. "That was my last one and I got an A!" He exclaimed with happiness in his voice, which made her smile a bit at how excited he was about his grade.[B]"I can't believe I actually studied this hard today! I feel really good!"[/B]
She watched as he sat down on the chair next to her desk and she decided to put away her books. She then turned around and faced him with a smile, "Did you?" He asked her. "Oh yeah, it felt really great too." She said while shaking her head back and forth.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"I feel like I've been studying for hours!" She exclaimed and he laughed a bit at how excited she was about studying. "How long did you study?" He asked her. "Not as long as you but it felt good."
"Good," He said before standing up and stretching his arms out in front of him.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] "So...what are you doing now? Want to go for a walk or something?" She asked him, "We can do some homework when we get back."
"Sounds like a plan," He said with a smile before walking over to where she was standing. "Let me take your bag first," he said as he reached out and took it from her, grabbing onto the straps of the book-bag.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"Thanks..." She said as he took off with the book-bag. "You know what...we should study together!" He said before turning back to face her. "That sounds like a plan," she said while smiling and following him out of the room, shutting the door behind them.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
They walked around their school's campus for quite a bit of time before they saw two boys who were talking to each other. "I don't know why I just let him take me." She said while walking past the boys. "He's kind of cute, isn't he?" He asked her as he looked at one of them who was about 5 foot and a bit shorter than himself.
"Ummm...I guess..." she replied before turning around to face him. "Maybe we should go back," She said with a smile on her face.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] [FONT="Courier New"][COLOR="RoyalBlue"][B]"I don't know why I just let him take me."[/B][/COLOR][/FONT]
"You know he likes you," He said to her with a smile before walking over to one of the benches on campus. They both sat down and she looked up at him. "I don't think that guy liked you." She replied while looking back at him.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"You should've seen how he was staring at me when I walked past them," He said with a smirk on his face. "He was staring at me?!" she exclaimed and he laughed a bit before replying to her.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] [FONT="Courier New"][COLOR="RoyalBlue"]"No, I don't think so." He said while smiling at her. "Maybe it was the other guy," She replied and he shrugged his shoulders before saying something.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] [B]"I could ask him to get you a pencil or something!" He said with a laugh, making her face turn red for some reason. "Or...I could give him my phone number?" She suggested and he looked at her with confusion.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT] [B]"You want me to call you? I mean..." He said before turning back towards his book-bag on the ground behind them. "We could study together," she said and he turned back around to face her.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"That's a great idea!" He exclaimed with excitement in his voice as he grabbed onto one of the straps on her book-bag. "Let me get your stuff," He said as he took it off of her, placing it down next to him and then sitting down.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"Thank you..." She said before taking out a textbook from the back pocket in her shorts. "I'm going to study now," He said with a smile as he turned around, facing his book-bag on the ground behind him. [B]"Do you want me to give him my phone number?"[/B] She asked him and he paused for a moment before looking back at her.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"I don't know," He said as he thought about it. "Yeah, that sounds like a good idea," she replied while smiling at him. She then took out the same textbook and placed it down on her lap before opening it up to where they left off studying.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"What are we studying again?" He asked as he sat back, resting against his book-bag. "Mathematics." She replied while looking down at the pages in front of her before turning around to face him.[B]"Yeah...I'm pretty sure I didn't study enough today..."[/B]
"Okay," He said with a nod of his head and she smirked at him. "You should probably get out your calculator." She said while looking down at the pages in front of her, before turning back around to face him again.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"Okay," He replied with a laugh as he turned around and picked up his book-bag off of the ground. "I'm going to go find my calculator now." She said before taking out her book from the front pocket in her shorts, opening it back up to where they left off studying.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
She then closed her textbook and placed it down next to him. "I'm going to get mine too." She said with a smile as she stood up and walked over to the backpack that was right behind theirs, opening it up to take out her calculator.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
He looked at her while watching as she opened the front pocket of her book-bag, taking out a notebook. He then stood back up and walked over to where his book-bag was sitting on the ground behind them, picking it up before turning around to face her.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"Here you go!" She said as she gave him a pencil. "Thank you," he replied with a smile. He then picked up his book-bag and walked over to where they were studying, placing it on the ground next to them.[COLOR="Navy"][/COLOR][/FONT]
"I got my calculator too!" She said while putting away her notebook. "Okay," he replied with a nod of his head before opening up his book-bag again and taking out his calculator.

[FONT="Tahoma"][SIZE="5"][COLOR="Gray"][COLOR="Black"][B]"Why does God allow bad things to happen?"[/B] The most difficult question to answer for me.[/COLOR][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]
[SIZE="2"]It's hard to explain a bad situation in the context of religion. If we see a person who is being hurt by someone else and we believe that God allows this, we'd say, "God created both him as well as his tormentor." And then we ask ourselves how could a loving god allow such torture to happen?
The question is not, why does God let bad things happen in the world. The real question is, why do good people suffer while evil thrives and prospers? [/SIZE]
[COLOR="Black"][FONT="Arial Narrow"]The answer to this is that it's our fault.[/FONT][/COLOR]
If God could do everything then he wouldn't have allowed bad things to happen. He would be all powerful and in control of every situation. If we think of a perfect world, we are thinking about a place where only the good exist and where no evil exists.
But God had given us free will. So our choices are what make up this world. We choose good or bad, so it is because of this that suffering occurs in the world. I know that many people think they have not done anything to deserve such treatment, but even if we believe that all things come from God then it means that whatever you do comes from him as well.
Suffering is an intrinsic part of a free will universe. And this leads us back to the question asked at the beginning. Why does God allow bad things? Because he cannot take our decisions away from us, and if we are allowed to make those decisions then it's only natural that there would be good and bad that come out of them.
It's hard for me to explain this subject because I know so much about the Bible, but I am just now getting to know how to apply all the information to my life.
So my answer is: "Why does God allow bad things?" Because he can't stop us from doing anything we want to do.

15:06:39 <+B> I am a huge fan of Taco Bell, and I think it would be cool to see it in DFW area.
15:07:21 <+B> So many people would buy food there as soon as they come out.
15:07:38 <+B> Also, maybe you can get a job at Taco Bell
15:07:48 <+B> And if the restaurant is opened in DFW area it would be really cool!
15:08:23 <+B> So please open Taco Bell in Dallas.
15:09:07 <+B> Thank you for your time and consideration of this proposal.
15:10:15 <+B> Sincerely,

We have a list of students who are applying to our school for the next semester. Most of them are transferring from other schools, but I can't help but notice that there is one student who transferred from another country. She was born and raised in America, so she should be fluent enough to take AP tests without any assistance, yet her AP test results were awful. She didn't score at all for the tests she took, even though the average score in those classes was about 4 out of 5 points. Her school counselor explained that her teachers were very good and they gave her extra help, which is why her grade point average is almost perfect despite her low scores on AP tests. She's a smart girl too.
I don't understand how she managed to be so bad at the tests when her grades in the classroom are so high. I feel like this would be more of a problem for students who don't score well on AP tests, but she was scoring A+ grades throughout the whole semester! How is it that she got an 0/5 while taking AP tests? Is there a way to tell if a student has cheated on the test or if they are just really bad at testing themselves?
Asked by Eloise,
First of all, I'm not sure about this but from what I understand it is very difficult for a student who is fluent in English and has been raised here to take an AP exam in another language. It could be that her teachers gave extra help with the language aspect of the test which is why she did so well on tests and failed them when she was given a paper and pencil format exam.
It's also possible that there were questions that tested more advanced skills than what she has learned in class, so perhaps her grades are high because she has mastered the concepts but not yet the material at a higher level. It could be an issue with how AP is structured or a problem with the school and their teaching.
I think the best way to tell if someone cheated on tests is by getting them in a room together and having them take them simultaneously under close supervision, or to check for suspicious behavior at the test center. I don't know about how easy it would be for foreign students who don't speak English fluently to take an AP test but I imagine that there are some difficulties with taking tests in other languages when you are not fluent in them yet.
I can't give you a definite answer, but hopefully this helps!

Sorry, I'm not a native speaker.
I mean how long do you wait for your AP result?
I know they will be sent to the college of students around 4th June. But I wonder when my school get mine.
My parents think I can be admitted by early action or early decision (EA/ED) if I take AP test. So it is very important that we have our AP result in time.
Any one know how long we should wait? How was your AP score?
