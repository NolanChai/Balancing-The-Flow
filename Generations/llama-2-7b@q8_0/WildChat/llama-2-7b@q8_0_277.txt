[FONT=Times New Roman][COLOR=#6748a0]Hello Panda Parents, this week has been an eventful week. The PN babies have continued to learn about family members and have also started learning about Birthdays and how to celebrate them. We have been practicing singing the birthday song and we made birthday crowns to use during our Friday birthday party dramatic role play. The PN students have been very excited with the arrival of fall and have enjoyed all the fall activities we have planned for them. They also did really well with recognizing number 1 and 2. The little pandas are also huge fans of jumping, climbing and riding bikes! Their gross motor skills and strengths continue to improve.[/COLOR][/FONT]
