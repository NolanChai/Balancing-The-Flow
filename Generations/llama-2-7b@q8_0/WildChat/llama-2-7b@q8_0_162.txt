- First I will make a long description of all the history of the XOS. I will try to give dates when possible, but sometimes you might have to make them up.
- I will include the year that it was introduced in the name. So if it was released in 1987, I would call it X-DOS (1987) or something like that.
- It is best that you describe everything you can about each system, so users know what they are getting into when using any of these systems. You should be thorough, but concise at the same time.
