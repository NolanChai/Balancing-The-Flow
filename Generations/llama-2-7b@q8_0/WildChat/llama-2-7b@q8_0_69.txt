1. Hello, my name is XYZ and I am honored to officiate your ceremony today. As you prepare to embark on this next chapter in your lives together, it's important to remember that your love will grow as long as the two of you choose it to do so.

2. Love does not consist only in gazing at each other, but also in looking outward together in the same direction.

3. I would like to congratulate both of you on choosing to spend this life with each other and wish you many more happy days ahead!
