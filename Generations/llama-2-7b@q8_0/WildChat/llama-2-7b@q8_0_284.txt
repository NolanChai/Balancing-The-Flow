Yes, the grey 18% will turn into a white 18% (it's the same as adjusting EV by +2). That's one reason why metering modes such as Matrix are more useful for general photography. With centre-weighted or spot metering, the camera tries to determine how dark the whole scene is going to be and adjusts accordingly. It tends to overexpose darker areas (that are not white) by +2 EV in order to lighten them up.

In the EXIF data, what would be recorded for the "lightness" or luminance of the scene? Would it still record as 18% grey? If so, then I have a feeling that if there is a "white balance" setting (as opposed to auto), that it may not do anything and just record whatever lightness was present in the scene.

It depends. Some cameras can measure light intensity down to 0%, but most top-end models are limited to around 15%. That means they can't pick up black as well as pure white, so if you shoot a black object that is going to be printed on black paper (or if the image is saved with zero contrast) then it'll turn out a little darker than it should.

It might be different between the camera and the software that writes the metadata though. I haven't looked at the EXIF for the picture I posted, but I am wondering if it would say 18% grey or something else, since the picture is clearly not a flat plane of 18%. It could very well be that the software wrote whatever was in the scene into the metadata (even though there is no way to record this).

I think you are right. You have to take the EXIF data with a pinch of salt, because the cameras usually read it from the sensor and can't measure pure black or white. That might mean the 18% grey in your picture isn't accurate either - although if your software has an automatic correction then you should be alright.

I guess I will have to take a picture of something that is solidly white and another one of something that is black, just to see what the EXIF data says. The only problem with this is that I can't think of anything black in my immediate area.

Well there's always your TV screen! ;)

I guess that would be about as close to pure black as I can get.
