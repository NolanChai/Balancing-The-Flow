Hi. You can find the [details on how to set up a project in Pega](https://community.pega.com/knowledgebase/articles/56001). As for the instructions on creating an Annual Statement, I'm afraid you'll have to wait until CCMS updates their documentation to include the new features they recently released.

The average size of an annual statements is about 8-10 pages depending on the complexity and the number of accounts for each investor.  We are currently using a 9x12 letter.  We also print two copies, one for the investors and one for our records.
