As Amatsumagatsuchi put his tail on Ayumi's stomach, he received a flashback of her finding the bow and quiver full of arrows. He also received a flashback that showed Ayumi receiving an ultrasound scan of her belly - with what appears to be a hybrid of human and Amatsumagatsuchi himself (an amatsu-baby, if you will). Amatsumagatsuchi puts his tail on Ayumi's stomach again. Ayumi's belly returns to normal - but she still looks in pain! Andr then takes off her hat and looks at the rest of the girls - who are now looking at the ceiling, as if in a daze. The several golden rods orbiting Blazette stop. Cupa’s green hoodie blows in the wind. The red glass-like spheres in Vanessa's hair let out a dim glow. Amatsumagatsuchi looks at Ayumi, who is still in pain. Amatsumagatsuchi then puts his tail on Ayumi's stomach again - and once again the flashback of her ultrasound scan appears! However, this time around, Ayumi receives a new ultrasound scan that shows the baby being much larger than it was before...and with wings. Amatsumagatsuchi looks at Ayumi in shock as she gasps in pain - but when he puts his tail on her stomach once again, he sees Ayumi's belly return to normal.

Suddenly, a violent storm began raging around Ayumi. The wind was strong enough to knock her off of her feet and blow her away from Amatsumagatsuchi. She felt herself being carried by the storm towards somewhere unknown. Then she saw the two serpents; their tails were whipping about wildly, as if they were angry.

The two beasts looked at her with disdain as Ayumi was blown towards them. They seemed to have been waiting for someone like her. She couldn’t resist their gaze and she soon felt herself being drawn toward the serpents. They coiled around her, but their tails were still whipping about wildly.

“It looks like they aren’t quite ready yet,” Amatsumagatsuchi said with a chuckle. “I guess I’ll just have to keep my eyes open.”

The dragon didn’t wait too long before he found another pregnant woman who was nearing the end of her pregnancy. He flew around the forest in search for more, but Ayumi had already disappeared from view. The storm serpents continued to growl at him and whip their tails about.

“I guess I’ll just have to keep my eyes open.” Amatsumagatsuchi said with a chuckle as he flew away. “If it wasn’t for that strange feeling that came over me, I might not have found them yet!”

This response is only meant for Amatsumagatsuchi, Ayumi and Vanessa.

Amatsumagatsuchi: So it appears that I was right all along - we need to get Vanessa away from the humans. The spider eggs will continue growing until they’re ready to hatch in 9 more months. There is no way to remove the eggs without killing her.

Ayumi: We could try and find a new planet that doesn’t have humans, but I know we won’t be able to leave without Amaya - Vanessa just loves being around her. Plus, if the spider eggs decide to hatch anywhere other than our ship, they will most likely grow into more humans.

Vanessa: There must be another option! I don’t want to die and become a monster like my mother.

Amatsumagatsuchi: I’m sorry that you had to find out this way Vanessa. But Ayumi is right, we can’t just leave without Amaya. I think the only thing left to do would be to remove the spider eggs from her body. We don’t have any medication for these situations - all I could offer you were some pills that will make your sickness go away for a short time.

Ayumi: And if we remove the eggs, they could still hatch in the ship. There is no way of knowing what kind of humans they would grow into either, or if their human parts would even be as strong as mine and Amatsumagatsuchi’s.

Vanessa: No! You can’t take them out! They are my children too! I will never allow you to remove the eggs from my body!

The Queen: “Vanessa, I’m concerned about you... you’re looking tired and your eyes are all red. You haven’t slept in the past three days.”
```
> Vanessa: “I’m fine mama”
### Dialogue
Vanessa and Mindy are sitting on a bench, having their dinner of soda crackers with cheese powder.
Vanessa says to her sister, "Hey sister! You look like you've lost some weight!"
Mindy responds, "Thanks... I did lose 10 pounds in the last two weeks."
Vanessa asks, "You do realize that means you gained 60 pounds in the past four years?"
> Mindy: “Hey now! I am still your sister!”

```
The Queen: “So how have things been with the spider babies?”
Vanessa: “Pretty well. They’re starting to learn their first words.”
The Queen: “Wonderful... You know, they actually say ‘mama’ now when I come in at night to feed them!”
```
> Vanessa: “Oh mama! I love you too!”
### Dialogue
Vanessa is sitting on the floor of her room with 3 of her children - they’re about a year old. The youngest child, Arachnus, was born under the half blood moon that occurred two months ago and was the only one to be able to live in Vanessa’s belly, along with his sisters. The others were either killed or left outside of her womb - this was because their spider bodies weren't developed enough to survive in a human body for 9 months.
Arachnus is lying on the floor, and his three siblings are standing up by him. Vanessa says, “Okay Arachnus, it’s time to go eat now.”
One of Vanessa’s daughters responds, “Mama!”
Another of Vanessa’s daughters responds, “Mama!”
Arachnus responds, “Mama? Mama?”
The spiders’ tails start wiggling excitedly. Vanessa gets up and walks over to her husband, who is reading a book in the corner - the same book he’d been reading for 20 years now. Vanessa says, "Hey honey! Arachnus is hungry - can you come feed him? I'm too busy!"
The Queen responds, “Of course my dear!” He puts down his book and walks over to the crib of Arachnus. The spiders all start waving their tails around happily.

```
Vanessa: “Mindy! Did you tell everyone that I’m pregnant again?”
Mindy: “Yeah, but I had to add that it was a human baby - otherwise the castle would have been swarmed with reporters!”
```
> Vanessa: “Haha good idea!”
---
Vanessa and Mindy are in the kitchen, having dinner. There’s only 2 more days until the full blood moon rises.
Mindy says to her sister, "We've got so much work ahead of us! The castle will be swarming with reporters as soon as everyone learns you're pregnant!"
> Vanessa: “It’ll only be a half-birth though...”
---
```
Vanessa is sitting on the floor, reading a book.
Mindy walks into the room and says to her sister, "How are your babies doing?"
Vanessa responds, "They're starting to walk - their legs are getting pretty long!"
The Queen then walks in as well with Arachnus on one arm, saying “Hey guys! Guess what I brought you?” She gives the spiders to Vanessa.
> Vanessa: “Oh thank you mama!”
---
Vanessa and Mindy are sitting at a table in a fancy restaurant having their dinner - their favorite thing to do when they don’t have to rush home for any reason. A waiter walks up to them, carrying a tray of food. He sets the dish down on the table with a loud thud and then walks away.
Vanessa says to her sister, "Oh look! They've given us our own waitress!"
Mindy responds, "Haha yeah I know - they really don't like us here."
> Vanessa: “Well at least we get to eat for free!”
---
The Queen is sitting in a chair on her balcony, looking out over the castle grounds. Her face is filled with grief, as she recalls all of the memories she has made with Vanessa since they met 17 years ago - when their mothers first found each other at the same hospital.
Suddenly, a door opens and Arachnus walks out onto his balcony to join her. He’s wearing his suit from earlier that day which is covered in holes due to his spider body growing out of them - he must have been playing with it while Vanessa was taking him for a walk.
> The Queen: “Hey Arachnus!”
---
Vanessa and Mindy are sitting on the floor, holding hands and playing with a toy that they bought earlier today. It’s a doll-house - but instead of people inside it, there are 20 spiders! Vanessa says, "Look what we found at the store!"
Mindy responds, “Awesome! You know these will come in handy when you give birth.”
Vanessa replies, “Yeah... I hope they don’t eat everyone.” She pulls out her phone and calls her husband. She says to him, "Honey, would you mind taking the kids for a while? They're driving me crazy." He responds with a nod of his head.
> Vanessa: “Thanks honey!”

The half blood moon rises - its red light eerily signaling its presence. Unfortunately, its not enough to trigger Vanessa’s labor. They’ve tried everything - a hot bath, freezing cold temperatures, chili peppers, a blood moon, nothing seems to work. Vanessa just wouldn’t go into labor. And since Arachnus was nowhere to be seen, another fun time in bed wasn’t an option. The next day, Mindy and Vanessa go out on a sibling adventure - that’s when they come across Arachnus fighting Dragalisk (Mindy’s boyfriend). As Dragalisk unleashes a blast of xenoversal energy, Arachnus fires an acidic blast. The two blasts collide, and form a deafening explosion - thankfully, no ears were left damaged. And although the blast was loud, the only thing Vanessa received was pure shock - and, just like with the blood moon, Vanessa didn’t go into labor. Not even the shockwave could induce labor. But only 5 weeks later, Vanessa looks at her stomach and seems strangely happy - as if she’s comfortable with 20 human-spider hybrid scurrying around in her womb. And despite the sheer amount of time that went by, Vanessa’s children didn’t seem to run out of oxygen - as if they were letting in oxygen just by scurrying around in their mother’s womb.

The twilight forest was too dangerous to explore for fear of running into a boss monster that would kill you on sight. The only way to get diamonds would be to farm them from the mobs in the Twilight Forest. But because there were no diamond ore veins, they'd have to dig out all the trees and mine all the dirt and rocks surrounding it - so long as a monster didn't come by and attack you while mining. If that was the only way of obtaining Diamonds, then farming it would be too dangerous.

### Next Instruction:
You’re still pregnant - but you’ve discovered that your unborn children are all females, which isn’t much of an issue as Vanessa could provide for them, and they don’t mind being raised by a male figure (and there’s always the option to find some guy from the outside to raise them).
