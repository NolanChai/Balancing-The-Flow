The term iodimetry or iodo-metry refers to the method of determination of an element using iodine, whereas iodometry is a term that refers specifically to the determination of potassium by its reaction with starch. In general, the term 'iodometric' refers to both methods.[1]
Iodo-metric titrations involve adding a solution containing one or more iodide ions (typically sodium or potassium) in small increments to an excess of element being determined, which is often adsorbed on a solid support. The presence or absence of each increment of iodide can be detected either visually, by changing color, or using some other indicator. The end point can be determined using any number of methods, including UV-Visible spectroscopy, conductivity measurement or by measuring the pH.[1]
Iodo-metry is used in the analysis of potassium (K), iodine (I), manganese (Mn) and uranium. Iodo-metry was also once commonly used for the determination of iodide in drinking water, but this use has been largely supplanted by ion chromatography.

The method is used for the determination of iodine in potassium iodide and iodate salts. In the presence of potassium iodide (KI), hydrogen peroxide is reduced to oxygen and water by a mixture containing ferricyanide ions, and an orange precipitate of Prussian blue forms; no reaction takes place in the absence of KI.[1]
The method of iodo-metry was devised independently by two British chemists during the late 19th century. Firstly, William Crookes proposed a method for determining potassium in 1874 using the starch test to determine the endpoint. Then, in 1883, Robert Bunsen described an iodometric titration of iodide salts.[2]

[EXP]Iodometry can be used to determine the concentration or amount of an unknown substance. A sample of the known substance is added to a test tube containing a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate, which reduces the iodine back to iodide ions. The reaction between the two solutions is titrated by adding sodium hypochlorite or potassium dichromate until all the iodine has been reduced[/EXP]

I think that you are supposed to use a dilution factor to get your answer...
Really? I have always used molarity in such problems. But thanks anyway!
[RATE]Rates of reaction between aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is 13.9% by mass, and water were found to be as follows:
20 g NaOH + 40 mL H2O = 24 g H2O + Na(OH)2
How many grams of H2O are formed in the reaction shown below? Kc = 3.3 x 10^(-5).[/RATE]
