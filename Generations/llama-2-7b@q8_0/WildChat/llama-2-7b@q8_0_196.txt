I don't know what happened here, but I tried to find a way to fix this, but no dice. If anyone else knows how to fix it, please tell me because I can't figure out how to do that.
Well, I guess this is going to be the end of this forum game since there are no more submissions at all.
I'm sorry if you were disappointed about that, but I think I had enough of it...
Oh and I'd like to say THANK YOU TO EVERYONE who participated in the forum games.
I hope we get a chance to play another forum game again soon.
Well this is getting kinda old so I am going to close the forum game section for now. If anyone would like to start a new one, then go ahead!

What was wrong with the old hookocho?!?!
i guess because it didnt have a mouth. so how did it talk then?
I'm sure there are many ways to communicate without talking. For instance, Hookocho could send telepathic messages to his brothers or other kooslangers in order to alert them of danger. Or he could simply give the Kooslanders a "stare" which they would interpret as an attack.
Why does Hookocho return?
Because the old one is broken, and the new one has a mouth to talk. Also I think that they made this episode because the Kooslanger was so cool in the first episode (Jeepers Creepers Where's Peepers)
Sorry if there are any mistakes :)

I believe they didn't make another Hookocho just for his coolness. He could have been a recurring character as well, but he's gone now that he's broken, and they are going to use the new one. I think they used him because they wanted to introduce an enemy again, so it made sense for him to be back.

Maybe he will return in a future episode?

I'm hoping Will's death won't be permanent. He is one of my favorite characters and I don't want him to leave the show.

I don't know about "permanent"... but he was definitely killed last night. It looked like a pretty gruesome murder, so I'm not sure how they would bring that character back in any realistic way. But who knows? Maybe he survived and just disappeared.

I hope they make her as bubbly and nice as in the 90s, and not like the darker version from 2013.
And I'm glad that they brought back Dexter and DeeDee to give Hookocho a lot of personality, like how she is supposed to be in the 90s.
I am glad to see them using the original voice actors for the characters! I hope the show does well.
It's great that they used their old voice actor. It feels more authentic this way.

Hiya! I'm going to try and answer the questions as best as possible, but there is still a few things that are rather vague, such as the number of episodes.
But here we go anyway!
[SPOILER]Could you give us some lines of dialog in this episode?[/SPOILER] I can't really give you any specifics without giving away what happens, so just general stuff will have to do for now:
1) [B]Ai: [/B]We should go check up on her.
2) Ai: [I]I don’t want him to be lonely anymore…[/I]
3) [B]Yuu: [/B]That's enough already! She doesn't need all this extra stress!
4) [B]Ai: [/B]It’s not her fault, Yuu. It isn't right to blame someone for an accident like that!
5) Ai: [I]What are we going to do?[/I]
6) [B]Yuu: [/B]I want this to end. I just can’t stand seeing her suffer…
7) Yuu: [I]I need to be there for you, too![/I]
8) [B]Ai: [/B]There are still a lot of things that haven't been explained yet...
9) Ai: [I]Yeah. But I don’t think he knows any better…[/I]
10) Yuu: [I]You don’t want to see her suffer, do you?[/I]
11) Ai: [I]No.[/I]
And that's about it for now. I hope this helps. ^^;
Thanks for the spoiler! I was wondering if they were going to go check on the other two girls as well, but wasn't sure. I'm curious about the ending you mentioned where one of them dies...I wonder what happens to her? Does she die because of Ai or Yuu?
Yeah it's not really a spoiler, since the characters aren't even aware that something like that is going on until later.
There will be some sort of revelation about who is actually dead and who isn't when we get further into it.
I have one more question:
Do you guys know if the series is ending anytime soon?
I asked because there are no other new episodes on Youtube right now, but I don't want to make the mistake of thinking that the show has already ended.

Jeff and Tori's reunion is interrupted when a ghostly figure appears in their bedroom. They try to discover if the haunting is related to Tori's missing father. But, when Jeff begins to see the ghost of his wife, he wonders who really needs rescuing?
The ghost of Tori's missing mother may have something to do with it.

[DESC]Peepers is a small robotic penguin which helps Dee Dee. It can turn into an ice-cream cone with his wings, and can be used as a mobile phone (the antenna). The main function of Peepers is to fly, because it has a very short distance for flying.[/DESC]
