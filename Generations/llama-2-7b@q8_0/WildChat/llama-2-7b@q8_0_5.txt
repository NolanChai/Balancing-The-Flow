Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common disorder in which the ventricles of the heart can’t keep up with the body's need for blood and oxygen. CHF occurs when the heart muscle becomes too weak or stiff to pump efficiently. As the condition progresses, fluid begins to build up in the lungs and other organs. CHF is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management. There are many different types of CHF, including valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle), and arrhythmias. The most common type of CHF is called congestive or systolic CHF. This occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs.

Survey is not a good option because it will only give results from the people who answer to survey, and there are no assurance that people will answer honestly. Health education is better as the government can provide information on how to prevent common diseases to all citizens.

The pregnant women who has not had chicken pox or rubella infection should be given a varicella vaccine, the woman at risk of getting influenza disease is eligible for influenza vaccine and all pregnant women are eligible to receive tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during every pregnancy.

Poor communication, yes but also the fact that it was an erroneous result from a lab technician that they were expecting to see “13” and not “2”. The nurse did everything she could have done right except repeating the numbers after the lab tech.
