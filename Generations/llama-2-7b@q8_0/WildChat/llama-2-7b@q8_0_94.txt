The coffee would slowly cool over time, the molecules of heat energy inside the cup (which could have been used to warm someone else) will eventually stop moving. The only way for heat death to occur is if all matter in our universe collapses into one single mass. Then that single point becomes a singularity and expands outward again, this time infinitely fast (at light speed).

Let's say we have a large room which is infinitely big and infinitely deep. We start filling the room up with a mixture of H2 and O2 and let it settle evenly throughout. For simplicity, we can assume that there are no boundaries in this room and it will eventually expand to fill the entire universe (not just our solar system).

For our first scenario, we start off by adding 10^17 H2 molecules to this room which has a volume of 1 cubic centimeter. We can also assume that there is an average temperature in this room of 0 Kelvin which is the coldest possible temperature (theoretically).

Next scenario, we have added 10^27 H2 molecules into our room with a volume of 1 cubic centimeters and at an initial average temperature of -273.15°C (-459.67°F) which is the absolute zero point (again, theoretically).

### Expected:
Eventually, after all these H2 molecules are added to our room, we should expect for a very small amount of O2 to start forming when there's an average temperature above 0 Kelvin. This is because when the average temperature is equal or below 0 Kelvin, then the reaction H2 + O2 -> H2O will not occur at all which means that there would be no water vapor in our room either. However, if you let this process continue for a very long period of time and increase the average temperature by increasing the number of molecules added, eventually you should expect to see an extremely small amount of O2 being created through this reaction even though there is still 10^27 H2 molecules in our room which is greater than 99.9% H2 molecules!

### Reason:
As the temperature continues to increase and more water vapor starts to form, eventually you should expect for some of it to condense out onto surfaces such as walls or other objects since there are no boundaries in this room (so they will expand infinitely). This means that over time, we would eventually have a surface covered with ice which is composed mostly by water and thus the average temperature at any point on Earth would be lower than 273 Kelvin or -459°C (absolute zero), causing an increase in entropy.

> When the universe was created, an infinite number of things were happening. Some things may have been very complex. These complexities could be so vast that they could not be imagined and yet were still possible. 

Boltzmann brains are the result of those possibilities. The complexities of time create a universe where each moment is equal to all others, as everything can happen in any one of these moments. One thing happening may be a small but complex event that is very unlikely. However, it did happen and it could be repeated over and over again in other universes where those small complex events could become Boltzmann Brains.

I don't think so! We are not living in a "infinite" universe, so your conclusion about the probabilities isn't valid.

### Reason:
[Suggested](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1938775/264768):

$$P = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{infinity} + \frac{1}{infinity^2}+...\rightarrow P = 0$$

I do not have enough information to make this claim. However, I am sure that there exists some probability. It is hard for me to come up with an exact number, but I am confident it exists.

What do you mean by "remember" here? It's possible to have a Boltzmann brain that remembers our universe as we are used to seeing it (i.e., with lots and lots of stars). The question is whether the average Boltzmann brain does so, and that depends on its initial conditions.

In general, no. The only way we have to reach thermal equilibrium is by removing all sources of energy from our system; this has been done for stars with the help of stellar evolution theory.

### Additional Note:
You are not allowed to add any thermal or electromagnetic insulators in between your cuvette and the environment!

The air bubbles escape and the water doesn't spill out. This is because water expands when it is heated and contracts when cooled. When an object is placed into a vacuum, the pressure on that object drops. This allows gases to be released from the water so they can expand. The surface tension of the water prevents the water itself from spilling out of the container because the molecules are too tightly packed together to allow them to escape through each other (they are not "loose").
