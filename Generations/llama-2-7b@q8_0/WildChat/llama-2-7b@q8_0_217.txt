I'm not really sure what to say... I hope you'll enjoy it. I personally don't like the ending, but that's because it's an interpretation of something I believe is a very important message in the game.

I am really enjoying it so far and it has been an awesome experience to read your work! I'm currently up to part 3/4 of chapter two and I can say that i don't like the ending either. However I am curious as to what you think will happen with Shovel Knight and Lillia once they get back to their respective worlds. I've got a theory about it but i haven't figured out how to word it yet
I haven't forgotten that there is an ongoing story in here, I was just wondering if there were any specific parts of the ending you found unsatisfying since I do not intend this as a complete translation.
But then again, I suppose it really doesn't matter whether or not you know how this ends, does it? It's just something I've been working on for quite some time now and I'm sure there are still many errors and things that need to be fixed but... Well, here it is.
I do have a few other projects in the works; I just haven't decided when or where I want to start them yet since they will all end up taking about as much time to complete as this one did.
Oh yeah I understand. Its very well written and its really interesting so i hope you get back into it at some point!
