[b][SIZE="5"]How to write a professional email in English?[/size][/b] [b][I]A business letter is not just another piece of paper you send someone.[/i][/b] It is an important means for communicating and can be used as a reference or record.
It should therefore be written professionally, with the correct language and tone. We will help you write your next professional email in English by providing some helpful tips on how to make sure that it sounds professional!
The first thing you need to do is think about what kind of letter it will be – formal or informal? A business letter should always start out as being more formal than an informal one. This means using full words rather than contractions and using a colon before each new sentence instead of using commas after every single one
It also means keeping your tone serious and avoiding any jokes unless they are completely relevant to the subject matter at hand! Remember that even if it's not always appropriate for an email, you can still use punctuation such as exclamation marks and question marks when writing a professional letter. It shows that there is someone behind these words who cares enough about what he/she says so as not to come across as too formal or cold
You should also write in short sentences since this makes them easier for people reading them on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets etc., which may cause confusion if long paragraphs are used instead
[b]How to write an OOO email in English?[/b]
[SIZE="4"]An out-of-office message is a written message that explains why the sender will not be able to answer any emails or phone calls for some time. It can also include information about how long he or she expects to be away and what people should do if they need assistance from them during this period.[/size]
[b]If you're going on vacation, it may seem like a good idea to write an OOO message before leaving so that your coworkers know not to contact you while you're gone. However, there are many ways of doing this wrong--and one big mistake is including too much information.[/b]
[b]1) Don’t make it seem like a personal problem (e..g "I am out of the country"). It might sound cute to your friends but it will give an impression that you have nothing more important than your vacation in mind when sending this letter. If possible try not mention where exactly are going, only say that you’re travelling around Europe or Asia (if you want). [/b]
[b]2) Don't include too many details about why you won't be available.[/b][b]For example: "I will not answer any emails until I get back from my trip." This is because people may think that your email address was hacked or something similar happened when they tried contacting you and couldn't reach anyone in charge of responding on behalf of the company (or person).[/b]
[b]3) Don’t worry about what others might think if there isn’t anything wrong with why you won’t answer their messages for a while.[/b][b]It is better to keep it simple by just saying "I'm not available." This will make sure that everyone understands clearly without making assumptions or having false expectations based on the tone of your message (or lack thereof).[/b]
[b]4) Make sure not to say anything about how long this situation is expected last either - unless you know exactly when things will change back.[/b][b]"I'll be away from my email until 6pm Eastern Time on Wednesday" is acceptable but does not give any specificity as far as dates go which means people might think that there could still possibly be some communication coming through before then if nothing else happens between now and next week.[/b]
[b][I]"I'll be away from my email until 6pm Eastern Time on Wednesday" is acceptable but does not give any specificity as far as dates go which means people might think that there could still possibly be some communication coming through before then if nothing else happens between now and next week.[/i][/b]
[b]5) Be careful about including other contact details or instructions for your coworkers to get in touch with you. The last thing you want is for them to feel like they're being treated like children by having their parents tell them what to do instead of taking charge themselves.[/b][b]"I’ll be checking emails every two hours during my vacation so please email me if there are any urgent issues."[/b]
[b]6) Don't try making your message sound too serious or formal by using fancy language--it may come off as pretentious instead of professional. Stick with simple words and phrases that people are more likely to understand.[/b][b]"I will be away from my email until 5:00pm EST on Friday so please feel free to contact me at anytime."[/b]
[b]7) Don’t forget about using proper grammar when writing this type of message. If you are unsure how something should be written then use a thesaurus or dictionary online (or offline if possible). For example, don't say "I will not respond to emails until I return from my trip." instead write "I am unable to reply at present".[/b][b]This is because many people tend not only misspell words but also use them incorrectly in their sentences which makes them sound unprofessional and childish.[/b]
[b]8) If you have any questions regarding what should go into an out-of-office message then please feel free to contact me at anytime. I am more than willing to help answer any of your concerns.[/b][b]"I will not reply to emails until I get back from my trip."[/b]
[b]9) Make sure that you proofread everything before sending it off because if there is a mistake then this could cause confusion or even anger on behalf of those who received the message (and probably won't respond positively).[/b][b]"I will not be checking my email until 4:00pm EST on Thursday so please contact me at that time if you have any questions."[/b]
[b]10) Be sure to check with your company policies before sending this type of message because they may have different guidelines regarding how much information should be included in an out-of-office email.[/b][b]"I will not reply to emails until I return from my trip." [/b]

[LIST][*]The first thing you should do is to write down a clear and concise subject line that states the nature of your message. It will be easier for readers to understand what they can expect from this email if they see it right away instead of having them go through all your content before even opening up the message.[*]You also need to make sure that you have a proper salutation in your OOO email which includes introducing yourself and telling people who are sending emails that there is someone else who will be responsible for responding during this time period (unless they want their
