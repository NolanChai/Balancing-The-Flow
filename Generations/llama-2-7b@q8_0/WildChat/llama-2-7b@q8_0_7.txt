*National Dog Day* was established by Animal Welfare Advocate, Author & Producer, Colleen Paige, as a way to honor dogs and recognize their positive impact on society. The holiday encourages dog owners to celebrate and appreciate their four-legged companions on August 26th every year.

Dogs are incredibly loyal and loving animals that provide us with companionship, emotional support, and unconditional love. They can also be trained to assist people with disabilities or perform tasks such as search and rescue operations. In addition to their practical uses, dogs have become increasingly popular in the entertainment industry as well, appearing in movies, television shows, advertisements, and other media.

Despite their many benefits, not all dogs are treated equally. Unfortunately, some are neglected or mistreated by their owners which can lead to physical injury, psychological distress, and even death if left untreated. As a result of this neglectful behavior towards animals it is important that we take steps to ensure that all pets have access to adequate care so they can live happy healthy lives free from suffering pain or hunger while under human supervision!
