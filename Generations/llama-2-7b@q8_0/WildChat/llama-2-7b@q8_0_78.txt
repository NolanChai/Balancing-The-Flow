Subject: Clear Documentation of Nursing Information in Accordance with the Patient Code of Rights
Dear [Interviewer],
I am writing to express my interest in the position of Nurse Technician at your organization. With over four years of experience working as a nurse technician, I believe that my knowledge and skills make me an excellent candidate for this role. My work ethic and dedication to patient care have earned me a reputation for being reliable and efficient.
In addition to providing quality patient care, I take great pride in the accuracy of my documentation. As a Nurse Technician, I consistently prioritize clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information. I am acutely aware of the importance of upholding patient confidentiality in accordance with the patient code of rights and privacy act guidelines. During my time on the unit, I frequently utilized software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documentation purposes. After each use, I took great care to log out from these platforms diligently, ensuring the utmost protection of patient confidentiality.
On one occasion, I conducted a blood sugar level check for a resident and administered the required insulin as per the instructions in Medi-Map, all under the supervision of my preceptor. The blood sugar level was in the normal limit. Following the procedure, I recorded the details in the patient's electronic file with date and time, and counter signed by the preceptor, maintaining accuracy for future reference and safeguarding patient privacy.
I have enclosed a copy of my resume for your consideration and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this role. Thank you for your time and consideration.

This response requires some research on the topic (4 scholarly references are required, not more than 7 years old). APA format is required.
The student will prepare a report that analyzes the major events of World War I as well as how those events are related to the development of modern diplomacy and international relations today. Students should look for causes of war (as in 1914), the impact of industrialization on military strategy, the role of propaganda in war efforts, and the treaties that ended hostilities. Students must also focus on the creation of new states after World War I and the relationship between imperialism, nationalism, and revolutions in those times. The final paper should be 5–6 pages double-spaced in APA format.
The purpose of this assignment is to identify your strengths as a writer (rhetorical style and effectiveness) using information from an actual audience analysis survey. You will examine the results of an audience analysis conducted for you by your classmates, as well as the textbook author and publisher's recommended readership demographics.
The textbook authors recommend that the following readership characteristics should be considered when writing:
Written for an undergraduate or graduate student majoring in public relations or communication (either a general course on rhetoric or an introductory writing course) who has taken freshman-level composition and/or technical writing.
You will use this information to make observations about your own strengths as a writer, and what areas may need some improvement before you begin your final paper assignment in Week 8. You should consider the following questions:
Is the content appropriate for the reader? What does an audience analysis survey tell me about my intended readers/audience? Are these characteristics similar to mine or different? How are they similar or dissimilar? In what ways will I need to adapt my writing style and tone to ensure it is effective? (You do not have to be the same age, gender, race, etc., as your audience, but you should consider this when deciding how best to adapt your writing style.)
Does the content address their needs, interests, concerns, or problems? In what ways does my own background/experience affect my ability to write for my intended audiences? What areas do I need improvement in before writing my final assignment in Week 8? How can I best address these issues and concerns?
In the Week 2 Assignment, you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation to describe the different elements of rhetorical style. In this assignment, you will prepare and present your rhetorical analysis.
Your presentation should address the following:
Identify a current event or an issue from the news (something that is relevant today) that your audience cares about. This could be anything—from an issue in politics, to sports, to entertainment, etc., as long as it's something that interests them and has been covered by some type of media outlet.
Create a PowerPoint presentation, or Prezi (whichever you prefer) that includes the following:
The name(s) of the person(s), group, organization, company, corporation, etc., that the rhetoric is attempting to influence and persuade.
The main point or argument they are making in their presentation (what do they want me to think, believe, feel, do, or agree with?)
An analysis of how they appeal to ethos by describing who the speaker is and why I should care about what he/she has to say on this issue? You may need to describe your speaker's credentials as a public figure. What makes him/her credible and trustworthy? How does their background, experience, or training influence how you perceive his/her opinion on the topic at hand (ethos)?
How is pathos being used in this rhetorical situation by identifying any emotional appeals being made to me as an audience member? For example, do they use stories about people who have been affected by this issue or event that make me feel something specific and personal towards their argument on this topic (pathos)?
How does logos fit into the presentation? Identify any logical appeals being used in their argumentative process. This could include statistics, facts, data points, etc., but it's also important to remember how they connect those facts with emotional appeals and other persuasive techniques (logos).
You must incorporate at least one image into your presentation (anything from a screenshot of a website to an actual photograph), as well as include the speaker's name(s) or title(s) on every slide. You do not need more than two slides for each rhetorical element (ethos, pathos, and logos).
Your presentation should be 10–12 slides long with one slide per rhetorical element in the Week 2 assignment description above.

In the case study scenario, the client was a man in his early 20s who presented with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. Upon physical examination, the nurse noticed that the patient’s heart rate was elevated and his lungs were congested. The nurse correctly identified the client as experiencing an asthma attack, and took prompt action to provide him with appropriate care.
The first step taken by the nurse in treating the patient was to administer oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula. This was an appropriate response as oxygen is essential for people who are experiencing respiratory distress, such as those with asthma attacks. By providing the client with supplemental oxygen, the nurse helped improve his oxygenation and alleviate some of the symptoms he was experiencing.
Next, the nurse correctly administered an inhaler containing bronchodilators to help relax the patient’s airways and make it easier for him to breathe. Bronchodilators are medications that can be used to treat asthma attacks by opening up the airways and making it easier for air to flow in and out of the lungs. By using an inhaler with a bronchodilator, the nurse helped reduce the patient’s airway inflammation and ease his respiratory distress.
After administering oxygen therapy and a bronchodilator inhaler, the nurse correctly evaluated the client’s response to these treatments. By closely monitoring the client’s vital signs, including his heart rate and blood pressure, as well as checking on how he was feeling after receiving treatment, the nurse was able to determine whether or not the treatments were effective in improving the patient’s condition.
If the nurse had not correctly identified the patient as experiencing an asthma attack and treated him with appropriate medications, his condition could have rapidly deteriorated, leading to serious health complications or even death. By promptly identifying the patient’s symptoms and providing effective care, the nurse helped prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from arising.
Overall, this case study highlights the importance of nurses being able to quickly identify and treat patients with acute respiratory distress disorders such as asthma attacks. By taking prompt action and using appropriate medications and interventions, nurses can help ensure that patients receive the care they need to improve their condition and avoid serious health complications.
In conclusion, the case study scenario presented in this assignment is a real-life example of how effective communication can help prevent potential safety risks in the workplace. In the scenario, a nurse was concerned about her patient’s oxygen levels being too high despite them not increasing during the shift. The patient was admitted to the hospital with an altered mental status and difficulty breathing. The nurse had been working for two hours without any interruptions, which allowed her to observe changes in the patient’s vital signs over time.
When confronted with this situation, it is important that nurses take a proactive approach to communication by recognizing the potential risks of high oxygen levels and taking appropriate action. In this scenario, the nurse identified the problem early on, which allowed her to make an informed decision about what steps should be taken next.
The nurse’s decision-making process was well-informed by both her experience with similar situations as well as knowledge gained through professional development courses such as those provided by CMSA and AACN. The nurse recognized that high oxygen levels could indicate a potential safety risk, so she took steps to ensure patient safety by consulting other members of the healthcare team and following established protocols for managing patients with altered mental statuses or difficulty breathing due to lung diseases such as COPD or pneumonia.
By taking proactive steps towards communication and recognizing potential risks before they occur, nurses can help ensure patient safety while maintaining their own personal well-being in challenging work environments. Properly identifying potential risks allows for timely interventions which prevent accidents from happening in the first place rather than waiting until it’s too late to act upon them; this is especially important when dealing with patients whose conditions may worsen quickly without appropriate care being provided immediately after identification of a problem area (e.g., high oxygen levels).
In summary, effective communication between healthcare providers plays an essential role in preventing potential safety risks from occurring within hospitals or other medical settings where nurses work every day. By recognizing potential hazards early on through proper identification procedures followed by prompt action taken based upon knowledge gained through education programs such as those offered by CMSA and AACN along with years of experience working alongside colleagues who share similar values when it comes protecting both patients’ lives along with their own personal wellbeing at work!

The patient refused to take his morning medications on time and the patient was particularly agitated. The patient has a history of dementia, mental disorder and an addiction problem. He has been admitted in the hospital for a month now due to his medical condition that was exacerbated by his substance abuse. I decided to give him space and time to calm down. Later on, I explained the need for taking the medication on time, how its help his conditions and the possible consequence if he will not take them. I understood that it was within his right to refuse the medication. And this was informed to my preceptor. Therefore, I documented his refusal to take his medication, handed it over to the next shift and reminded them to update with the GP when they are available. make it to  words
