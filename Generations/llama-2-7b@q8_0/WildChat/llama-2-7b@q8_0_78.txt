(I gave birth to a baby girl and named her Yuri. Just like me, she has green eyes and curly hair. And just like me too, the doctors told us that sheâ€™s a quadruplet - but there was no way I could carry four babies at once. Even though Sayori was upset about not having another baby after my birth, I was happy to be able to help her achieve her dream.)
