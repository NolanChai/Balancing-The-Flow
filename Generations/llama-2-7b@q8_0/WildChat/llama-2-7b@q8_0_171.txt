Comment: Thanks a lot! I'm using SQL Server 2008 and it works great! I only have to replace the 'VALUES ('geely/atlas', '/a/', 'dvigatel') AS t (cat_url, separator, alt_url)' with the query you provided.

Comment: It works only for first letter of catalog name.
How can i do it for all letters?

Answer: I have found solution in http://code.google.com/p/oracledb2011-samples/source/browse/trunk/src/dba_lateral.sql
It's working perfectly and in few seconds!
