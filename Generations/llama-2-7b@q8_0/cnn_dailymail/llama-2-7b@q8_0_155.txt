ers, researchers believe the tracks are evidence that they walked on water as their habitat was gradually flooded by rising sea levels.
The newly discovered trackways are among more than 300 dinosaur footprints found near Lake Koro Mit'i in the Bolivian Amazon, first identified by a local indigenous guide in the early 1970s, said University of Portsmouth paleontologist Richard Butler, who co-led an expedition to the site last year.
"These tracks are spectacular," Butler told LiveScience. "They're not just footprints running up a wall, but hundreds of footprints in a single strata."
Dinosaur footprints have been found at various places around the world, from China to Alaska. But these particular tracks are the first found in South America and among the few discovered that indicate dinosaurs walked on water.
The discovery was made during an expedition led by Butler with researchers from the University of Cambridge and Bolivian universities, as well as local guides.
Footprints were identified along a 3-mile (4.8 kilometers) section of rock face that forms part of a series of cliff faces along a narrow strip of land between the lake and the Amazon River, Butler explained. The tracks run in two separate directions up the rocky slope at an almost vertical angle, with some footprints appearing to be walking on top of other sets.

Because they run parallel with the cliffs, the researchers believe the tracks were made as the area was gradually flooded by rising sea levels, rather than the animals climbing up cliff faces to escape the rising waters. The team suspects that when the dinosaurs wandered out onto waterlogged land, their feet sank into muddy ground and they struggled to gain traction on the unstable surface.

"When you walk through wet sand or soft dirt, your foot just sinks in," Butler said. "If you've got big pads on your feet and they're not necessarily pointing forward — like the dinosaurs had — it makes them even worse."
The researchers believe these prints may have belonged to a sauropod such as Argentinosaurus (meaning "big lizard from Argentina"), one of the largest land animals ever known. These animals were not particularly fleet-footed, with Butler saying that it's more likely they would waddle or amble rather than run when traveling through muddy terrain.
The tracks are also evidence of an ancient sea level rise that occurred around 10 million years ago, which flooded the area and led to the formation of Lake Koro Mit'i. The area is now a dry desert with no signs of water, but Butler said that if the area was still connected to the lake it would have formed part of an island.
"There are lots of islands that are quite small in the Amazon, so there would have been very little vegetation and they would be able to walk around them," he explained. "We think that's what these animals were doing — wandering across this drying-up landscape looking for food or mates."
The researchers will now return to the site for further work, including studying a 12-foot (3.7 meters) long fossilized tail that was found during last year's expedition, Butler said. The tail is part of an Argentinosaurus specimen and was identified by experts at London's Natural History Museum, he added.
"It's not often you get a complete dinosaur tail — it's like finding the tip of a unicorn," he said.
