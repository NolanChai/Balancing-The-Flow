 asked his mother not to make him leave for the day, she was perplexed and hurt by her son's rejection of what had been such a positive part of his young life.
The Hales are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The family was preparing to move from their tiny farm community to a new home in town, so Cameron would have better access to public schools for his middle school and high school years. But Cameron didn't want to leave behind his beloved first-grade teacher and the classmates who had become friends that year.
So the Hales came up with a plan: They decided they could homeschool their son on weekdays, while he still attended school for religion classes, music lessons, choir practice and other activities in which Cameron was involved.
For years afterward, Cameron's father, Kevin, would tell people about the remarkable year when his son had to learn the hard way that being happy meant finding a balance between all the important parts of life: family, friends, school and church.
Cameron Hale died last month at age 20 in a car crash along Interstate 5, just outside Portland. He was returning from Oregon State University, where he was a junior studying computer science with plans to become an electrical engineer or work as a software developer.
His death devastated his parents and family, including his younger brother, Cody. Cameron's mother, Leann Hale, wrote on Facebook that her son "was full of joy."
"He would make you laugh when you didn't think it was possible to laugh," she said in another post. "He was a special kid."
But even as Leann and Kevin Hale mourned their boy, they found themselves turning back the pages of Cameron's life for inspiration and comfort -- especially his first-grade year, when he learned that there were limits to how much happiness each one of us can experience.
Cameron was a little shy when he started kindergarten in 2004, but by the time he began first grade, he'd found his place at school and had become an active leader among his classmates. He loved to sing and dance with them, Leann Hale recalled in a phone interview from her home in Starbuck, Minnesota.
But Cameron didn't have a single close friend that year: "He wanted friends so badly," she said. And he struggled to keep up with the other students in their class because of an undiagnosed learning disability -- though his parents were unaware of this at the time.
Kevin Hale, who works as a project manager and software engineer for Microsoft, remembers being startled by how quickly Cameron's teacher grew to love his son and his whole family. "She had the toughest-to-teach class," he said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday night.
"It was very rare that we got a phone call from her, and it wasn't good news when she did. But I remember getting one day, right at the end of first grade, when Cameron asked to stay home and not go to school. I think this was May of 2005."
The Hales realized then that their son needed help with his learning disability; they had never noticed it before because he worked so hard to keep up with the other students. They eventually discovered a solution for Cameron's struggles, but by then, the damage was done: His first-grade teacher wrote him an emotional note that year, explaining how she'd fallen in love with the little boy and his family.
"I will remember you always as my 'little man,' " she wrote. "You have taught me many things this year."
Hale said he thinks Cameron was too young to recognize that his teacher had a crush on him, but Leann Hale knew it all along. She decided not to share the note with her son until after he graduated high school and left for college -- when Cameron was old enough to laugh at himself.
The letter arrived in a box of belongings from first grade that Leann kept over the years. The parents eventually shared the story of their son's crush on social media, posting excerpts from the note with photographs of it. They said they were not seeking publicity for themselves or their dead son; instead, they wanted to share a simple message about being happy that Cameron had learned in first grade:
"Live your life to the fullest and be happy," he wrote at the end of his letter. "Don't worry too much, because things will work out."
Hale said she and her husband believe their son was trying to teach them the same lesson when he decided not to leave school altogether after first grade -- even though it meant sacrificing a little happiness for himself. He found that balance at age 12, when Cameron started attending public middle school near his home in Washington state.
"I think he wanted us to see that he could do it," Hale said. "He had to sacrifice some things, but he knew that his happiness came from within him. That was the message -- and it's a message we try to share with everybody."
