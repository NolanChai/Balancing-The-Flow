― captured on a cell phone by a witness ― emerged showing the officer firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he ran from him, according to police and prosecutors.
Slager initially told investigators that he opened fire during a foot pursuit after suspecting Scott of stealing his Taser. But police later determined that Scott was unarmed and had no connection to the stolen weapon.
The arrest came less than 24 hours after North Charleston Mayor R. Keith Summey condemned Slager in a news conference, saying he believed “it’s obvious” there would be criminal charges filed against him. The video was also released on Tuesday night to the public and quickly went viral.
The video shows Scott running away from police, and then Slager firing his weapon at him from behind as he runs ― eight shots in total, according to a source familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. The last three rounds appear to hit Scott while he lies on the ground motionless.
“I shot him,” Slager said on the tape. “I told him to stop running … I told him to get on the ground. He kept coming. That’s when I fired my weapon.”
Scott was unarmed and had no connection to a Taser reported stolen from an officer in December, North Charleston Police Department Chief Eddie Driggers said at a news conference on Wednesday. The witness’ video showed that Scott had nothing in his hands as he ran away after the initial exchange of words between him and Slager, according to police.
“The victim was unarmed when he ran from (Slager) … There is no evidence at this time to support an officer involved shooting,” Driggers said. “Therefore, I am ordering a full criminal investigation.”
A law enforcement official told CNN that the officer’s account of events were different than what was seen in the video. Slager said he fired his weapon after Scott took off running and tried to get out of his vehicle with the Taser, the source said. But in the video, Scott appears to be walking away from Slager when the shots are heard.
The official could not immediately say why there were differences between the two accounts. It is unclear what prompted Slager to start chasing Scott and why he fired his weapon.
CNN affiliate WCBD reported that Scott’s relatives said that he was returning to his car from work when he was confronted by a police officer. He tried to get back in his car but the officer wouldn’t let him, his family told reporters.
Slager was placed on administrative leave after Tuesday’s shooting and is expected to be terminated, according to Driggers. The city’s police department has about 300 officers, he said.
A source familiar with the investigation said that Slager had been an officer in North Charleston for four years and was assigned to a patrol unit. He was also recently awarded Officer of the Year honors at the station, according to a Facebook post from November.
Slager’s attorney, Andy Savage, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on Wednesday. North Charleston Mayor Summey declined to answer questions about how the incident unfolded or who fired the shots, citing that it was an “open investigation.”
The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which is leading the probe into Tuesday’s shooting, had previously said in a statement that the department received “a call for service and located one of its officers that had been involved in a struggle with another person over a Taser.”
Slager was transporting Scott to a local hospital for treatment after the incident when he stopped at a gas station to use the restroom, according to Summey. The mayor said that Slager told investigators that he “was not pursuing or chasing this person” and that it appeared that Scott had been injured in another altercation with police.
“I am sickened by what I saw and have asked the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division to immediately investigate,” Summey said. He added that Slager’s actions were “inhumane, uncaring and absolutely unnecessary.”
The video was captured on a cell phone by Feidin Santana, who told CNN he was driving back from work when he saw Scott walking down the street after an apparent altercation with police.
Santana said in an interview that he first noticed Scott because his feet were bleeding ― apparently from being run over by a car, according to the mayor’s news conference ― and “he looked like something was wrong with him.” As Santana drove up to a red light, he saw another man run away and get into his vehicle.
“He was driving in my direction,” Santana said, adding that at first he thought there might be more than one person involved in the incident. Santana then continued down the street until he reached an intersection where police had blocked off traffic. That’s when he pulled over to record video with his cell phone and called 911.
He said that when he saw a man on the ground with blood coming from his ears, he thought it was “too much” and called 911 again. He didn’t know at first if Scott had been hit by a vehicle or shot in the head. But Santana said he didn’t want to get out of his car because he worried that people would think he did something wrong.
“I was afraid they were going to do me something,” Santana said, adding that he was “scared.”
In the video, Santana can be heard saying on a call with 911 that Scott was shot by an officer and asking the dispatcher if there had been another shooting in town.
“He’s shot! He’s shot!” Santana is heard yelling as he gets out of his vehicle to approach Slager, who is holding Scott by the shirt near a fence. “Yo, you just killed him.”
Santana said that Slager didn’t say anything in response and he asked if police had given him CPR. Santana also told authorities that Scott was unarmed when he was shot.
“He said no,” Santana can be heard saying on the call with 911. “No, he just run … He don’t have nothing.”
Slager can then be seen walking back toward his cruiser and picking up something from the ground.
Santana said that in the days after the incident, officers approached him several times to ask what happened. After receiving no response from Slager or other police officers, he went back to the gas station where the shooting occurred and reviewed more footage he took with his cell phone. He then contacted police officials last night and gave them all of his video evidence, according to his attorney, Chris Stewart.
Stewart said Santana’s goal in speaking out now is to provide the “complete story” about what happened Tuesday morning.
“I hope he’s remembered for bringing this out,” he said.
