zzie and Johnnie Show last night when she revealed how a close relative had taken the £1000 donated to her from friends and neighbours after her seventh miscarriage at 34 weeks.
Dawn said: 'I have been in touch with my family and they are willing to return it. I just feel so let down by them.' Johnnie Hayes then asked the mother-of-five why she felt the need for a grave stone if it was only for her and not her baby. The grieving mum replied: 'I don't think anyone should be judged about that, but it is really important to us.'
Dawn's friends set up an online fundraising page so they could buy a headstone at St. Peter’s Cemetery in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. However the money was removed from her PayPal account by her brother without Dawn knowing about it. She said: 'It is more upsetting than anything else because we've been told all this time that everything has been OK and they have been fundraising for us - it's hurt me, it's made me very angry.'
The grieving mother revealed on the show that she had her first child at 14-years-old and later lost three babies. Dawn also said that after giving birth to another miscarried baby, her ex-partner told her not to look for a headstone as 'there was no point'. She added: 'We were going through the process of getting our daughter's name on it.'
When asked how she felt about her brother stealing the money, Dawn replied: 'I think I am disgusted because we have been trying so hard to move forward - it is really upsetting.' Johnnie told Dawn that he understood her frustration and said: 'People were very generous in wanting to help you in a time of need. I hope they are returned to the people who raised them and if not, then they must be held for your baby's grave stone - it would be disgraceful if anything else.'
What do you think about Johnnie Hayes' response? Would you return the money or leave it?
