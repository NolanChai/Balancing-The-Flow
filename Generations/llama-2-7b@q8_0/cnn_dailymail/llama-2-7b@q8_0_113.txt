 week after Sheen's public meltdown prompted concerns about his behavior in front of the cameras.
Production on the CBS series was suspended this month amid reports that Sheen had gone off the rails. He has been hospitalized twice in California for what his representative said were "exhaustion and dehydration."
"I'm still focused on getting better," he wrote, adding a photo of himself wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette while sitting by a pool. "That's all that matters."
The actor was taken to UCLA Medical Center after what his representatives called an "unusual incident" at his Los Angeles home. On Tuesday, Sheen was admitted to the hospital for observation after being released from police custody earlier in the day on $81,000 bail, CBS affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported.
Sheen had been arrested on charges of misdemeanor assault stemming from an incident with his wife, Brooke Mueller Sheen, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department statement.
The sheriff's department said Thursday that the case is being forwarded to prosecutors for review of charges.
In the Twitter postings on Thursday morning, Sheen described his current state as "fragile but resilient." He also wrote: "I will be back with a vengeance -- I've got my eye on you ... You can run but not hide from the pain that you feel inside. #winning"
He said in another post that he was "deeply ashamed" about the events that led to his being arrested and hospitalized for a week, saying it had become clear over time "that I am indeed a sick man." He also tweeted a link to an interview with CBS's "The Early Show" from October 2010 in which he talked openly about battling addiction.
Sheen is scheduled to appear before a judge on the misdemeanor assault case Friday afternoon, said Deputy District Attorney Lisa Bell. Sheen had been taken into custody by Los Angeles police after Mueller called 911 Tuesday night to report that her husband was threatening to kill her in their home, according to the district attorney's office.
Mueller told officers that "Sheen has a history of violent behavior," and he needed to be taken into custody, Los Angeles police Detective Chris Barling wrote in an affidavit. Mueller was not injured. Sheen was booked on suspicion of misdemeanor spousal battery with corporal injury and was released Tuesday afternoon after posting bail, authorities said.
The "Two and a Half Men" episode that aired this week featured Sheen in character as Charlie Harper. In the show, his character is seen drinking heavily while ranting about his recent firing by the network for being "winning." During the opening credits of the episode, the name of the show was changed to "Two and a Half Men" with Ashton Kutcher in place of Sheen.
CBS has not announced any plans yet regarding Sheen's status on the series, which he's been starring in for eight seasons. The network has already ordered more episodes than originally planned, so it could have no choice but to continue the show without him if he fails to return by mid-March.
The actor's personal life and drug problems have made headlines since his role on "Two and a Half Men" became one of television's biggest success stories in the late 2000s, catapulting Sheen into stardom and earning him more than $1 million per episode.
The actor was fired from the show after publicly criticizing series creator Chuck Lorre on his Twitter account. Sheen later told ABC's "Good Morning America" that he regretted what he had said, adding he would not have been so reckless if it were not for his addiction to prescription pain medication.
Sheen has admitted in the past to struggling with substance abuse problems and was diagnosed as bipolar at age 19. He has been open about his drug use in interviews, saying that he is a recovering addict but does not consider himself an alcoholic because he does not drink every day.
On Wednesday, Sheen's mother spoke out for the first time since her son's arrest and subsequent hospitalization, saying she was worried about his health.
"I am very concerned about Charlie at this point in time," Janet Sheen told reporters as she left a court appearance with Mueller, CNN affiliate KABC reported. "He is very sick."
Sheen's recent problems have led to speculation that he may be fired from the show and replaced by Kutcher, who has expressed his willingness to fill the role of Sheen's character. Kutcher said in a tweet Wednesday morning that he would "love" to take over if asked.
Sheen also had a guest role on NBC's "30 Rock." His character on that show, who was named after him, was killed off last month after Sheen admitted he is HIV positive in an interview with the National Enquirer.
