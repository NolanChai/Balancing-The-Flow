Lampard left to join New York City on loan last month, but still gets to wear his beloved Chelsea shirt when he pulls it on for the Major League Soccer outfit.
Terry told Sky Sports: "I was sitting down with him [on Monday]. It's just strange because I don't know whether he was going to come back in and sit down or whether it wasn't the right time to discuss things but it is.
"We were both there for 18 years and have had great times together, so hopefully we can look forward and move on."
Lampard, who has spent the summer at his family home in Surrey, has been training with NYCFC this week and will make his debut on Saturday as they take on Orlando City SC.
Terry said: "We were out of town together, he was staying here so we used to go up to the gym every day and have our little meetings in there. We had great times but I don't want him to leave."
