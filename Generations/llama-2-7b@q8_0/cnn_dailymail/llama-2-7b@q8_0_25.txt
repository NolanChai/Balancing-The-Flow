 Fat Gypsy Wedding is on trial after allegedly breaking into the home of a widow and stealing her jewellery.
A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding is on trial after allegedly breaking into the home of a widow and stealing her jewellery.
Joshua "King" Gray, 30, is accused of kicking down the front door of the pensioner's house in Birmingham, where he stole two gold rings worth £4,500 and a bracelet worth £1,650. He was arrested at a friend's home days later after police found his DNA on the jewellery boxes.
The reality TV star, who is known for his "magnificent" diamond ring, also wears gold signet rings with the words 'My wife' and 'Love you'.
Gray, from Small Heath, Birmingham, denies burgling the home of widow Elizabeth Davies in the early hours of November 1 last year.
The court heard Gray, who has been on the show twice before, was stopped by police two days later after officers found his DNA on a pair of jewellery boxes which had been stolen from Mrs Davies' home.
During questioning he said he knew nothing about the burglary but had spent a night at a friend's house and that the items could have been there before he arrived, Birmingham Crown Court was told.
Gray also claims he is "very close" to one of Mrs Davies' grandchildren - but admits they are not on good terms after an argument over his relationship with her daughter. He also denies causing actual bodily harm to the young man in 2016, saying it was self defence after he had been attacked with a baseball bat.
