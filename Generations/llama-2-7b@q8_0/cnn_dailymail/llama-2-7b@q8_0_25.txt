A Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail last December and is now being held in Insein Prison in Rangoon (formerly Yangon). The former Royal Navy officer had set up the Red Lion Bar in Yangon with a partner and had put an image of a lion on its sign which was deemed by authorities to be offensive to Buddhist monks. He has been described as having ‘fallen through the cracks’ and the Foreign Office have now said that it will no longer be providing consular services for Blackwood, who is believed to be in poor health.
Blackwood had also fallen victim to a crackdown by authorities on bars, cafes and restaurants using religious images as advertisements after monks went on a rampage during anti-government protests in September 2007. Blackwood was one of more than 35 people who received lengthy jail terms for charges related to the incident, with at least two others being given the death sentence and another ten receiving life sentences. The British Embassy in Rangoon has confirmed that Blackwood is still in prison but has not responded as to why its consular services were no longer available to him.
