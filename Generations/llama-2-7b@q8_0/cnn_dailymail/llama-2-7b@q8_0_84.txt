use Facebook to see what my friends are doing; rather I stare at the screen with a blank expression as the pictures of happy people dancing, eating and having fun on the beach bring back memories that make me weep.
I'm not alone: Last year 173,048 people were killed in Syria. Every day, around 1,600 innocent lives are lost to violence -- more than 550 of them children.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), almost half a million refugees have fled Syria for neighboring countries and Europe. Those who can't afford the journey cross over into Lebanon illegally through the Beqaa Valley. They enter the country with nothing but the clothes on their backs, a few pieces of luggage -- if they are lucky enough to have any at all -- and their memories of home.
For the first time in my life I woke up each morning feeling grateful for everything: water running from my faucet, food on my table, clean air filling my lungs. I spent a few minutes with my grandparents before they left for work. My mom made me tea and eggs. Life was as normal as it could be in the Beqaa Valley at that moment -- which is saying quite a lot.
Those memories of everyday life are what I cling to now, while trying to forget the other images: bombs, dead bodies lying on streets littered with glass and blood; burnt-out cars, buildings and houses.
At night when sleep doesn't come easily, I remind myself that I am alive, that I have a home where I can return after this crisis. Some 10 miles away in the Syrian capital, Damascus, there are hundreds of thousands who don't feel safe -- even at home.
I try not to think about it: How my friends' bodies were blown apart; their lifeless limbs scattered on the streets for days.
In this year I have become a stranger to myself.
A few months ago, I took a trip into Syria with a friend from Damascus and met up with another friend in Hama. The city was destroyed. We couldn't take pictures because it was so sad, too many people had lost loved ones -- our friends included. There were still bodies under the rubble; survivors were homeless and hungry.
The Syrian government is fighting to keep control of the country with tanks, machine guns and helicopters. Innocent people are dying every day as they try to get food or medication from one city to another. They are killed by snipers in their own neighborhoods and targeted while fleeing.
Somehow this war has become a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United States on the one side -- and Russia, Iran and Syria's ally Hezbollah on the other. The Syrian government is supported by the militias of Lebanon's Hezbollah group as well as by Shiite Muslim fighters from Iraq.
The opposition is made up of rebels trained and armed mostly by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. They include al-Qaeda and its offshoots such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Jabhat al Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate that has pledged allegiance to the terrorist group's leader Ayman Zawahri.
I have come to realize that we don't share a language with those on the other side of this war but we all feel the same pain -- loss and fear, anguish and suffering.
But still the fighting goes on. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about my friends: how are they getting food? How safe is their neighborhood at night? Are they even alive?
The last time I spoke to him he was scared -- scared for himself, his family and everyone else caught in this war. The bombs have hit his house again; he said there were 30 of them the previous day. He can't get any medication to treat his asthma because it is too dangerous to leave his home and go out into the streets.
I try not to think about him: If he survived this last attack, will he die from lack of medical care or a stray bullet? And if I lost contact with him how can I find out what happened to him? The Syrian government is blocking telephone services across the country and no one seems to be able to do anything about it.
I have a lot of questions for those who are fighting in this war, but most importantly: What's your goal -- for us, for Syria and for you? And how will you achieve it? Will we ever know peace again?
Sometimes I wish the world could forget that my country even existed. Maybe then no one would care about what happens there or if it ends in a complete destruction. But every day my friends die -- innocent people, not fighters, not extremists. They are just ordinary men and women who have nowhere else to go, nowhere to hide, no way to protect themselves from those with the weapons.
The Syrian government is trying to portray its army as a legitimate military fighting for peace in my country -- but it's all lies. The reality of this war is so horrible that if we were watching it on TV I would be shocked and disgusted, because how can anyone do this? How could the world sit back and watch us kill each other while they watch from their homes?
I don't care who started it or who is winning; all I want right now is for Syrians to stop killing other Syrians. But we are so far away from peace that no one seems even interested in talking about how to achieve it, what the consequences of such a decision would be and how long it will take to get there.
We need our politicians on both sides -- yes, I said "both sides," because I don't want to see more people dying just so we can have one side win -- to start working toward a peaceful solution. We must stop this bloodshed. If not, Syria will end up like my parents' generation, who lost their homeland to civil war and the Israeli occupation.
We all have families, homes, jobs that are important to us. This is why we fight -- so that we can live in peace without losing our loved ones, and be able to go on with our lives.
I feel like I'm living in a black-and-white world while the rest of the world sees my country as if it were in color. I wish they could see what I do: We are just people trying to live normal lives without dying because of senseless violence.
Every day we wake up and hope that this will be our last. The only thing Syrians can count on is each other -- not the government, or the United Nations; not even international aid agencies. No one cares about us. We are just a number in a statistic. That's why I started writing letters to my friends and family telling them that they must never forget what we went through.
It's a new year, but Syria is still the same: Full of death, bloodshed and violence. There has been no progress toward peace, despite the international community's efforts -- even those from its own citizens who have worked to create dialogue between all sides. All I can do now is hope for an end to this senseless war in 2014.
I want to go back to Syria and live in my homeland once again, but how will I ever be able to do that if it continues to bleed?
