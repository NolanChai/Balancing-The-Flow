Shapiro is the man who won OJ Simpson’s murder case in court and whose own career path would make for interesting viewing as part of an HBO or ESPN documentary: he was born in Brooklyn, served in the US Navy during World War 2, became a lawyer, won the Simpson trial, had to take a break from his legal work due to health issues but came back and now runs a law firm and is still involved in philanthropic causes.
If Shapiro’s CV were turned into a movie it would probably be better than The Godfather, which is why Pacquiao was so happy when the man himself sent him a personalised bottle of wine to congratulate his Filipino friend on making the fight against Mayweather possible.
“He sent me a signed bottle of wine,” said Pacquiao in an interview with GMA News TV, via BoxingScene.com. “I was really happy because it’s very special for me and I will always keep that as my gift from him.”
Pacquiao is now 36 years old so his career is approaching its twilight but he has every intention of retiring with his reputation intact.
He said: “I don’t want to go out and lose against a boxer who doesn’t have the heart or determination like me because I believe my fighting days are not yet over.”
