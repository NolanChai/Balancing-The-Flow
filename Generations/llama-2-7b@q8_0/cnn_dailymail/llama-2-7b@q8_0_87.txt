E-tourism is a term used to describe the use of electronic communication technologies in the travel industry. In today's fast-paced society, online booking has become second nature for many people and more than 10 million holidays are now bought by e-mail, with nearly half of all travellers doing their research online before making a decision.
Tourism boards such as the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing have also caught on to this new trend, offering virtual tours of Dubai's attractions from your own computer or smartphone, providing you with an insight into what to expect when you finally arrive in the country.
Tourists can now discover more than 20 different destinations around the world via the Dubai Department Of Tourism and Commerce Marketing website
A new virtual travel agent has also been launched by a company called Travelocity, which allows prospective holidaymakers to search for and book flights, car hire and hotels - all from your desktop or mobile phone.
While this is an incredible service for people who are short on time, it's also important that you do some research before making any big decisions. This is where virtual tourism comes in handy. Virtual tours of attractions are a great way to get an idea of what something looks like - without having to travel all the way there!
So why not try out this exciting new trend for yourself? Here, we've selected five amazing virtual tourist sites around the world that will help you make up your mind...
