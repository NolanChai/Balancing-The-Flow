19th century aristocratic status – their lives are about to cost when he develops a mysterious illness.
Fast-forward through the next few decades and Samuel is now at Oxford University, where he has been for more than two years. He’s already had to abandon one degree course and he doesn’t appear to be getting any closer to finishing his studies. And then he collapses on a street in Paris with no idea what happened.
‘The Man Who Spoke Snakish,’ by Andrus Kivirähk, is a wondrous fairy tale-like fantasy that could be described as the Finnish equivalent of ‘Harry Potter’ – except it isn’t aimed at children. It won the prestigious Finlandia Prize for fiction in 2013 and has already been translated into over a dozen languages.
The story is set in medieval Estonia, where many people believe that snakes can speak to humans. In fact, the language they use is known as Snakish.
At this point, it’s probably necessary to explain why Samuel Dymott is such an important character for his parents and family to save. Well, he was born with a rare disease that only affects five people in every generation. This disease has always affected men – and the symptoms include loss of speech as well as paralysis of facial muscles.
Samuel’s condition is worsening over time and he is unable to speak properly or walk. He can no longer study at university, so his parents have brought him back home to live with them. But even they realise that Samuel isn’t going to make it much past the age of 30 before he dies.
The Dymott family is one of the richest in Estonia – and their fortune comes from a successful business based on salt production. They have four daughters, who are all very pretty – but the youngest, Annie, is quite different to her sisters. She is known as the ‘Witch’ because she has red hair and green eyes like a witch in fairy tales.
And that’s where the story begins. The day after Samuel returns home from university, he meets Annie – and they fall immediately in love with each other. But their families are determined to keep them apart due to their differing social standing. So how will their romance develop? Will it end happily ever after or is there going to be trouble ahead?
The story is set on a fictional island in the Baltic Sea called Kadriorg, which was once part of Sweden and then Finland before being ceded back to Russia during World War I. It’s here that the story takes place – though most of it occurs in Paris where Samuel goes for treatment after contracting pneumonia while studying at university.
There is so much happening in this book that readers will be kept busy trying to keep up with all the different threads being woven together by author Andrus Kivirähk. But even if you don’t manage to get through all of them, there are still plenty of exciting moments along the way – such as when Samuel first meets Annie and finds himself falling in love at first sight; or when he goes back home again after being attacked by a gang of thieves while out walking late one night.
