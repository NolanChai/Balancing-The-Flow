Serena Williams was inspired by older sister Venus’ progression to the fourth round of the Australian Open as she fought back from a set down against Elina Svitolina.
Williams, who had to save three service breaks in the final set after recovering from a 1-5 deficit, said: “I love the way I played today and I think Venus was watching me at one point and she came over here afterwards.
“She was like ‘wow’, but it’s not just because she won – it’s the way that she did it. She fought to the end even when it didn’t look good.”
Williams said: “It feels amazing. I knew that I could do it, and I love being out there with a lot of people watching and competing. It was such an honor playing Elina.
“I think my sister was on the other side watching me – she won today too, so I’ll have to talk to her later.”
Venus Williams is into round four at the Australian Open for only the second time in seven years after a 6-2 3-6 7-5 victory over Katerina Siniakova.
The older of the Williams sisters, who was seeded number 10 in Melbourne, has struggled to keep her ranking inside the top 20 since winning Wimbledon and Olympic gold at London 2012.
She said: “I’ve been playing well over here so I felt like I belonged here again.”
