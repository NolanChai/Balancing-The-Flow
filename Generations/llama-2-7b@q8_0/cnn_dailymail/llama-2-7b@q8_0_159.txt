10 Group which monitored aerial attacks and helped devise tactics to repel enemy bombings and shoot down enemy aircraft.
Air Vice Marshal Patrick Hone, who led the operation between 1942-45, said: "The Battle of Britain was our nation's finest hour. It was a fight for freedom and we should not forget it."
He added: "Today's announcement means that there will always be somewhere to come home to after visiting the site where they worked so bravely and effectively in such difficult times, 70 years ago."
The 10 Group RAF Bomber Command bunker was built during World War II as one of 169 underground shelters across the country.
It is believed to be the only one which survives intact. The Grade I Listed building will open for the first time next spring after a Â£270,000 refurbishment.
The bunker will also contain a permanent exhibition about 10 Group's role in the Battle of Britain.
The airfield was operational between 1943 and 1958 and now contains a museum with a number of aircraft on display including a Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Avro Lancaster, Messerschmitt Bf-109 and an American Bell P-63 Kingcobra fighter.
The bunker's exterior was covered in concrete in 2004 to prevent damage from the elements.
