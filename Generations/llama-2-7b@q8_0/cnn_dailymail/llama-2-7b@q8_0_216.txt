­reach an even wider audience as a new interactive iPad app that lets readers explore the Bard in a whole new way.
The app, titled "Shakespeare on iPad" and available for purchase for $4.99 from Apple's online store, was launched Wednesday to mark what would have been Shakespeare's 450th birthday.
Using an interactive map of the world, users can explore all the places referenced in Shakespeare's works. There are also links to video clips and audio recordings of actors performing famous scenes from the plays.
"What we hope is that it will bring a lot more people into the experience of Shakespeare," said Dr. Gary Taylor, who helped develop the app.
Taylor, who is one of four authors for the app, has been working on the project for about six months and has spent his entire career studying Shakespeare's work. His research has led him to find that Shakespeare wasn't a fan of Hamlet.
"I think he was writing Hamlet because there was a market for it," Taylor said. "It just seemed very odd, from what we know about him."
But while some characters and themes may have been less than favorable to the Bard himself, there are still many who will find enjoyment in this new interactive app.
"I think that any Shakespeare lover or any fan of iPads would just fall in love with it," said Michael Shapiro, a New York-based arts and technology critic. "There's a lot of cool stuff going on."
Taylor believes the app will be helpful to students studying the Bard, as well as Shakespeare aficionados looking for more information about his plays. But even without all these features, it'll still offer an entertaining experience with its colorful pictures and engaging text.
The project was first conceived in 2012 by Dr. Tom Crawford at the University of Adelaide in Australia, who created a similar iPad app for his students. After meeting Taylor online last year, Crawford invited him to join in on the endeavor. Together they worked with a team of five other writers and editors from around the world to make sure all 38 plays were covered comprehensively.
The app also has an option for users who don't want any distractions while reading Shakespeare's works by offering full-page images that can be zoomed in on so they appear larger than life-size. This allows readers to enjoy the Bard without having any additional features distracting them from his writing, Taylor said.
The app is available for free download through Apple's iTunes store until June 24th when it goes into regular release mode. Users will be able to purchase individual plays or a complete package that includes all works by Shakespeare as well as his sonnets and poems written during his lifetime at $29 per year, according to Dr. Gary Taylor (the co-author of the app).
"We want people not only to read these great writers but also enjoy their work," Taylor said in an email interview with CNNMoney about his project's creation process and future plans for further developments."So we made sure that there would always be something new here every day ­ so we added extra features such as videos from actors performing scenes, or links to other related materials like photos of places mentioned by Shakespeare himself."
The app is the first of its kind created on an iPad. The project was funded by a $300,000 grant from Microsoft and Apple.
