safe but now are choosing to run against all odds because they know we can win.
In my first job after college, when I worked as a field organizer for the Democratic Party, I would often tell voters that politics wasnt about personalities or popularity contests. It was about ideas.
When I ran in 2008 and 2012, we did our best to prove this to be true. We told stories of the struggles real Americans face, from lack of access to affordable health care to underfunded schools to failing infrastructure and crumbling bridges. And because we knew those ideas mattered to them, we worked hard every day to help voters understand how our policies would make their lives better.
Now, with a Democratic nominee for president in 2016 who is the beneficiary of so many progressive ideas and ideals, its time for us all to continue the conversation. If we do that, we will win this race -- not just because our ideas are better than Republicans but because our people are better than theirs.
