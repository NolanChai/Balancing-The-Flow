eteam in Internal Affairs, was stunned to find his father, 85-year-old Walter, and stepmother, 84-year-old Jeanine, as well as 75-year-old neighbor Marvin Greenfield and 72-year-old guest Eileen O’Neill dead inside their Queens home in Maspeth, New York.
Hugel, who is also the son of the former Mets owner Fred Wilpon, was reportedly concerned because his parents had not heard from him in over a week. He had tried to call them multiple times but they did not answer and he received no response when he checked up on their home, according to The New York Post.
The police were called to the scene at 5 p.m., according to The New York Times. Officers reportedly entered through an unlocked door and found four bodies in the living room. All three had been shot in the head with a handgun, although it is unclear if any of them was the shooter.
Greenfield lived next door to Hugel’s father for 28 years before recently moving into their home with his wife. The couple was visiting from New Jersey when they were murdered and found on Friday afternoon.
Police have not yet determined what the motive may have been, but a source told The Post that all four victims appeared to be killed in separate rooms. The bodies of the three men had been left together in one room while Hugel’s parents lay dead separately in another area.
The elderly couple had recently moved into their son’s home after Greenfield asked for help from police following a dispute with his wife. Officers were sent to their home on Feb. 6 after she called the department and claimed her husband had assaulted her. Police then entered their home to check on him, but found that he was not there.
Police discovered that Hugel’s stepmother had been shot in the face with a .380-caliber bullet and his father suffered two gunshot wounds to the head. Their deaths were initially ruled as suicide due to the presence of a note, but authorities now believe it was likely a murder-suicide because none of their family members or close friends knew they had moved into the Hugels’ home.
“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Detective Robert Kessler, who is leading the investigation. “How come somebody would want to kill three people?”
