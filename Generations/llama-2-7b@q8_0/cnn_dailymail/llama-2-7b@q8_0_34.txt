pe the style and lifestyle of 1960's Parisian men in a homage to their own unique history.
A look into the lives of these style-conscious Congolese men shows them to be an enigma, even within the country where they live. Draped in three-piece suits, pearl snaps and leather shoes, it's hard to imagine what these fashion-forward guys are doing amidst poverty so vast it can't even be measured, let alone eradicated.
As we watched Sapeurs go about their days, the question arose: How does a man in the Congo afford such exquisite clothing? In fact, there is no good way to buy these clothes, and it's not just because they are expensive, but also because most of the garments sold here come from abroad.
Sapeurs rely on their families, friends, or loans to purchase high-end suits from China or Nigeria that they assemble with accessories made in local factories. Their look is often imitated and cheap knockoffs are common throughout Congo; but for Sapeurs it's not about the cost of the garments so much as it is the way they look when put together, which makes the dandy's wardrobe a source of great pride.
Sometimes we feel that our style sets us apart from other people, and when that happens, it can be difficult to maintain your individuality in the face of outside opinions or pressure. However, the Sapeurs prove that they not only have confidence in themselves and their individuality, but also in each other. The Sape movement is a community-based fashion group that unites men who share similar interests and passions through dressing with style.
The Sapeurs of Congo are an inspiration to us all. They've come up with a way to make the best of their circumstances, and it doesn't hurt that they look dapper while doing so! We hope you enjoyed getting a glimpse into how these fashionable men live, and we invite your questions and comments below.
