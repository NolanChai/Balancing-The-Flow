 the time asleep.
Boro looked a spent force against a side who were keen to extend their 10-game unbeaten run and could well finish above them this season. The hosts had the upper hand throughout, with Middlesbrough playing as if they hadn’t the energy to even lift one leg off the pitch.
Much has been made of Karanka’s insistence on playing a 4-2-3-1 formation, but that was a system that failed spectacularly at Vicarage Road. The midfield trio of Grant Leadbitter, Adam Clayton and Ben Gibson – who all came through the youth ranks together – struggled to impose themselves on this game against an organised Watford team.
Leadbitter was always likely to struggle playing in that advanced role and he certainly wasn’t helped by Middlesbrough’s decision to play without a recognised striker. Leadbitter drifted inside from left midfield too often, allowing the visitors’ defenders to get out of jail when Watford were in possession.
Clayton and Gibson had more success at times, but only because they were given licence to stray into attacking areas with more freedom than their team-mates further forward. Boro have looked more dangerous in a 3-5-2 system this season, though, which suggests Karanka’s stubbornness on the issue could be costing him points.
Middlesbrough had plenty of possession in the first half and rarely made Watford work hard defensively, but the Hornets were always more dangerous going forward and they looked menacing when Middlesbrough played the ball upfield to them. Aaron Cresswell had a fine chance for Watford after 20 minutes but fired just wide of the far post from eight yards out.
It was clear that Boro’s midfield trio were struggling to keep control of this game, with their defenders having to play much further up the pitch than they are used to in order to support them. That made it easy for Watford’s counter-attackers, and they caused problems on several occasions.
Boro were a disjointed force before half time and went in level at 0-0 after the interval thanks only to the heroics of Dimitrios Konstantopoulos, who pulled off an outstanding save from Andre Gray. The Greek goalkeeper’s form this season has been instrumental in Boro’s improved defensive record over last term, but his opposite number Heurelho Gomes was never really troubled against a Middlesbrough side that rarely looked like scoring.
It didn’t help the visitors when they lost Adam Reach to injury after 60 minutes and were forced into changing their system again as a result. Karanka introduced Lewis Baker from the bench in order to play with one up front, but Watford quickly took advantage of Middlesbrough’s lack of pace on the counter attack and exposed Boro’s vulnerability at set-pieces.
Karanka was furious when Watford scored from a corner that came off Britt Assombalonga’s head and then bounced into the net off Ben Gibson. But it was the right decision to disallow the goal after video review showed Boro had six players behind the ball in front of their own penalty area at the time the ball crossed the line.
Middlesbrough were in danger of suffering a third defeat in four matches, but they finally scored from a set-piece when Gaston Ramirez’s corner was flicked on by Adam Forshaw and volleyed home by the unmarked Ben Gibson. Watford fans groaned, knowing that goal would come back to bite them as Middlesbrough continued to push for an equaliser.
The visitors didn’t have to wait long for their reward, though, with Boro taking advantage of a rare counter-attack to score the winner through Britt Assombalonga. Watford keeper Gomes had earlier saved well from Ayala and Forshaw before Middlesbrough took the lead, but they couldn’t stop a clinical finish from Assombalonga who curled in his shot from 12 yards.
The hosts were left to rue their failure to take all three points as Watford’s record improved to eight wins and one draw since December 15, while Boro remain without victory in seven Premier League games following a promising start that saw them beat Manchester United at Old Trafford. They return to Teesside with plenty of work still to do if they are to maintain their top-flight status this season.
