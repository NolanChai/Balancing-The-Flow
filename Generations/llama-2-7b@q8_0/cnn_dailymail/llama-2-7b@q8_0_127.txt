10 p.m. Wednesday and landed in Hong Kong at around noon the following day, but was forced to return to its departure city after Chinese authorities ordered it to bring an American family to Beijing for questioning over a custody dispute involving two children who were aboard the plane.
"Our airport police notified U.S. Customs and Border Protection of our intent to detain this flight at Dulles," said CBP spokesman Brian Moskowitz, referring to the decision by United to return to the U.S. "The family is currently under Chinese jurisdiction, and we are working with local authorities to facilitate their custody transfer."
According to the airline, the investigation was sparked by a dispute between two divorced parents of a 1-year-old girl from Washington state who were both traveling on the same flight. The child's mother had taken her and another child in her care into China while the father was awaiting custody approval.
"As a result, U.S. Customs & Border Protection detained the aircraft in accordance with Chinese law," said United spokesman Jonathan Guerin in an emailed statement. "We regret any inconvenience to our passengers."
Guerin would not elaborate on the custody dispute or provide details of the child's age or name.
Chinese police boarded and arrested the girl at Dulles, said Lance Koskela, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington. The father was also taken into Chinese custody as he de-planed with his 5-year-old son.
Koskela would not confirm the child's name or age but said they were American citizens living in China. He could not say whether both children would be returned to their parent and could only confirm that "the father is currently in custody."
The mother had taken off with the other child, also a U.S. citizen, from Dulles on Wednesday evening, but was arrested upon arrival in Beijing. The 5-year-old boy has been placed in foster care.
"We have been working closely with United Airlines and law enforcement officials to ensure the children are safe," said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in an emailed statement. "The matter is now in the hands of the Chinese authorities."
Nuland would not comment further on the investigation or what arrangements have been made for the children but referred CNN to the United Airlines statement.
This was the first time a U.S.-bound aircraft has had to return to the same airport because of a custody dispute, Moskowitz said. He noted that in this case, Chinese authorities were following their laws, which were passed as recently as 2011 and are based on the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
In the United States, there is no law governing the international custody of children, according to a statement issued by Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. They called upon U.S. Customs to work with the Chinese authorities on this case.
"It's time for us to step in here," said Schumer, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a phone interview Thursday evening. "The State Department has been very involved, but we need more help from them."
Schumer called upon his colleagues in Washington to help facilitate a resolution and work with Chinese authorities to ensure that this family remains intact.
"These parents have two kids who are not only American citizens, they're Americans," he said. "I hope there is no further action taken here."
Schumer also called upon the U.S. Department of State and Customs officials to work with Chinese authorities to make sure that this family remains intact.
