everly said she met him at a hotel in Manhattan last month and alleges that he reached his hand underneath her blouse to feel her breasts during what was supposed to be an interview for a film role. She claims this happened on June 4, but the NYPD said they did not get involved until Monday after she reported it. Beverly said in a recording played by New York magazine that Weinstein seemed “very surprised” when she told him he had groped her. When she asked how he would feel if it was his daughter, she says the 66-year-old replied: “I’m not used to that, but I will take care of it.” However, he did not deny touching her and told officers he never met Beverly before their encounter. He is said to have been arrested on charges of third-degree criminal sex act - which carries up to seven years in prison – but was released after posting $10,000 bail. The NYPD has confirmed the sting operation took place, adding: “The investigation is active and ongoing.” Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. He also said that a number of people have been contacted by police for questioning in connection with the case. The latest incident comes after a string of sexual harassment and assault claims against Weinstein. Rose McGowan, who was paid $100,000 (£75,000) as part of a non-disclosure agreement to keep silent about her alleged experience, has been highly critical of the film mogul’s accusers for not coming forward sooner with their stories and of Weinstein himself. She said: “The thing that is so horrible right now in Hollywood – I’m not saying it was my case or anybody else's - but we all knew there was a big f***ing elephant in the room and everyone acted like it wasn’t there.”
