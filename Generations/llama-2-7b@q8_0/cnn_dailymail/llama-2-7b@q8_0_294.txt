The 38-year-old businessman was said to be holding talks with Libyan tribal leaders as he tried to arrange his own escape from the battlefield.
Colonel Gaddafi’s son is understood to be attempting to reach Zimbabwe – where President Robert Mugabe is a close ally of the Libya leader – by travelling through Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad in north-west Africa.
But the man who was once Colonel Gaddafi’s heir apparent is also reported to be trying to surrender himself to the rebels in order to avoid capture and trial.
He was said to have held talks with leaders from Misrata – one of the towns that has been fighting Libya’s 41-year dictatorship for months – about a possible truce, according to the pro-rebel website Libya Al Youm.
Colonel Gaddafi is also believed to have sent his son a message from his hideout in the city of Sirte that he should hand himself over or else die trying to flee, Libyan media said.
