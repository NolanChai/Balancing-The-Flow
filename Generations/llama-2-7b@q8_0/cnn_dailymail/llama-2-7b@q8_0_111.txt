 Schmidt took to Twitter on Wednesday and posted a video of the reality TV star threatening to “f**k him up”.
“I’ll f**king kill you,” she says in the clip.
The Real Housewives Of Miami star has allegedly been threatening the 28-year-old singer for two days, with Mr Schmidt claiming Ms Krupa called his daughter a “f****t” and a “wh***” on social media.
In a separate video, he also claims that he was threatened by one of Ms Krupa’s assistants.
