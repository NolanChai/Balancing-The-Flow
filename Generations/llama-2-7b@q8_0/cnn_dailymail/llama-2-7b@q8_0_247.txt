 US financial services giant e-Trade $1m and forcing its customers to wait up to four hours just to log in.
The problem was not that there were too many people trying to access the site at once – it was down for about an hour and a half during peak times when website use is high, but there are usually few problems before that – but because the site's servers did not have enough space to cope with the numbers.
"The problem we had is that the bandwidth available on our network was too limited," said an e-Trade spokesman. "We were looking at expanding that in order to cater for high traffic levels, but it took us longer than expected to get approvals and it wasn't enough."
It also has been a problem for many other firms, especially those providing streaming music services such as Spotify and LastFM. These companies are finding that while the number of people using their sites is growing rapidly – 3 million users for Spotify in its first year alone – the amount of space needed by each user to be able to play a track has gone up because of advances in technology.
"The challenge for all websites is to make sure that there's enough capacity to allow customers to use it," said Alex Lennard, director at UK-based IT consultancy 3S. "Websites need to have a good understanding of how many people are using them and the bandwidth required by each user."
He added: "Many companies underestimate this – they assume that if there aren't queues outside their offices when it is busy, everything will be fine. But online is not like the real world, because what can happen is that an organisation gets swamped with users trying to access a website at one time."
The internet has grown so much over the past decade that many experts believe the system may now be reaching its limits and running out of space. The number of webpages on the net – which includes everything from websites for companies, universities, charities and individuals, as well as social networking sites such as Facebook – is increasing at a rate of 25% each year, meaning there will soon be no more space available to create new websites or host existing ones.
The problem is that the internet has always been built on an ad-hoc system, with different people and companies managing their own individual server space. When this was less than a handful of servers it worked OK but as usage increases, users are now having to share resources more widely across a range of different websites and companies have found that they often cannot get the extra capacity they need from existing providers because it has already been allocated or reserved for someone else.
"The internet is very much a network where everyone shares resources," said Jon Hellevig, chief executive at London-based IT firm Cloudsoft. "When a website is down it's normally not because the bandwidth to that site has run out; it's more likely to be because another website that people have been trying to access from your site has had problems and is using up all available resources."
He added: "The internet was never built for high levels of traffic so we are now having to work our way through this problem. The next generation of the web will probably need to look at a more centralised approach, because it's not going to be possible to carry on the current system. We may even have to get the US government involved."
In 2010, the internet industry has been warned that space is running out, as the number of webpages on the net increases at a rate of about 25% each year. But one expert thinks it will be another six years before any major problems occur.
A study by US analyst firm Cisco showed that the amount of data being transferred over the internet increased from 60bn gigabytes in 2008 to 120bn in 2009 and is expected to grow to more than 400bn by 2013.
This has led to predictions that a new network, known as "internet 3", may have to be built in the US and Europe within five years if users are not going to experience major problems accessing websites. The cost of developing such a system could run into tens of billions of dollars.
But it is likely to take much longer than that for any major problems with internet use to occur because the number of people using webpages is also increasing at a similar rate and so more server space is needed overall, according to one expert who works in the online industry.
"We are seeing a rapid increase in the number of users and their requirements," said Alex Lennard, director at 3S UK Ltd. "In order for the internet to keep growing we will need more servers – but that's going to take time because there isn't that much money available."
