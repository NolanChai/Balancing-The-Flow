A blue badge is intended to allow people with mobility problems or disabilities to park closer to shops and attractions. But Gregory, of Loughborough Road, Bedford, admitted using the badge when it did not belong to him.
Gregory was spotted leaving the town centre in June last year after parking a disabled blue badged car with his family nearby on Midland Road. He told police officers that he had just collected the blue badge from an NHS employee at a clinic and that he was taking it back to be repaired.
Gregory, 51, who is unemployed and receives £170 per month in benefits, has no criminal record but admitted his false claims in front of magistrates in Loughborough. He said: “I didn’t think anything about it when I picked up the badge. I had no reason to suspect it was stolen.”
He also told police he was only able to walk 200 metres and was housebound but the prosecution case showed that Gregory frequently took part in long walks with his family and had been photographed walking through town with them on several occasions over a number of years.
