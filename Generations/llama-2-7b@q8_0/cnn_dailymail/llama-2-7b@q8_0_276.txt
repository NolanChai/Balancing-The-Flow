10 years worth of research in mice.
The benefits were seen after eating peanuts regularly for as little as four weeks - but not if they were mixed into drinks or biscuits, which may alter their digestibility. Scientists have known that regular peanut consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but it has long been a controversial food because of its allergy risk.
In the US alone, around three million people suffer from potentially life-threatening allergies to nuts, with one in every 130 children under five affected. But this study found that eating peanut flour daily over four months helped to prevent inflammation, which can cause serious food poisoning illnesses such as campylobacter, salmonella and E.coli.
"The bacteria produce a chemical that inflames the lining of the gut and this is what causes disease - peanuts have antioxidants in them that stop this from happening," said Prof Mark Tizard from Leeds University who led the study. "We think it's the combination of having healthy bacteria plus having a dose of peanut protein, that stops these inflammatory pathways."
The researchers tested the effects of eating one gram per day for four weeks against those eating 2g every other day or none at all. They also found that babies who were fed peanuts in their first six months had less of a chance of being allergic to them as they grew up.
Prof Tizard, whose study was published on Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, said: "People can be concerned about giving young children nuts but this study shows that exposing babies and children to peanut from an early age could actually prevent allergies." He added that those who were at highest risk should speak to their doctors first.
However, he advised pregnant women not to eat any as it could lead to premature births or miscarriages in those with a history of allergies. "You don't want to put babies and children on nuts if they are at risk from them," he said.
The researchers found that those who consumed the food everyday had higher levels of peanut proteins in their stool than those who did not. But this was also seen in mice given a diet rich in antioxidant-rich almonds, suggesting that it may be other foods that can have an effect on gut health and the immune system.
Prof Tizard said: "We don't know whether it is the peanut or something else in them but there are also high levels of antioxidants found in pistachios, so it could be some other foods that can help as well."
