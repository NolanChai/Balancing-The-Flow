In response to criticism, several major brands including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and TJ Maxx owner TJX Companies (TJX) have said they are not sourcing any products from the building in Bangladesh. However, there is no guarantee that other brands were not using it for clothing manufacturing.
The flaming disaster at Tazreen Fashions, which supplies clothes to major Western retailers, was one of the world's worst factory fires in years.
More than 100 workers died and another 200 are believed to be injured, according to an official statement from Bangladesh's government. Witnesses reported that some people jumped to their deaths rather than risk burning to death inside the building.
Many of those killed were young women who worked at Tazreen Fashions on the top three floors of the factory, which was making clothes for European brands. The fire broke out shortly after workers had arrived Saturday morning, and they reportedly couldn't escape because there were locked gates in front of them.
A spokeswoman from Wal-Mart told CNN that it "has never bought goods from Tazreen Fashions or used any supplier from the building." The company has been trying to reach out to other brands to ensure they weren't getting clothing from the factory, she said.
British retailer Primark, which also sourced from Tazreen Fashions, said in a statement it had "been assured by our supplier that we have not used any garments sourced from this factory since August 2011." It was the first to comment on its relationship with Tazreen.
A spokeswoman for H&M (HM) told CNN that it is not using Tazreen Fashions and has been assured by its supplier "that they are not in any way involved with this factory." But she acknowledged that "this doesn't guarantee" there were no other brands using the facility.
Industry analysts say that because most Western retailers buy clothes from a wide range of sources around the world, it is often difficult to pinpoint their specific connections to individual factories and brands. Some companies also outsource production, making it even harder to track supply chains.
"There's very little transparency on who's supplying what," said Kathryn Furlong, a retail analyst at Morningstar. "And the more complex you get, the less transparent things are."
While some companies are trying to clarify their links with Tazreen, others aren't saying much about it at all.
JC Penney (JCP) told CNN in an email that it has been investigating its suppliers and will continue "to monitor this situation as we understand more details regarding the cause of the fire." A spokeswoman for Ann Taylor Loft said the company is still trying to determine if any of its clothing was produced there.
Target said in a statement it is "not aware that any Target-owned or licensed apparel sold by Target or our stores has been made at this factory." It added, however, that it is conducting "additional due diligence with our vendors."
Some brands have stopped doing business with Tazreen Fashions because of complaints about working conditions in the past. The retailer has been cited by labor watchdogs for poor working conditions and not paying workers on time.
