The king's home is said to have been attacked on Sunday after rumours spread that he was involved in the unrest. King Goodwill Zwelethini denied any involvement yesterday, but the allegations were a blow for a man who has had his own share of scandals.
A close family member, Prince Mbonisi Gcina Zulu, was among those arrested by police after clashes on Sunday. The prince's home in Nongoma township is reported to have been torched during the unrest. King Goodwill's wife and sister were also caught up in the violence.
King Goodwill's alleged involvement with the riots came as police made 40 more arrests overnight, taking the number detained for looting, murder, arson and other crimes to more than 370 people. Police have been given special powers to tackle what South African President Jacob Zuma has called a campaign of "retribution" against foreigners.
The unrest spread yesterday to Johannesburg's northern suburbs - where at least five more shops were attacked and set on fire - but police said the violence had abated. In Port Elizabeth, the eastern coastal town that was one of the first centres of violence, police restored order after a night of looting.
The attacks on foreigners began in Durban two weeks ago when rioters attacked shops owned by migrants and killed more than 50 people in inter-racial clashes. The riots spread to Johannesburg and Soweto last week, where at least four people have been killed. More than 140 foreigners have been arrested since the violence began and many homes, shops and businesses have been destroyed.
Police say they will use force if necessary to ensure order is restored in areas affected by the unrest.
