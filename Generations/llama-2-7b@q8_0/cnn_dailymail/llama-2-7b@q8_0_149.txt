read through its pages.
I had thought about tackling the task before, but I could never find the time or energy required to devote myself fully to such an endeavor. It was only when I realized that this year's Passion Play was going to be a more somber affair -- no dancing, no singing, no laughter from the audience -- that it dawned on me: How hard could this be?
I mean, it couldn't possibly be as challenging as following a Twitter feed in real time.
So I dove in, and was quickly reminded why I had always found myself so busy. The Bible is a fascinating book -- well-written, often moving (but also occasionally tedious) and jam-packed with interesting stories that are worth reading on their own merit. But it's an even more compelling read when you remember its central plot point:
God created humanity in his image but screwed up by making us too free to choose between right and wrong, or good and evil. To remedy this mess he sent his son Jesus as a kind of atoning sacrifice (he died for our sins!). I get it -- the Good Book is more than just words; it's a great story, with a killer plot twist that still resonates today.
But then I thought about another story, and how its climax may be the most moving moment in the whole Bible: God's promise to Noah after the flood.
"As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease." Genesis 8:22
This was a time when the sun still rose in the west and set in the east. When people used the stars to tell them what season it was, and how long they had to plant or harvest their crops if they wanted any food that year. But God promised Noah something different -- he promised an Earth that would be predictable. Where we could count on a certain number of things in our lives, day after day, week after week:
Farmers are more productive when the seasons remain regular and predictable. It's why you see so many farms planting corn this time of year -- it can only grow if it has enough warm weather to germinate (usually 75-80 degrees for about five days) followed by a steady, moderate climate (around 65 degrees), and then cooler weather at night.
If the weather doesn't follow the expected pattern, or something changes unexpectedly in the growing environment, farmers lose time that they cannot get back -- lost opportunity costs that could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to large corporations. The stakes are high for any farmer who relies on predictable weather and the seasons to make a profit each year.
Which is why God's promise in Genesis was so important; it changed how people lived and worked, because they could now count on having more of what they needed. When you have certainty over your needs being met -- food to eat, water to drink, shelter from the elements -- then you can be more creative about building better lives for yourself and future generations.
God promised Noah an Earth that would provide more than it took away. It was a gift that changed everything afterward; and one we should all still recognize as being vital today.
So what's my point? Well, the Bible is good -- really good. And this week I had the chance to read part of it (Genesis 1-10) for the first time ever, and it made me feel grateful for a lot of things. But mostly I felt grateful that God created a world where we could still count on being able to meet our basic needs; because it means that we can focus on other things in life beyond just surviving another day -- like love, family, art, music or any number of pursuits that make us feel more alive than the simple act of just existing.
The Bible is good for this reason too: It reminds me how lucky I am to live in a society where people are still writing great stories about our past and future -- ones that inspire us to be better versions of ourselves tomorrow than we were today. That's why I want every child (and adult) who reads my books to take away one thing from them: No matter what happens next week, or next year, this country will always have an economy where people can still find work that makes them feel productive and fulfilled; because it is our only choice if we are going to survive as a nation -- the only way America can keep its promise to itself and future generations.
