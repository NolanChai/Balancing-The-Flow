 member Michael Kelly said at Wednesday's meeting that he could "no longer effectively represent the black community" as he had been doing since 2009. The vote to accept his resignation was unanimous, according to a statement on the town website.
Kelly -- who is not himself of African descent -- said in a speech posted online by Kildare Now that he could no longer do justice to the work required of him as mayor and representative for Athy's black community. He cited a recent murder in the town, saying "I am ashamed to be called an Irishman."
"Athy is a small town, but it was once home to some of Ireland's greatest people: James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, St. Brigid of Kildare," he said. "We can no longer claim this honor if we cannot rid ourselves of these problems ... I am ashamed to be called an Irishman."
Athy is a town in County Kildare, southwest of Dublin, with a population of 9,206 according to the 2011 census. The statement from the town council did not specify if Kelly's resignation was voluntary or due to pressure by other council members. It said he had "stepped aside" and that his office would be filled by a temporary mayor.
A spokesperson for Ireland's Garda Siochana, its national police service, told CNN the force is aware of Kelly's comments but has not launched an investigation. Kildare Now said Kelly has confirmed that he made the comments but declined to comment further.
