 the key battles which will decide who takes a place at Wembley and a shot at the final, including the battle of the goalkeepers and the strengths and weaknesses of Steven Gerrard's midfield and attack.
Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides' last chance to win any silverware this season. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks a the key battles which will decide who takes a place at Wembley and a shot at the final, including the battle of the goalkeepers and the strengths and weaknesses of Steven Gerrard's midfield and attack.
I expect a really close match and for it to be decided by the smallest margins - particularly if Liverpool are going to win because they are so dangerous in front of goal. They have scored 25 goals more than Aston Villa this season. However, with so much at stake I do not think Steven Gerrard will take any chances and we should see his team sit back and try to hit them on the counter-attack.
Villa's front three of Andreas Weimann, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke are all quick players so they will have to be careful if they are caught on the break and it would not surprise me if Gerrard went with three at the back instead of his usual 4-2-3-1 formation.
It was a risky decision to leave Ashley Cole out against Chelsea, although I can understand why Roberto Di Matteo did it because of the threat from Juan Mata and Eden Hazard. For me, he is still the best left back in England - but he has been given a chance to prove that at Liverpool where he can expect to play for three games with Jose Enrique out injured.
He has good competition though. It is going to be a real battle between them with Jordan Henderson likely to start on the right wing, and Gerrard or Joe Allen in midfield depending whether they play 4-2-3-1 or 3-5-2. Either way it will give Glen Johnson some protection and I can see him getting forward a lot more than he has done under Kenny Dalglish this season - that is where you see the best of him.
The midfield battle
This could be interesting because if Steven Gerrard wants to win on Sunday, he must control the midfield and try to stop Lucas Leiva and Jordan Henderson from having a big impact. With Aaron Ramsey in such good form for Arsenal I feel that Henderson has struggled at times this season.
However, Lucas is another player who always gives 100 per cent and you have to say he has been Liverpool's best player in recent weeks with his leadership qualities helping the Reds keep four successive clean sheets before they were beaten by Chelsea on Monday night.
So I expect Gerrard to try and win the battle against Lucas who is a really hard worker, but Lucas does have one weakness - he does not get forward enough. So it will be interesting to see if he gets forward at all or if Gerrard wants him to stay behind his backline to make sure Aston Villa are stopped.
For me that is the key battle in this match. If they win that, there's a good chance of them winning the game. It will give Liverpool a platform to build their attacks from and they could play Steven Gerrard on the edge of midfield or even out wide on the left - which is something he has not done for quite some time.
If I were Gerrard, I would probably go with three at the back so there can be no let-up in the Liverpool defence. They do need to tighten up defensively because they are leaking goals and although they have kept four clean sheets on the trot, you could see them conceding a goal if Villa get one chance.
I am sure Aston Villa will be trying to find space between Lucas Leiva and Fabio Aurelio on the left side of defence where Aaron Ramsey was so effective against Liverpool in midweek - that's when he can really cause problems for defenders as he gets forward and runs at them. However, I feel Gerrard is the key man to watch in this match because if Villa are going to win they have got to stop him controlling the game.
The front line battle
Aston Villa like to play with width so you will see Christian Benteke on the left flank and Gabriel Agbonlahor on the right, with Andreas Weimann playing off Christian Benteke through the middle. You would expect the trio of players to get on the ball at every opportunity because they have got some great ability and that will put them up against their counterparts at Liverpool - Luis Suarez, Raul Meireles and Maxi Rodriguez.
They all like to drift inside from wide areas and it is going to be interesting to see how Steven Gerrard sets his side out because he has got so many options in attack. With the exception of Dirk Kuyt, they have got a great selection - especially with Meireles back in form. Liverpool have been unstoppable at times when he has played and he was excellent against Chelsea on Monday night.
Villa are going to need to stop him if they want to win this match because he is the key man for Liverpool and one of the best players in the Premier League. They will also have to watch out for Suarez, who could get on the ball at every opportunity because Steven Gerrard has said that he likes playing him wide - he is a real danger player.
If they are going to win this match I feel it's got to be by a small margin and you can't really see Aston Villa scoring too many goals so I am sure they will try and hit Liverpool on the counter-attack.
