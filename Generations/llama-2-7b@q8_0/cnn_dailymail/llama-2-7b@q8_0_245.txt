The National Transportation Safety Board released its final report into the May 2013 accident that killed both pilots and destroyed a $4 million UPS cargo jet in an Alabama neighborhood just outside Birmingham.
The crash happened as the crew prepared for landing, shortly after it was diverted to the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport following an engine fire on takeoff from Louisville, Kentucky, according to NTSB records.
A witness said he saw the plane in flames before it plunged into a suburban neighborhood, killing both pilots and damaging 16 homes. The fire killed two people on the ground as well.
The NTSB investigation found that the cockpit's altimeter -- which provides information about the altitude of an aircraft -- did not function properly during the flight because it was "out of adjustment." But the pilots failed to notice and attempted to land in a hail-like downpour.
"The altimeter malfunctioned and the flight crew failed to maintain proper attitude for landing in conditions that exceeded the airplane's maximum control speed," the NTSB said in its report. The final cause of death, according to the NTSB, was "multiple blunt force injuries."
The NTSB did not name the pilots, but CNN has identified them as Capt. Cerea Beal and First Officer Shanda Fanning.
"The primary reason for this accident was the flight crew's failure to maintain airplane control during a high-speed, unstable approach," NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said at Tuesday's news conference in Washington, D.C. "We have determined that the pilots' inability to see out of the cockpit because of smoke and haze created by an engine fire resulted in their failure to recognize the unsafe approach conditions."
But members of the board expressed frustration at UPS, saying it had not followed up on a safety recommendation made after another UPS plane crashed near Wilmington, Ohio. In that case, the NTSB said the pilots were distracted by a problem with a cargo door on the aircraft and they crashed while trying to land in bad weather at a nearby airport.
The NTSB made 17 recommendations in total following its investigation of the accident near Wilmington -- the last came Tuesday, when it said UPS should follow up with pilots if their cargo doors aren't working properly and replace them as needed. But Hersman said UPS had not done so.
"The lack of response to this recommendation is troubling," she said. "Such a failure could have tragic consequences."
UPS responded by saying that it disagreed with the NTSB's recommendations and that it has "a strong safety culture and takes all safety matters seriously."
It added: "We believe we have already taken the appropriate corrective actions. We will continue to work with NTSB to address any further concerns regarding this matter."
