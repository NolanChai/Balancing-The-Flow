20 minutes of entertainment to the crowd before he was substituted for Mario Balotelli, who looked likely to be sent off for kicking out at Antonio Cassano.
Milan started with a bang as the Italian champions dominated the opening half an hour. A free-kick from Pirlo took a fortunate deflection in off De Jong and Milan were ahead.
Sampdoria came back into the game after the restart as they tried to get back on level terms. Their best chance came in the 59th minute when Cassano, who had been booked twice before this incident, was brought down by Balotelli but the referee only awarded a corner kick.
Milan were given hope again with just eight minutes remaining when Cassano's attempted through ball to Luis Muriel was intercepted by Christian Abbiati and his clearance was collected by Eto'o, who rounded Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano before slotting into the empty net.
The win leaves Milan second from bottom in Serie A but with only two points behind leaders Juventus.
