 scientist claims to have found the answer.
In a paper published in the journal Nature, French researcher Pascal Cotte wrote that the restoration of Leonardo's famous painting included "the removal or retouching of part of her eyebrow" as well as other changes to the image that were done by artists over time.
Cotte is no stranger to the painting. He has used a highly complex imaging technology called multispectral imaging to peer into the layers behind the canvas, which is one reason why he believes something may be hidden there.
"The image of Mona Lisa's face is not just on top of her hair," Cotte said in an interview with CNN. "It is also underneath. The hair is a barrier between us and the painting."
Cotte started working at France's Institut National de l'Audiovisuel in 2004, where his job was to develop digital technology for the study of works of art.
In 2005, he used multispectral imaging, which is similar to X-ray fluorescence technology often employed by archeologists, and focused on the "Mona Lisa" because it's one of his favorite paintings. What he saw shocked him: There were layers underneath Leonardo's original image of the lady from Florence.
"I was surprised to discover that there is something there," Cotte said, adding that many scientists had previously tried and failed to find anything hidden beneath the painting.
Cotte decided to take his findings public in 2007 when he showed them at an event organized by the French National Library, which owns "Mona Lisa." That's when people started asking him what happened to her eyebrows and eyelashes. Cotte had a simple answer: They were removed or retouched in 1951 as part of restoration work on the painting.
The mystery surrounding this event has fascinated scholars for years. A 2002 documentary by BBC art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon featured an interview with Giorgio Vasari, a 16th century Italian historian who described in detail what happened to Mona Lisa's eyebrows and lashes.
The story goes that during the time of the French Revolution, Napoleon ordered the painting removed from the Louvre, where it is currently housed, and moved to his private art collection at the Tuileries Palace. In 1808, one of Napoleon's generals, Count Charles-Francois Lebrun-Tondu, ordered her eyebrows shaved in a fit of anger.
Cotte said he could not verify the story told by Vasari but added that it "makes sense."
"I think she was too beautiful to look at," Cotte speculated. "To be honest, if I were Napoleon, I would also do this kind of thing. The only difference is that I wouldn't have been able to do the restoration because we didn't have any digital technology back then."
The eyebrow-less image of Mona Lisa has become a staple of jokes about the famous painting, including one about an optical illusion called "Mona Lisa smiles because she's glad Leonardo is gone," as well as a book by Dr. Seuss titled "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish."
Cotte said he hopes that his findings will shed more light on the story behind these jokes and that they might help scholars understand why Mona Lisa's image has changed over time.
