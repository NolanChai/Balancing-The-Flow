 more than ever before – with the trend beginning in London and spreading throughout the UK.
While French cuisine is well known for its use of escargot (snail), it seems Brits are now getting a taste for it too. Sales of snails have gone through the roof this year, and snail farming is now set to become a lucrative industry in Britain, according to a report from The Telegraph.
There’s even been an upsurge in sales of snail-themed clothing, with many Brits buying “Gastropod Gear” from the Gastropodd website. A T-shirt bearing the message “I love escargot” has been one of their most popular items to date.
The British obsession with gourmet food appears to be an indication of the growing interest in eating snails – and not just as a delicacy either, but as a healthy source of protein.
In France, there are 70 million molluscs produced on farms every year, which accounts for over one third of total production in Europe, with the majority used to make escargot, but some are also eaten fresh. The French have been eating snails since the days of the Roman Empire, and it’s estimated that they consume as much as 15kg per person on average every year.
The humble mollusc has long been a source of nutrition for the French, with snail meat considered to be one of the most protein-rich foodstuffs – containing up to twice as much protein than chicken. It’s also low in fat and contains plenty of vitamins B2 and B12, calcium and phosphorus, as well as iron, copper and zinc.
The rising popularity of snails has prompted a number of high profile British chefs to promote the food – including Heston Blumenthal, who served up a snail pasta dish at The Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire earlier this year.
Although there are concerns that growing interest in mollusc farming could put pressure on local wild populations of land snails, which already suffer from habitat loss and pollution.
Whether you’re a fan or not, it seems as though snail meat is here to stay – and who knows? Maybe we will see our favourite British cuisine restaurants serving up the delicacy soon!
