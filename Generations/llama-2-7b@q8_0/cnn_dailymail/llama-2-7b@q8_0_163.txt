2015, replaces Tom Latham, who is unavailable due to injury and will join the squad on May 19.
The selectors also recalled wicketkeeper-batsman BJ Watling for the series against England that begins with a Twenty20 match at Aucklandâ€™s Eden Park on May 26, followed by two Test matches in Dunedin (June 2-6) and Hamilton (June 13-17).
Guptill had been on his way home after the West Indies series before being recalled as a replacement for Latham. He has 3440 runs from 63 Tests at an average of just over 32, including five centuries and 18 half-centuries.
New Zealand will be missing several key players from their squad that beat India in the recently concluded three-match ODI series after they have been ruled out for selection due to injury or national duties. Brendon McCullum has retired from international cricket while Ross Taylor will not make himself available, having already been ruled out of the World Cup.
The selectors also announced a 13 man squad for the two Tests against England and confirmed that there would be no changes before the first match despite being left with just one recognised spinner after Ish Sodhi pulled out of the series on medical grounds. The only other change comes in the form of Luke Ronchi, who has been added to the T20 squad as a back-up to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum.
The 13-man squad: Kane Williamson (captain), BJ Watling (wicketkeeper), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Tom Latham, Dean Brownlie, Grant Elliott, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Neil Wagner and Mitchell McClenaghan.
