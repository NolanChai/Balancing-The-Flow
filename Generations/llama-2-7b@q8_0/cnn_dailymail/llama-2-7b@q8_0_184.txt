9:19 am EST on Thursday, June 25th, when it was supposed to separate from the Zenit-3F carrier rocket that had launched it into orbit just minutes earlier. The failure has left Progress M-27M, which is carrying about 2.7 metric tons of supplies, stuck in low Earth orbit as Roscosmos attempts to regain control of the spacecraft and prevent a collision with the International Space Station (ISS).
The Russian space agency did not report any initial damage caused by Progress M-27M's failure. If no further problems occur, however, the ISS crew will attempt to capture and dock the cargo craft later on June 26th using its robotic arm. The craft will then remain at the station until it disposes of all its supplies in July.
Progress M-27M launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on Thursday morning, along with an automated Soyuz TMA-16M spacecraft that is scheduled to return Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and American astronaut Scott Kelly to Earth later this year. The spacecraft successfully separated from its carrier rocket about 20 minutes after launch, but it appeared to malfunction soon afterwards.
Roscosmos attempted to regain control of the Progress M-27M shortly thereafter by firing up its main engine and controlling the craft's orientation in orbit using gyroscopes and thrusters. So far, however, the spacecraft has remained out of control. The Russian Space Agency's first attempts to regain control of the vehicle were unsuccessful, but Roscosmos is still attempting to fix the problem.
Progress M-27M will continue its orbit until it eventually deorbits and burns up in the atmosphere. It is unlikely that Progress M-27M will collide with the ISS or any other objects in space unless the Russian Space Agency makes a mistake while trying to control the craft.
