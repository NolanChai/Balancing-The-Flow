The United manager is understood to have made an emotional case for a trip across the Atlantic, which would take place during the club’s traditional summer break between the end of the Barclays Premier League season and their return on 29th July.
It has been confirmed that United will play at least two games in North America before travelling to Singapore, where they will be part of an International Champions Cup tournament along with Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. They are also expected to face New York Red Bulls in a third match on the trip.
The decision was announced by United’s executive vice chairman Ed Woodward at a meeting of the club’s board on Thursday night, having been approved by Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill during discussions held over recent weeks. The tour would be a break from tradition but, with the FA Cup final taking place on 14th May and the Premier League season ending five days later, United have no fixture scheduled for Saturday 26th July - the start of the pre-season period.
Van Gaal is understood to have told Woodward that he needs a short spell in training before preparations for the new campaign begin in earnest at Carrington and his players are likely to fly out to America on or around 13th July, which is also United’s traditional break-up date.
Woodward said: “Manchester United has always had strong links with our supporters across North America and we look forward to returning to the region this summer for our pre-season tour.” The last time that United played in America was 2011, when they travelled to Washington DC, Toronto, Boston and New York.
United have long planned to play at least one match during their Asia visit, but it remains unclear whether Chelsea will be included in the International Champions Cup in Singapore and Bangkok between 15th-23rd July. United are scheduled to travel to Singapore on 18th July.
