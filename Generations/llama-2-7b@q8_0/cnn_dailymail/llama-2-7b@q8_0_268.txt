ar Pradesh, says she is determined to break the current record by growing 14 feet and eight inches (4.5 metres).
"I want to break this record so that I can be remembered for a long time," Smita told Agence France-Presse news agency from her home in Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh state. "The current holder is American." She has been growing the hair since 1983 and had it cut on Saturday at a government hospital to officially measure its length.
It was then measured at 14 feet and eight inches (4.5 metres), said hospital official Arvind Kumar Singh. Smita, who holds several local awards for her hair, is already an Indian record holder for the longest ponytail on a female and has been recognised as the third-longest in the world by the World Records Union, an organisation which provides recognition to official records of human achievement.
The Guinness World Record currently belongs to a woman from the US state of Illinois who holds 14 feet (4.2 metres) of hair. Smita, 39, has never cut her hair but says she does not feel like she is missing out on anything in life. "I am proud that my hair will be remembered and people will talk about it," she said.
