ooed Colbert by offering to name an exercise device after him.
"Hey, if I'm going to die in space, I'd like to do so with my abs intact," said Colbert during a late-night monologue on CBS's "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." The offer was for the opportunity to have a piece of equipment on board the International Space Station (ISS) named after him.
"Oh, that's great news! And I hope you enjoy your trip to the moon," quipped Colbert. The space station is in low Earth orbit and not expected to go anywhere near the moon for several more years.
NASA's space station program had announced a contest to name a new exercise device on board, and Colbert decided to enter with his own entry: The Stephen Colbert Orbital-Adjustable Erector Squared.
Colbert made an even more personal plea for the prize -- that it be named after him during the show's "Audience Participation" segment. He asked viewers to tweet #NameTheSquatrainer and make a donation of $10 or more to help fund scientific research at NASA.
It was a no-brainer for NASA -- the exercise device is known as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device, which Colbert turned into ARED.
The space agency tweeted that it had selected Stephen's suggestion and promised him an orbital view of his new name in action.
It was a fitting end to a segment that featured Colbert and "Late Show" writers talking about the best time to have sex during their 24-hour broadcast. It was, after all, 7:56 p.m. on Valentine's Day -- prime time for romance.
The contest was in celebration of what NASA called a "productive visit by Colbert and his writing team" on Tuesday and Wednesday to the space agency's headquarters at the Kennedy Space Center.
NASA had invited the comedian, his wife Evie and his writer-producer-director Paul Dinello for interviews with NASA astronauts and a tour of the facility. Colbert also did a show taping on Tuesday night that was broadcast Thursday evening.
The visit came in advance of Colbert's planned appearance on CBS' "Late Show" from space -- an orbit around Earth aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, expected to last 11 days. It will make Colbert one of a handful of Americans who have flown into space.
His visit was in part to promote the March 30 launch of "The Late Show," which he has hosted since September and will do so again after returning from his voyage aboard the Russian Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft. The trip is expected to include stops in Jordan, Israel and the West Bank.
He's no stranger to space travel: In 2001, Colbert traveled on a NASA shuttle mission as a guest of astronaut Jim Halsell aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour for its STS-90 mission.
