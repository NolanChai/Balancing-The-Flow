Since last week's anniversary of the 2010 accident off the coast of Louisiana, scientists have made new discoveries about how this disaster has affected both the Gulf region's marine life and the long-term health of its oceans. And there are still many unanswered questions as we work to understand what happens to an ecosystem when it is exposed to millions of barrels of oil -- including whether, and for how long, this one will be a lasting reminder to us all that there can be too much of a good thing.
The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred nearly five years ago off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.
Much of the media attention has focused on the impacts of this disaster on dolphins and other large marine mammals. But scientists are also documenting effects that will likely be felt for generations, including the destruction of fragile coral reef systems along a 1,000-mile stretch of coastline from Florida to Texas.
"It was the worst oil spill in history," said Dr. Nancy Rabalais, executive director of Louisiana State University's Center for Ocean Sciences Education and an expert on Gulf corals. "So far, we've been able to see some of these changes from the surface -- but even now that most of the visible oiling has gone away, there are still so many questions about what happened in deeper waters and how these reefs will recover."
Rabalais is one of hundreds of scientists working together to better understand the ecological effects of the spill. The result has been a wealth of new knowledge and an extraordinary amount of data -- but the scope of this environmental tragedy is so vast that, as Rabalais pointed out, there are still "hundreds of thousands of questions" about the long-term impact on our oceans and coastal ecosystems.
The first phase of studies has focused on documenting immediate physical changes to these reef systems -- how much oil was deposited on them, what areas were most affected, and where the slick traveled through the Gulf. In a study published in January by Rabalais' team, scientists found that more than 40% of Gulf reefs they surveyed showed evidence of oiling, with significant damage to nearly half of them.
Over time, we are learning about how deepwater corals -- the most complex and diverse group of organisms in our oceans -- have been affected by oil exposure. Scientists from LSU's School of Renewable Natural Resources recently discovered that some species of these corals were exposed to at least 60 pounds per acre of oil over long periods of time, or an area equivalent to six football fields.
But the questions don't stop there. What will be the impact on coral reproduction and recruitment? Can the reefs recover if they are heavily damaged? And what about the other organisms that call these corals home -- how do we assess the overall ecological health of Gulf waters after such a traumatic event?
Researchers from Florida International University recently studied more than 50,000 fish in the northern Gulf. They found that two of five species they examined were likely affected by the oil spill. In particular, they discovered elevated mortality rates among the deepwater coral-associated tiger shrimp. This could be an indication that these shrimp, and perhaps other deep-sea organisms, have been significantly impacted by this disaster.
In a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi showed that oiling is likely to increase with oil price -- which is currently at its highest level since 2013. "When you look at what happened with Deepwater Horizon and now oil prices are on the rise again, these reefs in particular could be at a greater risk," Rabalais said.
The Gulf of Mexico has more than 7,800 miles of coastline -- but that doesn't include the vast areas offshore, including deepwater coral communities. These habitats are home to thousands of species, many of which are still unknown and undiscovered by scientists.
Areas offshore from Florida to Texas contain more than 5,000 square miles of deepwater corals, all of which have likely been exposed to some level of oil during the spill. Some of these reefs -- including areas known as the Flower Garden Banks and the Upper Keys, in the northwestern Gulf -- are among the most biologically diverse coral communities in the world, hosting hundreds of different species of deepwater corals and other marine life like sea cucumbers.
"One of my main concerns is that we don't know the full extent or magnitude of what happened to these reefs," Rabalais said. "Because they are so far offshore, there's less attention paid to them -- but we have no idea how damaging this disaster was."
In a recent study published in Nature Geoscience, scientists from the University of Miami used advanced satellite imagery and mathematical models to estimate that millions of gallons of oil were deposited on deepwater reef areas, including those located more than 80 miles offshore.
This image shows coral communities inside the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in Texas' Gulf Coast waters.
But because so much about these habitats remains unknown -- where they are, what species live there, and how vulnerable they are to oil spills -- it is difficult for scientists like Rabalais to determine whether this disaster has had a long-term impact.
"The bottom line is that we don't know what happened," said Dr. Mark Hixon, an associate professor at the University of Miami who studies corals and their interactions with oil spills. "And in some cases, it may take hundreds or thousands of years before we do."
In addition to these impacts on deepwater coral reef communities, scientists are also working to understand how the Gulf's fragile coastal environments have been affected by the disaster, including shallow-water oyster beds and wetlands. These areas can be extremely sensitive to oil spills -- in part because they are home to many species of organisms that are particularly vulnerable to such exposures.
"Oil has a dramatic impact on these ecosystems," said Dr. William Patterson, an assistant professor at the University of Florida's School of Forest Resources and Conservation. "It affects everything -- plants, animals, soil microbes, bacteria, phytoplankton. It changes the entire food chain."
Patterson is co-authoring a study that will examine how oiled coastal areas in Louisiana have recovered from this disaster. His research focuses on how oil exposure affects "keystone species" -- those organisms at the base of an ecosystem, such as microbes and phytoplankton, which play crucial roles in the health of marine habitats.
These fragile coastal environments are home to many species of fish, including red drum (shown here).
But unlike deepwater reefs -- where much of what is known about their response to oil spills comes from studies that took place after previous disasters -- scientists like Patterson have had only a few years since the Deepwater Horizon spill to examine how these coastal systems are being affected.
"In some cases, we don't know yet what happened," he said. "We're trying to figure out where oiling occurred and how much oil was released."
These types of studies will continue for years after this disaster -- perhaps even decades -- as researchers like Patterson work together to better understand the long-term environmental impacts from the Deepwater Horizon spill.
One of the most important findings to date, he said, is that some of these coastal areas appear to have recovered relatively quickly after the oil dispersed. But because so many questions remain about what happens to an ecosystem when it is exposed to millions of barrels of oil -- and whether this will be a long-term effect for our oceans -- scientists are still working hard to document how these coastal communities have been affected by the Deepwater Horizon spill.
In some cases, we don't know yet what happened. We're trying to figure out where oiling occurred and how much oil was released."
The impacts on deep-sea corals are not yet fully understood. "We don't have a baseline for what these reef communities look like before this event," Rabalais said. "So we don't know if they were already stressed or in decline. There could be other things going on here that haven't been discovered."
"It may take hundreds of thousands, millions of years to get back to normal," she added. "And there will probably never truly be a recovery. We have to assume these reefs and the organisms that live there are damaged for life."
As we work to fully understand how our oceans were affected by this disaster, scientists are also looking at what can be learned about how future oil spills affect the health of our coastal environments. In particular, they are examining whether
