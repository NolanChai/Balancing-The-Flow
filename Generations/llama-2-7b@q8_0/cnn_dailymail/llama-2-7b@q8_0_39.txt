ts to escape the Premier League star, who is being investigated by police.
The incident took place at The Sankeys venue on Liverpool's Seel Street earlier this month, when the Arsenal player was celebrating after England's 2-1 defeat of Russia in a friendly match at Wembley Stadium. According to reports, the teenager said that Lennon had been drinking heavily and she tried to keep him away from other people but he ignored her requests.
Liverpool club bosses have reportedly refused to comment on whether any complaint has been received by the management of The Sankeys, where the 25-year-old Arsenal star was said to have been enjoying himself with friends in a private box before heading into the main room. A spokesman for Merseyside Police told Sky News: "We are aware of this matter but it is not currently under investigation."
The incident comes at an embarrassing time for the 10-cap England international who has just returned from injury after missing a number of matches due to knee trouble. His club boss, Arsene Wenger, recently suggested that Lennon will be sold in this transfer window amid rumours linking him with a move back to Manchester City.
