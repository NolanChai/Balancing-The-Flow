 of photographs portray the unconditional love and loyalty that our dogs have for us. In a time where we are often distanced from nature, when man spends more time in front of computer or smartphone screens than with his family and friends, the series "Man's Best Friend" reminds us to spend more time with our loved ones and the true meaning of companionship.
In this serie, photographer Sébastien Tixier offers a look into our relationship with dogs that is both unique and universal. Dogs are perhaps one of the only living creatures in the world who will put aside their own instincts to protect and care for humans as if they were their children or family members. We should all take time to appreciate this pure form of love, and never forget our place within nature and our connection with animals.
These dogs are so lucky to have been saved by a loving owner, and given such a wonderful life. Sébastien has taken many beautiful photographs showing just how much they mean to him.
