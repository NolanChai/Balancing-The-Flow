With 75 airlines flying from the capital city's international airport to more than 200 destinations, it can get quite crowded at times – especially during China's national holidays when millions of Chinese travelers fly abroad for vacation.
However, with a planned capacity of more than 100 million passengers per year by 2025, the new Terminal Three will help to solve that problem.
"The world's largest airport terminal is coming soon," said Beijing International Airport spokesman Feng Yibin.

The 750,000 sqm Terminal Three – which has been under construction since January 2014 – will have the capacity to handle up to 100 million passengers per year. The project is due for completion in June 2019.
"Once complete it will be the largest building in China and one of the world's largest airport terminal buildings," said Feng.
The terminal will cover an area equivalent to more than 750 football fields, or about eight times the size of Paris’ Louvre museum.
The new terminal is expected to take up to six years to complete, at a cost of over 42 billion yuan (US$6.38 billion).
When completed, it will be able to handle 100 million passengers every year and help Beijing's capital airport – the second-busiest in China after Shanghai's Pudong Airport – expand its capacity from around 97 million travelers at present to over 130 million by 2025.
It will also boast a huge number of luxury shopping options for travelers, including more than 1,100 stores and dozens of dining outlets.
The airport is designed to cater for the growing numbers of Chinese tourists seeking overseas holidays and business trips. It currently sees an estimated 45 million passengers pass through its terminals every year – up more than 16 percent from last year.
