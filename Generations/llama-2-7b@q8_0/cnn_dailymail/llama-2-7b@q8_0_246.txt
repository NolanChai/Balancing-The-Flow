The Florida Agriculture Commissioner on Monday issued an opinion that David Gustafson -- whose attorney said his client fired in self defense -- was within his rights to use deadly force after a young couple broke into his grove, ransacked it and then threatened him with a knife, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
The two trespassers were also armed, he said.
Gustafson shot 21-year-old Brittany Newsome three times in February after he confronted them at his home about 40 miles northeast of Tampa. A grand jury last month declined to bring charges against him.
In its decision Monday, the agriculture commissioner said that while Florida law requires a person to retreat before resorting to deadly force if it is reasonable to do so, "the doctrine of 'no retreat' provides an exception under certain circumstances."
Florida's "no retreat" law says people who use deadly force must first try to escape if it is safe for them to do so. The law also gives people a right to defend themselves in the face of an attacker who is also armed, according to the opinion.
The opinion noted that state law doesn't require someone to retreat before resorting to self-defense, "especially where a defendant is attacked by several individuals," it said. The commissioner's office concluded that Gustafson was justified in his actions.
Florida has long been one of the country's most lenient states when it comes to allowing people who use deadly force to avoid criminal prosecution. A state law dating back to 1862 says "any person ... shall have the right to stand his ground, and meet any force by force."
But in 2005, the Florida Legislature added a provision saying that under certain circumstances, people do not necessarily have to try to escape an attack. The state law defines when someone has "no duty to retreat" before using deadly force, including if he or she is trying to protect property from being damaged or stolen.
Critics say the law gives people carte blanche to use lethal force in any situation and can allow unjustified homicides to go undetected, according to a 2015 study by Harvard University researchers that found Florida has one of the highest rates of fatalities due to justifiable homicide in the country.
Critics also say the law is flawed because it doesn't make clear whether people have an obligation to try and flee before using deadly force, and does not set a minimum threshold of danger for when lethal force should be used.
