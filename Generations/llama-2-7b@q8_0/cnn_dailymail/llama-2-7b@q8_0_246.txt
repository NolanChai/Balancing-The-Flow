In the video, titled "How to get Kendall & Kylie Jenner Lips with Mentholatum Lip Plumping Gels," YouTube beauty vlogger Jack Fan uses mentholatum’s Lip Plumper gel on his lips, as well as a suction cup similar to the ones used for breast augmentation.
He then posts side-by-side photos of himself and Kylie before and after he applied lip plumpers.
Fan says he was inspired by fellow YouTuber James Charles' recent video featuring lip injections. In an email to Mic, Fan said his inspiration for the video came from "the huge amount of fans that watches [sic] his videos."
Charles responded to Fan with a tweet calling out the YouTube star’s controversial method: “@JACKFANZ I get it. But when you use things that make your lips swell, they get worse and won't go back down.” He later deleted the post.
Fan responded by saying he’ll remove the video once it has over 100,000 views (it now has 96,321), adding “I have already received a lot of negativity from this video but I will not edit it."
