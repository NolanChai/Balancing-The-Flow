100 per cent green energy.
Mikhail Chester, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University (PennState), recently proposed using excess wind and solar power in times of plenty to produce hydrogen by splitting water into its two main constituents: oxygen and hydrogen. Then, he said, that hydrogen could be used as a fuel or an electricity source via fuel cells.
“The advantage of producing hydrogen from renewable resources is that we can store excess power in the form of chemical bonds,” Chester explained. “Hydrogen provides several potential options to store energy: it can be transported long distances and stored on site, used as a vehicle fuel or burned for electricity generation via a fuel cell.”
This is where things get interesting. If we’re going to rely increasingly on renewable forms of power generation in the future, we will need an effective way of storing excess energy at times when there isn’t enough wind and sunlight available. Hydrogen could be our ticket out of this conundrum.
Chester’s study focused specifically on the potential for hydrogen storage from wind energy production in Texas, but his findings are equally applicable to Australia. While it’s true that Australia is currently one of the world leaders in renewable energy and has recently been making a concerted push towards producing more power using wind, solar and biomass resources, it still struggles to meet peak demand during the daytime on sunny days when there isn’t enough wind.
As a result, we need some form of reliable storage solution. Hydrogen may well be that answer. The researchers have shown how excess renewable energy could be used at times when we don’t need it to create hydrogen by electrolysis—that is, passing electricity through water and separating the oxygen from the hydrogen.

The problem is that we have limited capacity in terms of our current production methods. With current technology, hydrogen needs to be produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas before it can be converted into green hydrogen. If this process becomes more widespread then it could potentially hinder our efforts towards meeting zero-carbon targets.
The researchers are now working on developing a new electrolysis system that will allow us to produce green hydrogen using wind and solar energy, which they believe would be significantly cheaper than the current systems we use today. “Our technology is much more efficient—we’re talking about 35 per cent efficiency,” Chester said.
This is a huge breakthrough, and it means that we finally have an option for long-term storage of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Hydrogen could be used in all sorts of ways, including transportation vehicles, fuel cells or even electricity generators if necessary; whatever the case may be, this new technology looks set to revolutionise how we produce energy in the future.
