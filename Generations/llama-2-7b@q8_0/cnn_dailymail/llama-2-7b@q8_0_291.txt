., Fla., said Robert Williamson was caught on camera by surveillance cameras stealing jewelry, cash and electronics.
The cruise line has issued a statement saying they are aware of the incident: "Royal Caribbean International takes guest safety very seriously and is working with local authorities in Florida to resolve this situation," the statement read.
Cruisers on the Allure of the Seas, the largest ship in the world according to its maker Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., were told by a cruise line employee that the crime was isolated and no one is in danger. The Miami-based company said in its statement: "Royal Caribbean International has taken appropriate action with this crew member and will be conducting an internal review of our protocols, as well as enhancing training and procedures to further safeguard against any reoccurrence."
According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office, the burglaries occurred between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m., when many of the cruisers were sleeping or out at sea on a tour. The victims, ranging in age from their late teens to early forties, resided in rooms throughout the Allure of the Seas, which had about 6,000 passengers and crew on board.
Robert Williamson was arrested by police in Royal Palm Beach, Fla., in connection with burglarizing at least two vacationers' rooms on January 5. According to the Palm Beach Co. Sheriff's office, the crime is believed to be an isolated incident and no other cruisers have been targeted so far.
Royal Caribbean says they have video evidence of one burglary which occurred in a room where a crew member was present at all times, but it was unclear how the suspect was able to get into that particular stateroom. "We don't know if he had special access or not," said Royal Caribbean spokesman Cynthia Martinez.
The victims did not notice anything missing until the end of their cruise, when they saw that jewelry and other items were gone from their cabin. Most of the victims, who are still in Florida, are cooperating with police but at least one has declined to pursue charges. According to the Palm Beach Co. Sheriff's office, most of the victims said they did not know Williamson or any crew members personally and that all of their belongings were stolen, except for a pair of scissors which was left in a purse in one cabin.
Royal Caribbean is reviewing their procedures for preventing crimes onboard ships after the burglaries occurred during a seven-day cruise from Fort Lauderdale to Cozumel and Jamaica, according to its statement.
"Our guests are our number one priority," said Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Lyan Sierra-Caro. "We've been working with the sheriff's office and have offered assistance in helping them identify any possible suspects."
