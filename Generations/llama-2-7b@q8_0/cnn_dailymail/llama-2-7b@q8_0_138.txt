responsive in the home of her babysitter, Nicole Reid, 37, in January last year. She had suffered two fractured ribs, a broken collarbone, two skull fractures, bruising to her face and brain damage before dying in hospital several days later. Her parents, James and Alana Hutchings, have now launched a legal bid for Reid to be sentenced to jail over the death of their daughter. But they are also calling on the childcare sector to introduce mandatory guidelines on sleeping arrangements for infants. 'Indianna was a healthy and happy baby until she met her babysitter,' said Mr Hutchings, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 'What happened should never have been allowed to happen - Indianna could have been saved.' The couple had dropped Indianna off at Reid's home on January 20 last year as they prepared for a night out on the town. She was found unresponsive by her mother several hours later, after complaining she hadn't heard from her daughter and that there had been no answer to calls made to Reid's mobile phone. Mr Hutchings told The Daily Telegraph he believed Indianna had suffocated under a blanket placed over her in the living room of her babysitter's house. 'I don't think she was malicious, I believe it was an accident,' he said. 'But people shouldn't be allowed to care for babies unless they know the correct way to look after them.' Reid pleaded guilty in May last year and is due to be sentenced on April 20 after her barrister, Scott Robertson, applied for a psychiatric report at a recent hearing. The couple have lodged a bid with NSW's Director of Public Prosecutions arguing that she should face a jail term over the death of their daughter. 'We know what happened to Indianna and why,' said Mr Hutchings. 'But we also think people need to be aware that it happens more than they realise.' A spokeswoman for Child Care NSW, an industry body representing 5,000 child care providers, said guidelines already existed on how children should sleep, but the organisation was preparing a new document which would set out detailed advice. 'The [new] guideline will provide clear and simple information on the risks of sharing beds with small children,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 'There are some circumstances when it is appropriate for small children to share beds, but this should only be in a parent's own home where parents can closely supervise and monitor their child.' Mr Hutchings said he had been given no indication by authorities how Indianna died after the injuries suffered. He said Reid, who also worked as an early education assistant at Campbelltown Public School, could not explain what had happened. 'She's tried to apologise but there's nothing you can do for something like that,' he said. 'I don't want to sound cruel or anything, but she should be in jail.'
