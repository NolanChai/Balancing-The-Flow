12 rounds of boxing history at the MGM Grand on May 2nd, but they wouldn’t be where they are today without their mothers standing behind them all along.
It was his mother who gave him a love for fighting and she is also responsible for teaching young Floyd to respect women as well. She never allowed her son to stay home from school to train when he was younger, believing that an education would be more important than boxing.
Floyd’s father had been shot and killed while on the job when Floyd was just six years old so his mother did everything she could for him. They lived in a two-bedroom apartment with his grandmother and they struggled to make ends meet, but his mother didn’t care as long as her son made it big someday.
While his mother had been working at the post office to keep food on the table and pay for their small apartment, Floyd was living in poverty on the streets of Grand Rapids, Michigan. He grew up with his father being murdered and not having any money to do anything, but he didn’t let it get him down because he had a dream to make something out of himself one day.
Pacquiao is no different than Mayweather when it comes to the love and support he gets from his mother. In fact, she was responsible for introducing her son to boxing in the first place by teaching him how to throw punches when he was only 10 years old.
Mom knew that her son had an innate talent for fighting and decided to sign him up for lessons with a local trainer who would give Manny the tools that he needed in order to make it big someday. In fact, she even taught her young son how to fight back when other kids tried picking on him because of his poverty-stricken lifestyle at home – something that has served Pacquiao well ever since then!
While Mayweather may not have had the same kind of struggle that Manny did growing up, he still relied heavily upon his mother’s love and support to help him through tough times as a child. In fact, she was even there for him when Floyd was sentenced to 90 days in prison after attacking an employee at a sports bar back in the year 2000!
“If it wasn’t for my mom, I wouldn’t be here,” Mayweather said on Tuesday. “I never gave up because she always believed in me.”
It is no surprise that both Floyd and Manny are so grateful to have their mothers around as they prepare for the biggest fight of their lives! They know that behind every great man there stands a woman, and we hope you enjoyed reading about how these two fighters feel about this important person in their life.
