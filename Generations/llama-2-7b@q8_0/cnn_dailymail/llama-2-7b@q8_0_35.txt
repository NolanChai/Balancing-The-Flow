The Spokane County Sheriff's Office is investigating a possible sexual assault at the River Community Church that occurred Saturday morning during service.
Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said deputies were called to 9108 N. Nevada St., near Sprague, at about 4:30 a.m. for a report of an unconscious female with no pulse and not breathing. When the deputy arrived, he found her on her back with her legs straight up in the air and blood on her legs.
"It was definitely sexual assault," Knezovich said at a news conference Monday afternoon. "There were some significant injuries."
The woman is listed in critical condition but could survive if she gets medical help soon, he said. A family member told deputies they believe the attack happened during service and the woman left service to take a nap with her legs up on pillows, Knezovich said. Her husband found her bleeding shortly before 4:30 a.m., when he went into their bedroom to wake her.
Knezovich said his office is working with other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Spokane Police Department, in the investigation. He also said it's possible others were assaulted at the church but have not come forward.
The church's website identifies the pastor as Terry Hollowell. A woman who answered the phone at his home Monday afternoon declined comment about the assault or church policy on sexual abuse.
"I don't know anything," she said, and hung up.
Knezovich said he has questions about how the church handled reports of previous sexual assaults in 2010. In one case that year, a woman reported to police she had been sexually assaulted while asleep at her home, which was within walking distance of River Community Church. The woman's husband, who is also a pastor, told investigators the assault happened after he and his wife fell asleep in their bed with her legs straight up toward the ceiling, according to police reports.
When deputies went to investigate that case, they found blood on the carpet around the woman's body but no signs of sexual assault, Knezovich said Monday. The husband told investigators he thought his wife was having a bad dream, and he did not call 911 until after she had been up all night vomiting in their bathroom sink, according to police reports.
The Spokane Police Department concluded that there wasn't enough evidence of sexual assault to arrest the husband at that point, but investigators noted the incident was "unusual," Knezovich said. The woman reported another possible sexual assault last year and a third case is under investigation with no arrests yet, he said.
Knezovich said his office has not spoken to any of the women who have reported being assaulted at the church. He declined comment on whether church officials have been helpful in investigations into past cases. He said it's possible more victims could come forward after reports about this weekend's attack go public, but he couldn't say how many more attacks may be unreported.
"We want to talk to the victim and let her know that we are here to help," Knezovich said. "I don't think anybody would have done anything different."
