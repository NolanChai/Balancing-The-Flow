 handbags and mobile phones.
Police from Scotland Yard's anti-robbery squad said they were dealing with a new generation of thieves who had learned how to avoid being caught by CCTV cameras and bystanders, and had perfected methods for distracting their victims before stealing their belongings. The pickpockets usually operate in teams of two or three. One manages to get hold of the victim's bag while a second draws attention with an insult or physical assault â€“ then runs away with it once the owner is preoccupied.
One recent incident involved a gang of four men following an older woman into a shop, where one pretended to be buying a product before stealing her handbag. One officer described how a man had grabbed another customer's bag and run out of a store as if he were being chased by a policeman. The owner had not been aware that the thief was carrying out an elaborate distraction technique, police said.
Officers are using undercover officers to identify and arrest members of the gangs.
