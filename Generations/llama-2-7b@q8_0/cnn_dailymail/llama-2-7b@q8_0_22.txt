idelined near the 49th Street-Times Square station when smoke began billowing from one of its three cars, officials said.
The subway line was shut down for about half an hour before being reopened with service resuming on a single track between Times Square and Queens Plaza, according to a tweet by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The agency said service in both directions was running normally on Monday afternoon.
Video posted online showed smoke pouring from inside one of the cars, while another clip recorded a man standing on the sidewalk nearby telling a woman to “run” and get out of the train because she was being overcome by fumes.
A spokesman for the Fire Department said firefighters were responding to reports of smoke in the subway line about 6:50 a.m., but that there were no reported injuries or deaths. The cause of the incident remained under investigation, he added.
