30-something year old Jesus (Diogo Morgado).
I can't help it. He looks like a total stud. And in that moment, I remembered just how attractive Jesus is to women. He was born and raised by God Himself as His son. That alone gives Him an instantaneous appeal to the fairer sex, but then there's also the fact that He has blonde hair, blue eyes, a nice smile, strong jawline, muscular arms, etc.
When I got married, my husband said to me on our wedding day, "I don't care if you are sleeping around with other men, as long as they look like Jesus." And that is the truth. You don't have to be a Christian (or even believe in God at all) to recognize that Jesus is good looking. He's hot.
My friend Sara and I once went through our old journals and we found where we had written about what it would be like if Jesus came back to Earth as a guy (and not a woman). We imagined He would come back with brown hair, blue eyes, broad shoulders, etc. I think I am not the only one who thinks that way.
So yeah...I find Jesus sexy too. And since I do, I want to share these funny quotes from our good friend Jesus:
Jesus on the Cross: "It's ok if you leave me now."
Jesus at the Last Supper: "Hey guys! Check out my sweet new robes!"
Jesus in the desert after 40 days and nights without sleep: "I can't wait to eat some pizza!"
Jesus on the cross: "Amen. I hope that doesn't get me into trouble with God."
Jesus on the cross: "That's why they call me Jesus."
Jesus, while he was teaching at synagogue: "Yo! Yo! What up!"
Jesus on a horse: "Hey! That's my saddle, jackass!"
Jesus to his mom after He found out she had given birth to Him without His father's knowledge: "Mom...seriously? You could have asked me."
Jesus at the wedding of Cana: "Don't worry. I've got this."
Jesus at the Last Supper, just before being arrested and tortured: "Hey guys! Check out my sweet new robes!"
Jesus on the cross, to Pilate: "What? I was just trying to have a conversation with you!"
Jesus after he rose from the dead: "I'm back!"
Jesus to his disciples before leaving them for the last time: "Guys...don't be such dummies. Don't let me down."
I think Jesus is sexy and funny too. And He knows that! I hope you enjoyed this little post as much as I enjoyed writing it. :)
