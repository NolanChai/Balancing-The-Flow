42-year-old stuntman from Argentina who has done many amazing things in his life including base jumping and performing high-flying acrobatic tricks over mountains and ravines.
The daredevil took part in an incredible feat by leaping over a sports car as it travelled at 60mph towards him, landing on top of the car in the process. The daring stunt was caught on camera from several angles including video footage taken inside the vehicle and a drone flying overhead.
Al managed to complete the stunt without any injury and was awarded $15,000 for his bravery but the stuntman said that it wasn’t worth all of the risks he took in order to win. Al has been performing incredible feats for over 20 years and has competed in several record-breaking attempts as part of the Stuntdoubles World Championships where he placed second last year behind his fellow countryman, Juan Pablo Novillo Colo.
The stuntman is now hoping to break a new Guinness World Record by performing a jump over 23 cars that will be driving in formation at speeds of up to 90mph – which he plans on doing for charity and raise money for an organisation that helps children living with cancer.
Al the Jumper is currently training hard and hoping he can set a new Guinness World Record for stunting later this year or early next year if everything goes according to plan as they have been planning it since last year but it has taken much longer than expected due to many factors such as COVID-19 restrictions affecting travel plans etc.
In conclusion, Al the Jumper is an incredibly brave man who takes risks on a daily basis in order to perform amazing feats that we can only imagine or dream about doing ourselves! His latest stunt over 60mph cars was no exception and he managed to complete it without any injury which shows just how talented this daredevil really is. We wish him all the best of luck with his next record-breaking attempt!
