its patiently for it in shallow waters off the banks of Lake Windermere, Cumbria.
He managed to land it with just one hand on his own after it snapped his rod.
Sam, who lives at Staveley near Kendal, was fishing with friends when he struck gold. He said: 'I'd only been there a short time and we were all having a laugh about the size of the fish I was getting. 'So I decided to catch one that was bigger than my own head.
'I got this fish - but it was a lot bigger than my head. It was pretty amazing - a once in a lifetime experience.' Sam has been fishing since he was eight-years old and is a keen member of his local Staveley Angling Club. The 8ft catfish - which weighs the same as boxer Ricky Hatton - is a relative of the more common American catfish found in lakes across Cumbria.
Sam, who attends Thornbridge High School at Tapton, Chesterfield, has caught many other big fish over the years, including 20 lb plus carp and pike. His family have fished for generations - his grandfather was a keen angler and Sam's dad now fishes on Windermere every week with him.
It is believed to be one of the largest catfish ever caught in England. Fisheries expert Martin Fleming said: 'I know this is a big fish and it is not often you get such huge specimens - but I don't think we have ever seen an 8ft catfish before.
The family returned to Staveley where the fish was filleted by his dad. He said: 'It took ages for my dad to fillet it and he managed to take out all of the bones and cooked it that evening.' Sam is now planning on going back to Lake Windermere in a few weeks' time with his mum and dad who are also keen anglers.
