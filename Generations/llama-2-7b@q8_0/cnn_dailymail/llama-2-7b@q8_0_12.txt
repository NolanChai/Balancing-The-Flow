The new Gorilla Glass 2 will be on display next week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas -- which is set to host a record number of companies this year -- and it's about 20 percent thinner than the current generation, according to Corning Inc., the company that makes Gorilla Glass. The glass also will be twice as touch sensitive as current versions.
That's good news for gadget makers, who are trying to cram more sensors into slimmer devices with larger screens and more computing power. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Note II, which was unveiled earlier this month, has a 5.5-inch screen; Apple hasn't announced any plans for a bigger iPhone (yet), but that could be coming soon.
"The Gorilla Glass 2 is one of those products that really is just in its infancy," said David McQueen, senior analyst at ABI Research. "It's not even been announced yet and it's already starting to take a larger share (of the market). It seems like every new product has Gorilla Glass 2 on it."
Gorilla Glass 2 is also more resistant to scratching than current versions of Gorilla Glass. According to Corning, this version of its glass can withstand 10 times as much force without cracking or breaking compared to the original product.
Besides the Galaxy Note II, Gorilla Glass 2 will be used in at least four products that'll be announced next week: Motorola Razr M, Motorola RAZR i, Samsung Galaxy Note and Acer Iconia B700.
