 Dortmund at the end of this season.
Klopp’s contract is due to expire on 30 June but the BVB coach is already negotiating a new deal which could see him stay in charge until summer 2016. But Bayern legend Beckenbauer believes Klopp, whose contract was extended by two years in October, has the qualities necessary to succeed Guardiola when he departs at the end of this season.
“I would like it if Jurgen stays for another two or three years and then goes to Bayern Munich,” Beckenbauer told Bild am Sonntag on 16 March. “He is a very intelligent person and knows exactly what the players need from him. He’s a fantastic coach who knows how to get things done.”
