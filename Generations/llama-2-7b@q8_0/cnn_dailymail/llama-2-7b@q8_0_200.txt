ents on the beach at Jumeirah Dhevanafushi (which translates to ‘Sunset Island’) is sublime and, from our balcony, we could see the island of Gan – the one they filmed Cast Away on.
But we weren’t here to lie around in swimsuits all day; there are a lot of things you can do in the Maldives beyond snorkelling or drinking cocktails by the infinity pool, and I’m going to tell you about them (because no one else will).
We’d done our research before we arrived – and this was pre-Google, pre-Pinterest, pre-Instagram. It took us a bit of digging but we came across a few things that were hard to ignore.
One, the hotel is owned by the Jumeirah Group who are known for their exquisite taste in all things luxury. And two, they’d designed each individual villa to blend into its natural surroundings – so that you felt like you were living on a private island, rather than in one.
There was no real way we could resist this.
And then there were the activities.
One of these was the jacuzzi at the edge of our beach-side villa; it had to be booked each night but it came with its own little attendant who would bring us drinks and towels and just leave them for us to enjoy until we got bored (which took a few days). It was so nice, in fact that I don’t think I’ve ever felt as relaxed.
There were also some other activities on offer – from scuba diving to spa treatments at the Jumeirah Spa – but we didn’t do any of them because it just wasn’t necessary. We spent all day in our swimsuits and flip flops, bobbing around like penguins as we dipped our feet into the warm waters and enjoyed one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen.
We did go snorkelling a few times – but that was to be expected because you can’t possibly visit the Maldives without doing it at least once (and ideally, a lot more than that). It was our first time snorkelling in coral reefs and we had so much fun. But this trip was really about relaxation; we didn’t want to be rushed around all day, just because it was there.
Jumeirah Dhevanafushi is an adult only hotel (although children are welcome at the kids club) which means you can expect complete peace and quiet – which makes a change from your average all-inclusive holiday with its loud music and packed poolside area. There were some other guests there but they mostly seemed to be couples or families so we didn’t feel like there was too much going on around us; it’s nice not having to compete for space at the infinity pool, especially when you have a view as good as ours!
There are 74 villas in total – each with its own private beach area, spacious deck and plunge pools (and of course the jacuzzi). There’s no TV or phone signal but there is wi-fi, which I found to be excellent quality considering we were so far away from home.
The best thing about Jumeirah Dhevanafushi is that you don’t have to go anywhere to do anything – you can just sit on your balcony with a cocktail in hand and watch the sunset over Gan, or take a walk down to one of their restaurants. The beach restaurant serves up some great Mediterranean food for lunch – we tried pizzas, salads, burgers and freshly caught fish (which was delicious). It’s hard not to fall in love with this place when there are so many things you can do while staying put!
The sunsets from our balcony were incredible; we spent most evenings drinking wine or beer as the sun went down, then woke up at dawn and did it all again. There’s no better way to spend your holiday than watching these beautiful scenes unfold right in front of you!
We also had some great food at Jumeirah Dhevanafushi – the restaurant was excellent; fresh seafood, steaks, pasta…you name it! They even offer a barbecue menu where you can cook your own meals on an open grill. It’s such a fun way to spend a day and I highly recommend trying it out if you ever visit this stunning island nation.
Our stay at Jumeirah Dhevanafushi was fantastic; we had everything we needed right there, including some great food and drink options. We found ourselves coming back for more every night because it’s such an enjoyable way to spend your time in this beautiful location!
