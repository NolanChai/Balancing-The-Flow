The book, titled "Playing the Man," is based on interviews with 19 Edwards supporters, campaign staffers and family friends and will hit bookstores Tuesday. It paints a portrait of an ambitious politician who put his ambitions first and allowed his wife, Elizabeth -- herself a powerful force in her own right -- to shoulder the blame for his actions.
"His ambition was stronger than he thought," author Scott Martelle quotes Edwards' friend and adviser Mike McCurry as saying. "He had no real interest in being vice president. He wanted to be president."
In Edwards' failed 2004 campaign, the book alleges that he put himself first -- at his wife Elizabeth's expense, sacrificing his family for his political aspirations.
Edwards also took a risk when he repeatedly denied fatherhood of the child born out-of-wedlock to Rielle Hunter in 2007 during his presidential campaign, the book says, and continued to deny it even after his affair with her was exposed.
He's guilty of "playing the man," a term that describes someone who is willing to do anything -- including taking advantage of others -- in order to get ahead. The phrase dates back to Shakespeare, who used it in 1596's "Othello."
"This is the Edwards we meet: ruthlessly ambitious for power and a man who will not hesitate to do or say anything if he believes it will lead him closer to that goal," Martelle writes. "In many ways, he is Othello in modern garb, his 'reputation' as important to him as his own life."
According to the book, Edwards was a man with a sense of entitlement: "He was entitled to be president, he thought, and nothing would stand in his way."
Edwards denied fathering Hunter's child when the affair became public. And despite multiple DNA tests confirming his paternity, he never admitted his daughter Quinn's motherhood until shortly before his death from cancer last week at age 61.
"I think that Edwards was fully aware of what he was doing," Martelle told CNN on Monday. "He wanted to run for president in 2008 and he knew he could not do it as a married man, given the fact that he had an illegitimate child."
Edwards' spokesman said they were unable to comment before seeing the book.
The revelation of Edwards' affair was met with condemnation from his political peers. But according to Martelle, Edwards didn't seem concerned at first about what other people thought or felt -- he just cared about himself and his ambitions.
"He was not terribly concerned about the impact on his family," he said. "He knew how deeply hurt (his wife) Elizabeth would be."
According to Martelle, Edwards' marriage to Elizabeth began to suffer when the former senator decided to run for president in 2004 -- and continued to deteriorate as he pursued that goal.
"(Elizabeth) didn't believe John would run for president," Martelle writes of her husband. "He was an able politician, but not a presidential candidate. It was a risk she wasn't willing to take."
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Edwards' wife became so frustrated by his infidelity that she threatened to leave him if he didn't come clean, Martelle writes. But according to his book, Edwards continued to deny it was his child even when Hunter was pregnant with another man's baby -- a decision the author said "seems foolhardy."
"You don't need to be a psychologist to see what was going on," Martelle told CNN. "I think he was trying desperately to hang onto this fantasy that he could run for president."
Edwards had always been a consummate political operative who, according to the book, treated his wife as an assistant during the 2004 campaign. His marriage began to crumble after his affair with Hunter became public and he continued to treat her like just another staffer when Elizabeth wanted to divorce him.
"John had lost all respect for Elizabeth," Martelle writes. "He knew she was angry, but that didn't stop him from ordering her to do the things he thought would help his political prospects."
According to the book, Edwards was willing to lie and deceive others -- even those who were closest to him -- in order to preserve his reputation as a dedicated public servant. And while he was always quick to accept credit for other people's efforts on his campaigns, the author said Edwards never took responsibility for his own actions.
"He'd rather die than admit he had failed," Martelle writes. "It had become his defining characteristic."
The book also touches on a number of other topics. It claims that John and Elizabeth were both aware of Hunter's pregnancy with the couple's daughter Quinn when the senator was running for president in 2008 -- even though he denied it publicly -- because they feared his political career would be over if word got out about the affair.
The book also recounts Edwards' involvement with Native Americans and details what happened to them after President Bill Clinton signed into law a bill that took land from several tribes in order to make room for a nuclear power plant, according to Martelle's book. The bill was called the Indian Removal Act.
Edwards wrote in his memoir "Four Trials" that the act was one of the most important pieces of legislation passed by any president -- yet few people have ever heard about it because it was buried inside a larger energy bill signed by Clinton, Martelle writes.
