24-hour staffing problems. The NHS trust said it had made "significant" efforts to address the issue and that the consultants' claims were not borne out by facts or evidence.
But Dr John Kiely, who was one of those who resigned, said a serious incident involving a patient could have happened if they did not leave immediately. He added that it "was not safe for patients to continue" at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, where staff had been on duty for 12 hours and were not provided with meal breaks or time out of the building.
The doctors said there was a failure to communicate and an inadequate system of management at the hospital, which has about 450 beds and provides services such as plastic surgery, trauma and burns treatment. Kiely told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It wasn't safe for patients to continue with staff being on duty without meals breaks and time out of the building. There was a failure to communicate between consultants, doctors and senior management."
The four resignations came after 19 other members of the hospital's medical team refused to work overnight shifts, following concerns about safety, as part of a dispute with NHS Worcestershire. Kiely said the trust had ignored repeated requests to address staffing problems at Alexandra Hospital and that there were serious issues about patient safety.
The four consultants - Dr Michael Walsh, who was appointed last year by NHS Worcestershire as the medical director for the trust; Dr John Kiely, a consultant in plastic surgery; Dr Mohamed Abdullahi, a consultant surgeon and trauma team leader; and Dr Timothy Crane, a consultant physician - were appointed last year by NHS Worcestershire as the medical directors for the trust.
NHS Worcestershire said the consultants' claims had not been borne out by facts or evidence. It added that since 2011 there had been no reported serious incident involving a patient at Alexandra Hospital related to staffing, and that it had made "significant" efforts to address staffing issues.
The trust said the consultants' claims were inaccurate, unsubstantiated and not based on any evidence of the care provided by clinicians to patients. It added: "In the last two weeks there has been a significant improvement in clinical cover at Alexandra Hospital. A second locum senior registrar was appointed from 25 February for five days per week, with four rotating consultants providing seven day a week senior medical cover."
Kiely told the BBC that the consultants had hoped to return to work at Alexandra Hospital if there were assurances over staffing and patient safety. He added: "I would hope we can go back. We haven't been offered anything in writing, so it remains to be seen whether or not they are going to do something."
A spokeswoman for NHS Worcestershire said the trust was very disappointed with the resignations and that it had tried to work with the consultants "to ensure we continue to provide a safe service at Alexandra Hospital". She added: "Our focus is now on making sure all the patients who attend our hospitals are treated in a timely fashion, with compassion and the high-quality care they deserve."
The resignations come as health secretary Jeremy Hunt looks to reduce NHS spending by Â£20bn over five years. The trust will lose 49 beds at Alexandra Hospital from April this year under a review of services that has seen two consultant-led geriatric units shut down and another move into a care home with nursing.
The trust said the closures would have "no impact on patients". In an interview with Radio 5 Live, Hunt insisted there was no crisis in the NHS and said there were some services that had been allowed to develop without any proper scrutiny. He added: "In the last couple of years we've got rid of 100 hospital trusts, so it hasn't all been about closures."
