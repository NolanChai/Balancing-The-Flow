6 years old when their dad made the decision that he would give one child an organ transplant while leaving the other without one.
In June last year, the father underwent a successful liver transplant in Ontario to save his daughter Phuoc’s life. Binh, who is now 7, had her surgery Monday night at McMaster Children’s Hospital. The twins were born on Jan. 15, 2004 and they share the same organs – except for their livers.
“I thought she would die,” said their mother, Truc Nguyen from Ontario, when her husband asked her which daughter should get the organ. “When we talked about it beforehand, I knew that it would be Phuoc because I couldn’t put my child through such a major surgery again.”
Doctors were able to save both sisters because one had two kidneys while the other only had one. Truc Nguyen told CBC News that she was not allowed to see her daughter after surgery. “My heart is broken. I want to cry,” she said through an interpreter.
The twins are now out of danger and their father is recovering in hospital from a kidney transplant operation. Phuoc Wagner’s transplant surgeon, Dr. Robert Shapiro, told reporters that the family has “been through quite a lot.”
