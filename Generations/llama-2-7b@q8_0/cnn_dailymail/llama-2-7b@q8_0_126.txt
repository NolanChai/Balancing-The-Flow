With the sale of Theo Walcott for just over £20 million in January 2012 to Southampton, followed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s departure to Liverpool last summer, the net balance of those two players is around £75m which means Arsenal have taken a net transfer income from those two deals alone of around £98m.
The sales of Robin van Persie and Samir Nasri in 2012 cost Arsenal almost nothing with both players being sold for around the same fees they had joined us - around £15m each, leaving a net balance on those two transfers of just over £6 million, or around £3.45 million per player.
The final big chunk was the sale of Cesc Fabregas in 2011 which cost Arsenal £35m to Barcelona but brought back close to that amount in return - so the net balance is around £8m, or around £4million per player.
So, as you can see, there has been a total of just under £130 million available for transfers from outgoings in recent years with the most significant players leaving the club since the start of 2012 being the sales of Adebayor and Squillaci to Manchester City (£15.8m), Denilson to Sao Paulo (£600,000) and Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona for £15 million in January 2014.
So, if you take the transfer income of around £98m from outgoings since May 2013 and add on to that another £33 million available this season with the sales of Arshavin, Chamakh, Fabianski, Squillaci and Vela - then we have a total of close to £145 million in the bank over the past four years which could be used for transfers.
So why is it that Wenger seems unable or unwilling to use this money for new players? As you’ve probably read on other sites by now, many Arsenal fans believe there are several reasons and most of them seem to be valid but one of the main ones I hear from Arsenal fans these days is that it all comes down to Wenger.
Fans will often say he ‘wants’ to sign a certain player but can’t because he doesn’t have money available for transfers, or has been told by the club that they can only spend this amount on transfers and nothing more so the manager is stuck with what he has and must work with it.
It seems a common argument too when Wenger has failed to buy a replacement player in recent transfer windows but how do we know whether or not it’s true? Well, it could be of course - and I’ve heard plenty of stories from agents about players being signed by other clubs because Arsenal ‘couldn’t afford’ them.
I’ve also heard plenty of stories about players who have said that the manager wants to sign them but has been told he can only spend a certain amount by the club and therefore they are unable to bring in new talent. However, I don’t think it really matters whether or not these claims are true - after all, agents have their own agendas too so could well be spinning stories - what does matter is if there is any truth in them at all?
As usual, the answer seems to lie somewhere in between what people say and what actually happens. For example, I’ve heard that a manager wants a player but isn’t able to sign him because of financial constraints only for it later to transpire that he could have signed the player had he wanted to - so perhaps there was never any real desire on Wenger’s part to spend any money in the first place.
On the other hand, I know that Arsenal have turned down some players this season who would have been ‘happy’ to sign for us because they were offered less money than they had been promised - so if they didn’t want it, why should we? - and of course there is also the argument that you can never trust what agents say anyway.
One thing I do know though is that if a player wants to come here he will come regardless of whether or not the club is prepared to spend money on his signing - players rarely turn down moves for Arsenal because they don’t want to play for us, so if they are interested it doesn’t matter how much we offer.
I also know that Wenger has made no secret in recent years of wanting a larger budget to spend on transfers but this doesn’t mean he is unwilling or unable to use the money available - what he says and does may be different things entirely, for example if you look at his transfer dealings over the past few seasons.
The manager has spent more than £45m in the summer of 2013 alone but also made clear that we weren’t expecting to sell any players which meant he had less money available to spend than some other managers who may have brought in cash from outgoings and used it to fund new arrivals.
But even if we ignore this, Wenger has always been one of the biggest spenders on transfers since he arrived at Arsenal all those years ago but what’s most important is that the players he buys are not only ‘worth’ their money but also good enough to play for us and help us win trophies.
Of course, Wenger has always been accused of making mistakes with his signings in recent years - from the likes of Andrey Arshavin all the way up to Lukas Podolski – and he hasn’t always made the right choices when signing new players but even if we do concede that some of them have been poor value for money then it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be on our team, especially not at Arsenal.
Some fans are convinced that Wenger only signs ‘cheap’ players - or ‘cheap’ compared to other clubs anyway - and that he is somehow unwilling or unable to sign big-money players but this is just nonsense because it simply isn’t true, as many of his previous signings can testify.
There are plenty of examples where Arsene Wenger has spent millions on new arrivals – £7.5 million for Robin van Persie in 2004 was hardly ‘cheap’ by anyone’s standards but then there were the big-money purchases of Marc Overmars in 2000, Emmanuel Petit and Gilberto Silva in 2002, Thierry Henry in 1999 - not forgetting his first signings for us like Kanu (£4.75 million), Tony Adams (£3.5 million) and Dennis Bergkamp who cost £7.5 million from Inter Milan in the summer of 1995.
So, as you can see, Wenger hasn’t always been afraid to splash out on players if he sees potential in them but what about now? Well, despite all that talk about ‘budgets’ and money for transfers we are currently sitting at around £80-£85m net in terms of our transfer income over the last four years - more than enough to buy a couple of big names as Wenger has previously done with his biggest signings.
So why not make use of it? As I said earlier, there could be plenty of reasons for Arsenal’s lack of spending in recent seasons but it doesn’t matter what those reasons are because what does is that we continue to spend the money available on new players who will help us win trophies.
If you believe that Wenger really wants to sign a player, then he should be given the funds necessary to complete that deal and not have his hands tied by some imaginary financial restrictions - if they are there then surely someone in our boardroom must know about them?
The players we’ve been linked with this season all seem to cost around £30-£40m or more – so why haven’t Arsenal put in the bids for any of them? Well, I guess the only way to find out is if they do start signing new faces.
