th Century history when gay and lesbian people were treated appallingly by the authorities and subject to violence and harassment. It follows an LGBT group from London who raised funds for striking miners during the 1984-85 strike, but it’s really about what community can mean, as well as how people – especially those on the margins of society – help each other through hardship and struggle by supporting and loving one another.
For anyone who has ever suffered discrimination or prejudice because of their sexual orientation, this film will probably hit a chord, so it’s perhaps not surprising that Miliband says he felt moved to tears while watching the emotional scenes on-screen. But what makes his comments significant is how unusual such an admission from a senior politician is in itself; and even more importantly, how positive his response was, which has prompted speculation about whether or not this could be a turning point for the Labour Party’s attitude to LGBT rights.
For decades, gay people have been treated appallingly by political parties on both sides of the Atlantic. The story of Alan Turing is just one example of how government policies can impact upon individuals’ lives – and in this case it was a Conservative politician who led calls for more severe punishment against gay men.
Many LGBT people still feel that the Labour Party, especially under Ed Miliband, has not done enough to combat homophobia or transphobia, and many of them were offended by Ed’s choice of a speechwriter in 2013, who had previously made some less than politically correct comments about gay people.
Ed’s apology for this was accepted by the LGBT Labour group, which then pledged its support to Miliband as leader of the party. It is now hopeful that he will take steps in 2015 to make the Labour Party a more welcoming place for all LGBT people. This may be wishful thinking; and if Ed does decide to promote a policy on equal marriage (or even civil partnerships) then this could have consequences elsewhere, since not everyone within his party agrees with him about this issue. But if he can persuade others to join the debate in a positive way – as he did when talking about Pride – it would be an important first step towards ensuring that LGBT people feel less alone and more accepted within the Labour Party than they do at present.
