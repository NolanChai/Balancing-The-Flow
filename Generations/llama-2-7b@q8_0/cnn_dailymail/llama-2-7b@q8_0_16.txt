ough in order to get some great shots. But there was something about this wild animal that made me want to turn and run away. The rhino's eyes were locked on mine, yet she didn't seem angry or alarmed – just focused.
This was my first time seeing a rhino up close and personal in the field. I have seen them as roadkill, dead from poaching; I had seen them as skins mounted on walls in African trophy rooms; and I had also seen them on TV wildlife documentaries. But here they were – huge, magnificent animals that looked like something out of a Jurassic Park film. They're one of the most mysterious creatures left on earth and their very existence is threatened by the illegal trade in rhino horns.
Sadly, the 17,000 or so remaining wild rhinoceroses (about half are white) are still being hunted for their horns and killed. In the last ten years, over 3,500 have been slaughtered by poachers who hack off the rhino's nose and front legs in order to steal its horns. The horn is used as an aphrodisiac in South-East Asian countries – particularly Vietnam.
The rhinos were calm, but I was pumped with adrenaline. My mind was racing; my heart thudding. I was a few metres away from an animal that can weigh four and half tons. It's not something you see every day! I wanted to get closer, but my guide gave me the signal: 'Time to move back.' I couldn't have done anything different or made any other choices, except for one thing – maybe I could have stayed still; remained calm and focused on the task at hand.
I had always been told that if you want a photo of an animal like this it is important not to run away when it gets close. The advice is: 'Never show fear!'. But the truth is, most people would panic in this situation – including me.
The horns are what makes rhinos so special; they look like huge tusks or razor-sharp daggers on their snouts. They're made of keratin, which is similar to human hair and fingernails, but harder. The black and white rhino have two horns whereas the greater one-horned rhinoceros has only one – a strange coincidence that I think was meant to be!
When they were first discovered, people thought that it was made of bone. It is only in recent times that scientists have discovered how much like human hair rhino's horns really are.
I asked the guide if we could come closer and he agreed as long as I kept my distance at all times. He had seen this happen to a few people before. He said: 'Sometimes they get too excited when they see one up close, but don't worry. They're very calm animals.'
It was only after we moved away from the rhino that I noticed something strange about it. She looked different from all of the other rhinoceroses – her horns were on either side of her nose instead of in front. It took me a few minutes to realise what this meant. I had never seen such an animal before!
The next day we went back to look for more rhinos and saw several more times, but that was the only time I got close enough to touch one with my own hands – as long as you're careful not to slip on its thick mud-like poo.
Wild animals are a bit like people; they have different personalities just like we do. This rhino seemed to be the calmest of all of them. She was so placid that it almost made me feel bad for her – almost! I will never forget this moment when she came face to face with me under my Land Rover, and then slowly backed away into the bush as if nothing had happened.
I will always remember this particular rhino and the way that she looked at me. It's a moment that has stayed with me ever since, because it reminded me of something important: 'Never show fear.' You don't need to be a hero or a warrior – just focus on your mission and keep calm!
I was in Africa for a very good reason and I made sure to stay focused on my goals. I was there with one thing in mind, but it wasn't easy getting there...
Wild animals can also have a negative effect on people who are trying to do important work – especially those who may be helping out other animals like rhinos or elephants that were once friends of ours (like lions). Wildlife conservation is more than just protecting them; it's about learning how we should treat them too!
I want you all to learn this lesson for your own good – don't show fear when faced with an animal. In my experience, they can sense if you are scared of them and it only makes things worse. So be brave like me; stay calm in the face of danger or other difficult situations – because that's what being a hero is all about!
Remember: 'Never show fear.' You don't need to be a warrior or a hero; just focus on your mission and keep calm.
