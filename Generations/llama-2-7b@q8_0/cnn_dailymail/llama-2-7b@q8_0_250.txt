 Redknapp's first signing of the summer. Redknapp admitted that he is looking to bring in more signings but admits it will take time as his targets are out of contract. He said: 'I want one or two more but it could take a while because most of my targets are out of contract.' The 29-year-old's arrival would provide competition for the likes of Samba Diakite and Jerome Thomas, who have both struggled to make an impression during their time in west London. QPR's first signing of the summer was Spanish striker Esteban Granero from Real Madrid on a free transfer.
