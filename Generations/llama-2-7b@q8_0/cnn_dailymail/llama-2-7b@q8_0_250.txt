 Formula E's 2017/18 season.
The company plans to use its existing 290bhp all-electric drive system for the car, but it has yet to confirm whether this will be able to generate more than a megawatt of power (1 million watts) - or 1,360 horsepower - and if it can then it would easily break the 200mph barrier.
Formula E is currently in its second season and has been designed to showcase electric cars and encourage manufacturers to develop cleaner cars for public use. It takes place on a mixture of street circuits around the world, including London's Olympic Park, and features teams from major brands such as Renault, Virgin Racing (owned by Richard Branson) and Jaguar.
Insane mode in Tesla’s Model S P85D is designed to provide drivers with 412bhp for five seconds before the car reverts to normal. It is available for owners who have taken the optional Ludicrous Mode option which costs £2,750 on top of a standard £95,000 Model S P85D.
The Formula E race season will begin in September 2016 and the first race will take place in Hong Kong before returning to London for two races at the end of June next year.
