1-2 start with a strained left knee, but he will be back in action just two days after missing out on their opening three games of the season. "We had no chance of winning without Melo," said coach Mike D'Antoni.
The Knicks have been hit hard by injuries, losing forward Wilson Chandler to a hamstring problem before Anthony was sidelined last week. Chandler is likely to miss this game and Anthony is expected to start as New York look for their first victory of the season. "Everybody's looking forward to playing with him," said D'Antoni, whose team lost their opening two games in London by a combined total of 51 points.
"I think our guys are going to be excited. You know, they've been down. They're getting back up again so they're not too far from where we want them." Anthony scored an NBA high 46 points on Wednesday in the US as New York beat Minnesota 126-94, their best result of the season to date.
The Knicks then lost two more games on Tuesday and Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers by a combined total of 53 points before Anthony flew across the Atlantic with his teammates. "It's great," said D'Antoni when asked how much better he feels about the team.
"He was in phenomenal shape, and to see that kind of energy in practice is very exciting." New York face a Milwaukee side who have lost all three of their games so far this season including defeats against Philadelphia on Wednesday and Washington last Sunday. They also began with a 102-96 loss at Denver when they were playing without the injured Andrew Bogut, who is again unavailable for Thursday's game at London's O2 Arena.
"It was really difficult. We got to this point where it's tough for us to go out and make a move, you know, because of the way our team's built," said coach Scott Skiles. "We were looking to do some things that we could get used to and just build something from there. We still are building."
Skiles believes he has a good squad but it is his first season in charge at Milwaukee. The Bucks lost all three of their opening games last week and the 52-year-old Skiles, who was fired by Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns, took full responsibility for his side's poor start. "You get to this point where it's tough to go out and make a move because of the way our team is built," said Skiles.
"We were looking to do some things that we can build from there. We still are building."
