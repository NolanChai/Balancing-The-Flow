 who was waiting to take her home and begin their married life  cradled his beloved in his arms.
Three years later, Rachelle is not only walking again but running, working out, dancing with friends and preparing for the biggest challenge of her young life: getting a college degree at age 21 while learning to live without use of her legs.
Through it all she has never lost hope or focus on what really matters in life: the people who love you and your ability to help others. She's been featured by Good Morning America, People magazine (twice), and The Rachael Ray Show; the stories have helped raise $100,000 for her spinal cord injury non-profit organization called Inspire.
But her story goes much deeper.
The daughter of a pastor, she was raised with a strong work ethic that's pushed her to succeed in everything she's done  including a stint at the Disney College Program and working on Broadway. Her positive attitude toward life has enabled her to adapt to challenges, including an extremely rare spinal cord injury, as well as move forward into college.
In My Lucky Life with Cancer: Holding On, Letting Go, and Finding Grace in the Face of Adversity (St. Martin's Press/Thomas Dunne Books), she describes her emotional journey as a cancer survivor from initial diagnosis at 20 to rebuilding her life after the accident that left her paralyzed.
While My Lucky Life has been lauded by readers and book critics, many have questioned whether Rachelle's story is believable given the unusual nature of her spinal cord injury (which she says occurred while diving into a pool from 8-12 feet up). In this interview for Yahoo! Health, Rachelle explains how her accident was caused, what life has been like since becoming paralyzed and how she is dealing with her new reality.
YAHOO! HEALTH: You suffered two separate injuries in your spinal cord that left you paralyzed from the neck down. Can you explain a little about your accident?
RACHELLE FRIEDMAN: I was diving into the shallow end of my parents' backyard pool on May 23, 2010 at age 18. My best friend and I had been swimming laps all day to prepare for a high school water polo game. After the game (which we won), she invited me over to her house for dinner where she had prepared my favorite chocolate cake that included a lit candle.
The party was underway when she suggested I dive into the pool, even though she knew it would be risky given the fact that I had never dived headfirst into deep water before. She thought I would land safely in the shallow end and just have to stand up again. I tried to walk back a few steps after my jump so I could go straight into the shallow end but ended up bending forward a bit as soon as I hit the water because of how much adrenaline was rushing through me from being nervous about diving. That caused me to miss the pool completely and land with a huge impact in the middle of the deep end.
I started swimming back to the surface but didn't make it before my body went numb (a sign that my neck had been broken). I felt myself sinking down and tried desperately to stay afloat by grabbing onto the water. My best friend quickly jumped in, pulled me out of the pool, and started CPR. Meanwhile, her parents called 911 immediately. The ambulance took me straight to the hospital where a neck brace was placed on my head and my body was put into traction. I underwent two surgeries that night (one to stabilize my neck and one to stop any bleeding) after which I spent about 25 days in the intensive care unit at Loyola Medical Center in Maywood, IL.
Y!H: When your spinal cord injury was first diagnosed, you were told it would be unlikely that you'd ever walk again. Were you discouraged by the news? How did you manage to remain positive?
RF: I definitely felt a huge sense of loss when my doctors told me that I might never walk or use my legs again because it meant I would be losing everything I had been working for  all my dreams. I'd spent the last 10 years preparing myself to become an actress and singer in New York City, so those were devastating words to hear at such a young age.
But then my pastor father reminded me that even if I could never walk again or work on Broadway, there was still plenty for me to do with the rest of my life  especially since I had so much more time than most people in this situation who die or are paralyzed immediately after a spinal cord injury.
So I decided from the beginning not to waste one single second worrying about what could be taken away from me but instead to focus on all of the good things that I still had: my friends, family, and most importantly, my ability to help other people in need. That gave me so much hope for the future because even though I was physically limited now, there were still countless ways that I could make an impact with my life from where I sat.
Y!H: You said you've been overwhelmed by all the support you've received since your accident. How has it changed you? What have you learned about people as a result?
RF: Being in this wheelchair and being paralyzed at such a young age has allowed me to learn so much more about the power of forgiveness, generosity, and compassion because I've been on both sides of that fence  giving and receiving. When I was injured I didn't even realize how self-centered I had become over the years until I was forced to stop walking around with a stick in my hand like a victim all the time.
It was then when people would come up to me to tell their stories of struggle or give me a donation that I realized what an important role I played as a leader for them because it was such a blessing to be able to help others who had so much less than what I did  even though I'd lost the use of my legs.
Being paralyzed has also taught me how to live with greater gratitude and more humility than ever before, which is one reason why I feel so lucky with what happened to me because there are people who were born without arms or legs that can never get the chance to experience life the way that I have.
Y!H: What has been most difficult about your new reality? How have you coped?
RF: There is a lot of pain and suffering that comes with being paralyzed because it's not just the loss of walking around; it's also having to deal with people staring at me in public all the time, which has caused me so much embarrassment. I think it's easier for other people to cope with their problems than it is for a person like me who can't control what happens to her body because she is in an electric wheelchair and needs help from someone else just to get from one place to another.
I've also found that I have less privacy now since the accident, especially when living alone on my own, because if something goes wrong then there's no way for me to call 911 or any other emergency service number unless somebody else picks up the phone first. And if they don't know how urgent it is then they might just end up hanging up which could be very dangerous in an accident situation where every second counts.
Y!H: You started the nonprofit organization Inspire to help other people with disabilities. What inspired you to start this charity?
RF: My pastor father (Rev. Michael Friedman) has always been my biggest inspiration because he is an incredible example of how to overcome adversity and live a life full of love, peace, joy, and faith in God despite being paralyzed himself from the neck down since 1970 when he was only seven years old.
The idea for Inspire actually came from my dad because I wanted to do something special with my life after being paralyzed myself which would be different than what everyone else expected me to do based on their preconceived notions of who I used to be before the accident happened. He told me that God had placed a special purpose for both of us in this world and that it was up to each one of us individually whether or not we were going to choose to fulfill that calling through serving others as leaders instead of being followers by letting other people lead our lives after something tragic happens like this.
Y!H: You have been an athlete your whole life  from cheerleading at age three to water polo and acting in high school. How has it felt for you to be unable to move around as freely anymore? Has anything surprised you about the experience of being paralyzed?
RF: It was really hard to give up my active lifestyle after becoming paralyzed because I'd always been so involved with sports and exercise. That's why one of the main reasons for
