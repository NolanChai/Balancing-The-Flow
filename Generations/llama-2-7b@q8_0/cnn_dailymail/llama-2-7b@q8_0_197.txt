at Ghediri's voice was heard on the Internet, telling supporters of his former boss that they should stop sending him messages and rumors about his whereabouts.
He said he had been busy with "the most important issues" for the last five days. He gave no indication of when or how he escaped from captivity.
Earlier Saturday, Libyan state television reported that a special forces unit captured Ghediri in Tripoli and found weapons and ammunition at his residence. It said he was on its wanted list but did not elaborate on the reasons for his capture. The report could not be immediately verified and there were no other details about his whereabouts or condition.
The capture of Gadhafi's former spokesman comes just days after a French court issued an international arrest warrant for him. Ghediri, 42, was charged with murder over his role in the crackdown against protesters. He is also suspected of being involved in kidnappings and other crimes committed during Gadhafi's four-decade rule.
In March, Libyan authorities said they captured Ghediri at a hotel near Tripoli airport after he fled to Tunisia. It was not immediately clear if Saturday's report referred to the same incident. The government has not commented on his whereabouts since then.
The report came as a special Libya court held its first hearing in Tripoli, two months after its opening session in Benghazi, east of Tripoli. The court is investigating alleged war crimes committed during last year's civil war and will decide later if there are enough evidence to prosecute the accused or close the cases.
In Saturday's hearing, the judges heard from one witness who said he was captured by a militia that had been loyal to Gadhafi before being transferred to Misrata where he saw dead bodies of civilians and fighters at hospitals and morgues.
