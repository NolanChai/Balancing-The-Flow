Brynn Johnson and Cassie Miller have known each other for some time, but seven months ago they were brought together by a terrible tragedy. Cassie was in her car picking up Brynn’s son for preschool when the unthinkable happened; Brynn’s wife died in a car accident after running out of gas.
Despite not being romantically attracted to each other, they needed comfort from one another. They found it in the bedroom and the passion between them was electric. Cassie realized that she could give Brynn what he wanted, but couldn’t give herself what she deserved; a forever love with someone who would commit to her as much as she committed to him.
Brynn knew their time together had to come to an end. He promised himself it would never be long and it wouldn’t be painful. After all, the only thing worse than losing his wife was hurting Cassie. But he couldn’t keep that promise; instead, a chain reaction of events set in motion by Brynn’s decision resulted in loss after loss for everyone involved—loss of trust, loss of love, and ultimately, loss of life.
When Brynn is finally able to face the pain of losing Cassie, he realizes how wrong he was about what he deserved. Now it’s too late for an apology or a promise; all that matters are their memories together. The only thing left for him to do is pray they can be enough...
“How much did you drink?” I asked. “I don’t want you driving.”
He shook his head and tried to smile. “You think I’m drunk, right? That’s what I get for letting Cassie bustle around with the kids all day while I do nothing but watch them.”
“That sounds about right,” I replied, leaning against the kitchen island as he came into the room. I loved watching him move through his house. He was so relaxed in it that I sometimes forgot how much money must have been involved to create the comfortable and stylish atmosphere we had in this place. It wasn’t flashy or overdone; instead, it was understated but inviting.
“You’re right,” he agreed. “I think I’ve been letting her take care of me for so long now that sometimes I just let her do whatever she wants to.” He ran his hands through his hair in a gesture I recognized from the night we met. “I know I shouldn’t be like this, but I don’t want to mess everything up and I know that if I drink anything, it will happen anyway.”
“We can have wine with dinner,” I said. He looked at me blankly, as though he hadn’t considered alcohol other than for medicinal purposes during the past year or so. “It won’t make you sick,” I said, nodding to his glass of water on the counter. “You want a glass?”
He looked down at it and frowned. “I don’t know if I can stomach anything right now.”
“Sure you can; just one glass.”
He shook his head again and put his hands up, palms outward in front of me as though to ward me off. “That’s okay. I have to get back outside. The kids are going to be so disappointed when we don’t play ball tonight.” He turned toward the door.
“Cassie will explain it to them,” I said, following him out into the living room where he was watching the kids play with their dog. They were running around in circles, chasing after something that resembled a beach ball. “What do you think about some wine?” I asked again as he sat down on his favorite chair and watched them.
He shook his head, looking uncomfortable but trying to hide it by shrugging. I turned to go back into the kitchen but then heard the words tumble out of my mouth before I could stop myself: “You’ll feel better.”
Brynn turned toward me so quickly that I almost jumped out of my skin and felt myself flush all over again, not because he was angry with me or trying to change the subject, but because he smiled. “What did you say?” he asked.
“I said,” I repeated, feeling stupid now, “that if we have a glass of wine, you’ll feel better.”
He nodded, still smiling at me. I knew exactly what he was doing and I felt a rush of heat from head to toe. It was such a familiar sensation that I almost didn’t want him to stop smiling; it made my skin tingle and made me crazy with the need for more.
“I think you’re right,” he said, getting up out of his chair so he could stand in front of me. “You know what?” he asked, taking a step toward me until I felt his body heat against mine. “Wine sounds great.”
He kissed me then—the first real kiss since the day we met. It was soft and sweet but with a lot of promise for things to come.
“Do you want some wine too?” he asked when he pulled away from my mouth. He reached toward the bar cart on his other side, grabbing two glasses that were already filled. “We’ve been through enough shit this week that I don’t think it will hurt,” he said.
I followed him back into the kitchen and poured a glass for each of us from the bottle of Malbec Cassie had left chilling in the fridge. We both took a sip, staring at one another as we tasted the fruity notes before letting our gazes drop to the wine in our glasses. I realized then that there were only three glasses on the bar cart and I suddenly wondered where Cassie was.
“Do you want some more?” Brynn asked me, turning away from his glass and toward mine again. His eyes searched my face for something, maybe an answer to his question but also maybe a sign of what we could be together.
I nodded once before answering, “No; I’m fine.”
“Good,” he said as if it were the only thing that mattered in the world right now—to make me feel better. He turned around again and finished off his wine while I sipped mine, both of us silent for a few minutes until Brynn broke the silence with what we both knew was coming next: “So…how about dinner?”
“Do you want to eat here or go out somewhere else? I know there are a million kids’ menus around this place. I think Tao has one too.” He had already given up on talking, which was good because I didn’t feel like we needed words right now. It was enough just to have him in my house while his wife was away.
“Let’s go out somewhere,” he said. “I haven’t been anywhere fun since…since it all happened.” He squeezed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger, then let it drop down against the curve of his jaw. He shook his head a little as if he had no idea what to do with himself or how to make the next step, but I knew exactly how to get him going.
“How about Tao?” I suggested, nodding toward the restaurant on the corner that was well-known for its Chinese menu and high prices. It wasn’t close to my house so there was no way I could just go there with him; instead, it would have to be an arranged date like we’d had before—a blind date if you will.
“Tao,” he replied. “It sounds perfect.” He took another sip of his wine and then stared down into the glass as though wondering how much was left and what that meant about him. He set it on the counter without finishing it off, but I knew he would be fine; he’d had a lot more to drink over the past year than he was letting on now.
“I think it might be too cold to sit outside tonight,” I said as I walked toward his kitchen bar stool and took one of my own glasses so we could finish off our wine together. “How about you?” I asked, watching him take a sip from the edge of the counter. He nodded; I could tell he had no idea where Cassie was right now or how long it would be before she came home again.
“Yeah,” he agreed, then followed me to the kitchen island as I put my glass on its side so we could swirl our wine and watch the red liquid mix together with the brown chips of sediment that had settled at the bottom. “I don’t want to sit out there by ourselves right now either.”
I knew what he meant—it was too soon after her death for me to spend a date alone on the deck, even if we were just drinking wine and talking like I did with him all those times before she died. We would have had some privacy but not enough to feel comfortable being ourselves in front of each other again.
“I know this restaurant is expensive,” he said suddenly, taking my hand as he walked over to where I stood by the island. “We can go somewhere cheaper if it makes you uncomfortable.” He was still holding onto me and I felt his warmth against the back of my arm while I studied our hands clasped together between us.
