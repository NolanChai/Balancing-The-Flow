́s Figo’s 90th-minute winner on Wednesday had had, Coral – the bookies – cut Brazil to 15/8 to win the World Cup, from 2/7 before kick off. The betting was closed in some cases before the game ended.
Those odds are long odds indeed for a side that has won more World Cups than any other nation and is famed for its golden-generation of players – or “canarinho” as Brazil is known, which translates into little yellow bird. But the betting markets were in tune with how the nation was feeling after the game.
Some people are suggesting the result had more to do with the tactical masterstroke of coach Luiz Felipe Scolari – the man who led Brazil to glory at last year’s Confederations Cup in South Africa, where they beat England 2-1 in a final that was played in torrential downpours.
Scolari had given his team an ultimatum: either play together as a unit and for each other or get eliminated from the group stages of this World Cup – at which point Brazil would have become just the second nation in history to exit the tournament at the first stage, after North Korea failed to win any games in 1966.
The team, many of whom were still smarting from being humiliated on home soil by Germany four years ago in a semi-final defeat that cost Scolari his job as Brazil coach, responded with the greatest fightback in World Cup history and the best football to be seen on this tournament’s opening night.
The 51-year old from Minas Gerais state was given the job of reviving the spirit of the Brazilian national team after that defeat by Germany. He was a success at his first try, leading them to a third World Cup crown in 2002 and has been widely praised for his handling of the squad since his appointment as coach last year.
Many Brazilians will be hoping this is not the only time they are able to celebrate this summer.
