 Darnley and her children were thought to be on the run after MI5 intervened and raised concerns they would travel to join Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL).
The BBC has reported that Mr Malik – who was described as a "low-risk" case in an open letter from the Stop Islamophobia group – has been arrested by Turkish authorities. The couple had been believed to have travelled to Istanbul earlier this week, and were said to be staying at a hotel there ahead of plans to fly on to Syria via Germany.
It was also claimed that the two children were "safe and well", but their names have not yet been released by police. Mr Malik's mother-in-law Jan Darnley had previously urged for him to come home, telling BBC Radio 4: "They are not ISIS, they don't want to join ISIS."
The couple were reported as having left their home in Slough with their children – aged five years old and under – after MI5 raised concerns that the family would travel to Syria. The Stop Islamophobia group said: "Asif is an innocent man who has been portrayed by the media as a 'jihadi bride's husband'. Asif is not a terrorist, he is a loving father and has no links to any extremists."
The group added that Mr Malik was a "low risk" case but had been placed under MI5 surveillance after being in contact with two IS supporters online. One of the men, who met Asif via Facebook, was jailed for three years and four months last month for sending electronic messages promoting terrorism. The man's sister, Ammara Nadeem, said: "My brother's been jailed but there's not much I can do to stop my brother from coming back out of prison."
Mother-in-law Darnley added that her son-in-law had gone to Turkey for a job and that he was on his way home. The 53-year-old told BBC Radio 4: "I don't think he would ever go anywhere near Syria, or join ISIS. I just know him as my son."
She added that she did not understand why the family had been removed from a government counter terrorism list and that her daughter was being "railroaded" by MI5. The couple's friends told the BBC: "There is no doubt in our minds about who Asif Malik really is, he has never made any threats of violence."
A spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said they were aware of a missing persons inquiry being carried out by British authorities and that they were providing support to other agencies.
