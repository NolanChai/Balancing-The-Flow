 at the Wolong Nature Reserve. It means that they have now had sex 28 times over the course of five years - which equates to around 1,036 hours in bed together! Lu Lu is the son of famous pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian – who are also on display at the Washington Zoo. The male was born in 2005 and has been nicknamed 'Little Golden Egg' - due to his golden fur that he inherited from his parents!
Pandas have an incredibly complex sex life, as only half of all mating attempts result in conception. This means that pandas must mate with more than one partner during each breeding season (usually between August and October). They can also get pregnant twice per year if they are lucky enough to conceive on both occasions – although this is very rare. As well as being the most sexually active mammal, pandas are also believed to be among the longest-living land animals in existence!
Lu Lu's new record may sound impressive but it pales in comparison to some of his parent's achievements: Mei Xiang has had sex with Tian Tian 176 times and Zhen Zhen twice as many – that's almost half a thousand hours in bed! Pandas have an incredible amount of stamina and are known for their long-lasting love affairs. They can mate for up to seven minutes at a time, which is considerably longer than other species such as lions or tigers who only last around two minutes on average (according to data collected by researchers).
This isn't the first time that Lu Lu has made headlines: he was already famous after being born in captivity when his mother gave birth at just five days old. He became one of China's most celebrated cubs before going off on loan back home where he continued to impress fans with his impressive skills – including climbing trees and swimming!
Pandas are among the most sexually active mammals in existence, with some individuals known for having up to 176 sexual partners. However, this new record has been set by Lu Lu who is believed to have mated with Zhen Zhen for an impressive seven minutes and 45 seconds – that's almost twice as long as other species such as lions or tigers!
