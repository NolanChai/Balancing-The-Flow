artorial and musical extravaganza.
The first thing you notice when attending a Ghanaian funeral is that everyone is dressed in their very best. This includes the deceased's relatives and friends as well as people who never knew him or her before.
If you are not familiar with the deceased, it can be quite difficult to find your way around the funeral grounds. People dressed in white are clearly members of the immediate family (although, occasionally, they will also be dressed in red). Next are relatives and friends, all wearing a variety of colors: blue, purple, green or orange.
Then there is the sea of mourners dressed in black. These are people who have never met the deceased but come to pay their respects at funerals as a matter of course (in some cases because they are required to do so).
But this does not mean that every visitor wears black -- far from it, there is also an abundance of colors in this sea: pink, yellow, green and even red.
The reason for the wide variety of colors may lie in Ghana's religious culture. The vast majority of its people are Christians but Islam and traditional religions continue to be practiced by many Ghanaians as well. In fact, Muslims make up about one-fifth of Ghana's population and 70 percent of the country is considered traditional.
And although funerals in Ghana can take place within any of these three belief systems, the color black has no sacred connotation whatsoever -- which is why it is so rarely worn at funerals.
The most common colors that mourners wear to a Christian funeral are white and pink. White because Jesus was thought to have been a "light-skinned" man (although he could be anything but) while pink is believed by some Christians to have special significance on account of its close resemblance to the color of blood, which reminds us that our bodies were created from earth.
But most Ghanaian mourners are unaware of this association and simply wear whatever colors they feel like wearing at funerals. And they feel free to mix-and-match these colors as well: A white top worn with a red skirt, for example, or an orange dress teamed up with yellow shoes (in the latter case, the color scheme may be based on a popular soccer team).
For the same reason that many Ghanaians are unfamiliar with the significance of black at funerals, they also do not know why it is so rarely worn. The answer lies in an ancient belief according to which the deceased can only enter heaven if he or she is wearing white on earth (a notion that seems to have been borrowed from Islam).
Consequently, it is considered bad luck for a person to wear black clothes during a funeral, so all visitors are advised to do so. If they fail to take this advice into consideration and end up in the wrong color group anyway, they may be asked to change (but not always!).
Because people from different religious groups often attend the same funerals in Ghana, there is also a high degree of confusion as far as mourning rituals are concerned. In this case too, visitors need to follow their hosts' instructions carefully.
For instance, when they arrive at the church or mosque where a Christian funeral will take place, it is common for them to be asked whether they would like to "go to church" with the deceased's family. In other words: Would you like to see him in heaven? If they say yes (which most people do), then they are given a black handkerchief, which should be draped around their necks for the entire ceremony.
This may come as a surprise to visitors from Christian countries where funerals and church services have traditionally been separate events. In Ghana, on the other hand, both of these rites usually take place in one venue. And while they are officially meant to be two distinct ceremonies -- with a service held at the funeral home or cemetery followed by another service in church -- this is not always adhered to strictly.
As it happens, mourners sometimes wear their handkerchiefs even during church services (so-called "catholic" and "evangelical" funerals) but are expected to remove them for the traditional rites which follow afterwards (the so-called "native" or "local" funeral).
Mourning rituals can be particularly confusing when visitors attend a Muslim funeral in Ghana. This is because they will find themselves at what seems like an endless series of funerals: first, the burial service and then another one held shortly afterwards to welcome people from far away who could not make it to the first ceremony (this may be followed by yet another funeral to welcome visitors coming from even greater distances).
It is only after all this that you can go home.
