ingling together, in an attempt to confuse their predator from above, as it searches for prey below.
The images were captured by Alex Mustard, 42, who specialises in underwater wildlife photography. He said: ‘I’ve always found sharks fascinating and I wanted to do something different with these pictures – I hope they will help people appreciate that they can be as amazing at sea as on land.’

The first photo shows a shoal of fish darting together in an attempt to stay one step ahead of the predator above.
This image shows how a shark has become distracted by the movement and is looking for food below – while another is waiting its turn to attack prey from above.
Mr Mustard, who runs a company called Wild Ocean, added: ‘Fish are very clever – they form huge shoals because they know that predators are more likely to attack individuals rather than a large group.
‘A big group will also confuse the shark and it is much easier for the fish to swim away if one or two individual fish get eaten.’
He added: ‘If you’re in a shoal of fish, there’s no point looking up at all – keep your head down. You just have to be very, very patient.’
The images were captured from 80ft below the surface off the island of Tavarua in Fiji. He said: ‘Sharks are one of nature’s most feared creatures but there is no reason to worry if you come across a shark.
‘They only attack humans if they feel threatened and I have never had any problems while diving with them.’
