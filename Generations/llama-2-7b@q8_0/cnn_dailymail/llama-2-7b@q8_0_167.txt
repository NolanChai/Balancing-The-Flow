Cuba was among those nations that were suspended following the Cuban missile crisis, when it came within days of an all-out war with the United States over Soviet nuclear missiles installed on Cuba by Fidel Castro in violation of a pledge not to do so.
The decision was 24 votes for and four against. Only the United States voted against lifting the suspension. Canada, Guatemala and Mexico abstained. The 34 members that make up the OAS include several Caribbean nations as well as Canada, Brazil and Chile.
A day earlier, the region's foreign ministers had failed to reach a consensus on the issue and voted instead to continue discussing the matter, which has been ongoing for more than a year.
The decision means that Cuba will be able to resume full membership in the 34-nation organization, but that it cannot vote at this week's meeting, or take part in any of its committees.
"We have sent a strong signal," said OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza. "The member states of the OAS are very clear: There is no place for Cuba in this organization until there are democratic changes."
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who is hosting the meeting, has been at odds with Cuban authorities over his decision to grant asylum earlier this year to Fidel Castro's brother and rival leader Raul Castro.
Zelaya had sought to allow a vote on lifting Cuba's suspension during the first day of the meeting Tuesday -- a move that was blocked by the United States, which said it wanted more time to continue negotiating with countries who were opposed to the measure. The United States has lobbied hard in recent months to persuade Caribbean and Latin American nations not to lift Cuba's suspension, arguing that the island nation remains undemocratic and an ally of terrorism.
The vote on Wednesday came at a meeting called to discuss whether Honduras should be reinstated as a full member in the OAS after Zelaya was deposed in June following a power struggle between him and the country's supreme court. The U.S. government refused to recognize President Manuel Zelaya, arguing that he had violated his nation's constitution when he pushed to hold a nonbinding referendum on rewriting it.
In October, the OAS voted 19-2 in favor of suspending Honduras from the group for six months because the country failed to recognize an electoral court decision ordering Zelaya restored as president. The United States and Costa Rica were the only two nations voting against that decision.
