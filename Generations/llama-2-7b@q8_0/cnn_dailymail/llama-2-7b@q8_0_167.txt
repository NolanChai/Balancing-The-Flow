Ms Bartholomew and her friends, who have all been cast in the new season of HBO's hit series, had planned to attend a Game Of Thrones-themed party on Sunday evening, but their plans were thwarted when they couldn’t find any chicken to cook for the feast.
In an explosive Instagram post that has since been deleted, Ms Bartholomew wrote: “I went into butchers to buy some chickens and was told by a male employee that I should have gone somewhere else because they didn’t sell women food.
“This is Australia 2014 people … we need to educate these narrow-minded idiots who think it is funny.”
But in a statement released late on Monday night, the butchers said Ms Bartholomew had left an angry voicemail with one of their employees when they couldn’t find chicken for her.
“After many attempts to contact this person by phone we received a threatening message from one of her friends saying we will be getting some nasty emails from them,” the butchers said in a statement on Instagram.
“We are not racist or sexist and we don’t care what gender you are, we just want our customers to feel comfortable when they come into our shop.”

The statement continued: “We have a lot of young kids who work here and we are very upset that people think they can come into our shop and be rude to them because they don’t sell women food.”
Ms Bartholomew then posted another screenshot of the voicemail, which showed she was asking for a large chicken.
She later deleted both posts but told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that her friends had been invited to the Game Of Thrones party as part of an acting class she has attended in Sydney’s western suburbs since 2011.
The group have also appeared in TV series such as Dance Academy, Packed To The Rafters and Underbelly.
“We were actually filming for a Game Of Thrones-themed party we had organised to attend,” she said. “It was just going to be a casual get together of friends.”
The 27-year-old, who has been in a relationship with Mr Guerra since last year, told Fairfax Media it wasn’t the first time that sexism had gotten the better of her while shopping for dinner.
“It is always women who go into butchers and are treated like they don’t know what to do or as though they aren’t allowed in,” she said.
“I have been told it is a man’s shop and I should leave because I am not a man.”

In the voicemail, which was received by the butcher last month, Ms Bartholomew can be heard saying: “Can you get me some big chicken breasts please … I need four of them. I have to feed 25 people.”
She said she would return later that day because she wasn’t able to buy the chicken at her local supermarket, where they had no stock in store.
The butcher told Fairfax Media he couldn’t remember who left the voicemail but insisted it wasn’t Ms Bartholomew.
“She never came back and she never picked up the phone,” he said. “We have spoken to her and she was very rude … she said we don’t sell women food.”
When contacted for comment, Mr Guerra’s manager, Brett Tucker of Ridgway Management, declined to provide a statement on behalf of his client.
