In a motion filed Monday with the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich said the case against Thomas Arthur was "legally insufficient" and requested that his death sentence be overturned.
Rich's office will then decide whether to retry him in a trial or drop all charges against him. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for Aug. 17, according to a statement by the court.
Arthur's attorneys said they were "ecstatic" about the news and hope he will be free as soon as possible.
"Mr. Arthur has spent nearly three decades in prison wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit," attorney Bernard Harcourt said in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday night. "Today, his wrongful imprisonment finally came to an end."
Arthur was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1982 murders of two elderly women at their Mobile County home. A jury recommended he be executed in September 1985 but the sentence was never carried out because Alabama courts found it unconstitutional.
The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that ruling in a decision last year that declared the state's execution protocol constitutional, opening the way for Arthur's death sentence to be reinstated. He spent his 30th birthday on death row earlier this month.
"I look forward to being released from prison and returning home to my family," he said in a statement last week after a federal judge ruled that he had no legal right to the new hearing. "In all honesty, I don't know what I will feel when I am free again."
Arthur's attorneys have long maintained his innocence and argued the case against him relies on questionable evidence. They say Arthur was wrongfully convicted by a jury that believed he had ties to an organized crime ring called "The Company" that authorities said operated in Mobile at the time.
They also note that Arthur has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He previously won two stays from execution after courts found Alabama's death penalty procedure was unconstitutional.
