 Zabiela, 35, fled from Lithuania after being jailed for the killings and lived under an assumed name in Newcastle before moving south and then settling on the Wirral.
The Lithuanian national arrived in England around ten years ago on a student visa but when his student status expired he remained in the country illegally, claiming he had been unable to return because of “family problems”. In 2012, Zabiela was arrested and charged with assault.
Five months later, police raided his flat and discovered a false Lithuanian passport and travel documents in the name of Zabiela’s real identity as well as several weapons. A further search of his car uncovered two bottles containing traces of urine and faeces – which were confirmed by fingerprint analysis to be human excrement.
On December 2013, he pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury. He was sentenced to four years in jail but his sentence was reduced on appeal on the basis that he had not used the gun and it was “not a suitable weapon for him”.
However, Zabiela was still behind bars when in 2014 he was extradited to Lithuania to face charges of murdering two men – one of whom he stabbed to death at a house party. He spent just under two years on remand in Vilnius before being convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve 25 years.
On appeal, Zabiela’s sentence was reduced to 18 years – but it meant he should have been returned to England at the end of last year so as to ensure his deportation did not cause him undue hardship or delay. But Lithuanian authorities decided to release him early in July and he remained in the UK illegally, meaning he was classed as an overstayer.
After being told he must leave Britain by December 31, Zabiela applied for refugee status on the basis that he had a fear of returning home but failed in his bid to stay in England after it emerged he was being investigated by Lithuanian police who were looking into other offences.
However, with just days before he was due to be deported, Zabiela’s lawyers applied for an urgent injunction at a court hearing on January 8 which sought to delay his removal until March 17 – by which time they said he would have recovered from depression and been “rehabilitated”.
On January 23, Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused the extension and granted Zabiela two weeks to appeal. However, his lawyers failed to secure an extension before a deadline set for March 10 at which time the court would have been forced to deport him immediately – meaning he could only remain in the UK by claiming asylum or becoming subject to a human rights investigation.
With his future still unclear, Zabiela has now sought an appeal against his removal in the European Court of Human Rights and it is not clear whether he will be allowed to stay until his case is heard. As a result, taxpayers will continue footing the bill for Zabiela’s upkeep after paying £325,000 for him to remain on bail.
