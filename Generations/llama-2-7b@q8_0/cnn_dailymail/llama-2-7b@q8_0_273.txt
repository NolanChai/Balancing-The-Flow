The first thing I thought about when I heard this story was a joke from an old SNL sketch where the "War on Christmas" is being fought by two guys with cardboard signs and one of them has his sign that says, "Merry War on Christmas!" The other guy's sign is missing.
Anyway, I'm not surprised to hear about this lawsuit because it seems like these cases always happen when the holiday season starts. For a long time in my state there was an organization that would go around with cardboard signs during the month of December asking for donations to buy food and other necessities for poor people. Some Christians saw this as "forced charity" (meaning it's wrong to use the law or any force to compel someone to give money) but they also said that the organization was violating a state law about fundraising without a license. This group appealed, lost and had to stop operating in my area.
Then there was that guy who got arrested for putting up his own Christmas lights at night because it violated his HOA's rules. I think they also sued the city. There are probably hundreds of similar stories every year. And then you have the ones where people sue over a business opening on Thanksgiving Day or some such thing.
I guess what bothers me about these cases is that I don't understand how they violate anyone's rights. If someone doesn't want to buy something, then just don't. If you think there's an issue with your HOA and its rules, then change the rules or leave. Or start a new organization (I believe one of these groups is trying to do that right now).
If these lawsuits are really about religious freedom, I think it's also worth noting that many Christians objected to this particular store opening on Thanksgiving because they said it violated the sanctity of the holiday. So what would you call a lawsuit where someone sues another person for violating their own "right" to keep a business closed?
@Chuck, I believe the correct response is, "Today we celebrate Thanksgiving. Tomorrow, we begin Christmas!"
This is great! The store is open on Thanksgiving and now they are suing them for opening up before 10AM on Black Friday. What a world we live in.
These people should be sued for wasting the courts time with frivolous lawsuits like this.
What is wrong with these people?? I think some of them need a reality check and find out what's going on around them before filing a lawsuit!!
Wow, when it comes to holidays there are now more than just religious ones. First, thanksgiving day shopping became a big thing in the late 80s early 90s I think, and then we had Black Friday sales for even longer, but now apparently Thanksgiving is not long enough so let's push it up to midnight...okay, and after that the holiday season isn't long enough so let's start with midnight on Thursday..okay? Now it seems the holidays are being shortened even more because there won't be any time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I think these people need to find a hobby, or at least get a job.
I can't wait until Black Friday starts – the day we finally honor our debts to each other!
