 her for not paying, she says the person has yet to make eye contact or engage in conversation.
Amy Fraser of Halifax was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2009 and had to have part of a leg amputated below the knee, though she still wears a prosthetic limb today. In the wake of her surgery, she says she received two notes on her windshield from someone who lives nearby: one saying that Fraser’s parking lot spot wasn’t reserved for her only, and another telling her not to leave her handicap sticker in it.
“I just started getting these notes and I was like, ‘Who is this? What did I do wrong?'” Fraser said.
But after three years of notes, Fraser says she has yet to make eye contact with the person who left them on her windshield. She’s not sure if they’re from a man or woman.
“I don’t know if it’s like the opposite of my problem,” said Fraser, 39, who had to use a wheelchair for about two years after surgery. “[They] have this person in their life and they just can’t deal with them.”
Fraser says she has tried to engage the person but was rebuffed when she asked if everything was alright. She said that all her neighbors know each other, so it may be a case of a misunderstanding, but she wants answers.
“I don’t understand why they would feel the need to write me notes,” Fraser said. “It’s really weird.”
