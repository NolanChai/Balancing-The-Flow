agers and players out of work, but with the latest match postponed because of Covid-19, it is hard not to feel for the fans as they wait in limbo for their next chance to witness a game at Villa Park.
At least Villa’s supporters were afforded some brief respite after Christmas when their side reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup – and that meant there was a trip to Manchester United in the New Year, albeit an empty one as Old Trafford was closed for Covid-related reasons.
The club had only drawn at home with West Ham United in December before losing on penalties to Brentford in a cup quarter-final and then 2-0 to Southampton four days later; their worst run of form since relegation from the Premier League two seasons ago was still not quite at an end.
That followed another three league matches without a win, having last lost as many on the final day of the 2018-19 campaign – and after that, there were four wins in the space of five games to take Villa into the top half of the Premier League table.
Steven Gerrard’s side had drawn 1-1 at home with Arsenal and Leicester City either side of a trip to Manchester City and they followed up those three matches in December by beating Burnley 2-0 on Boxing Day before two more goalless draws.
Villa were also given an extra day’s rest following their last game, with the first of back-to-back home fixtures against Everton postponed because of Covid issues in the visitors’ squad. The second game was called off after Aston Villa reported a further positive case and that means they will still be without any league points by the time the New Year arrives.
And even then, there is no guarantee that their next outing will be at home to Everton on 13 January as there are more postponements ahead.
Brentford’s win against Burnley was a first away from home in seven attempts but their poor record at Turf Moor over the past five years had been even worse, with no wins and only one goal scored in six league games (D4 L2).
The Bees had last won in Lancashire when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-0 on the opening day of the 2016-17 season but, after failing to win any of their first nine matches this season, that changed on New Year’s Day as goals from Said Benrahma and Bryan Mbeumo gave them a first away success since April 2019.

Brentford have only won one of their last seven league games (D4 L2), but that victory was at home against Newcastle United in December – the first time they had beaten a team currently in the Premier League’s top 10 since April 2019.
They also recorded their biggest ever win over an English side when they beat Wrexham in the FA Cup fourth round, and have won their last three matches across all competitions without conceding – their best run since October 2020.
