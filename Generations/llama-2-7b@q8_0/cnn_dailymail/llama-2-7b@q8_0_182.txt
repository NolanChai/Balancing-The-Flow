 the love interest of Dr. Bruce Banner. She had only one problem with the script when they presented it to her -- the character of Betty was an ice queen who was cold toward men.
"She's very hard-edged and a little bit more reserved," said Tyler. "I didn't know if that would be what my fans wanted to see." But director Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) insisted on keeping it that way. It's not just Betty who doesn't want Banner around -- it's also the government, which has been searching for him since he unleashed his super-powered alter ego in 2003's The Hulk.
This time they send in Tim Roth (Lie to Me) as Emil Blonsky, an aging soldier with a grudge against Banner for getting away. Tyler said that her character was more emotionally mature this time around -- but she also had the same problem.
"I would say Betty's emotions are at 50 percent," joked Tyler, who has a son (Milan) with rocker David Gardner and is pregnant with her second child by another rocker, Royston Langdon. "The other half of me was like 'I don't know what I can give you,' because my emotions are running so crazy right now."
But Tyler said she'll be able to relate when her baby is born and the little guy gives her some trouble at night.
"It's going to be like a second Bruce Banner," said Tyler, who was eight months pregnant on the set. "My husband will come into the room in the middle of the night with these giant pillows over his face."
