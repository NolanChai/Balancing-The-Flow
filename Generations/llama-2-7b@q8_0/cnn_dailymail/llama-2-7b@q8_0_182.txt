Jen Psaki thought the offer to be President Barack Obama's communications director wouldn't last long.
She figured White House chief of staff Denis McDonough hadn't heard she's expecting a baby girl in April — or that her husband is moving across the country for a new job at Google.
"I wasn't sure if I had mentioned it," said Psaki, who will leave the Obama administration on Jan. 3 to start her own communications consulting firm. "If Denis hadn't heard about the baby yet, he would hear about it soon."
But when she accepted McDonough's offer to become the White House's first female communications director last weekend, she decided to say yes anyway — and not let her personal life get in the way.
"I think my reaction was: 'This isn't going to end well,' " Psaki said Thursday morning in a phone interview with The Huffington Post from Washington. "And I said it aloud."
She spoke out loud about many things throughout her long career as an Obama adviser, often with a sense of humor and an ability to spin bad news into something more palatable for the public. Psaki's appointment as communications director is sure to be welcomed by reporters who have gotten to know her over the past eight years as she fielded countless questions in the White House press briefing room, where she made history last year when she became the first female West Wing press secretary.
In many ways, Psaki has become known for how quickly she is able to respond with a quip or joke that lightens up an otherwise tense moment. Her ability to find humor in even the worst of situations — something she says was passed down from her Italian-American grandmother — made her particularly well suited to work at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., where things often don't turn out as planned, and sometimes fall apart completely.
When asked if that lighthearted quality is a strength or weakness, Psaki responds without missing a beat: "I think it's probably my only one."
"Jen has been the glue that held together an organization that had to deal with a lot of crazy things," said Ben LaBolt, former press secretary for President Barack Obama.
Psaki joined the administration in 2007 as deputy communications director when Obama was a freshly elected senator from Illinois who was transitioning into a presidential campaign. She served as the top spokesperson on that race and then for the president's re-election bid — helping him win his first term before he took office in 2009 and then returning to his campaign team in 2012 to work on Obama's historic re-election.
In many ways, she was there at the beginning of it all, standing side by side with her boss as they navigated a series of crises, including the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. She also helped Obama navigate his most famous fumble — when he referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as "former" during a March 2014 news conference with then-British Prime Minister David Cameron at the NATO summit in Wales.
A few months later, Psaki was appointed White House communications director, replacing Jennifer Palmieri (who is now Hillary Clinton's campaign communications director). She was a top contender for that post back when she joined Obama's 2012 re-election team and would have been the first female chief spokesperson in the White House. But her pregnancy at the time made it impossible to travel with the president around the country, and Psaki instead decided to take a role overseeing communications for that campaign's 50-state strategy.
In many ways, Psaki said she doesn't feel like much has changed in Washington since then — including how the press and the public view the White House. "I think we live in an era when everything is so polarized, so I don’t know if we’re as far along as people want to give us credit for," Psaki said.
She's also not surprised by the political landscape she's leaving behind after serving Obama for eight years — a time marked by intense partisanship and gridlock in Washington.
"I think that there is a deep divide in our country, but I don’t think it was any different when we came to office than what it is today," Psaki said. "If anything, the political process has been more challenging than ever before."
Psaki is already thinking about how to advise her new clients at the communications firm she'll be launching next year, and hopes to eventually work on both sides of the political aisle. But for now, Psaki said she wants to enjoy every second with her family — and especially that little girl who will join them in April.
"It’s the best job I could ever have," she said. "I think it would be a lie if I wasn’t a mom saying that, but really, it’s not something that people talk about a lot."
