, is accused of stabbing his wife Carmela to death in her home, reports NBC News.
Anthony and Carmella Novellino were married for more than 30 years before the couple divorced five years ago. Police found Novellino holding his ex-wife’s hand while he was wearing a pig mask and holding a large kitchen knife after the attack, according to reports by NBC News and The New York Times.
Prosecutors say that Novellino attacked Carmella in her home on Friday with two knives and then left. After Novellino fled, the police found him on Sunday hiding underneath his ex-wife’s bed. Novellino was charged with murder but is currently being held without bail at Passaic County Jail.
Police say that Anthony Novellino admitted to stabbing his ex-wife and leaving her in the house after killing her. The ex-husband told police he could not remember the events leading up to the alleged murder, NBC News reported. Prosecutors say they do not have a motive for the crime yet but think Novellino may have killed Carmella because she wanted an annulment of their marriage.
Prosecutors also claim that there were signs of an ongoing dispute between the couple before Carmella was murdered, according to reports by NBC News and The New York Times. Prosecutors say they are reviewing police evidence and statements from witnesses to determine Novellino’s motive for the alleged crime.
Police found a note in Carmela’s home that said, “Don’t forget my handkerchief,” which prosecutors believe was part of an argument between the couple before her murder, according to NBC News. A friend who saw Novellino after his wife was killed said he appeared calm when he left the crime scene and drove away from Carmella’s house on Friday night, reports The New York Times.
Prosecutors are still determining whether or not Anthony Novellino will be charged with murder in addition to manslaughter charges. A judge ordered that an autopsy be performed on Carmela Novellino’s body before a hearing on Wednesday morning, reports NBC News.
