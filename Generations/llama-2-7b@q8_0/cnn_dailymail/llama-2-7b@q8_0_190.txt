uled off with a massive £24,000 takings.
Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam, 36, died when he fell from the back of a van after jumping in to chase the robbers.
The shop owner, of Colindale in north London, had been on his way home at around 4pm when five masked men burst into his store and began stuffing money into holdalls.
He tried to stop them but was knocked unconscious with a crowbar before falling from the back of the vehicle.
The gang then fled in two getaway cars, one of which was later found abandoned just 10 minutes away on nearby Cricklewood Broadway after the pursuing police managed to track them down.
Detectives arrested six men and are hunting for a seventh suspect – believed to be their leader – as they investigate the murder investigation.
The arrests include a 35-year-old man from Hounslow, West London, who was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery.
All six were bailed pending further inquiries.
Detectives said there was no indication the robbers knew Mr Arulchelvam would be working alone or that they had planned to kill anyone – but stressed they are continuing to investigate if there is a link with his death.
Police revealed yesterday that Mr Arulchelvam was on his way home when the armed thieves struck, stealing £23,960 in cash from the tills and £40 in change before making their getaway.
Detective Sergeant Timothy Moffat said: ‘This was an horrific robbery where a shopkeeper was killed after he tried to stop the robbers.
‘The suspects were violent, carrying crowbars and had no concern for Nick’s safety or the safety of his business.
‘There is nothing to suggest they intended him any harm, but we are not taking this incident lightly.’ Mr Arulchelvam had worked at the shop since it was opened seven years ago.
