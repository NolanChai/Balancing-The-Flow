Kick back, relax and put those feet up because September is the least stressful month of the year. That is the word from researchers who warn Brits to make the most of their downtime as the stresses of day-to-day life – such as deadlines at work, tax bills or looking after a family – will soon be back on the agenda.
It was revealed that September had been deemed the ‘laziest’ month due to people having more time off from school and work. This then frees up space in our diaries for other activities such as going on holiday, going shopping or simply relaxing at home.
In comparison, December has been named Britain’s busiest month with a high stress factor of 140% due to people being busy working to hit deadlines before Christmas.
The study was commissioned by TUI Vacations and is based on the number of searches conducted for holidays over the last twelve months, which equates to around eight million holiday bookings each month.
Researchers analysed the search data to determine when people are most likely to search for their next getaway, with September being the busiest time.
They found that June is also a popular month to book holidays due to school holidays, as is July which sees more searches than any other month thanks to the summer weather.
The researchers then analysed the average cost of flights and accommodation during this period to determine when Brits should take their next trip based on affordability.
According to the study, September offers the best value for money with average flight costs dropping by 14% and hotel rates falling by an incredible 30%. It was also found that August is a particularly good time for families looking to save as it is during this month that hotels are offering the largest discounts.
In contrast, June was named the most expensive time of year to book flights due to it being peak season with airlines charging more per flight seat in order to make up for lost revenue over winter months.
Accommodation rates during this period were also high due to hotels and other tourist attractions looking to make as much money from summer visitors.
A spokesperson for TUI, which commissioned the study, said: ‘Whether it’s hitting the beach or jetting off on a city break, September offers some of the best value holiday deals around right now.’
