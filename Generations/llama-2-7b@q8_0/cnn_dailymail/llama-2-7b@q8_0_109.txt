The high court gave state prison authorities until December 26 to come up with solutions that could include releasing thousands of inmates early or moving them into less expensive jails and prisons.
"California officials will not be taking any rash actions," Attorney General Jerry Brown said Tuesday afternoon, explaining why the state won't move immediately to release tens of thousands of convicts. "We are going to develop a plan that we believe is realistic in its implementation, but it will also give us breathing room."
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he welcomes the high court order and hopes it will bring some relief to an overcrowded prison system plagued by violence.
"We have a responsibility to keep dangerous criminals off California's streets, but we also have to do so in a way that is both safe for our communities and fiscally responsible," the governor said in a statement. "I look forward to working with Attorney General Jerry Brown to develop a plan that accomplishes those goals."
The state had until September 27 under an order from the U.S. District Court for California's Eastern Division, but officials asked the Supreme Court on Monday to extend it while they developed alternatives to prison overcrowding, which has been an issue since the 1980s.
"We are in agreement that a plan should be put forth that is going to move California toward compliance with the order," Brown said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon after he met with Schwarzenegger's office and state corrections officials. "There will be a timeline, and it will give us time for implementation."
The high court's decision followed an earlier ruling by the federal appeals court that upheld a 2008 settlement requiring California to reduce its prison population by about 46,000 inmates. The settlement is tied to a lawsuit brought by three prisoners who claimed prison conditions were unconstitutional and violated their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.
The appeals court said the state needed to cut its prison population by 37,200 within two years to comply with federal constitutional requirements. The appeals panel gave the state until August to do so but then extended that deadline in response to requests from the corrections department and Schwarzenegger's office.
"The court is not going to be rushed into issuing a decision," said U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, who has presided over the case for more than 15 years. "There will be an opportunity for public comment on our plan." He called the high court's order "a big step in the right direction" because it will allow California to submit its proposal and seek feedback from the judges and the state Legislature.
Corrections Department spokesman Luis Patino said his office is pleased with the high court's decision. The department has been trying to reduce overcrowding by releasing inmates early who are nearing the end of their sentences but whose paroles have been delayed because there aren't enough prison beds for them, he said.
"We are working around the clock with the attorney general and his office, as well as state legislators," Patino said. "We think we have a good plan, and it will be submitted to the court in two weeks." He added that officials may need to find more beds for parolees so they can leave prison when their sentences are up.
Patino did not immediately comment on whether the department plans to seek emergency federal funding to expand its capacity as state legislators consider a proposal to do just that, which was introduced Monday in both houses of the Legislature.
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said Tuesday that the governor's office is working on proposals for lawmakers to consider that would include prison reform measures. But he added that any plans would have to pass muster with the judiciary. "We believe it is essential that any legislation move forward in a way that makes sure our courts are satisfied," McLear said.
In August, Schwarzenegger's office said it could not come up with enough beds in existing prison facilities to house the 37,000 inmates ordered by the appeals court within two years. As of May 2009, California had 165,498 state prisoners -- nearly twice the capacity of its prisons and jails, which can hold 90,000 people.
The federal lawsuit was filed in 1990 on behalf of three men who said their constitutional rights were violated because they were held in long-term isolation or kept from going outside to sunbathe for more than two hours each day. The lawsuit also claimed that overcrowding has resulted in violence, a shortage of medical and mental health care and inadequate educational programs.
In 2005, the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of the prisoners, saying their constitutional rights had been violated because they were kept isolated from other inmates for extended periods.
