Bassett recalls being told by Perry that he needed to go on a short trip -- and not bring his phone with him. A few hours later, he was detained at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport after TSA officials discovered 75 bullets in his luggage. He'd forgotten they were there from an earlier hunting trip.
"I was completely surprised," Bassett said of the incident. "I don't know whether I was more embarrassed or humiliated, because when you get to that age, it is pretty clear to me that I am not 25 and going on a bachelor party."
That TSA episode became a flashpoint for Perry as he sought re-election in 2010. The Texas governor was running against a relatively unknown Democrat named Bill White -- and his campaign team had long seen an opportunity to paint the governor as "tone deaf" when it came to everyday Texans.
The bullets were, for many voters, a tipping point in that race. White's supporters said Perry seemed out of touch with average citizens. Perry's backers, meanwhile, claimed it was an overblown episode and pointed to the fact he had forgotten the weapons were even there as evidence.
The episode -- along with others, including his remarks about secession from the United States and calling for a return to "biblical" principles in government -- helped make Perry one of the most controversial governors in Texas history. But that didn't prevent him from winning a third full term in 2010 or running for president two years later, despite having never won an election outside of his home state and consistently finishing in the lower tier of polls.
In Texas, Perry's brand has remained strong -- so much so that he is now considered the favorite to win the GOP primary. As of Friday night, Perry was running 18 percentage points ahead of Sen. Ted Cruz in a Quinnipiac University poll of Texas Republicans, and another 7 points ahead among those who plan to vote in early voting.
Though Perry has never been a great fundraiser, he is now sitting on an impressive war chest. He raised more than $10 million since January, according to his campaign. And when the primary season kicked off earlier this month, it was Perry -- not Trump or Carson -- who led among Republican voters in Iowa.
That's why national Democrats are now worried about what a Perry candidacy would mean for them. They say he could become their "wild card" -- someone who is more likely to make a serious bid than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said in an interview that Perry's candidacy would force Democrats to "wake up" and realize the primary race will not be a cakewalk for Hillary Clinton, as some pundits have suggested. And it could also help determine whether the Republican nominee is a true outsider who can win over voters across the country -- or whether it'll be another establishment favorite like Romney in 2012.
"If Perry gets in there and wins Iowa, and maybe New Hampshire, I think you have a different race than people are talking about," said Rosenberg, president of the nonprofit New Democratic Network. "I don't see how he doesn't go all the way."
In an interview this week on Fox News, Perry described himself as the underdog in the race for the GOP nomination. But others in his party say that label is not accurate. They point to the fact that he has already raised more money than Carson and Trump -- despite being largely silent for nearly a year -- and had 16% support among Texas Republicans who planned to vote early as of mid-September, according to Quinnipiac University.
"He's not a wild card," said Dave Wilson, chairman of the Travis County Republican Party in Austin. "In terms of fundraising he's leading everybody."
Perry has always been a polarizing figure among voters. While his supporters call him a strong leader and credit him with Texas' economic turnaround -- when it comes to fiscal responsibility, for example -- opponents say he is out of touch with average Texans.
In an interview this week on Fox News, Perry said he was worried that the race could be too negative. "I think we've got a great country and we can do better than what we're doing right now," he said. But some Republicans say he is not immune to the same forces as everyone else running for president -- including Trump, who has gone after Perry on everything from his job creation record in Texas to his "mishandling" of the HPV vaccine.
The Texas governor was among the first candidates to go after Trump when he announced last month that he would be running for president. And even as some pundits have speculated about whether Perry will actually get into the race, he has continued to blast him -- especially on social media, where he frequently takes aim at Trump's policies and his own rivals.
Perry, for example, has consistently criticized Trump for making disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants. "Mexico isn't sending you their best people. They are not bringing in the best of Mexico. If we have 14 million illegal immigrants in this country, it is because our government has allowed that to happen," he tweeted Tuesday.
In an interview on CNN's "The Lead" Monday night, Perry said his strategy would be to keep hammering away at Trump until the business mogul backs down from the race or fades away -- or both. And some Republicans believe he will be successful if he stays consistent with that message.
"He is a good enough politician that I don't think he's going to fall prey to whatever the Trump phenomenon turns out to be," said Republican consultant Curt Andersson of Austin, Texas. "I think he has a better chance than most at really keeping Donald Trump on the ropes."
But others are skeptical Perry will stick it through for much longer -- or that he can actually beat Trump if they end up squaring off in Iowa or elsewhere.
"I don't know how many rounds he is going to go with Trump," said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican consultant who has known the governor since 2003 when he worked for the state party. "If you want to run against Donald Trump, you can only do it by calling him out on his BS.
"I don't know how many rounds of that you have," he added.
