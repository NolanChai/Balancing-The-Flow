23-year-old nephew, who fled Ethiopia’s brutal regime in search of a better life in Europe, did not survive his dangerous journey over the Mediterranean Sea. Like thousands of others, he drowned trying to cross into Italy from Libya. My family has suffered tremendously as a result of my nephew’s death and countless other Ethiopians have lost loved ones and experienced similar tragedies.
My experience in Europe is not unique among young Africans who are seeking better lives for themselves, their families or friends. And, while I am now a refugee in Finland, I know that many of my fellow migrants feel like they are treated as criminals rather than people who have rights and should be given protection from persecution, torture and death.
For example, one man who shared his story with me was an Ethiopian citizen named Amir Aman, a well-known singer who performed at the 2015 World Cup in Brazil. He said he fled after being arrested for criticizing the government. When his music career started taking off, he decided to stay in Dubai and perform there instead of returning home to Ethiopia because he feared retribution by the government against him or his family if he were to go back.
So Amir flew from Dubai to Turkey, where he hoped to reach Europe. But on the way to Greece, he was detained by Turkish police and spent five months in prison before being released on bail. He had a difficult time finding work as an artist in Turkey because his passport didn’t allow him to perform professionally. After some failed attempts at making it into Europe — including a journey on a wooden boat across the Mediterranean Sea that almost ended in drowning — Amir decided he needed to stay in Turkey, where he had family and friends.
“I can no longer put my life at risk,” Amir said. “It’s not safe for me in Africa. I need Europe.”
But there is still so much confusion about what kind of protection the EU should offer refugees like him.
The European Union has long struggled to agree on how to deal with its own migrant crisis, which peaked in 2015. Since then, asylum-seekers and refugees have been stuck in limbo while they await a decision on their applications for international protection. This is because the EU’s Dublin Regulation — the legal basis of its asylum system — does not allow those seeking safety to travel within Europe or settle elsewhere in the bloc. The Dublin Regulation says that “the member state responsible” for an application must process it, but it doesn’t define what that means exactly.
That means asylum-seekers and refugees have had no choice but to live in countries they first arrived in. They are stuck on the margins of society, living with little support or assistance from their host country while they wait months — sometimes years — for a decision about whether they will be allowed to stay. Many find themselves trapped in legal limbo, unable to move onward without an official determination that their application has been rejected or accepted.
As a result of the EU’s failures in dealing with its migrant crisis over the past few years, many refugees have lost faith in Europe and its institutions as protectors of human rights, dignity and freedom — values we all hold dear.
The problem is so severe that the UN refugee agency warned in 2019 that 34 million people are now fleeing their homelands, with more than half being forced to move by conflicts. That means that nearly a third of the world’s population has been displaced — and many of them face an uncertain future as they wait for permission to apply for protection in Europe or elsewhere.
That is why it was so important last year when Germany announced plans to abolish some barriers to mobility within Europe, allowing people to move freely across borders without fear of being deported back home if their asylum application were rejected. It’s also encouraging that Italy recently took steps toward implementing a similar plan, which would allow refugees and migrants who are in the country illegally to be granted temporary protection while they apply for international protection elsewhere within Europe instead of being forced to return home.
But these plans don’t go far enough. What we really need is an effective solution that allows people fleeing persecution, conflict or war to find safety in a different EU country where their lives and wellbeing can be guaranteed without having to risk making the dangerous crossing over the Mediterranean Sea from Africa — something my nephew tragically had no choice but to do.

It’s clear that the current system of allowing people who arrive on Europe’s shores by boat or cross into Europe via land routes through Turkey and Greece is broken and needs fixing as soon as possible, before more lives are lost in an attempt to reach a better life elsewhere within Europe. The EU has already spent billions trying to stop migrants from crossing over from Africa; it now must invest in a program that offers meaningful protection for those who do make this dangerous journey while ensuring their human rights remain protected along the way so they have a chance at finding safety here too — not just economic stability.
That’s why I joined Amnesty International earlier this year to call on the EU to reform its migration system, which is currently failing migrants and refugees alike by putting their lives at risk in order to meet political objectives. We urged European leaders to implement a human rights-based approach that will protect everyone who seeks safety in Europe without resorting to unlawful pushbacks or forcibly returning people back home under the pretext of nonrefoulement — a principle that forbids governments from sending people back into danger.
The EU’s response so far has been mixed. It did agree on new rules last year that aim to make it easier for people who are granted international protection in one EU member state to move freely throughout the bloc without having their rights restricted or revoked simply because they arrive in another country first before applying elsewhere within Europe. But these rules don’t go far enough; they don’t allow people who have been living illegally in another EU country for years without applying for asylum there — like my nephew was forced to do after he fled Ethiopia — from being deported back home again simply because they arrived first elsewhere within Europe before applying elsewhere within the bloc instead of going through regular channels by making an official application directly at their port-of-entry country upon arrival instead.
It’s also encouraging that Italy recently took steps toward implementing a similar plan, which would allow refugees and migrants who are in the country illegally to be granted temporary protection while they apply for international protection elsewhere within Europe instead of being forced to return home. But these plans don’t go far enough; they still require people who arrive first before applying elsewhere within Europe from being deported back home again simply because they arrived there first before making an official application directly at their port-of-entry country upon arrival instead.
The EU’s response so far has been mixed — but we believe it is important that the bloc takes action to ensure everyone who seeks protection in Europe can do so without fear of being sent back home under the pretext of nonrefoulement or unlawful pushbacks. Only then will refugees and migrants feel like they are treated as people, not criminals — and only then can we truly say that our EU is a safe place for everyone seeking safety here too.
