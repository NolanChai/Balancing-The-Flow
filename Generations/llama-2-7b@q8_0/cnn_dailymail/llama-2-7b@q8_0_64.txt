pered and fed through a tube, his tiny body is now bloated with waste.
The baby is one of five children born addicted to heroin in the past year at this hospital near Seattle. His parents are struggling with their own demons - including poverty and depression - and can't take care of him on their own. In the hospital, he spends his time being treated for withdrawal symptoms that include tremors, fevers, vomiting and diarrhea.
His parents hope that eventually they will get to be with him again, but it may never happen. At a recent visit, the baby's father, John Doe, said he wasn't sure what would become of his son or if they could ever leave the hospital together as a family.
"I can only say right now I want to make sure my kids are taken care of," John Doe said through tears. "And that's all I've got."
