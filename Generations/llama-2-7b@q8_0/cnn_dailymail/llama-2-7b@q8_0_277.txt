iley, 14, suffered multiple injuries when she was hit by the car as she crossed the road near the entrance of her school in Essex last May. The driver – who cannot be named for legal reasons – had smoked cannabis and taken cocaine before he drove away from an off-licence at 3am that morning, Basildon Crown Court was told. He admitted causing death by careless driving but was cleared of manslaughter after a jury heard Liberty had ‘run across the road in an unsafe manner.’
Yesterday Liberty’s mother Donna Bailey told the court how she was left distraught over her daughter’s death and had suicidal thoughts. She said: ‘I thought, “What is it going to be? Am I going to kill myself?”‘ Ms Bailey said the pain was so great that she contemplated suicide at the exact spot where Liberty died, near her home in Stanford-le-Hope. But she decided not to because she had a son and stepchildren who were looking after their grandmother while Ms Bailey was at work as a cleaner.
Ms Bailey said: ‘I just wanted to see my children, I didn’t want them to grow up without a mother.’ The mother-of-three added that Liberty’s death had made her feel suicidal and she had contemplated taking her own life because she could not bear the pain. She told of how she was diagnosed as bipolar in 2016 after struggling with depression for several years.
She said: ‘I have always been a really positive person but this has changed me… I have suffered from severe anxiety, stress and panic attacks since Liberty’s death.’
Ms Bailey added that she was trying to cope by going out with friends as well as visiting the memorial site of her daughter.
The mother said: ‘It helps me to go to the place where my daughter died but it is difficult, there are a lot of emotions. I feel sad all of the time and sometimes it’s very difficult for me.’
Ms Bailey said she felt like her life was at an end because she would never see Liberty again. She added: ‘I don’t want to live anymore but if I killed myself, I know that would make my children feel worse and I couldn’t do that.’
The 49-year-old also revealed how Liberty had been worried about her own mental health and had taken cocaine on the day she died. She said: ‘I have read she was taking it for a period of time, but I don’t know if this is true or not.’ The court heard Liberty had suffered from self harming for several years, including cutting herself. Ms Bailey added that her daughter had been treated by mental health services since 2016 and had been prescribed anti-depressants and sleep medication to help her cope with her ‘torture’ after being bullied at school.
