Thiriez was attending a Ligue 1 meeting in Paris when his counterpart from AS Monaco, Jean-Pierre Bergeron, came onto the Bastia pitch to celebrate with players after the club beat the Stade Rennais (1-0) for their first ever Coupe de la Ligue title.
Bastia were fined €5,000 for ignoring an instruction from officials and coming onto the pitch after the final whistle in Paris, a punishment that Bastia president Geronimi has described as "a disproportionate penalty".
"The LFP needs to change. This is not football," said Geronimi on Tuesday at a press conference ahead of Thursday's Coupe de la Ligue semi-final first leg between Ajaccio and Lyon, in which Bastia are the visitors.
"Frederic Thiriez should resign. I feel ashamed to be part of French football," he added.
Meanwhile, Bergeron is set to step down as president of Monaco after 19 years at the helm and will be replaced by vice-president Stéphane Bianchi.
