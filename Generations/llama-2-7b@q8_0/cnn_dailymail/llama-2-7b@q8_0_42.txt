Co-host Sherri Shepherd, a mother of two, immediately disagreed with her fellow panelist, saying that she'd never allow anyone to spank her child because of the potential for injury, especially when there were other ways to discipline kids.
"I think we agree on this," said Goldberg, who has never had children of her own. "Spanking can be effective."
She later explained what she meant:
"I've been spanked plenty of times and I didn't dieâ€¦You know sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't work. And you have to teach your kids that when they do something wrong, there is a consequence for their actions. When you do the right thing, then there are rewards for doing the right thing."
The co-hosts then got into an argument about what constitutes child abuse and if spanking should be considered inappropriate behavior or not. Goldberg remained adamant that it's a form of punishment, but Shepherd said it wasn't effective because "it doesn't teach your kid to make better decisions."
She also called spanking "barbaric" and noted that the kids who do it are often children with behavioral issues.
The View's newest addition, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, didn't have much to say on the topic because she doesn't believe in spanking either (she used to be against it). Co-host Joy Behar, however, admitted that her own mother had been known to beat her and her sister when they were children.
"It was done with love," she said, noting that it only happened once a year around the holidays because her parents wanted to make sure their kids wouldn't get into trouble.
