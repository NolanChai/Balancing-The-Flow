, central defender, full-back and striker before next season and is concerned by their lack of activity so far this month.
Henry signed for Barca from Arsenal for £24million back in 2007 after 13 years at the Emirates Stadium and is still adored by many fans, with his 3-year reign as captain often being regarded as the pinnacle of modern Arsenal success. However, it has been suggested that the Frenchman's spell in London was marred by too many mistakes and he also struggled to win over Arsene Wenger.
Henry's comments will not be welcomed at board level but could give fans something to get excited about as they look towards the future. With Arsenal having only one player (Lukas Podolski) sign a new long-term deal in recent years, it is clear that there needs to be a big turnaround if Wenger is going to remain at the club after his contract expires next year.
The 36-year-old also believes the Gunners could struggle to qualify for European football in the future and wants four major signings made this summer so as not to leave things too late for the Frenchman. However, there may be one stumbling block in Wenger signing any players this year - Arsenal are already around £20m over the wage structure, which has been set at £85k a week for their top earners.
The club's hierarchy will need to make some big decisions during the next few months if they want to keep Wenger and build on his 17-year legacy in London.
