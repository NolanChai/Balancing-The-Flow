an Army officer James Foley was murdered on August 19 after the US government made him an offer which would have allowed him to be exchanged for Guantanamo Bay prisoner Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden.
Foley’s mother Diane, who has since been abducted, was forced to listen to her son being decapitated in a video released online by the Islamic State terrorist organisation (IS). As well as pleas for help from his captors, Foley made an emotional statement telling President Barack Obama to ‘bring back our boys’.
Speaking today, Diane said she would be too distraught if her son were still alive. She said: ‘I can’t imagine him as a prisoner. I don’t know how long he was held or where he was but it was brutal. He was kept in isolation. They told me they took him out for a walk and shot him twice, once in the leg and then the back of his neck.’ She said she thought her son had been beheaded by IS, describing the video as ‘horrific’.
Speaking to The Independent from an undisclosed location, she said: ‘The first thing I noticed was the yellow jumpsuit, which James wore when he was taken in Syria. I could hear the sound of his voice but it wasn’t like before. He sounded so nervous and that is not my son. This man is so desperate for us to bring back our boys.’ She said she had no doubt her son was dead, adding: ‘It just seemed too cruel if he was still alive. I can’t imagine how horrible it would be if he were still alive because of the torture he must have been put through.
‘I hope that my husband is also dead so that he doesn’t have to suffer any more,’ she said, adding: ‘It has been a nightmare since I heard the news about James and John.’ She said that she had hoped her husband was still alive as he is suffering from Alzheimer’s but added: ‘If that is what has happened then I am just grateful that it is over for him. He didn’t deserve to suffer any longer than he already has done.’
Diane said her son James was a devoted Christian, who prayed daily and never cursed or swore in his life. She added: ‘He used to say “God is great” before every prayer but I don’t know if that’s true anymore because I believe God was not with him when he died.’ Diane said her son had been a kind and considerate person, adding: ‘There were people who were suffering around the world but James wanted to help those who needed his skills as a journalist.
‘I used to worry about my other children too much but I could not stop thinking about what was happening to James. He was so kind that I hope God will forgive him because of it.’ She added: ‘My only hope is that he’s dead, then at least his suffering has come to an end. If we found out that he was still alive we would be more distraught than if he were dead. It wouldn’t help my son or me at all, except that maybe it might ease the suffering.’
Her husband John told The Independent: ‘My wife and I are in shock. We had been trying to cope with our son being gone since September but we just couldn’t take this. We have suffered enough now so God can finally let us be together again.’ John said he was sure his son had been beheaded, adding: ‘It is what we expected all along because they are such evil people and I don’t think they would leave him alive.
‘I don’t know how many times James was tortured before they killed him but my wife thinks it was probably about a week or so ago.’ He said he had been told by US officials that his son ‘was taken out of prison in Aleppo and executed by beheading on August 19’. The elder Mr Foley added: ‘I can’t believe they got to him after everything we have done for them and still we get no help. It is a nightmare.’
Foley, who was captured while working as an independent journalist in Syria, became the first US citizen killed by IS when he was beheaded last week. His execution video released yesterday shows the 40-year-old father of three speaking directly to camera and appealing to Obama to ‘bring back our boys’ – a reference to fellow Americans Steven Sotloff, 31, and Peter Kassig, 26.
In his appeal Foley said: ‘I guess it will be seen as confirmation that I am being held by the Islamic State.’ He added: ‘I’d like people to know that my family is doing okay and we are coping with this terrible situation.’ Speaking after the video was released, US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel said Washington had made an unprecedented offer to IS.
He said: ‘There was an opportunity for us to get James Foley back and a large number of other hostages held by ISIL [IS]. But ISIL refused that offer. Now, we don’t make offers like that unless we have confidence they can be carried out.’ A US official said the plan called for US-backed Iraqi forces to release dozens of prisoners held by Iraq and IS would then hand over the hostages.
He added: ‘It was a very specific offer and it wasn’t rejected because the US didn’t think that the conditions were appropriate.’ The Obama administration has been criticised for failing to secure Foley’s release despite warnings from former intelligence officials, who said he was in danger as early as last November.
In an interview with The Independent on Monday, retired US Army Lieutenant General Michael T Flynn – who ran the Defence Intelligence Agency and is a senior member of America’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) – said he had warned officials in Washington that IS posed ‘an existential threat to us’.
He added: ‘It is now clear we should have acted more decisively against Isis when we had the chance, and now they are on the march again.’ The US is understood to be planning a military campaign involving air strikes to slow down IS militants who have seized control of large areas in northern and western Iraq since June.
The Obama administration has faced mounting pressure from Republicans as well as some Democrats to take more aggressive action against the terrorist group. Foley, 40, was working for the Boston-based news agency Agence France-Presse when he disappeared in northern Syria in November 2012 while covering the civil war there.
His wife Diane said: ‘It’s been hard being apart from him but I knew he was doing what he loved and helping people who needed it.’ She added: ‘We’ve never had an argument over anything and we are just hoping that his death will be quick and painless.’
Her husband John added: ‘My son is a real hero. We always said James would do anything to help others. He didn’t think about himself or even his own safety at all – he was such a good man.’ The elder Mr Foley said his son had worked for the Boston-based news agency Agence France-Presse for three years after he left his job as a reporter for the Boston Globe.
He added: ‘James was a very spiritual person and would pray every day before each of his meals. He never swore, even when he was angry.’ James had been working in war zones since 2008, travelling to Iraq to cover the 2011 revolutions that swept across the Middle East as well as Afghanistan, Somalia and Libya.
He went missing after being taken by a group of militants near Idlib – a town at the edge of Syria’s northern border with Turkey – while he was on his way to meet an AFP colleague who had been detained in Raqqa, IS’s stronghold in northeastern Syria. Foley’s last communication with his family and friends was an e-mail sent from Turkey shortly before he crossed the border into Syria where he was arrested.
He is thought to have been held by militants until July 2013, when a video showed him looking thin but apparently healthy. The first of several videos that IS posted online last month featured another captive – American journalist Steven Sotloff, who had also worked for AFP. The group warned that Foley and other hostages would be killed unless Washington halted its air strikes against IS militants in Iraq.
Another video released on 3 September showed Foley’s fellow captive Peter Kassig, a US former soldier who converted to Islam after being deployed to Afghanistan in the army’s medical corps. Foley had been reported to have been taken hostage with British journalist John Cantlie and Dutch photojournalist Jeroen Oerlemans on 23 November 2012.
Cantlie, a former Royal Marines commando who covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya for Channel 4 News, was kidnapped while filming in Aleppo but was released after eight months in
