Martinez signed a five-year deal when he joined from Wigan in June and was quizzed at his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday’s trip to Southampton on whether there was any chance Alcaraz, who is out of contract next summer, would be offered an extension.
Alcaraz has made just seven Premier League appearances this season following a hamstring injury but Martinez insisted the 34-year-old still had a role to play and was looking at ways in which he could help him recover his place in the side.
Martinez said: “We are very aware that Antolin Alcaraz is going through some tough times, not only injury wise but also form wise.
“We’re working with him because we see there’s a lot of talent in what he does and when we speak about him being in the final year of his contract it doesn’t mean at all that he doesn’t have a place in our future, we are very open to that.
Alcaraz is currently out on loan at Championship side Blackburn but Martinez has not ruled out recalling the player if he can prove himself fit and ready for first team action.
He said: “I don't rule anything out, I’m an open-minded person and I love to give people opportunities when they have a chance, but it needs to be earned through your performances."
Alcaraz’s understudy Distin is also out of contract at the end of the season after being linked with a summer move to Swansea.
The 36-year-old has been an ever present in Martinez's side so far this campaign and despite his advancing years, he remains one of the first names on his team sheet.
“Sylvain Distin is playing great, he’s a very important player for us,” said Martinez. “I have to be honest that I haven’t received any interest from him in the last couple of months but obviously we know there are a lot of options out there.
“For me it will not depend on how many offers Sylvain Distin has, because we like his work ethic and he is still giving everything for us.”
