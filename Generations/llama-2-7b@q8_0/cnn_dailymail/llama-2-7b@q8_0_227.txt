14-page petition for the court to order Vergara to turn over all of the stored eggs that she had planned to use and he wants them destroyed. He also asked that the judge rule in his favor without having a hearing.
According to the filing, Loeb’s attorney wrote: ‘Vergara has made clear her intention is not to carry a child from any egg to term, but rather to have those eggs destroyed.’ The court document claims that Vergara had frozen her eggs before she met Loeb in 2014 and that she said at the time that they would be used for medical research.  ‘Vergara never intended on carrying a child with any of these embryos,’ Loeb’s lawyers claim.
