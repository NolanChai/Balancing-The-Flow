­admitted dodging rail fares while commuting into London has been banned from the financial industry.
Burrows had been accused of trying to avoid paying full price for his tickets on Southern Rail by using a discounted pass which covered only a small part of his journey.
But Burrows, who lives in Hastings and works as an independent advisor, was spared a criminal record when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) offered him a chance to repay the full amount he dodged.
Burrows used a pass which covered only part of his journey, but did not realise that he had breached the rules, according to prosecutors.
The CPS said he was "highly remorseful and fully co-operated with us", adding: "He has paid back all the money he gained through ticket fraud and his employer is aware of this."
But Burrows’s work in the financial industry is over, a spokeswoman for City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.
She added: “Jonathan Burrows has been banned from working in the financial services sector as he admitted dishonesty."
Burrows’s admission comes amid concern that Southern Rail passengers are being "ticket-checked" at random – or on a targeted basis based on their travel habits.
The Department for Transport (DfT) has launched an inquiry into the rail operator's conduct, and is considering taking legal action over its allegedly discriminatory approach to ticket inspections.
