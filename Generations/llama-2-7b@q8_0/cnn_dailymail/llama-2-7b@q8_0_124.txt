 broke out after one man complained about the food and demanded his money back.
Colombian television reporter Juan Manuel Arenas was dining at a restaurant in Recife when the scuffle occurred with the footballer Luis Carlos Ruiz allegedly throwing plates onto the floor as he demanded his money back.
The video has gone viral after being filmed by fellow diners, and has seen some Brazilians question why Colombians are allowed into Brazil for the World Cup without visas.
"I’m surprised they were even let in to eat at a restaurant," said one tweeter on Twitter. "Wonder what would have happened if it was just Brazilians."
The match between Colombia and Brazil is set to be watched by some 50 million people, with the host nation expected to win easily as they have an impressive record against their neighbours from the north.
Brazil beat Colombia in every game during qualifying for the tournament, including a 4-1 victory over them in March, when Neymar scored twice and Oscar got a goal too. It was the first time that Brazil had beaten Colombia away from home since they beat them at their own stadium on World Cup qualification back in 1986, however the result could have been different if there hadn’t have been a late sending off.
In fact, Colombia are unbeaten against Brazil at any tournament for the last five years with one win and three draws. Their previous World Cup meeting was in 2006 when they drew their group match two-two.
