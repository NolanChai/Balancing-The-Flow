The parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital.
Corey Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon more than anything wanted to see his parents Craig and Joanna wed – but sadly it wasn’t to be.
But the couple did not let that put a damper on their day and were joined by loved ones at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where Corey was being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).

The wedding of Craig and Joanna Edwards took place in the intensive care unit at Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital on Friday – where Corey is being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
Health bosses at the hospital held the ceremony to make his wishes come true after they realised that a wedding was something he desperately wanted.
The couple were joined by loved ones on Friday as they exchanged vows in front of Corey’s bedside.
His father, 37-year-old Craig, said: ‘I thought it would be something that might make him smile a little bit.
‘We have got lots of support from the hospital and the staff here are fantastic. The children’s ward is amazing, we can’t fault them.’
Corey was diagnosed with leukaemia in January after doctors found he had 50 per cent more cancer cells in his blood than normal – an amount so high that it put him in intensive care for five days.
Mr Edwards said: ‘It was a very traumatic time, but the staff here have been unbelievable, especially on the children’s ward.’
He added that Corey is ‘not really aware of what’s going on at the moment – he is not very well’ and is being treated with chemotherapy.

In a video made by the hospital, Mr Edwards said: ‘Corey is a very brave boy. He has been going through treatment and we have all seen him deteriorate a lot.’
Mrs Edwards added that Corey was still fighting for life, saying: ‘He is getting weaker but he is still fighting. We don’t know how long it will be until he is over the line or not, so we are just living in the moment and enjoying every second with him while he is here.’
She added that the wedding was something Corey had always wanted to do and would have been ‘really happy with this if it were possible’.

Craig said: ‘We didn’t want to lose sight that there is a reason why he wanted this. We are trying to make it all special for him.’
Corey’s father said they had planned to wait until next year but as his son was becoming iller, the wedding took place on Friday and family members travelled from around the world to be by Corey’s side.
He added: ‘We wanted to do this now because he is so unwell at the minute and we didn’t want to lose sight that there is a reason why he wanted this. We are trying to make it all special for him.’
