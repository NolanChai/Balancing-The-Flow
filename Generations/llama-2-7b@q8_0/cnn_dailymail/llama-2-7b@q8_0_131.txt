He's the unfortunate reality TV star caught trying on a woman’s knickers in a shop.
But as he faces prison, the father-of-two could be forgiven if he feels more than a little hard done by.
His victim was 17-year-old Samantha Faiers, whose mother Billie starred with her on The Only Way Is Essex.
She and her husband Mark, a former cagefighter, wrote to the Old Bailey pleading for leniency for Harry Derbridge.
They said: ‘Harry’s family have suffered enough. We believe he should be given a chance. Please spare him from jail.’
Derbridge was caught red-handed trying on a pair of knickers in lingerie store Ann Summers in Clapham, south London, last January. The 31-year-old father, who had been drinking, tried to pass off the items as his wife’s and admitted shoplifting when confronted by staff.
