Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN's Dana Bash on Tuesday that he had not seen the bill at all. But when asked what would happen if he were to veto it, he said: "I would have no problem with that."
In other words, the governor doesn't know whether or how he will sign a law passed by the legislature and believes his personal views on an issue trump those of the elected representatives in his state.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, on the other hand, said in a Wednesday press conference that his stance had not changed since last weekend when he first expressed support for the Indiana law. In fact, it's been his position all along.
"This is not about discrimination and this is not about hate," Pence said at his press conference on Wednesday. "It’s simply about freedom of religion. It’s about freedom to live out our faith."
But Indiana state Sen. Travis Holdman told CNN's Chris Cuomo that he thinks the law has been misinterpreted and that it actually prohibits discrimination. He said there were "two sides" to the bill, and that it was intended to prevent discrimination in all business transactions -- including those involving private citizens.
In other words, a state senator who voted for the law doesn't understand how it works or what it says. (This is also true of Hutchinson, by the way.)
It's one thing if these politicians don't know about their own laws. It's another to have no idea at all about what their laws do or why they were passed.
Both governors say their states will amend their bills and that they don't reflect their personal views, but there seems to be little consensus among them on how the law should be interpreted. And if these officials are incapable of interpreting even basic provisions, who can?
One thing is certain: A majority of Americans believe that the "religious freedom" bills are discriminatory and unjust -- so it's not as though a majority of Americans agree with their governors.
