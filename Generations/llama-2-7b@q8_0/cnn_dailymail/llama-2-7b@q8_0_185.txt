Over the past 12 years, some 750 billion gallons of water have been stolen from California’s rivers by massive pumps located in the Delta that redirect the state’s freshest water to corporate agriculture and urban development in southern California — even as water levels for salmon and other fish drop perilously low.
And it has all gone on without any public oversight, because of a 2002 ruling by then-Gov. Gray Davis that handed control over the pumps to the Bureau of Reclamation, part of the U.S. Department of Interior.
As a result, thousands of farmers who depend on water from the Delta have been cut off from their supply in favor of supplying Southern California cities, especially Los Angeles, with its own brand of “farm-to-table” foods.
“Farms are closing down and people are having to leave their homes,” said Doug Obegi, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which filed suit against Interior this week on behalf of the San Francisco Baykeeper organization to force an end to the pumping.
“The government needs to be held accountable” for its failure to address the problem, Obegi said in an interview. “The [Bureau of Reclamation] has been operating with a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy for years.”
Even as the agency has quietly pumped and diverted water from Delta rivers that are home to endangered species like salmon and smelt, it has also failed to monitor how much freshwater is being sucked out of the area.
“This lawsuit asks the court to require the federal government to be more transparent about its actions in the Delta,” said Baykeeper’s executive director, Deborah Jansen. “The public needs this information so that it can participate in decisions affecting California’s water future.”
A 2013 survey of pumping by a coalition of environmental groups showed that since 2002, more than twice as much freshwater from the Delta has been diverted to cities and farms in southern California as the amount needed to restore the delta ecosystem. In fact, it concluded, “the entire [Delta] is being sucked dry.”
The study, published by the non-profit Public Policy Institute of California, said: “The region’s ecological and economic future is being sacrificed so that Los Angeles can get its water a few weeks earlier in the summer. That is not good enough.”
But with little public scrutiny or transparency, the pumps are now operating at their highest capacity ever — diverting 7,200 cubic feet of freshwater per second from Delta rivers and streams to be pumped into California’s Central Valley.
In response to a request by Reader Supported News for details on how much water was being pumped, Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Scott Laird said that the bureau “does not provide or track data for quantities of water diverted.”
Instead, he wrote: “The State Water Project (SWP) has a 5-year operating agreement with Reclamation to use water stored in federally-owned reservoirs and conveyed through federal facilities. Under this agreement the SWP is required to meet its contractual obligations with users located throughout California.”
As part of that “agreement,” the bureau, Laird continued, “is only able to provide the amount of water delivered by Reclamation” — not how much was pumped out of the Delta itself.
Laird went on: “We will work with our partner agencies to continue to identify and implement solutions that ensure a reliable water supply for Californians while protecting endangered species.”
He said Reclamation had no immediate comment on whether it would provide any details of pumping to the public, in response to NRDC’s lawsuit.
The Delta is where some 60 percent of California’s freshwater comes from — and the source for most of its water supply, which in turn feeds a third of the nation’s crops each year, including many “farm-to-table” food products.
But in recent years, much of that water has been diverted to provide for southern California, where much of it goes to water lawns and golf courses.
Meanwhile, in the Delta — as well as in rivers like the San Joaquin — salmon populations have collapsed, with most runs being extirpated over the past two decades, and smelt numbers dropping from 12 million fish per year to less than 500,000.
“The Delta is dying,” said Obegi of the NRDC. “And it’s not just wildlife that are disappearing — farmland, too, has been abandoned because there isn’t enough water.”
He added: “These pumps have turned the delta into a massive bathtub for southern California.”
“The problem is that we need to have these pumps for the Delta ecosystem,” he said. But, he continued, “they should be used only when there’s enough water to go around — not just to please the farmers in the Central Valley who want their irrigation canals full.”
The problem, however, is that it takes years for environmental damage to become apparent, Obegi noted. “As a result,” he said, “it may be too late to save some species now.”
But in fact, NRDC’s lawsuit was not about stopping the pumps altogether — but rather to get information on how much freshwater is being stolen from California rivers and streams that are vital for salmon and other fish.
“The public has a right to know what’s going on with water resources in this state,” Obegi said. “This lawsuit will force the Bureau of Reclamation to start monitoring what it does, so that we can know when things get out of hand.”
