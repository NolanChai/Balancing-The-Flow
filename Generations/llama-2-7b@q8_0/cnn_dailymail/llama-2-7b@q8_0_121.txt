-of-the-art, 4K TVs that will have grabbed the attention of every fan who was watching last night's Champions League clash between Chelsea and Barcelona.
The broadcast featured a mix of live action from inside Stamford Bridge (as well as interviews with all the big characters), graphics to illustrate key moments in the game, plus replays and goals courtesy of Sky Sports. But that was only part of what ITV did last night, because it also covered the game in 360 degrees, which allowed viewers to look around them (virtually) and watch the action from all angles on their TV screen.
So how did they do it? Well, I'm no expert, but the best I can describe is that at any given time there were four cameras filming different parts of the stadium. So when a player would run past a goal, for example, you could look round and see him running towards goal from one angle, then you could turn to the right and see what he was doing as he ran past the other goal post. You can see how this works in this video from last year.
ITV said: "Our coverage of Chelsea v Barcelona in 360 is part of an industry trial supported by BT Sport, Sky Sports and UEFA to explore new ways for viewers to access live sport using the latest virtual reality technology."
It's not the first time we've seen this type of thing on TV. Back in November it was used in the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico when the cameraman moved around inside the Bernabeu Stadium (see video here). The same thing is also being used for some tennis matches at the moment.
What ITV has done, though, is take things one step further and incorporate it into their live broadcast, which they said would "offer a truly immersive experience to football fans". It's not a bad effort, but let's be honest - when you compare what ITV have done here with the 4K TV screens being sold by retailers like John Lewis at the moment it does seem a bit of an odd thing to concentrate on.
If you missed out last night (or even if you didn't) there are some highlights over on the ITV site.
I agree, the quality of the 4K is mind blowing. It looks just as good as anything in cinemas at the moment. I have a 65" LG set which does a pretty good job for TV and it was like looking through a window when watching the game on that screen last night. I'd say though, if you're only getting Sky Sports then don't bother buying one of these TVs yet as they cost around Â£2000 at John Lewis!
