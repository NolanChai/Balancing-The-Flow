-reform statements, and frustrated Republicans who say it gives Democrats a boost with voters in an election year.
"I have said that I will take action on my own if Congress refuses to act," Obama told Univision TV network reporters Friday at the White House.
On immigration reform, he added: "What we're not going to do is let this thing become a political football or another issue where politicians are just talking through it and saying things that they don't actually believe because they think it will help them on Election Day."
Obama's decision angered advocates for reform, who say he has repeatedly promised to take action on his own if Congress doesn't act on immigration. But the president said Congress can be a more effective venue for the issue.
"I do think there is still a chance that we could get comprehensive immigration reform done this year," Obama said, "and I would like it to be." He added that he didn't want to lose the opportunity to fix America's immigration system this year because of politics.
While Obama has the power to act on his own by issuing an executive order granting work permits and deportation relief for some undocumented immigrants, the president said it would be better to have Congress pass a comprehensive reform bill that includes a pathway to citizenship and other provisions.
"I'm confident if we can get a bipartisan majority in the Senate and a majority of Republicans in the House who want to get this done, then we should do so," he said. "If they don't want to get it done because they think it would be good politics for them, that's a cynical approach."
Some Latino groups disagree with Obama's decision not to act on his own to enact immigration reform, and the League of United Latin American Citizens said Friday that it was considering legal action if he didn't keep his word.
"It is deeply disappointing that President Barack Obama has backed away from his commitment to take executive action this year to provide relief for millions of undocumented immigrants," said LULAC president Brent Wilkes in a statement Friday, adding that the group will "closely monitor any action by the Administration on the issue."
"If we see no action forthcoming before the midterm elections, then LULAC will have to consider legal options to compel this President to follow through on his campaign promise," he said.
LULAC is also one of a coalition of immigration groups that has threatened to sue Obama if he doesn't take executive action by year end. The group sent the White House a letter Friday stating it would file suit against Obama unless the president acts by year's end.
The group argued that "if President Barack Obama does not act before the end of 2014, and then after the election is over in November," then he will have broken his promise to the Latino community.
"This action will be a clear sign of betrayal to millions of undocumented immigrants who were assured that the President would provide relief for them by the end of 2014 -- an assurance made during the 2012 campaign, reiterated repeatedly after being elected in November 2012 and again at the State of the Union address. If President Obama breaks his promise to the Latino community, it will be a violation of that trust."
But Obama said he believes Congress is still a better venue for immigration reform than executive action.
"If we get legislation out of Congress that is good and comprehensive, then I'll sign it right away," he told reporters Friday. "But if they don't pass legislation to fix our broken system, then what I'm going to do is go ahead and take an executive order."
Obama has pledged to make immigration reform a top priority of his administration but the issue has stalled in Congress as both parties have struggled to find common ground. Some Republicans have voiced support for legalization efforts, while many Democrats favor the creation of a pathway to citizenship.
But House Speaker John Boehner said Friday he's still hopeful that legislation can pass this year, but conceded he doesn't expect it will happen before November's midterm elections.
"I don't know what's going to happen in the next month or so," he told reporters in Ohio on Friday. "But I think there are a lot of people who want to get this done, and there is still time to do it."
