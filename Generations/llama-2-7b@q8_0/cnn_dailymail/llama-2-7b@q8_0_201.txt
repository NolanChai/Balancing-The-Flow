The lawsuit by Joshua Hedges of Leesburg came one day after Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring's office said it would investigate Mason's handling of the case to determine whether Title IX federal requirements were violated.
Hedges was expelled in March for allegedly engaging in non-consensual sexual activity with an unidentified female student who later complained that she had been sexually assaulted. Hedges maintains that they did not have intercourse and that the act was part of role playing between two consenting adults.
"We believe Mason's decision is flawed and not in the best interest of our students," university spokesman Brian Hemphill said Friday, adding that Hedges also filed a grievance against Mason with the state's Office for Civil Rights. "We are taking this matter very seriously and will cooperate fully in any investigation."
In an interview at his home on Thursday, Hedges told The Washington Post that the act was consensual and described it as sadomasochism involving restraints and sexual role play. He also said he did not have intercourse with the woman, who is not identified by name in court records.
The lawsuit alleges violations of his constitutional rights, including the First Amendment right to free speech, and accuses university officials of discriminating against him for being a man. The suit seeks unspecified financial damages.
"We're suing because we believe Joshua Hedges is innocent and he was wrongfully expelled," said John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor and founder of the Action on Smoking and Health who has filed similar complaints in recent months with schools that have suspended students for violating sexual misconduct policies.
"The only thing they found that he had done was engage in sadomasochistic role playing," Banzhaf said, "and that's not a crime."
Hedges alleges Mason administrators violated his rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination based on sex. He argues that the university discriminates against men and allows women to file complaints without the need for corroborating evidence or any testimony from the alleged victim.
"The allegations in this lawsuit are troubling," said Rachel Laser, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which is not involved in Hedges' case but filed an amicus brief last month with U.S. Supreme Court justices who were considering the issue. "There have been other cases where students alleged to be responsible for sexual assault have had their rights violated, and this is a good example of that."
The lawsuit also challenges Mason's policy barring sex between faculty and students, which the school adopted last fall in response to federal Title IX requirements. Hedges says he was suspended from teaching a course because of his sexual relationship with the woman involved in the case.
Hedges met the girl while studying for a master's degree at Mason; they dated briefly and had sex only one time, according to court documents. Afterward, she said she did not enjoy it and asked him not to contact her again, he said. He continued his relationship with her but told her that he would be leaving town and moving back to Leesburg after graduating, the suit says.
In February 2013, Mason officials received a complaint against Hedges alleging sexual misconduct, according to court records. The student did not name any alleged perpetrator but told officials she was not comfortable discussing details.
A year later, when she saw him at the school's science and technology campus in Manassas, the girlfriend said, she reported to university police that he had sexually assaulted her while they were students together. She provided no specific dates or times of incidents and was not able to describe what happened during those encounters because they were so long ago, according to court records.
Hedges says he met with a dean from the College of Science as part of an investigation into his relationship with the woman but refused to answer any questions that did not relate directly to his work and classroom behavior, such as what happened during their dating relationship. He was expelled from Mason in March 2015.
Banzhaf said he would also sue the university if it were a woman who was punished for engaging in consensual sexual role play. "We've seen more cases with women than men, but we have sued against both," he said. "If [Hedges] were a woman, we'd be taking action just as fast."
The university did not respond to The Post's request for the woman's name. In court papers, Hedges accuses Mason officials of violating his rights under Title IX by denying him due process and equal protection during the disciplinary proceedings against him. He also argues that he was denied freedom of expression by being barred from teaching after his suspension last year.
"This lawsuit is about protecting students' civil liberties," Hedges said in a statement released through Banzhaf. "I want to set an example for other students who are accused without evidence and found guilty due to the lack of evidence, to stand up."
