The best golfer in the world, who has played in the last two Ryder Cups for his country, is a good bet at +1500 at FanDuel Sportsbook.
Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — 14 different winners since 2000 — it is impossible not to pick Dustin Johnson.
The best golfer in the world, who has played in the last two Ryder Cups for his country, is a good bet at +1500 at FanDuel Sportsbook. He’s also +675 at Caesars Sportsbook and +625 at Unibet, but all three are the same price.

He also won at The Players Championship to end last season when he was ranked No 2 and was the leader going into Sunday at The Open before losing his way. He is +1900 at Unibet, which seems very generous given all of those things we just mentioned.
