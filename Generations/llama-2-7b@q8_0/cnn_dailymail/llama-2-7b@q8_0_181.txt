A five-year-old Ohio girl died Wednesday after she tried to get out of a moving Jeep, authorities said.
Cameron Laughlin was with a three-year-old child in the parked car, the Staunton Police Department reported. The children were playing while their parents went on an errand about 9:45 a.m., and they were supposed to be watching them at all times, police said.
The family was driving northbound on U.S. Route 23 when Cameron leaned out the window of the Jeep’s open passenger-side door and fell onto the road, authorities said. A passerby picked her up and took her to the hospital where she died a short time later, police reported.
Cameron was pronounced dead at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, according to police.
“This incident is being treated as an accident,” Chief Mark Solomon said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.”
