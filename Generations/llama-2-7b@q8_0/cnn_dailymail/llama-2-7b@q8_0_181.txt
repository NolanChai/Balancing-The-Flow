 are coming in.
Koke, who scored two goals for his national team during this month's European Qualifiers campaign, has been a model of consistency and reliability since joining Los Colchoneros in 2011, having made almost 300 appearances to date in all competitions.
The versatile Spaniard is an asset that is almost irreplaceable at Atleti, given the way he can play on either flank as well as through the middle in attack and how well he reads a match.
Koke will not be easy to replace, but there's no doubting that his departure will have been softened by the arrival of Rodri from Manchester City for an estimated €70 million (£62.5m/$81.4m).
The Spain international is the latest star brought in by Atleti president Enrique Cerezo, and he's going to be a big hit with the fans at Wanda Metropolitano.
Rodri has made over 100 appearances for City across four seasons at the Etihad Stadium, but hasn’t quite managed to break into Pep Guardiola’s starting XI on a regular basis. He’ll get plenty of chances in Madrid though as he bids to become part of Diego Simeone’s first-choice XI.
The 23-year-old is known for his technical ability, his impressive reading of the game and his leadership qualities. He has great vision and can pick out a pass from anywhere on the pitch while also being very comfortable in possession.
