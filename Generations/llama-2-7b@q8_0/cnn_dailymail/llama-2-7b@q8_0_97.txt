34 was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree attempted murder after police found two of her sons in critical condition at a local hospital, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KOMO.
Police were called to the scene around 8:15 p.m. Friday night on reports that two children -- ages 6 and 7 years old -- had been injured, according to a probable cause statement from police filed in court Monday. The boys were taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle with severe cuts and lacerations to their throats.
Booth initially told police the children's injuries occurred after they came home from school Friday, but police said they didn't believe her story. After interviewing the boys, authorities learned Booth had cut both of their throats around 1:30 p.m. that day -- using a "bathroom knife" she kept in her bedroom, according to the probable cause statement.
When police found out about the attack, they took Booth into custody and arrested her on two counts of first-degree attempted murder. She was booked into the county jail where she remains with bail set at $2 million each count. It's unclear if she has an attorney who can speak on her behalf.
An affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate KING said Booth admitted to police that she had cut both of her children's throats in an attempt to silence them "to keep them from talking and causing problems for her." Police were unable to determine what prompted the attack, according to court documents.
Investigators say they have not found any evidence Booth tried to treat either boy after cutting their throats and that she did nothing to stop the bleeding. They also noted that both boys had bruises on them that appeared "consistent with prior injury."
An online obituary for a girl who died in 2015 described her as the oldest daughter of Booth's husband, Scott Booth. The website said she was born prematurely and suffered from "several health complications throughout her life," but that she died peacefully at home with her family by her side after a battle with cancer.
CNN has reached out to a number of people who appear in the obituary, including Scott Booth's mother and brother, as well as his father and sister.
