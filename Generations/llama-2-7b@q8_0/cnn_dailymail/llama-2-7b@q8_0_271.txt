"We do not think we are ready," Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faisal said. He added that if the Saudis had a veto power, they would use it. "This is an important position and one we take very seriously." The prince pointed out that since Saudi Arabia's inception in 1932, it has not had any diplomatic relations with Israel or Jordan.
There are two things to be said about this move: one positive and the other negative. On the positive side, by declining membership in the U.N., the Saudis have demonstrated a seriousness of purpose that may eventually lead them towards some sort of rapprochement with their regional neighbors -- and more importantly, Israel. This would be an important step in a process of gradual normalization of relations among all the countries in this troubled region.
On the negative side, however, by turning down membership in the U.N., the Saudis have done themselves a disservice: they've given their critics ammunition to argue that the Arabs are not serious about peace and security -- but rather, the only thing that is important is scoring cheap points against Israel at international forums.
That is certainly how many Israelis see this move; one senior Israeli official told me that he could "no longer take the Saudis seriously." This is a shame because there are plenty of good reasons to support the kingdom's bid for membership in the world organization. The Saudi position on international security and peace -- namely, its stand against terrorism and its insistence on the creation of a Palestinian state -- would have been an asset to the council.
Surely, however, it is time for all parties concerned to come back down to earth and give each other some credit: Israelis are not so naive as to think that just because Saudi Arabia declined membership in the U.N., it means that relations with Israel have suddenly become easier than they were before.
Israel has many problems, including Palestinian terrorism -- but they aren't going away simply by virtue of Saudi Arabia's decision not to join a world organization. For its part, however, Riyadh should make the most out of this opportunity: it should seriously consider taking up the membership offer again, and should try to use this time for real introspection into its own role in regional conflicts.
In short, there is an opportunity here for Saudi Arabia to seize a leadership position in the region -- and the world -- if only they could stop playing politics with such simplemindedness.
