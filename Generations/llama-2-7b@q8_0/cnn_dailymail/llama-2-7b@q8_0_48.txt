 she trekked through the woods with her parents in Martha's Vineyard on Sunday afternoon.
The First Lady wore a white top and blue jeans while husband Barack sported faded green shorts as they led their daughter along a trail at the Oak Bluffs property that is owned by a friend of Michelle Obama's, according to reports in the Boston Globe and People magazine.
Mother-of-two Michelle had just returned from an eight day vacation in Italy with her daughters last week - which she documented on Facebook - but was still making the most of family time while back home in Massachusetts.
The First Daughter, meanwhile, was overheard asking her father about the presidential election after he said something about his opponent Mitt Romney's chances.

The Obamas, who have been at the secluded property for two weeks, were joined by their good friends Valerie Jarrett and Dr Jill Biden.
It is not clear whether Sasha's sibling Malia, 13, also accompanied them on the nature walk but her father had been spotted with both his daughters riding bikes around Martha's Vineyard last week.
The First Family were seen strolling along a beach near their rental home as Michelle walked in front of Sasha and Malia followed behind her husband.
On Thursday, the president appeared to be in relaxed mood after his first round of fundraising events in New York City, where he raised $1.5 million for the Democrats at a dinner held in honor of his re-election campaign at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.
He told donors that his main focus now was winning re-election this November, even though it was unlikely to be easy given recent polls showing Romney ahead in several swing states.
'We know there are a lot of hurdles in our way,' he said at the event held for 50 wealthy Democrats. 'This campaign will be long and hard.'
