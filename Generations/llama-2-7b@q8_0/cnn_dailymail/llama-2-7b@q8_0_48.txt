Speaking at a mass rally commemorating the 52nd anniversary of the Cuban revolution, Castro said Cuba's government should not enter into negotiations with Obama. He added that Obama was unqualified to talk about the island because he had never been there.
"The president of the United States has a name that doesn't mean anything," Castro said at the rally in Havana's Revolution Square. "I don't know why they call him Mr. President. He is not even an adult, nor qualified to be one."
Castro said Obama's policies were designed to make Cubans live worse than they had before 1959 -- the year when he took power and kicked out U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.
"I don't care whether you like it or not," he added. "You can insist on your own way if you want to be stupid."
The former leader has stepped down from the presidency, but remains first secretary of Cuba's Communist Party and head of its national assembly. He is now 85 years old.
His comments were televised by the country's state-run media.
Obama last month renewed a general license allowing Americans to travel to Cuba without obtaining a special "people-to-people" visa. The move came after several high-level meetings between the two countries and is part of an effort by Obama to improve relations with Havana that have been strained for decades over U.S.-backed attempts to oust Castro from power.
The Cuban government has not yet responded to Obama's latest move, but there are already signs of resistance from its leftist allies in Latin America who oppose what they see as U.S. meddling on the island nation.
Earlier this week, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez said the change in U.S. travel policies would allow Americans to come to his country and "infiltrate" it politically.
