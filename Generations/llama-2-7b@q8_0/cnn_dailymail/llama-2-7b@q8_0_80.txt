ny Johnson has been missing her engagement ring for more than six years, but the story of its disappearance began long before that.
Johnson's husband, Josh, proposed to her in 2003 after she had been living and working in London for about a year. They decided to have the proposal documented on video -- Johnson was not expecting it, even if they had spoken earlier about getting married.
The ring is from Johnson's mother, who died when Jenny was just eight years old. She wanted to give her daughter something "unique and beautiful," but she didn't want it to be a typical wedding band, says Johnson, so she designed an eternity band that includes an heirloom sapphire surrounded by diamonds.
The couple returned from London after the engagement and continued their planning for the nuptials, which would take place in May of 2004 at a beachfront hotel on the Jersey shore where they had honeymooned.
"I wanted everything to be perfect," says Johnson. "Whenever we went out shopping or got dressed up and took photos, I never stopped smiling."
But the ring didn't stay with her for long. It was lost in transit from London to Newark Airport on September 1, 2003 -- the same day of the terrorist attacks at Heathrow Airport.
The couple had taken a connecting flight on American Airlines from Gatwick Airport. "When we got off our flight into Heathrow, we went right through security," says Johnson. "I remember going into my bag and putting it back in, then walking out of the terminal." The ring was not there when they left the airport.
"We tried to call American Airlines and the London police station but nobody knew what happened or even where our luggage went -- all they could do was file a lost baggage report," she says.
"We spent three days looking for my mom's ring everywhere we could, from the airport to our house, then we had to go back to work." They finally came up empty-handed and filed a police report at a nearby precinct. It was only when they started getting calls about their lost luggage that Josh began investigating.
"The next morning I got on the phone with American Airlines," says Johnson, "and I started crying because I knew it wasn't going to turn out well." They were told that the bag had been found and was being shipped back to New York from Heathrow. "They asked if we wanted our ring sent or if we could come to the airport to get it -- Josh said, 'Why would you send us there?'"
When Johnson spoke with her husband again later that day, he told her that they had lost the ring and had filed a police report about its disappearance. "The person at American Airlines didn't even know where my mom's ring was," she says. "That made me feel horrible." She also believes that if she had been allowed to travel home with her luggage, she would have discovered it missing then and there -- perhaps preventing the long search for its whereabouts.
"They did file a police report on the lost ring," says American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith in response to Johnson's statements. "It is not unusual to lose rings or other items while traveling. In fact, our goal is to return all lost items to their rightful owners."
Johnson says she was also given the phone number for a British couple who had recently been reunited with a ring that they thought they would never see again -- a case similar in many ways to Johnson's and one that has also become a bit of an urban legend at the airline.
"It's very common when a bag is lost that the contents are not always discovered right away," says Smith. "Because it takes time, we encourage our customers who have lost items in their luggage to fill out and submit a Property Claim Form as soon as possible."
Smith declined to comment on whether or not an investigation has been conducted regarding Johnson's claim that her ring was stolen by an airline employee. The couple is still waiting to hear back from American Airlines regarding their lost ring, which they say was worth $30,000 when it was stolen and is now valued at more than twice the original price because of its sentimental value.
"I'm not sure if I want them to return my mom's ring," says Johnson, "because that would bring back all those memories."
