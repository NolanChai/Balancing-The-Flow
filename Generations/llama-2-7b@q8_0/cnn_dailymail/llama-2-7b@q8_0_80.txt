According to the Harvard Business School, being let go from a job is not only an opportunity for introspection, it's also a chance to find your true calling in the world of work.
A 2009 paper titled "Job Loss and Career Renewal" by Harvard professors Francesca Gino and Bradley R. Staats found that people who are let go from their jobs can take advantage of what they call the "sunk cost fallacy," in which they're more likely to engage in creative thinking after getting fired, as a way to deal with the sting of rejection.
"Such experiences may be critical to help individuals reorient themselves and identify new career opportunities," Gino said in an email interview with CNN. "While losing a job is not pleasant -- nor should we take it lightly -- thinking about what happened can make us stronger, more creative thinkers and ultimately lead us to find new careers that better suit who we really are."
So how exactly does this process work? Here are five steps that will help you turn your job loss into a job gain:
1. Be prepared for the emotional roller coaster -- but don't ride it
Losing your job can be an incredibly difficult experience, so it's important to take the time to fully embrace and process any emotions you may feel after being let go. According to Gino, this will help you become more creative in how you move forward with your career.
"It is natural to fall into a spiral of self-doubt when we are rejected, but doing so can actually limit our ability to be creative," she said. "Trying to understand the situation and reflect on what happened will help us become more open to alternative ways of looking at things."
But don't ride that emotional roller coaster for too long -- try to find a happy medium between embracing your feelings and moving on from them, says Gino. She suggests scheduling a time to be alone in order to give yourself the space you need to fully process any emotions you may have after getting fired.
2. Focus on your strengths and how they can help you find your next career move
During times of intense transition, it's easy to feel like we're at a complete loss about what our future will look like -- but according to Gino, that's not necessarily the case. She says there are two steps for getting back on track after losing your job:
"First, focus on what you have done well and enjoy doing in order to identify strengths that can help you find a new opportunity. Secondly, try to take a step back and think about how those same strengths can be applied to a different job," she said. "If the strengths are aligned with your career interests, this should increase the likelihood of finding a role where you can succeed."
3. Make sure your resume reflects your true personality
Aside from identifying your strengths and how they can help you find a new position after being let go, it's also crucial to make sure that your resume accurately reflects who you are as a worker -- even if the job you lost was in an unrelated field. Gino says it is important for job hunters to not only highlight their strengths and skills on their resumes but to do so with confidence.
"For example, people often forget that they should tailor their resume to the specific position at hand -- but this can be easy if you focus more on what you have done well than on your previous titles," she said in her email interview with CNN. "Secondly, people sometimes feel uncomfortable when talking about their achievements; try focusing on how proud they were or how excited they felt."
4. Don't just apply for the same position over and over again -- this is a wasted opportunity to be creative
It can be tempting after getting fired from one job to go out and immediately search for another in a similar role, but according to Gino, doing so may not end up being the best career move. Instead, she suggests that job hunters take time to reflect on what they've learned about themselves during the firing process -- and use this as an opportunity to think creatively about how their strengths could apply in different roles.
"It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you know exactly what your next job should be, but doing so can actually limit our ability to find new careers that better suit who we really are," Gino said. "We all have different interests and skills; take advantage of this by exploring alternative paths for your career."
5. Find a support network -- whether it's old colleagues or new friends, having others on your side will make the process easier
A job search can be an incredibly stressful experience, so Gino says that it is important to find people you trust who can help you through this tough time by listening and offering advice when needed. According to her, even if they don't have much work experience themselves, friends or family members may still have some helpful ideas for how someone should approach their job search after being laid off from a previous position.
"It is also important not only for people who are looking for new jobs but also for those who do not know what exactly they want," she said in her email interview with CNN, adding that the more support you can find during this time period of your life will ultimately help make finding success in whatever field comes next easier.
