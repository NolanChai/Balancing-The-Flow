­Glasgow to demand that voters ­"choose hope over fear" in the General Election, and warned against voting for UKIP in the referendum on Scottish independence.
But an Opinium poll for the Daily Mail revealed how many Scots are ready to vote SNP in May and then choose ­independence next year.
In the poll of 1,004 voters, 75 per cent backed voting SNP at Westminster on Thursday, 98 per cent wanted a second independence referendum within five years and only two out of five would vote to stay in the UK if Scotland was independent.
Asked who they planned to support at this election, more than half - 54 per cent - said the SNP, with just 26 per cent for Labour.
In an attempt to halt his slide south of the Border Mr Miliband vowed a Labour government would be tough on immigration and help struggling families hit by wage squeezes caused by rising costs.
But he refused to pledge not to allow a new runway at Heathrow, saying: "We have to recognise that the economy of Britain has changed since 2008."
Mr Miliband was also warned last night that his appeal had failed to win over women voters as he launched Labour's manifesto in Cardiff. A new poll shows that less than half of female voters would back a Labour Government led by Mr Miliband, with just 45 per cent saying they trust him and only 38 per cent believing he can lead the country through difficult times.
In his first campaign visit to Scotland since he launched his bid for power, Mr Miliband said: "People are right to be fearful of a world that is changing too fast; but people should also look at how the other parties would react. They would react by trying to turn back the clock and pretend everything was fine when it wasn't."
He insisted Labour, which is trailing in the opinion polls, is offering "a positive vision of Britain for the future". He told a rally: "I am standing here today not as part of some big bureaucratic machine. I know what matters to people because that's my life and I understand it better than anybody."
But Labour has been badly damaged in Scotland by the independence referendum - and is now playing catch-up to the SNP, which has had its biggest poll ratings since the referendum as well as a surge of support from voters fed up with UK parties.
The Opinium survey showed that 26 per cent would vote Labour at Westminster in May compared to 49 per cent for the SNP - and only 17 per cent for Mr Miliband's party when Scots were asked who they wanted as Prime Minister.
It is a similar picture across much of England with support for Labour falling below 30 per cent.
Mr Miliband, whose leadership was called into question after the SNP surge in Scotland in September, launched his manifesto on a day when the SNP said it had secured a promise from David Cameron to agree an independent Scotland's membership of the single currency. The SNP has also been at odds with Labour over plans for new nuclear power stations and fracking for gas.
The latest polls show that 46 per cent of Scots plan to vote SNP, 22 per cent Conservative, nine per cent Liberal Democrat and just three per cent UKIP.
Mr Cameron is expected to return from his Easter break on Friday and meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday before formally launching his campaign in Scotland next week.
