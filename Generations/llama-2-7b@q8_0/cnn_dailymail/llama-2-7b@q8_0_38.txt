 other charges in October. He is accused of killing at least 11 women over seven years starting in the 1980s, when he was a Cleveland police officer. Prosecutors said Sowell raped his victims before bludgeoning them to death with hammers or chains.
If convicted of all 23 counts against him, the state could have sought execution by firing squad. The Ohio Constitution prohibits such executions and prosecutors did not request that option. Instead they asked for lethal injection. Under the new capital punishment law signed earlier this month by Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, inmates can be put to death with a cocktail of drugs rather than a single substance -- though they have to waive their right to challenge that protocol. The judge set sentencing for March 9 and ordered Sowell returned from the Cleveland jail where he's been held since his arrest in October to Death Row at Chillicothe, Ohio.

I hope they do a test on him first before doing the lethal injection! He'd probably turn into a zombie or vampire and come back to kill again.
