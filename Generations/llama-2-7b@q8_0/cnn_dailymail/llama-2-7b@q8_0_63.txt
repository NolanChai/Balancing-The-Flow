 dashcam as he drove along I-95 southbound near Stamford, Connecticut, last month.
As Mr Rivera records, he sees a grey SUV going straight towards him and he slams on the breaks, but is unable to stop before being smashed by the other car which has veered across three lanes of traffic into his lane.
The shocked trucker can be heard gasping as he tries to process what happened with the 51-year-old woman at the wheel. The driver of the grey SUV is seen getting out and screaming at the truck after she realizes that her car has been damaged in the crash, but the terrified trucker is unable to understand her because he only speaks Spanish.
The incident took place at around 9am on October 24 last year near Stamford, Connecticut. In a statement, police said: ‘The operator of the grey SUV was driving erratically prior to the crash and had been traveling southbound in the northbound lanes of I-95 when she struck the truck that Mr Rivera was operating.
‘Following this accident, officers located the driver of the grey SUV attempting to commit suicide by hanging from a tree in a nearby wooded area. The woman who attempted suicide has been taken into custody and is receiving medical treatment at a hospital.’
