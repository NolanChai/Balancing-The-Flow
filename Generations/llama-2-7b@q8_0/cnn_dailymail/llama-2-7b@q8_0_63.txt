6,000 from the taxpayer.
Jennifer Smith was given an eight month suspended sentence and ordered to pay Â£5,847 in compensation for her deceptions at Swansea Crown Court yesterday (Wednesday July 25).
Smith, aged 36, of Marlborough Street in Gowerton, claimed to be unable to walk and used a mobility scooter. But she was actually able to walk short distances without assistance and also had her own vehicle.
Swansea Crown Court heard Smith made false claims for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) between 2006 and 2010. She also claimed for Carers Allowance, council tax benefit and housing benefits.
She was arrested in January this year when a routine check of her records revealed inconsistencies in the details she had provided.
Her deceptions were discovered during an investigation by the Department for Work and Pensions into suspected fraudulent claims involving 415 people.
Smith admitted six charges of dishonestly making a false claim when she appeared at Swansea Magistrates Court on May 28.
