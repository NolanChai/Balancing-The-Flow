 218 games in 19 seasons at the club, admits he is never sure about his team until kick off and often takes a last minute decision.
"I try to make my mind up on the Monday morning," said Wenger, whose side have been drawn against Manchester United for the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday week. "But it's difficult because you are not 100 per cent sure. But if you leave it too late there is a big chance that your players can make mistakes in their preparation."
He added: "I try to wait as long as possible, but you have to be careful with the team selection when you get close to kick-off time because of injuries or suspensions. But I think the biggest worry for me is that we don't make so many mistakes this season in games where we are already winning."
Wenger also said it was hard to see how England would top their group at the World Cup finals without a home draw against Slovenia on Wednesday, which could be followed by trips to Croatia and Ukraine. "There is no room for error," he added. "I think it will be difficult."
The Arsenal manager revealed that Robin van Persie had played the entire 90 minutes of England's 1-0 friendly win over Slovakia in his comeback from a knee injury, but could not say if he would be risked against Liverpool. "We will wait and see," added Wenger.
