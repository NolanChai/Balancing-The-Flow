It's unclear what caused the collapse of the 8-story building under construction in Oakland, California, but debris from it hit an adjacent building.
The building that collapsed had been undergoing demolition since late May when it became unstable and the owner ordered work to be halted until engineers could evaluate the structure's stability, the city's Building Inspection Department said in a statement. The site was deemed safe for workers to return Tuesday morning after tests showed that the building was no longer unstable, but there was still concern about whether it would collapse on its own or during demolition, the department said.
"The decision of the owner to resume the work despite this advice is being investigated by city inspectors and will be referred to other authorities for consideration," the statement said. The city's fire department and police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A man who answered the phone at Oakland-based developer LRM Development, which is handling demolition of the building, declined to comment on the collapse. He also declined to identify himself.
Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said she would speak about the tragedy at a news conference scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PDT Wednesday.
