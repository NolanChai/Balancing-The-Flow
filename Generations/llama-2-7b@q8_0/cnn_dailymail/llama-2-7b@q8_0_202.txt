4000 years ago dominated the ancient world with their advanced culture and commerce, were in fact refugees.
The findings come from an extensive study by a team led by Professor Richard Evershed of Oxford University. The scientists analysed genetic material found on bones excavated from Akrotiri on Santorini. They compared them with samples from modern populations and found that the inhabitants of Minoan Crete were actually native to the island.
The finding could throw into question many theories about the origins of this ancient culture, including whether its people were descended from North African invaders or refugees fleeing natural catastrophe. Evershed said he was "blown away" by the results when they compared the DNA with that of modern populations in the Aegean islands and mainland Greece.
It's been suggested that they may have come over on a boat, from Libya or Tunisia," he added. But this is really not supported by genetics." The researchers found that the people of Akrotiri had the same Y-chromosome haplogroups (types of DNA passed down through the male line) as people in Crete and neighbouring Cyprus today.
Santorini's Minoan town was buried by a massive volcanic eruption around 1,600 BC that is believed to have led to the collapse of the Bronze Age civilisation and the destruction of Atlantis. But in the 1950s, researchers from the American School of Classical Studies at Athens found bones on Akrotiri with traces of North African DNA. The theory was that these had belonged to refugees who settled on Santorini after fleeing other parts of the eastern Mediterranean in an effort to escape the upheaval caused by the eruption and the collapse of Bronze Age civilisation that followed it.
The new study has challenged this idea, however, demonstrating a strong genetic link between ancient Akrotiri and Crete's modern inhabitants. The researchers examined 82 bones recovered from the city in 1967. They compared their mitochondrial DNA - inherited only through mothers - with that of 40 Cretan individuals.
"They matched very well," Evershed said. "Their genetic profile was very similar, which suggests they are very closely related." The research also suggests that the Minoans who inhabited Crete were not just from one ethnic group but had a wide range of genetic ancestry. Evershed explained: "In Cretan DNA we found people who were descended from two different branches of the human family tree, and this was very common."
The scientists hope that by analysing the full genome - which they plan to do for many of the samples - they may be able to learn more about Minoan culture. Evershed said: "We're trying to work out whether they were using livestock, whether they were using animals and so on."
The researchers are planning further studies involving ancient bones excavated from around Crete. The scientists believe the DNA of the Minoans is relatively well preserved in their remains because most of these people were buried in hot springs. These natural ovens meant that the bodies were protected from insects and other animals, which otherwise could have chewed on the flesh.
The findings will be published this week in the journal Current Biology.
