160 miles south of the Canadian border was blamed on excessive speed by police who say that the parents lost control after passing another car and drove off the road, crashing into a wooden signpost which fell onto their truck.
The unidentified man and woman were killed instantly while their baby boy is believed to have died shortly thereafter.
Washington State Patrol Trooper Mark Francis said that the couple’s young son was declared dead at 9:50 AM Tuesday morning when a medical team arrived on scene but it wasn’t until an autopsy was performed several hours later that they were able to confirm the baby died due to the incident.
The parents were from Puyallup, Washington and were traveling westbound when their pick-up truck veered off the road at 9:30 AM Monday morning on SR 512. The vehicle struck a wooden signpost which then fell onto their truck as they were under an overpass.
Francis said that investigators found that excessive speed was to blame for the accident, saying “They had passed another vehicle and that’s when they lost control.”
The identities of those involved have not been released pending notification of family members.
