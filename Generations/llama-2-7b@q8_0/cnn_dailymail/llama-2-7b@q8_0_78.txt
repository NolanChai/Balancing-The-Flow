 members who have voiced opposition is that they need more time to evaluate the situation and hear from constituents.
As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn’t be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed. One common refrain from members who have voiced opposition is that they need more time to evaluate the situation and hear from constituents.
“I think I am still waiting for all the facts,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), who expressed skepticism in an interview with CBS News about a decision to act based on “very sketchy information.” The same goes for Rep. Chris Gibson (R-NY). “I have not yet made up my mind one way or another, but I want to hear more from the president and from members of his administration,” he said in an interview with CNN.
Whether the Obama team should be surprised at this state of affairs is open for debate. The White House has made clear that it will not put a resolution on Syria before Congress unless there is a credible threat of action against the Assad regime, which is now undergoing its own civil war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez (D-NJ) said he was working with Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the ranking member on that panel and an ardent opponent of any military action in Syria, to work out a bipartisan resolution to authorize the use of force against Assad’s regime.
The goal is for it to be a “clear, straightforward authorization with no conditions,” Menendez said. And if Congress comes back from recess next week and fails to act, he will try again in two weeks when the Senate reconvenes after Labor Day.
“I’m not interested in putting this off, but I am interested in being very specific,” he said, adding that he would be happy with a 48-hour deadline for a strike if Congress authorizes it. That would give Obama time to make his case against the use of chemical weapons by Assad to the American public before Congress returns from recess next week.
So far, neither the White House nor lawmakers have released a specific proposal that spells out exactly what the president could or should do in Syria. And while Menendez said he would like to see such language, he also acknowledged that he’s not sure it will happen — at least not on Thursday when Obama addresses the nation and Congress convenes for a pro forma session.
“I think we need to be very specific,” he said. “I don’t know if I expect it to come out of today.”
