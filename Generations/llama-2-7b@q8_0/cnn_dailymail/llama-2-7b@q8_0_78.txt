However in the first round of the US Open he gave us all a glimpse of just what he can do when everything clicks into place. He beat Spain’s Feliciano Lopez 7-5 6-3 4-6 6-1 on Tuesday evening after three hours and seven minutes of enthralling tennis.
It was perhaps the most complete performance we have seen from Monfils in a very long time, if not ever. The Frenchman started slowly with errors, but as he grew into the match his best tennis appeared. In the second set, it was almost a one-way street for the 25 year old. He looked strong and fast on all surfaces, mixing up his strokes beautifully to get Lopez off balance.
Monfils’ serve is sometimes too much of a liability but he served very well today (76%), only losing two points on second serves. His return game was also outstanding, winning 65% of his return points and breaking twice in the first set, something which became a theme throughout the match as he broke six times in total.
He moves forward so well off both sides and takes the ball very early on, getting into the court quickly to put pressure on his opponents. It is easy to see why he was once labelled “the best player of this generation” by former World Number Two Mats Wilander.
Perhaps most impressive though is the fact that Monfils beat Lopez in four sets after losing the first two, showing great mental strength and determination to win in straight-sets. It has been a long time since we have seen him play with such conviction and it would be no surprise if he carried on this form for many more matches to come.
Monfils’ opponent in the next round will either be Mikhail Youzhny, or an unknown name in qualifier Tim Smyczek. The match against Smyczek looks likely at this stage as Monfils has been drawn into a possible quarter-final clash with World Number One Novak Djokovic.
Monfils is playing some of his best tennis for quite some time, but he will need to get through another tricky opponent and more pressure in order to meet up again with the man who beat him in last year’s Australian Open final.
