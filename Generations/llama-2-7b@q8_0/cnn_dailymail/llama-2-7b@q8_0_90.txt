2015 (pictured) to learn more about their lives
The robot can travel for miles on its own, but can only last around eight hours before it needs charging - a major issue in Antarctica where temperatures drop below -30C.
Scientists have created a 'robot penguin' that will help them to understand the birds' secret lives. The robot is designed to infiltrate colonies and learn more about how they behave when unobserved by humans.
The 'penguins', which are not really penguins at all, are fitted with cameras and sensors and can travel for miles on their own using a variety of different modes. They're designed to act as if they're an animal, walking along the ground and jumping over rocks and obstacles - but unlike real animals, they don't get tired after a while.
They were created by robotics scientist Paul Patterson, from the University of Salford in Manchester, who has been developing the robots for seven years as part of an ongoing project to learn more about emperor penguins and their colonies.
Penguin rovers have already been sent out into the Antarctic wilderness - but this is only the second time they've actually seen a real emperor colony. They were designed with safety in mind, and can only be deployed if it isn't too dangerous to travel to them.
The penguins are equipped with cameras that take photos every few seconds. The information from these cameras will help the researchers identify how many eggs a female is carrying and whether or not she's still incubating, among other things.
Dr Patterson hopes his project can shed light on emperor penguin behaviour in some of its least well-studied colonies, giving us valuable information about them that would otherwise be impossible to gather - especially considering that the colony was only discovered two years ago.
In the future, he wants to create a version of the robot that can also swim so it can go underwater as well as on land.
