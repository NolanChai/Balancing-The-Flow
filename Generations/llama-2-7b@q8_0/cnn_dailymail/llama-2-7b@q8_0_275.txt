5% actually got a human operator on the other end of the line.
The problem: The IRS has cut staff by 18%, while the number of people it serves has increased by almost 6%. At the same time, Congress slashed funds for the agency in 2011 and 2012â€”a move that led to more than $354 million less being spent on information technology.
The result: Taxpayers' calls were answered by only 90% of the time this season, according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).
"Our audit work found that call-waiting times and average taxpayer hold times have increased significantly in recent years," said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration, in a letter to IRS commissioner John Koskinen this week. The IRS needs "to address these issues by increasing staff resources and developing a systematic approach to hiring."
The report also found that the agency's 69 phone lines were insufficient for its call volume of nearly 130 million calls last year, which was up 2% from fiscal 2014. TIGTA said in order to provide adequate customer service, it recommended that the IRS consider additional lines and hiring more personnel.
"It's pretty clear there needs to be more resources on this end," says Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution. "The phone system has a lot of limitations when you start talking about adding staff or adding lines."
The IRS declined comment to Fortune, saying it was still reviewing the report. But in a statement after the report's release, Koskinen said the agency is working with TIGTA officials "to identify additional ways we can improve taxpayer service and ensure that everyone who has an issue or question with their tax return receives quality customer service."
