 forest she was able to find her familyâ€™s camp and reunite with her owners.
The elephant had been stolen from her owner in northern Thailand when she was just four months old, before being rescued by animal rights activists a year ago. She is now 18-years-old and has found the place where she belonged all along.
Throughout her life, the elephant had been used for logging work and often suffered from injuries. The last time she saw her owner was in 2017 when they were separated by a road that was being built. It is not clear how long she has been missing or what happened to her during that period of her life, but it appears she made the trip back through the forest with no human help.
The video was captured by her owner, who has given her the name Nok and had become close to the elephant over the years before they were separated. It is not clear how long ago the reunion took place, as it was filmed at night, but she appears healthy in the short clip that has been released on social media.
