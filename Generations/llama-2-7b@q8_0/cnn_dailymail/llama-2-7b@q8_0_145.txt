ofield is at the bedside of the man who tried to murder her, giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while he lies on a stretcher in a trauma ward.
A week after she narrowly escaped from a house in Staffordshire which had been set alight and partially destroyed by an explosive device, Ms Scofield has returned to the scene with her husband, Mark. “I thought I’d lost my husband,” said Ms Scofield, 43.
“It was awful being told that he’d not survived and then finding out that he had. I was just so relieved.” Mr and Mrs Scofield were forced to flee the house after hearing a large bang at around midnight on Christmas Eve.
They ran outside but were confronted by smoke and flames and could only escape through a window in the roof, where they fell two storeys onto the backyard of a neighbour’s house.
The incident was almost certainly related to an investigation Ms Scofield is conducting into an allegation of fraud involving a charity which she ran for 16 years. The charity, Kids Aid International, was based at the house in Staffordshire where they were rescued by firemen and police officers who attended the blaze.
Mr Scofield, whose business, Gulf Safety and Security Ltd, advises companies on how to protect themselves against terrorist attacks, said he believed his wife had been targeted because of her role at Kids Aid, where she raised about £30m in funding.
He said: “The fire was a calculated attempt on Corinna’s life and that is the reason for this attack.” Ms Scofield is one of four people who claim to have been defrauded by Kids Aid. She is also investigating claims about another charity, The Foundation For Human Rights, which is allegedly run by her husband.
Both charities were investigated by the Charity Commission, but inquiries concluded that there was insufficient evidence to take any action against the trustees. Kids Aid and The Foundation for Human Rights both say their funds have been used solely to promote human rights and children’s health in developing countries.
Both charities were founded by Ms Scofield, who also owns a property company in Staffordshire called RJW Property Holdings Ltd. Her husband said his wife had no involvement in the two companies he runs with her brother, Michael Williams.
