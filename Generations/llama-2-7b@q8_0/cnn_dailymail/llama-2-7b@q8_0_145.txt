15 minutes after they received an alert that he had been involved in the fatal crash with two cyclists in Oxfordshire on Tuesday night.
He then proceeded to speed away at speeds of up to 80 mph before finally being arrested by officers armed with guns and Tasers just outside Swindon, Wiltshire. The shocking footage shows him driving around a roundabout repeatedly in an attempt to evade arrest, while police car sirens blare behind him.
Officers were then forced to ram his vehicle into a wall before jumping out and tackling Ali, who was found hiding underneath a bush near the scene of the crash on the A420 Oxford Road in Cholsey, Oxfordshire.
Ali has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Two men died at the scene following a head-on collision between two bikes and a silver Mercedes car being driven by Ali. Both cyclists involved were riding Honda CB650F motorcycles when the incident took place, while Ali was on his way to work in Reading.
The accident occurred around 9:30pm at a spot known as The Wharf and happened shortly after police had issued an alert about a vehicle with the registration number C712 OGD which had been reported stolen earlier that evening in Oxfordshire, just down the road from where Ali was arrested.
Ali appeared before Reading magistrates yesterday accused of causing death by dangerous driving. He was not required to enter any pleas and he will next appear at Reading Crown Court on October 20. His case has been adjourned until November 18 when it is expected the charges against him will be amended.
Superintendent Ian Hunter said: ‘I’d like to extend my personal condolences to all of those who knew and loved Richard, John and Dale. These men had their whole lives ahead of them. The impact on friends and family must be devastating.
