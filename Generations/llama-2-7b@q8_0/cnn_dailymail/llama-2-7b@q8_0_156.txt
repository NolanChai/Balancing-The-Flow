London is the capital and largest city in England, United Kingdom, with an estimated population of 9 million inhabitants. It is a global city and financial centre, whose influence in politics, culture, art, fashion and commerce ranks among the world’s most influential. The city was founded by Romans as Londinium; it became a major settlement under the Anglo-Saxon rule. In the 12th century it became an important trading post between England and France during medieval times when many traders settled there to trade goods from Europe for English produce such as cloth or woollen garments (hence its nickname ‘Woolf City’).
The population of London is over nine million, making it the most populous city in England. The city has a diverse range of industries and occupations, which are largely concentrated in finance and insurance; professional services like law firms, accountancy practices etc.; public administration such as government departments and local authorities (such as councils); health care and education sectors with hospitals/schools/universities etc.; tourism industry including hotels etc.
London has been described as the financial capital of Europe because it is home to many international corporations that are based there or have their headquarters in London’s financial district: Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Banking Group plc, Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC Holdings Plc are just some examples.
Birmingham is the second-largest city in England with a population of over one million people. It has been called “the second city” since the 16th century, due to its history as an industrial center for iron and steel production. In recent years Birmingham has become known more for its cultural offerings than manufacturing, including Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre which was reconstructed on an island in the canal network that runs through the city centre (it opened its doors in 1997). The National Exhibition Centre is another popular attraction here; it hosts many large events such as car shows or trade fairs throughout the year so there’s something for everyone!
The capital of England, Manchester has long been an important cultural and commercial hub. It was once home to Britain’s first cotton mill, which opened in 1842, and is now one of Europe’s biggest shopping malls (with over two million visitors per year). The city also boasts many museums and galleries; among these are the Imperial War Museum North – housed within an old warehouse on Salford Quays – which contains exhibits on warfare throughout history including World Wars I & II as well as other conflicts like Afghanistan or Iraq today.
Nottingham is a city in the East Midlands of England, located 12 miles northwest of Birmingham and 24 miles southeast of Sheffield. Nottingham has been called “the city of a thousand trades” because it has an industrial history that spans back centuries – from coal mining to lace making, textiles to electronics manufacturing – but today there are only two main industries left: banking and finance; and retail (shopping).
Leeds is the third-largest city in England with a population of over 650,000. Leeds has been called “the world’s most vibrant student town” because it houses three universities: Leeds Metropolitan University; University College London (UCL) at Headingley campus; and University College Dublin (UCD). The city also boasts many cultural offerings including galleries such as Tate Britain or Tate Modern, museums like National Gallery of Art or Science Museum Group Collection – but these aren’t just for students either!
Liverpool is a port city on the River Mersey in northwest England. It was founded in 1730 by Prince Rupert von der Pfalz and named after him (the German word “Liverpool” means “river mouth”). Liverpool became an important trading centre during the Industrial Revolution due to its location on major shipping routes between Europe and North America; at one point it was second only to London as England’s largest port city after Newcastle upon Tyne until 1846 when Manchester overtook both cities with its textile industry boom following industrialization there earlier than anywhere else in Britain!
Bristol is the sixth-largest city in England, located on the River Avon. Bristol was founded by Normans from Normandy (French) and has been an important port since at least 12th century when it was called Brygge Stade; this name means “bridge town” or “island town.” The city’s most famous landmark is Clifton Suspension Bridge which spans across Avon Gorge below Bristol Temple Meads railway station and connects Clifton Hill with Leigh Woods on Leith Walk above them both!
Coventry is a cathedral city in the West Midlands of England. The city’s name comes from an early form of ‘covenant,’ which was used by medieval people to describe their pledge not to commit any crime against God or man, but instead live peaceably together as one body under Christ Jesus (the King). In 1940, during World War II, Coventry suffered heavy damage when it was bombed heavily over three nights between November 13th -15th; this event became known as “Coventry Blitz”. The city has since been rebuilt but still retains many historical buildings including St Michael’s Cathedral which dates back to around 1100AD!
Newcastle upon Tyne is a city in the North East of England, located on the River Tyne. It has been called “the shipbuilding capital” because it was one of Britain’s largest manufacturing centres during World War II when its factories produced millions of tonnes worth of ships for use by both sides in the conflict (including aircraft carriers).
