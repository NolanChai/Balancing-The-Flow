2015, with promising results.
This unusual airplane is able to take off from water without leaving any wake and it can even hover over the surface, as if it was a helicopter! In fact, unlike the former one, it doesnâ€™t need runways or special preparation in order to land safely on the sea or lake. It may seem like the perfect choice for police forces and coast guards but also for environmental patrols, search and rescue missions, and more.
This video presents you a very good test of this aircraft in flight conditions and its ability to take off from water and hover. Enjoy it!
