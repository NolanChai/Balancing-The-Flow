South Korea's Defense Ministry told Yonhap News Agency it believes North Korea fired a three-stage missile into waters off its east coast late Saturday, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. The launch occurred about 10:30 p.m., Korean time (9:30 a.m. ET), South Korean officials told Yonhap.
Satellite photos from U.S. firm Digital Globe taken before and after the launch show an object that appeared to be a three-stage rocket in a vertical position, CNN reported on Sunday.
The images were taken at 6:37 p.m., one hour before Saturday's scheduled launch time. A second satellite image was taken about two hours later.
North Korea has fired numerous short-, medium- and long-range rockets since 1998, but they have been deemed unsuccessful. However, the North's missile technology is improving at a pace that has concerned South Korean officials, who have urged their government to respond strongly to Saturday's launch.
On Sunday morning, Seoul called on the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting in response to North Korea's latest test-launch of what it claimed was an "earth observation satellite." The move came despite a statement issued by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon asking for "restraint" from all parties.
"This is not the first time that North Korea has launched a missile and said it had been for launching satellites," South Korean government spokesman Kim Hyun-soo told reporters in Seoul Sunday morning. "In fact, there are several cases of such activities."
He added that the satellite launched by Pyongyang on Saturday was not an earth observation satellite but a long-range missile designed to carry a nuclear warhead.
The December 12 launch came six months after North Korea announced it had conducted a successful nuclear test, prompting a new round of condemnation and sanctions from the international community.
South Korean President Lee Myung Bak told reporters in Seoul Sunday that he plans to meet with his counterparts from China and Japan on Monday to discuss measures to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear ambitions.
