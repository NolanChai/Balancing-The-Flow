ars the end of a 60-day waiting period that began when the FCC approved the deal in January.
The companies have promised they’ll be “aggressive” about providing high-speed broadband for low-income households and will also expand internet access to schools and libraries, though consumer groups worry the merger could result in higher prices.
“This is an historic opportunity to improve the nation's infrastructure,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told Congress earlier this week, “and we want to take advantage of it.”
The FCC’s approval of the merger was based on the understanding that the companies would not block online video services from competing with cable operators. However, Time Warner Cable and other smaller pay-TV providers are already complaining about Comcast’s new $10 per month Internet TV service, which offers more than 25 channels for the cost of a basic cable subscription.
“The problem is that Comcast's competitors can't do this,” Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus told the New York Times on Tuesday. “And if they did try to do it, I'm not sure we could work with them.”
According to Marcus and other industry leaders, Comcast’s entry into the Internet TV market may ultimately lead to higher cable bills for consumers as more content creators seek alternative distribution methods. In response, the US Department of Justice will look into whether the merger violates antitrust laws by raising prices for consumers or restricting competition.
In a separate FCC filing last week, Comcast promised they’d invest $2 billion in infrastructure over the next five years to improve broadband speeds and boost internet access in low-income neighborhoods. They also said they would give new customers an opportunity to leave their service within 30 days of signing up with no penalty.
“Comcast is ready, willing and able to invest billions of dollars to bring the Internet to millions more Americans,” Comcast executive vice president David Cohen wrote in a blog post this week. “We want everyone to have access to the benefits of broadband.”
