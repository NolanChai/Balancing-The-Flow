The Yorkshire batsman was replaced by Andre Fletcher who went on to help his side win. Aaron’s injury is not as serious as it first seemed, but he will be out of action for a few days and we hope it won’t have any effect on his plans for Yorkshire this season.
The news comes after Aaron revealed that he was going to stay with the club despite speculation linking him with a move back home to Australia. Finch made 5,346 runs in 19 Tests, including two centuries and three other half-centuries at an average of more than 52 and 18 ODI tons for a strike rate above 85.
He also captained the side with distinction following Michael Clarke’s retirement from international cricket before announcing his own decision to end his career on the world stage in 2019. “I’ll be back this year,” he said at the time. “We’re not sure what form we’ll be playing, but we want to play T20 as well.”
