 cerebral palsy because she hadn’t received enough oxygen in the womb.
Three years later, her brother Matthew suffered from the same condition when a medical mistake meant that he wasn’t given enough oxygen during his birth at the same hospital.
Natasha and Matt are just two of 19 children with cerebral palsy who were born at the Royal Oldham Hospital between 1993-2007, an investigation found. The NHS trust which runs the hospital has admitted that it made mistakes in a number of pregnancies and births during this period.
The Independent’s probe revealed that some cases could have been prevented if staff followed correct procedures.
Their parents now say they want answers after finding out about their children’s condition – and feel let down by the NHS Trust which runs Oldham Hospital.
Paula, 36, said: “I am not looking for compensation because that would be like rewarding people who have caused so much pain to my family but I need answers about what happened at the hospital with both of them.
“Matt and Natasha were born on opposite sides of the maternity ward and it is inconceivable that there wasn’t someone watching over the process. How do you accidentally not give a baby enough oxygen?”
The investigation found that babies were left without vital equipment to monitor their heart rates during labour – putting them at risk of brain damage or death if they suffered from a lack of oxygen in the womb or when born.
Mistakes also happened after babies had been delivered, with one baby being wrongly classified as dead and put on a trolley in the mortuary. Another child died after his mother was not warned that she should keep her son warm during the first few hours of life to avoid brain damage.
Mum Paula said: “I would love to have my children back but it’s too late now. We don’t want this to happen to other people’s babies.”
The trust which runs Oldham Hospital, Pennine Acute Trust (PAT), said the cases were caused by failings of equipment and staff training.
A spokesman for PAT said: “We apologise for any errors that have occurred in past practices at Oldham Hospital. We accept that some of these errors were avoidable if they had been properly detected and resolved.” The trust said it would be reviewing its procedures and making changes to avoid such mistakes happening again.
The family’s solicitor, Paul McCullagh from Simpson Millar, said: “I am so proud of Paula and Matthew for speaking out about what happened to them at Oldham Hospital. I believe that if they had been treated properly, neither of them would have suffered life changing injuries.”
