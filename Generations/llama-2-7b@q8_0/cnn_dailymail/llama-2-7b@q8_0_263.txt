ared "gateway drinks," researchers say.
Those who drink alcohol more frequently on flights are also likely to do it outside of planes as well, according to new findings by a University of Kentucky psychologist and his colleagues from the Netherlands published in this month's issue of the journal Addictive Behaviors.
Researchers found that people who said they had ordered more alcohol on flights also reported drinking more often at home than those with less flight drinking history, according to the study.
But does one lead to another? And is this phenomenon confined only to alcoholic drinks? The authors suggest it might be possible that people who are "gateway" consumers of alcohol could also be gateway users of other things such as food and smoking.
The research team questioned 8,227 people about their flight histories in a survey on the Internet in the Netherlands. They then asked 364 people (41% women), all between 20 and 49 years old, to report how frequently they drank alcohol at home or out and about outside of the skies -- during the past year.
"We found that a history of consuming more alcohol on flights was significantly associated with higher rates of alcohol consumption in daily life," said the study's co-author, Gerda Reuphorst, an assistant professor in the University of Kentucky Department of Psychology and head of research at the Center for Addiction Science.
"In other words, people who order more drinks on flights also drink more frequently outside of airplanes."
This finding was not unique to alcohol drinking, said Reuphorst, though it did occur most often in alcohol. The association between frequent flight drinkers and those who consume more alcohol off planes was strongest with beer or wine, but the same trend occurred for hard liquor as well.
And it didn't just depend on age: People of all ages were more likely to report drinking outside flights if they reported higher consumption on board. The link also held true even after researchers took into account other factors such as gender and income, according to the study.
The questionnaire used in this research is one that has been widely used around the world by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a division of the United Nations, Reuphorst said. Other studies have looked at drinking and smoking behavior on flights or their influence on behavior once off planes, but no one has looked at both sets of behaviors at the same time, she explained.
This study does not prove that people are more likely to consume alcohol in excess outside flights because they drink too much inside them, said Reuphorst, whose work focuses on the influence of environment and context on addiction. It's also possible that some other factor or characteristics make some individuals more likely to order alcoholic beverages on planes.
"However, we think it is plausible that people who are already heavy drinkers may use flights as an excuse for consuming even more," she said. "Since airplanes have a unique social environment with the combination of confinement and alcohol availability, they might facilitate high-risk behavior."
"If you do not limit your intake on planes, this could be one step in an overall drinking escalation, or it may also result from people already consuming more alcohol at home," she added. "In either case, airlines should try to provide a social environment that is less conducive to high-risk behavior and that allows passengers to consume moderate amounts of alcohol."
