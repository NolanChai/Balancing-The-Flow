's death, it has become the unlikely home to his family.
Mrs Whicker had lived on the island for 20 years with their daughter, Anna, when in 1989 Mr Whicker was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He and his wife decided to sell up and move into a small cottage near their daughter, who lives in the area with her two children.
'I always thought it was such an idyllic place for them,' says Mrs Whicker from her home in France. 'It is quite beautiful: I think Alan would have liked that.'
The couple had lived on the island since 1985, when they bought a small farmhouse near their daughter and son-in-law, who also live there with their children, Oliver and Rosie. But they wanted to be closer to Anna's family for when they got older. 'It was just one of those things,' she says.
In 1989 the couple decided to move into a cottage in the village, which was then renovated by local builders. Alan died on December 23 last year at his home near Brixham Harbour after suffering from Parkinson's for nearly 20 years. Anna remembers him as 'a very funny man'.
'He would sit down with us and be quite serious but, once he got up again, it was the same old jokes.' Mr Whicker's TV career spanned more than a quarter of a century. His series The Real World won an Emmy in 1972, followed by the equally popular Around the World In Eighty Days with Michael Palin in 1985.
He died at his home near Brixham Harbour after suffering from Parkinson's for nearly 20 years.
But before that he was best known for his TV series Whicker's World, which began in the early 1960s. In an interview with the BBC in 2004, Mr Whicker described how he had wanted to be a film star but ended up reporting around the world. 'I like meeting people and finding out what they think of things,' he said.
Mr Whicker, who was married four times, had no children of his own and when his daughter Anna's two children were born in 1984 and 1986 she asked her mother to adopt them so she could go back to work as a nurse. Mr Whicker then became a father at the age of 52 - despite not having any children with his fourth wife, Barbara Lowe.
'They were all in on it,' Mrs Whicker said. 'It was very funny: I think he was quite excited by the whole thing.' And that's how his family is described too. 'Alan was such a good friend and wonderful husband,' she added.
