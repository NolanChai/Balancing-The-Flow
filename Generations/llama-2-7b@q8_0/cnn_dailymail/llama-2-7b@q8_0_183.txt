The Democratic California congressman will be named this week as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, according to a senior Democratic leadership aide who did not want to be identified discussing sensitive committee appointments.
Rep. Andre Carson's appointment would mark the second time in four months that an American Muslim has been tapped for one of the most powerful committees on Capitol Hill and underscores how Islam is quickly becoming a force on Capitol Hill as a growing number of lawmakers with roots in the Muslim world are elected to Congress.
In fact, there could be two other members appointed soon who are Muslims -- Reps.-elect Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Rashidah Tlaib (D-Mich.).
But Carson's selection is likely to have more immediate political impact than the others as he joins Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, a Republican, in one of Congress' most exclusive committees, which overseas intelligence activities including those involving foreign spying and counterterrorism efforts.
Carson's appointment also comes just days after President-elect Barack Obama named the first Muslim member to his transition team as well as a top White House adviser who is likely to be an envoy for American Islamic relations if he is confirmed by the Senate. The president-elect's chief counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, John Brennan, is widely viewed in Washington as a Muslim friendly figure.
During his 20 years of service on the House intelligence panel, Rogers was known for being an aggressive critic of the FBI's use of national security letters to conduct warrantless searches into the private lives and business transactions of Americans suspected of terrorist links, including Muslim Americans. He also opposed the Bush administration's domestic surveillance program, which he said had been "grossly" misused to spy on innocent people in America.
Carson is viewed as a close ally of Rogers and other lawmakers who are concerned that the government has not done enough to protect civil liberties against abuse by intelligence agencies after 9/11. He will serve on the House Intelligence Committee's top secret subcommittee, which deals with foreign intelligence operations.
Carson would be a second Muslim-American serving in the U.S. Congress -- and the first lawmaker who is both African American and Muslim to hold federal office. The other member of Congress who is a Muslim was Republican Rep.-elect Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), whom Pelosi is expected to appoint to the House Financial Services Committee as she rearranges her caucus' leadership positions next week.
"We have an opportunity with this committee to put forward what we believe to be best practices in terms of homeland security," Carson said in a statement Tuesday, referring to his plans to use the intelligence panel to push for more civil liberties protections from abuses by U.S. authorities. He also said he was looking forward to working with "my good friend and colleague" Rogers.
But his selection will likely raise concerns among some conservative lawmakers who have been skeptical about Obama's efforts to improve relations between the government and American Muslims as well as fearful about the president-elect's pledge to close Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, if he is able to negotiate a transfer agreement for the terror suspects held there.
Sen.-elect Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that "it doesn't sound like this committee should have someone who has ties with the Muslim Brotherhood," an Egyptian group whose members say they want to see Islamic values spread throughout the world and which has been banned in some Arab nations for allegedly supporting terrorism.
The conservative senator-elect said he believed Carson's selection would "raise red flags" about whether Obama is serious about his promise to bring a change of tone to government relations with Muslim communities after years of mistrust and suspicion by the Bush administration, which has been criticized for using a heavy hand in fighting terrorism.
"I don't think it sends out a good signal," Paul told reporters after delivering his victory speech in Lexington on Tuesday night, calling Carson's appointment "another indication of how Obama is going to change our tone."
Carson has been criticized by some conservatives and liberals for accepting an award from the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) last week. CAIR was founded in 1994 after members broke away from the Muslim Brotherhood and describes itself as a civil rights organization working to promote "mutual understanding" between Muslims and other Americans.
In his remarks accepting the group's award, Carson defended its work in Washington but did not discuss the group's ties with the Egyptian group, which he said had been unfairly portrayed as being connected to terrorism. He also made no mention that CAIR has been implicated by the FBI for possible links to Hamas and other radical Islamic groups.
Several congressional Republicans have backed Obama's pick of Rashidah Tlaib, a Palestinian-American Muslim, to serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as Rep.-elect Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), whom Pelosi is expected to appoint to the Financial Services panel.
In his campaign for Congress, Carson had said that if elected, he would work with Republican leaders in the House to make sure that Obama "doesn't go too far" to improve relations between American Muslims and their government.
Obama's nominee to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom also has ties with CAIR, which the Bush administration has said is linked to Hamas and other radical Islamic groups.
Brennan was an adviser to CAIR in 1994 and 1995 but denies any involvement or association with the group since then. In a statement to The Washington Times, Brennan's lawyer denied that his client had ever supported terrorism. "Mr. Brennan has never advocated terrorism," said his attorney, Mike Jaffe of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr in Washington.
Brennan was a top official at the Central Intelligence Agency during the Bush administration but left last summer after he was criticized for his role as an adviser on Bush's secret program to use harsh interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects held abroad without charges or trials. The Obama transition team said in November that Brennan would be appointed "senior advisor" in the administration and was considering him for ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a position that has been vacant since 2005.
Carson's selection on the intelligence panel comes as Obama is poised to take office amid growing concerns over terrorist threats by Muslim extremists who are plotting attacks within the United States as well as abroad. The incoming president has been criticized by some conservatives for failing to speak out more forcefully against Islamic radicalism while he was running for president and some Republicans are calling on him to be tougher in his fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda.
Obama has called Muslim-Americans "the most trusted group" during the 2008 campaign, a comment that caused an uproar among many conservatives who believed the president-elect was showing favoritism toward Islamic communities in the United States. But Obama later apologized for his remark and said he had been trying to make clear that Muslims should not be discriminated against because of their religion.
The president-elect is also facing new criticism from some conservatives over his selection of Brennan, who has been viewed by many lawmakers on Capitol Hill as a strong advocate for civil liberties. In fact, one senator -- Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) -- recently asked the White House to clarify whether it had approved Brennan's nomination or not after news reports indicated that Obama was likely to nominate him.
"We will not confirm this appointment," said a senior congressional GOP aide who spoke on condition of anonymity, calling Brennan "an open supporter and apologist for terrorist groups." The aide said the Obama administration would be making "a huge mistake" if it nominated Brennan as envoy at large for international religious freedom.
In his campaign for Congress, Carson, a former Indiana state legislator who also served on the city council in Indianapolis and was a former police officer there before joining the U.S. Army Reserves, said he wanted to use his experience as an adviser to the FBI's Congressional Liaison Office to help improve relations between Muslim communities and their government.
Carson has also criticized the Bush administration for being too harsh in its fight against terrorism and warned that some Americans may not welcome Obama with open arms because of his connections to Muslim countries such as Indonesia, where he lived briefly when he was a boy, or Kenya, where his father was born.
"I think that many people are concerned about the new president's ability to deal with what they see as a Muslim world and whether or not there will be an unhealthy tilt," Carson said
