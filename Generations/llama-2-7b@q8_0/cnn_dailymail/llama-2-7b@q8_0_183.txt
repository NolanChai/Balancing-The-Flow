uting beta testers for a new low-power mode that it has been working on for some time.
“We have always made battery life a priority,” Apple stated in an email sent out to participants of its Beta Software Program. “But we’re always trying to find ways to extend battery life even further. The Low Power Mode beta will give you an extra hour or so of battery life when your iPhone needs it the most.”
To qualify for the program, Apple requires that you be running on a software version of iOS 8.4 beta and have access to iCloud. Once approved, testers must agree not to discuss any of its findings with outsiders until after the testing period ends. They are also asked to take note of how the phone reacted when placed in low-power mode during their normal daily activities.
Based on this information, Apple will be able to determine whether it is ready for release and if additional changes need to be made to ensure optimal performance. While no official date has been given yet for its eventual public release, beta testers can expect that the feature may arrive sometime later in 2015.
