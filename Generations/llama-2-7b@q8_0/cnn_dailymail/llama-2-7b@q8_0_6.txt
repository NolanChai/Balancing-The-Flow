aturdays trip to Tottenham, having seen him look a shadow of the player who scored 14 league goals last term. It has been reported that Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas could move for Walcott in January and Wenger admits he is concerned about his players form at international level. There were no takers on transfer deadline day but Im not worried as long as we know whats going to happen in the winter, said Wenger ahead of Saturdays lunchtime kick-off at White Hart Lane. Walcott was a shining light for England after his impressive performance against Brazil last month and he started both games against Spain and France this week. But Walcotts confidence has been dented by those performances as the 23-year-old has not scored in either game, failing to hit the target at all despite coming close on several occasions. I have spoken to Theo after each game and hes very disappointed about whats happening to him, said Wenger. He will come back next week and well have another talk with him. Im quite confident he knows what is going wrong. It was always my idea that if youre young enough you should play against Brazil in your first game. Thats why I picked him because I wanted him to build his confidence again, added the Arsenal manager, who insists there were no offers on transfer deadline day for Walcott or any of his other players. Im not worried as long as we know whats going to happen in the winter. The players are all staying here. I can tell you that at least. But theres nothing to worry about. Wenger revealed that Arsenal have no plans to sign a striker before the transfer window closes and he is happy with his current squad, who are still chasing Champions League qualification for next season. The Gunners have also lost out on a place in this year's competition after Chelsea beat Basle 1-0 at Stamford Bridge last night to move two points clear of them in the group stages. I feel we have enough quality, said Wenger. If you ask me now about transfers and players coming in I dont see any need. You can always be stronger but at this level its not that easy to find a player who is better than what you already have here so I am quite happy with the squad. The only way we could get into the Champions League is by winning our last two games and getting some help from other teams in the group, added Wenger, whose team have also lost 1-0 at home to Bayern Munich on Tuesday night and trail Chelsea and Napoli by a point with both sides still to play. Arsenal are currently third in Group F but must beat Spurs and hope for a defeat for one of the other two teams if they want to secure Champions League football next season. Wenger admitted that the situation has left his players demoralised. Our confidence isnt at its best, said the Frenchman. We have lost three out of five games now and that makes it more difficult but we believe in our ability. Its very disappointing not to get into the Champions League after being top of the group for 14 weeks. The only good news is weve been second in a very tough group all along and at this stage were still mathematically qualified. We need two wins. That sounds simple but its not that easy because you know what is waiting on us. We have to go into every game like that. Its a difficult situation for the players because their confidence has gone down slightly after Bayern, added Wenger. But I think they can cope with it and the first job tomorrow will be to recover from Monday nights defeat against Bayern. The Spurs match is very important as well of course but we have to go into every game in good shape so that our performance level doesnt drop. We lost three games now out of five, that is a bad sequence. I know what my players are capable of and Im sure theyll give their best tomorrow.
