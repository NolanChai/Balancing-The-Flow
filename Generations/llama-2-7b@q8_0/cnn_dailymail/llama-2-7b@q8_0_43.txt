 not often we get a glimpse into what really happens between the players, the coaches and management at cricket matches, but Pietersen has delivered an entertaining read from his point of view.
I can relate to this feeling of isolation that he describes, in some respects, as I’ve never felt more lonely in my life than when I was a professional footballer playing for Southport FC on the non-league scene and having been away at boarding school during all my formative years. It wasn’t so much not knowing any of the players that I was playing alongside who were local boys, but it felt as though they all knew each other already – and I didn’t really fit in with their football or lifestyles. I can only imagine how much harder this must be for Pietersen who grew up and played his early cricket in South Africa before moving to England at 13 years old and having to adjust to the culture, language and customs of English life – all while learning to play cricket professionally in a completely different environment.
He is honest about some of his batting technique and insecurities, which is refreshing as he’d clearly spent many hours analysing his performances with specialist coaches. The details of the mental training sessions are really interesting, such as the use of biofeedback, where the heart rate monitor strapped around his chest picks up his stress levels and sends signals to a computer screen that displays an image of a boat. He could then visualise himself steering this boat safely through some turbulent waters – while at the same time maintaining his calm focus on the task in hand. I’ve had my own experiences with biofeedback which worked well, but perhaps not for as long as Kevin made use of it!
What struck me most about the book was how he came across as an intelligent young man who felt misunderstood by many of those around him – including his cricket coaches and teammates. I don’t mean this in a bad way, but there is such a thing as too much information for some people. You can talk to them about the intricacies of your technique at great length and they will absorb it all; or you can tell them you have the highest batting average ever achieved by an England batsman and they’ll probably want to know if they can watch Match of the Day with you tonight. I was particularly interested in how he would communicate with his teammates at tea times, before matches – whether it be one to one or all together. I was impressed by the amount of time that Pietersen dedicated to preparing for each match and also the level of self-confidence and belief he had in his ability to achieve great things. He obviously has a strong sense of self worth and a desire to win, which is very positive.
The book gives an insight into the inner workings of an England cricket team, as well as the English Cricket Board itself – or at least, what goes on behind closed doors at Lord’s. I also learnt some useful information about how to get better as a cricketer myself: don’t have a beer before playing!
Overall it was a good read and I particularly enjoyed the part where he described his batting approach during his record-breaking innings of 206 against Australia in 2005. He describes how he has the technique to score runs and how he sets about doing this. For example, when facing a fast bowler (such as Glenn McGrath) – he’d look for the ball to come in at him sharply but on an outward line, so that it would pass just outside his leg stump, allowing him to pull the ball straight back down the pitch. He’d then get behind it and drive through cover for a four. This is really useful information which will help me to play shots correctly when I next bowl – and also if I should ever be at Lord’s watching England take on Australia in an international cricket match!
I don’t know how much truth there is in the book, but it certainly gives a fascinating insight into the world of professional sport and what goes on behind the scenes. I’d recommend you read this if you are a fan of Kevin Pietersen or if you’re interested in cricket as a whole – or even just have an interest in the inner workings of high performance teams, which is something that many people struggle with.
