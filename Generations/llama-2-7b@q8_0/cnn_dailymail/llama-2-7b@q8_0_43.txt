ation of business and cultural leaders on a four-day visit to meet with officials from the Cuban government, which last year made up more than $60 million in state exports and was the U.S.'s 4th largest trading partner.
The Cuomo delegation includes actor Robert De Niro, who has expressed interest in film projects on Cuba; the heads of Madison Square Garden and Major League Baseball; representatives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and several cultural institutions. The Governor said that he's interested in investing in agriculture on the island as part of his "Buy Local, Buy American" initiative.
While the Obama administration has relaxed trade and travel restrictions to Cuba , Congress still maintains an embargo against Cuba, and the President can only do so much on his own. For example, Cuomo was unable to hold talks with Cuban officials about freeing imprisoned U.S. contractor Alan Gross and other Americans detained by Havana .
Aside from Gross , Cuba currently holds 53 prisoners for political reasons, according to Amnesty International . Among them are 20 journalists and human rights defenders, six members of the Ladies in White opposition group, and five spouses of U.S. diplomats detained when they tried to flee Cuba aboard a raft .
Cuba has also been under scrutiny for its handling of human-rights activist Guillermo Farinas , who is on a hunger strike that began in July 2010 and has continued through more than 600 days. His wife, Elsa Morejon, says she hasn't seen her husband in almost a year, but the Cuban government claims to have visited him every week since January 2013.
In February, Obama announced that Cuba would be removed from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism , though Cuba still faces U.S. trade restrictions under the Trading With The Enemy Act and the Cuban Democracy Act .
The last time a governor went to Cuba was in 2009, when California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger toured the island with his wife Maria Shriver during a family trip .
