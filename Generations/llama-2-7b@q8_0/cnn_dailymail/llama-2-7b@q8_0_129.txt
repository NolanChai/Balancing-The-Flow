 found Eloise Robinson guilty on Friday of fatally shooting her husband, Clifford Robinson, 73, at his home near Sacramento last year.
Earlier this month, a jury convicted Robinson’s daughter, Sharon Lee Rhoades, who was also accused in the case and is awaiting sentencing. Rhoades told police that she and her mother had shot her stepfather after he fell to the floor unresponsive during an argument. But prosecutors contend Rhoades lied about what happened at their father’s home on Aug. 17, 2015, and accused Robinson of shooting him twice in the back of the head.
During her closing arguments Friday, Placer County Deputy District Attorney Robert Hemmings described the elderly couple as “a crime team,” according to the Sacramento Bee. He said Eloise Robinson was “the brains” and Rhoades was “the brawn.”

The couple had been married for less than three years when he died and she became a widow again. The Sacramento Bee reported that Eloise Robinson’s first husband was stabbed to death in 1956, when she was just 24 years old and Rhoades was an infant. She was convicted of second-degree murder but was later released on parole after serving seven years of a 15-year sentence.
“It’s my belief that Eloise Robinson is guilty of first degree murder,” Placer County District Attorney Brain Zahnd said during opening statements last week, according to CBS Sacramento. “The victim was shot twice in the back of his head.”
Robinson pleaded not guilty and maintained her innocence throughout the trial. She has been ordered to return to court on Nov. 21 for sentencing. Rhoades faces up to life in prison when she is formally sentenced later this year.
