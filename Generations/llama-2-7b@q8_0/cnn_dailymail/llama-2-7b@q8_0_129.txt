A California family whose son died on a secret mission to Afghanistan has joined a lawsuit against the Navy over its use of drones.
Lance Cpl. Nicholas Sprovtsoff’s parents, Linda and Jeff, want the military to end the practice of sending troops into combat without telling their families where they are going or why they have been sent on dangerous missions.
The couple is one of a dozen plaintiffs who sued the Navy on Thursday in federal court in San Diego over its use of unmanned drones in combat operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
‘We believe there needs to be accountability and transparency,’ Jeff Sprovtsoff said Friday at a news conference near San Diego, where he is retired from the Navy and his wife works as an environmental scientist.
They were joined by two other families whose sons died while on drones missions in Afghanistan: former New York Times reporter Chris Hedges and his son Danny, who was killed in 2005; and Joseph Rodriguez, whose son Juan, also a Navy SEAL, was shot down by the Taliban in 2009.
‘We want to know where they are, what they’re doing,’ Linda Sprovtsoff said, speaking for herself and her husband as well as two other families who joined their lawsuit on Friday.
Their suit is part of a class-action case filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which says that the Navy has violated its members’ First Amendment rights to free speech and association by preventing them from talking about or publicly protesting drone missions they have been ordered on.
It also claims the Navy illegally classified drone operations as ‘special operations,’ making it harder for families of those killed on drones to sue.
The suit, filed in San Diego federal court Thursday, says that the Navy has not only violated free speech and association rights but has done so to cover up war crimes committed by its drone operators, who have been implicated in the deaths of Afghan civilians.
Sprovtsoff said he was ‘shocked’ when his son’s commanding officer told him about a mission in which his son and other members of SEAL Team Six were ordered to fire on an Afghan compound in 2011, even though they knew no Taliban were inside.
The commander told Linda Sprovtsoff that her son was fired upon by Afghan soldiers after he landed at the base where he was supposed to pick up his team and bring them home. Her husband said he asked if anyone was killed on the mission, but he was never given an answer.
It wasn’t until two months later, when the Navy publicly announced that its SEAL Team Six commander, William McRaven, had died in a helicopter crash during a nighttime raid in Afghanistan, that his parents learned their son was among those killed.
‘I felt like I couldn’t trust anything that anyone said,’ Jeff Sprovtsoff said of the experience. ‘We are still seeking truth and justice.’
The lawsuit also names the U.S. Navy and CIA as defendants, saying they have violated constitutional rights by deploying drone warriors overseas. The Navy has not responded to the suit.

The lawsuit comes amid a debate over the growing use of drones in combat, particularly by the U.S., which has used them for targeted killings and surveillance missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and other countries.
Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall have raised concerns about drone operations and whether they violate federal privacy laws that prohibit domestic surveillance by warrantless searches of communications records.
Last month, the ACLU released an extensive report on the use of drones by the CIA, which it said had killed scores of people in countries including Yemen and Pakistan. The group says at least 160 civilians have been killed as a result of drone strikes since President Barack Obama took office five years ago.
The report found that the number of civilian casualties caused by U.S. drone strikes has risen in recent months and is up 57 percent from last year, when the CIA killed more people than the military did overseas for the first time ever.
Lawyer Rachel Meeropol, who represents the families on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said that the drone program is a ‘black hole,’ and that it is illegal to send troops into combat without telling them where they are going or why.
She also called the Navy’s use of drone pilots in Afghanistan an ‘unauthorized war’ and accused the military of engaging in ‘widespread violations of constitutional rights.’
Meanwhile, the group also announced that it is taking legal action against the U.S. government on behalf of a dozen other families whose relatives have died or been seriously injured during drone strikes.
