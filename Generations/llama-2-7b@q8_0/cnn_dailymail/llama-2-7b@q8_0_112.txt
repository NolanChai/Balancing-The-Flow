The group stage is over, and it’s as good a time as any to take a breather and reflect on what we have seen so far at the World Cup. 16 of the 32 teams that began in Brazil just over two weeks ago have already been eliminated, meaning that only eight will still be standing when play resumes following an extended break for most of next weekend.
There is a lot to process before then: Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo was injured against Ghana and won’t return in time for the quarterfinals; Germany and Belgium both needed extra time to win their respective Round-of-16 matches, while Argentina advanced despite Lionel Messi going scoreless through 90 minutes.
Naturally, we are all looking forward to Friday afternoon when Neymar and Brazil will begin another journey in pursuit of the one trophy missing from their collection, which would make them the first team ever to win a World Cup on home soil. The hosts are favored to advance to the semifinals, but will need more than just an advantageous draw if they are going to beat a tough Germany side that has already beaten them in this competition before (in 2014).
If Brazil and Germany advance past their quarterfinals matchup on Friday night then it would set up what could easily become one of the greatest semifinals ever. Both sides will have played five matches by then, including a Round-of-16 match against an opponent who was favored to win but didn’t: Argentina beat France in extra time; Germany defeated Sweden 2-0 despite conceding first half goals from two set pieces. The only problem with this scenario is that Brazil have already lost their best player, Ronaldo, which means they will need all hands on deck just to get past their next opponent if they want another shot at glory in the final game against either Germany or Spain who are both also looking forward towards reaching another semifinal after getting through their Round-of-16 matchups.
The World Cup is a fun time, and it’s hard not to appreciate what we have been able to witness so far. But there is no doubt that this tournament will be remembered for more than just its drama—the 2018 edition has already produced some of the best performances in recent memory. For now, let’s take a look at who has been performing well over these first four days:
– England: They were impressive against Belgium and should have won that match by two or three goals; they played well against Tunisia as well but couldn’t finish off the chance to advance after a missed penalty kick from Harry Kane. The only real problem I see with their game is how much they rely on set pieces—and not just corner kicks! They get most of their chances from crosses into the box, which means that if you can defend those well then you have shut down one of England’s best weapons (which makes sense because it was hard enough for them to score without crossing).
– Portugal: Cristiano Ronaldo got hurt against Ghana and won’t play again until after next weekend when they face Uruguay in Sao Paulo on June 30th. Even though he is out of action until then, this team still has plenty going for them; even if they lose one match (which isn’t likely) then they will still advance because they can beat both Russia and Spain who have each lost their first two matches at the tournament thus far…and possibly France too?! But let us not get ahead of ourselves here—this team doesn’t need any help from me.
– Uruguay: They have been solid defensively despite losing Luis Suarez early on in this World Cup; but what they really need now is for Edinson Cavani to start scoring again so that he can take some pressure off Diego Godin (who has also struggled lately). A win over Portugal would put them into the next round though it won’t be easy considering how poorly they played against Iran.
The 2018 FIFA World Cup is well underway and with more than half of the teams already eliminated, we look ahead to what lies in store for the remaining eight nations still vying for a spot in the quarterfinals.
Here are our predictions on who will make it past the Round-of-16 stage and which two teams will face off in an epic final match.
With the World Cup well underway, we’ve had some great matches already but there’s still plenty of football left to be played! Here are your predictions for how far each team will go at this year’s tournament:
France (1): I think France are going to win it all again after losing in 2014 when they were the favorites. The French have looked very good so far, but there are still some things that can go wrong with this squad if they don’t stay focused and play smart football against more talented opponents like Spain or Germany who also have a chance at winning it all!
Spain (2): I think Spain will make the final but lose on penalties because they haven’t been able to find their rhythm yet while playing against better teams such as France or Argentina who are both contenders for winning this year’s tournament after losing last time around when these countries played each other at Brazil 2014 where Germany beat both nations in separate matches before making it into the semis themselves!
Germany (3): I think Germany will lose their first match against France but win out from there until reaching semifinals where they’ll face Spain again whom they lost against last year at Brazil 2014 when both teams made it into those stages too! However, if anything happens with either side during quarterfinals then we could see another final between these two nations which would make sense since both countries have been dominating European football recently so there’s nothing stopping them from playing against each other again in 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.
Sweden (4): Sweden are my dark horses for winning this tournament because I think they have a better chance than anyone else right now despite being eliminated last year at Brazil 2014 when Argentina beat France who were favorites to win it all back then too! However, if anything happens with either side during quarterfinals then we could see another final between these two nations which would make sense since both countries have been dominating European football recently so there’s nothing stopping them from playing against each other again in 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.
Japan (5): Japan are my dark horses for winning this tournament because I think they have a better chance than anyone else right now despite being eliminated last year at Brazil 2014 when Argentina beat France who were favorites to win it all back then too! However, if anything happens with either side during quarterfinals then we could see another final between these two nations which would make sense since both countries have been dominating European football recently so there’s nothing stopping them from playing against each other again in 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.

Australia (7): Australia are my dark horses for winning this tournament because I think they have a better chance than anyone else right now despite being eliminated last year at Brazil 2014 when Argentina beat France who were favorites to win it all back then too! However, if anything happens with either side during quarterfinals then we could see another final between these two nations which would make sense since both countries have been dominating European football recently so there’s nothing stopping them from playing against each other again in 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.
Serbia (8): Serbia are my dark horses for winning this tournament because I think they have a better chance than anyone else right now despite being eliminated last year at Brazil 2014 when Argentina beat France who were favorites to win it all back then too!
