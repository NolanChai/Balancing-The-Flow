Hannah Campbell was serving with the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers on 28 December 2007 when she was blown up by a roadside bomb in Iraq. She lost one leg and her spleen, suffered severe damage to her womb and had shrapnel lodged in her brain.
The explosion came just four days before Hannah’s 26th birthday as she sat on the roof of an Army truck that was driving through Basra. She remembers how ‘everything went black’, then ‘waking up in a field hospital’ and seeing doctors working to save her life.
Hannah spent months undergoing rehabilitation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after losing her right leg below the knee. But it was not until she returned home to Glasgow that Hannah’s true suffering began when she developed severe PTSD. She was also diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition called antiphospholipid syndrome, which damages tissue in the body and can cause miscarriages.
Hannah married husband Jamie, 31, just five months after they met while he served with the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers in Iraq. Hannah, now 32, gave birth to Lexi-River at the end of last year and has been overwhelmed by her daughter’s happiness since then.

But behind the joy of celebrating Lexi-River’s first birthday, the former Army corporal is battling PTSD and now has just months left to live. Hannah was diagnosed as terminally ill in March 2014 after doctors found tumours on her heart that had spread to other parts of her body
She has spent two years being treated for severe depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts at the Military Rehabilitation Centre in Selly Oak, Birmingham. Hannah was also diagnosed as terminally ill in March 2014 after doctors found tumours on her heart that had spread to other parts of her body.
She has been told she will probably not live beyond three years, but remains defiant and is determined to beat the odds again by taking Lexi-River through puberty so that she can become a mother herself one day. Hannah said: ‘I was born with my own miracle baby and now I want to be there when she becomes a mum.’
Hannah was born in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, on 11 August 1982 – the same week that Princess Diana’s wedding took place. She grew up with an older sister, Eileen, and parents Jim and Janette Campbell. Her father had served in the British Army and her mother was a nurse at Alexandra Hospital, where she met her husband-to-be, Dr James McLean.
Hannah said: ‘My dad had served in the Army for 20 years and then my mum became a matron. My childhood home was full of doctors and nurses because I have always been surrounded by carers.’ Hannah went to St Patrick’s Primary School and then Cardross Secondary School before taking her Higher exams at Kilmardinny Academy in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire.

After leaving school, Hannah went to Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow to study primary education, specialising in Gaelic language teaching. She graduated in 2004 at the age of 21 and took a job teaching young children while she waited for the right time to join the Army.
She said: ‘My dad had told me he was joining the Territorial Army because I wanted to do something worthwhile. He served as an army engineer in Northern Ireland before becoming a teacher, and taught us all that we should always be helping other people.
‘I also knew I wanted to give my career a purpose so that I could feel like I was doing something with it.’ Hannah joined the Territorial Army after passing her medical tests at Glasgow’s Moorfield Hospital on 21 July 2005, aged 22, and spent six months in training.
She said: ‘I did my officer training to start with and then I learned all about explosive ordnance disposal. The most important thing is that you have a very calm head because it is often the smallest things that can go wrong when trying to diffuse an explosion.’

She was also trained as a platoon commander, meaning that if the regular forces were absent or wounded, she could take charge of any operation. Hannah said: ‘When I went on my first tour to Afghanistan I got so scared but I soon realised it’s not just about what you have seen – it’s about knowing how to react when things go wrong.’
Hannah served with the 619 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company in Afghanistan from November 2007, based at Camp Bastion. She said: ‘We had a platoon of seven vehicles and we were all in charge of different operations – if one vehicle went down, someone else would come to the rescue.’
On 28 December 2007, Hannah was driving with another soldier in her armoured truck when they hit a roadside bomb. She said: ‘We didn’t have any warning at all that there was an explosion ahead – I just remember thinking “everything is black” and then waking up in a field hospital.’
Hannah spent months undergoing rehabilitation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after losing her right leg below the knee. She said: ‘I got my prosthetic limb fitted in March 2008 but I couldn’t have it on for longer than 15 minutes because I kept getting blood clots in my calf.
‘Eventually, I went back to Glasgow and then was sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham where they carried out an amputation of the rest of my leg.’ Hannah (left) with her dad Jim at home in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire after she lost one leg below the knee
