, life is very different from that experienced by Western children, and entertainment can be hard to find.
In order to help address this need, a charity called The Citizens Foundation has been working with an amusement park operator named Ibrahim Khalil Khan to develop the "Kidz City" project in Lahore.
The aim of Kidz City is not only to provide entertainment for poor children living in Pakistan's slums, but also to give them access to education and help their parents gain employment so they can improve the lives of their families.
The project has been under way since 2003 when Ibrahim Khan donated 14 acres of land to TCF and set aside a plot for Kidz City, which features 25 different rides, such as carousels, Ferris wheels and roller coasters.
In order to make the theme park affordable, Ibrahim Khan has worked with his family members and other supporters to raise the money needed for its construction. So far they have collected around $10 million in donations from around 3,000 people who live in Pakistan as well as people living overseas.
Kidz City is more than just a theme park, though, it also provides children with a school and vocational training so that when they leave the attraction after spending time on its rides, they can return to their slum communities having learned new skills.
"The objective of this project is to help the kids who are living in slums because many slums don't have any recreation facilities," Ibrahim Khan told ABC News. "So our goal was to build a place where there would be all sorts of recreational facilities for these children."
According to the U.N., one-third of Pakistan's population lives in poverty and millions of young people are unable to access education, with around 60 percent not enrolled at schools. However, Kidz City is helping to change this by providing thousands of children from disadvantaged families with free education.
"We're trying to make them aware of what they can do in the future so that when they leave this facility and go back to their community, they can actually give something positive to those around them," Khan said. "So I think it's a great gift not only for these kids but also for the families living in the slums."
Khan's vision has been praised by many, with Muhammad Shafqat Masood telling BBC News that Kidz City is a "great initiative". He explained: "It's a wonderful place where they can come and spend their time. And this is very important because in our society there are lots of social issues we have to address. One of the most important ones is the problem of uneducated youth."
This year, Kidz City has been nominated for two awards: one from Pakistan's Federal Government Award for outstanding contribution to tourism and the other as "Best Leisure Facility" in the Pakistan Property Awards 2014. In 2013, it won the prestigious PATA Gold Award in the category of Best Community-Based Tourism Project.
"It's really a very special place because we have more than 100,000 visitors every month," Khan added. "And I think this is a great achievement for us and for our people."
In addition to providing entertainment for children living in poverty-stricken communities, Kidz City has also helped improve the lives of their parents by giving them access to training and work opportunities. As Khan explained: "It's really a wonderful experience because not only are we educating these kids but we are also empowering their families."
Khan is hoping that his project will set an example for others, with his ultimate goal being for Kidz City to become a global franchise so other countries can replicate what he has done. He added: "We want this to be the model of how people in Pakistan should treat the poor and the needy."
Pakistan's slum communities face many challenges, but Kidz City is helping to provide children with education and entertainment while also empowering their parents. It serves as a reminder that even small actions can have a significant impact on people's lives.
