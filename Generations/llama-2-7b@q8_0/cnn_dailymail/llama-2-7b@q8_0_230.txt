 24-16 in the first round of Premiership Cup matches.
“I think the whole ground’s been bouncing all day,” said Dai Young, the Wasps director of rugby. “We had some nerves early on, but to finish that well was good. I thought we showed great character as a team.”
There were few surprises at Adams Park; Bath are 14th in the table after losing their first two league matches, and the visitors started without five of their starters: the centre Anthony Watson is injured, the centre Ben Tapuai is on loan to Sale Sharks, the scrum-half Rhys Davies is also on loan, while Jack Wilson and Josh Bayliss are in the Six Nations squad.
“We knew that Bath were going to be without some of their more experienced players, so we had to take our chance,” said Young. “I thought we started the first half really well and we got into a good position. We just didn’t quite make it count.”
Young’s men had 20 minutes on top when they scored three tries before halftime; however Bath, led by Ben Spencer and the flanker Mark Wilson, fought their way back in the second half to reach level at 16-16. They then lost two players with yellow cards and were overwhelmed as Wasps regained control. The final try came from the centre Marcus Smith, who had just been replaced after a first-half injury.
Young was pleased by his team’s response to Bath’s resurgence: “I thought we handled ourselves really well,” he said. “We could have got flustered but we stuck to our game plan.”
His side were also grateful for the return of Will Rowlands, who had missed two games with a head injury. He came off the bench and scored a try in his 75th minute; Young was delighted by how he returned: “He’s been unlucky with injuries this year but I thought he looked good today.”
Bath coach Neal Hatley acknowledged that Wasps were more clinical on the day, especially when they went from scrummage in their 22 to score two tries.
“We made a few mistakes and missed some opportunities,” Hatley said. “At half time we had to be more efficient with what we’re trying to do. I thought our first-half performance was good but they scored three tries from penalties.”
