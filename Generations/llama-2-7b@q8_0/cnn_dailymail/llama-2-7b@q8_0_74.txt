A 64-year-old driver who was on his way home after finishing work has been found dead in an industrial accident in the East Midlands.
The man, named locally as Kevin Barber, had worked for 32 years at a factory in Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire and died of "multiple injuries" after being hit by a van during the early hours of this morning.
A source told The Telegraph that Mr Barber was found lying on the road by two members of the public who had been out walking their dogs.
"There were no signs of foul play but an investigation is under way," a spokesman for Leicestershire police said.
Leicester's Mercury reported that Mr Barber died after being hit by a white van as he made his way home from work.
Mr Barber, who had four children and six grandchildren, had worked at the factory since leaving school aged 16 in 1974.
In an obituary on Leicester's Mercury, his family said: "Kevin was a hard worker all his life. He loved playing football as well as being with his children and grandchildren. Kevin will be missed by the whole community."
