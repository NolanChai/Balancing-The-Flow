ites were also closed in response to fan anger.
The match was preceded by a minute’s applause before kick-off in memory of former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson who died on Thursday, aged 73, and the fans stood together for the tribute. The protest, though, had been planned long before the club announced Wilson’s death.
There were banners protesting against ticket prices around the ground and many fans held up a white card with the message “fair prices”. Some of the fans stayed away until half time with others staying only for the first 10 minutes but there was no repeat of the mass walkout at White Hart Lane last month when more than 40 per cent of supporters refused to attend.
An Arsenal statement said: “During today’s match a number of fans chose not to enter the stadium or leave shortly after kick-off, in protest at ticket prices. This decision was made before any announcement on our former player Bob Wilson.” Liverpool had their own fan demonstration, as part of an ongoing campaign against ticket pricing and also against ticket touting, which is scheduled for a debate in parliament this week.
Liverpool fans were joined by two members from the West Ham Supporters Trust (WHST), who are planning to organise a similar protest against their own club at Anfield next month. WHST chair Steve McNichol told Arsenal fans at today’s game: “Our hearts go out to you and we will be with you when our time comes. You can trust us because we have walked this road before.” Liverpool fans had also planned a protest against ticket prices before the club announced Bob Wilson’s death.
It is now likely that West Ham will face similar action by their own supporters as Arsenal fans are expected to follow their lead, especially if the result of today's game goes in Liverpool's favour and leaves them at the top of the league table with Arsenal only two points behind. The Emirates is one of the most expensive grounds to watch football in the country.
