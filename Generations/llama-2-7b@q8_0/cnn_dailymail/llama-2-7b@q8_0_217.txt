Diane Keaton today reiterated her support of her friend and longtime collaborator Woody Allen following allegations of abuse made earlier this year by his daughter Dylan Farrow.
Thirty-one years after the actress starred in the iconic film Annie Hall, she again featured on screen in Allen’s latest project, Irrational Man, released yesterday.

Farrow first made allegations of sexual abuse against her father when she was seven years old back in 1993. The claims were subsequently dismissed by the Connecticut Supreme Court, with a judge ruling that the child had “exaggerated” aspects of what took place and that he “failed to take advantage of an opportunity to establish his innocence”.
When asked about Farrow’s allegations at Cannes this year, Allen said: “I don’t want to hear it. I know nothing about it.” He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the past.
Following Farrow’s allegations earlier this year, Keaton released a statement on Facebook saying she would continue to work with the director.
Today, speaking at a press conference for Irrational Man in Los Angeles, Keaton reiterated her support: “I think that I will always be loyal and honest to Woody Allen and I will never let go of this relationship.”
In 1977, Farrow was awarded joint custody of the couple’s adopted son Moses over the protestations of Allen. She has long been vocal about her opinion on him, telling Vanity Fair that he “will be remembered as an abusive and lying man who mistreated his wife and family”.
Allen is married to Soon-Yi Previn (Farrow’s adopted daughter from a previous marriage). Farrow was reportedly unaware of this relationship until 1991.
Irrational Man, released on August 7 in the UK, sees Keaton play Abe Lucas, an emotionally detached philosophy professor who comes to an Ivy League college for a job interview and meets Jill (Emma Stone). They begin a flirtation that quickly becomes more than he bargained for when she takes a sudden interest in his teaching methods.
The film is co-written by Allen and directed by him, as well as starring Keaton alongside other big names like Stone and Joaquin Phoenix.
