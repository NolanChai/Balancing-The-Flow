An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board.
The pensioner, who was travelling in the business class cabin with her daughter and granddaughter, began to shout and scream at other passengers before throwing food around the plane.
Air Canada flight AC169 took off from Frankfurt airport at 7pm local time with just under 200 passengers on board but was forced to return after less than four hours in the air when a stewardess reported the disturbance, The Sun reports.
The woman was restrained by passengers and security staff before she was escorted off the plane while it remained at Shannon airport for seven hours overnight until 2am yesterday morning local time.
A police spokesman told the Irish Independent that garda√≠ are investigating whether to make a criminal complaint against the woman who was given emergency medical assistance on arrival in Ireland before being taken to University Hospital Limerick where her condition is unknown, according to reports.
