60-second look at what aliens might be like - by looking at how they grow and adapt in their environment. The team from Stony Brook University in New York studied how these creatures were able to live on surfaces coated with iron and sulphur. These chemicals are deadly for most creatures, but the 'shrimp' was found to have developed an adaptation that allows it to eat this poisonous mix by removing the harmful elements of it from its body through specialised glands. The findings suggest aliens would likely grow in a similar way to these shrimps and provide Nasa researchers with a glimpse into how they might evolve over time on other planets, or even moons, they said.
'This is probably the closest thing we have seen to what life will be like on an alien world,' said Dr Chris House, who led the study published in Science magazine. 'It's one of those things where you say - it's pretty wild how these guys are able to survive and thrive.'
Nasa scientists studied the behaviour of a species called Rimicaris exoculata, which lives near hydrothermal vents at depths of more than 2000 metres below the ocean surface. These geothermal vents spew out hot water that is teeming with bacteria and other organisms that thrive in the high-heat environment.
The Nasa team focused their study on the shrimps' ability to adapt to this environment and thrive by growing on chimneys made of sulphide minerals. These mineral formations act like chimneys, drawing water from the ocean to feed microbes in the vent, allowing them to grow.
As they crawled through this rocky area, they were able to suck up and eat tiny bits of iron that fell onto their bodies. In doing so, they are also exposed to poisonous sulphide minerals on these rock formations which can be fatal for most creatures. But by extracting the elements in a specialised gland within its body - called the malpighian tubule - it is able to survive this environment and grow.
The researchers say their discovery provides an insight into how aliens might evolve over time, as well as what they might look like when living on another world. 'Our study of these shrimps gives us a glimpse at how life may develop on other planets,' said Dr House. 'It could help us understand the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to complex organisms.'
This new information is likely to be of particular interest for Nasa scientists who are studying the possibility of finding alien lifeforms in the universe and what they might look like when discovered. The space agency has previously claimed there are billions of planets outside our own solar system, most of which could potentially harbour some form of extraterrestrial life.
It is thought that any aliens that are found by Nasa will likely be very different from us - because they would have evolved in such a different environment to our own. This study suggests these creatures may look similar to the shrimps studied, with a hard shell and tiny claws on their limbs. The researchers also said these aliens could have an exoskeleton that is resistant to damage from the hot temperatures found in other planets' atmospheres.
Nasa says it is important for them to learn as much about life on Earth before looking at how extraterrestrial organisms might develop - so this study provides valuable information about how they might grow and adapt over time, regardless of where they are found.
'This research gives us a better understanding of the process by which some animals can adapt and survive in environments that would be deadly to most others,' said Dr House. 'It helps us understand more about ourselves as well.'
