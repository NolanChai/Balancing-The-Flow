� even the goodwill � of a large section of our support had been stretched beyond breaking point, leaving a ragged trail in their wake that stretched to all four corners of Goodison Park.
One week earlier, a defeat at Chelsea and a draw against Wigan at home had seen Everton slip into the relegation zone for the first time since the beginning of the season, and they needed more than just three points from their next two games if they were to stand any chance of survival.
A draw against Stoke on Saturday would have been enough but instead we had to settle for a 2-0 defeat that left many pondering what happens now?
In the words of one poster, �the atmosphere has gone, the players don't want to play for us, our manager is useless and we can't score goals. I'm off!�
Of course, such a drastic reaction isn't in keeping with the character and tenacity that have defined Evertonians down the years but this is one of those times when it seems as if the whole world has gone mad and even the most loyal are having to question whether there is any point in going on.
Ten days later, a 4-2 win over Chelsea might be enough to change our minds completely but first we have to get past Sunderland tomorrow; then Arsenal next weekend, and it's not beyond the bounds of possibility that we could end up with the same number of points as we did in our last relegation battle.
But surely the difference will be that this time there is a huge amount riding on the outcome?
It should be a formality but it won't be, because of our history and our reputation for throwing games away.
I do hope I'm wrong � very much so in fact! But we have to be honest with ourselves. If we want to live in hope then we have to face up to the reality that this might just be another season when we struggle against relegation once more and have to fight like hell all the way until the final whistle.
It's time for our manager and players to stop dicking about with their excuses, time to start looking forward with confidence and a spring in the step that has been missing from this side ever since Moyes went off on one of his holidays and left us floundering until he returned in the depths of winter.
If our manager can't be bothered about it then maybe we should just sack him and see what happens � at least with a fresh pair of eyes at the helm there will no longer be any doubt who is responsible for this sorry mess, and it might also be possible to put the past behind us.
The players have to do better as well. If they don't want to play for Moyes then why are they still here? Some of them would surely jump at the chance of a move elsewhere and I think we all know who they are!
But in the meantime, it's down to us; the fans and the Board. It is up to you and me to make sure this club goes into next season with renewed hope and energy but if that doesn't happen then we will have no one else to blame for our demise except ourselves.
Evertonians are a resilient bunch of people who always find the silver lining in the darkest cloud, even when it is just a tiny glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. But if we carry on as we are there will be nothing but darkness and despair to follow.
The only question that remains is �what happens next?� The answer lies within our own hearts, because without it this club may have no heartbeat at all...
I've had an e-mail from a reader who claims to know the identity of one of the "fans" in the photo taken outside Goodison on Sunday night. If that is the case then I would like to extend my apologies to that person for naming them without permission and I shall endeavour to remove their name as soon as possible.
In the meantime, if you recognise the face in question please e-mail me at roger@rogerbarton.com.
