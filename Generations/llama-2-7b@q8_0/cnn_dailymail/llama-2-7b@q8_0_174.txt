heastern Telescope (ESO).
Researchers believe it could contain rocky material which may one day give rise to a 'super-Earth' - an exoplanet up to five times bigger than our planet. The exoplanet is almost 10 percent larger than Jupiter, and was spotted as part of the European Southern Observatory's HARPS (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) study of star formation in nearby young stellar associations.
The 'super-Earth' - named ESO 273-6 - has an estimated mass between seven and ten times that of Jupiter, which is the largest planet in our solar system. It is also one of the oldest planets yet discovered. Scientists believe it may contain large quantities of rocky material which could provide a suitable base for life to evolve on Earth.
"It's like an alien planet," said Francesco Pepe, lead author of the research paper. "The planet is so big that we can say with confidence that it contains more mass than Jupiter but less than ten times the mass of our Sun." The team said they were surprised to find the 'super-Earth' was so massive in such a young stellar association, which usually consists only of very low-mass stars.
They added that ESO 273-6 is likely to be an outlier - and there are probably smaller planets with lower mass in these systems. The planet orbits the star every 30 years at a distance of around 175 million miles, roughly four times the average distance between Jupiter and our Sun.
The HARPS team's new paper, which has been accepted by the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, will be published online next week. The research was also presented at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo, Japan last week.
