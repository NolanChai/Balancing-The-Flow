, was being targeted by classmates when she was 12 years old in the 2015/16 academic year and that officials at the school and local council ignored complaints of bullying.
According to a report from ITV News, the lawsuit also claims that Tianni’s mental health worsened and she was forced to leave school with her mother after experiencing severe anxiety. In 2017, Stratton filed an official complaint against the council but she says the authorities dismissed the allegations as “insignificant.”
Stratton is now seeking compensation for her daughter’s suffering and a public apology from officials at Nottingham City Council.

“It was a case where I felt like they didn’t care. They tried to tell me there wasn’t anything going on, and now we know there is a lot going on.”

In response to the allegations against her daughter’s school, Nottingham City Council said it could not comment due to “the ongoing nature” of the case.
“The safety, well-being and education of our children is of paramount importance and we take any concerns about bullying very seriously,” a spokeswoman added. “We always investigate complaints in line with the council’s policy.”
According to Stratton, her daughter Tianni had been diagnosed as autistic when she was 10 years old and was taking medication for her condition at school. She says that after being bullied by her classmates in October 2015, the council conducted an investigation into what happened but it found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the children involved.
In November 2016, Stratton filed a complaint against one particular student who had been abusive to her daughter and said he was “very rude” towards her during lessons as well as making remarks about her weight and appearance behind her back while she waited outside of classrooms.
In December 2016, Stratton sent another formal complaint regarding these issues but received no response from the council until March 2017 when it was informed by another parent that Tianni had been “punched in the face” on numerous occasions during lessons at school and that she had suffered bruising as a result.
The case against Nottingham City Council is ongoing but Stratton says her daughter has now recovered from PTSD following the bullying episode which lasted for two years before it was finally stopped by officials in 2017 when they were alerted to what had been happening behind closed doors during lessons at school.
“We believe that there were multiple occasions where our daughter was bullied and she was not supported,” said Stratton, who says her daughter has recovered from PTSD following the ordeal which lasted for two years before it was finally stopped by officials in 2017 when they were alerted to what had been happening behind closed doors during lessons at school.
