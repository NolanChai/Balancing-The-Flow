25-word message "We are not slaves" in large letters across their faces and chests before each game.
The players are members of Northwestern University's football team -- who will face Michigan on Oct. 10 at Soldier Field in Chicago -- along with those from Rutgers, whose coaches were fired last week, and Illinois State, which lost its conference opener to Illinois-Chicago earlier Saturday.
"We are not slaves," the players wrote on their faces. "We are human beings."
The three teams' student-athletes all took part in a similar demonstration during an April 13 practice session, but they did not publicize it or even inform team management of what they were planning to do.
"They asked us, 'Can we get a hold of your coach?' I said, 'I don't know,'" said Kevin Gordon, whose father is the head football trainer at Northwestern University and was one of the first players to reveal Saturday's plan publicly on Twitter. "We had no idea what it was going to be like. But as soon as we got out there on that practice field and I heard all these other guys talking, I said this is our moment."
The demonstration comes in light of last month's report from the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which found a "deeply troubling lack of attention to the well-being" of college athletes. In the wake of recent scandals involving NCAA-member universities and their football players, it recommended that Division I schools adopt the following four changes:
-- All scholarships should be guaranteed for all four years;
-- Athletic trainers should receive academic support services from student affairs, health care resources and access to tutoring programs;
-- Coaches who are hired after a certain date must disclose any previous violations of NCAA rules;
-- There should be an independent review board that will monitor athletes' well-being.
The Knight Commission report was the result of more than 40 interviews with current and former college football players, as well as parents of young people who play the sport at a Division I level. The NCAA has responded to the report by stating it supports most of its recommendations but not all. The commission's report also cited three high-profile incidents -- involving North Carolina, Rutgers and Penn State -- which resulted in "the death or severe injury" of football players.
The protest Saturday was first reported by Sports Illustrated.
When contacted Sunday morning, the NCAA released a statement that read: "Student-athletes have been playing sports for more than 100 years to enhance their lives and the lives of others in their communities through competition, education and other experiences they receive."
"The NCAA believes strongly that student-athlete wellness should always be at the forefront of our efforts on behalf of college athletes," it said. "We are proud of what we do for student-athletes, but we know that there is room to continue improving and will work with others in higher education and outside the NCAA to make sure that happens."
NCAA President Mark Emmert declined an interview request by CNN's Lisa Sylvester on Sunday morning.
The three schools whose student-athletes protested Saturday all responded in statements of their own about why they decided to participate in the demonstration and what it meant to them.
"I was proud that our players had the courage to stand up for themselves," Northwestern University head football coach Pat Fitzgerald said in a statement on the Wildcats' website. "But I am even more proud of their willingness to work together with other student-athletes throughout the country to bring about positive change."
"These young men have chosen to use their voice and platform to advocate for themselves," Fitzgerald said in a statement posted on Facebook. "It was important that they do so in an effort to improve the well-being of student athletes, particularly in regards to their health and academic support programs."
Illinois State University Athletic Director Larry Lyons, whose school lost its conference opener Saturday afternoon to Illinois-Chicago 38-24, released a statement that read: "The Illinois State football team is focused on the upcoming game against Youngstown State next week. While I respect our student athletes' right to express themselves, we will not be taking any action against those who participated in this activity."
"Our focus remains on educating our young men and preparing them for life after college," it said. "As a university, we take great pride in the fact that our football student athletes have a 100% graduation rate over the last five years -- with two of those players graduating this semester."
Rutgers University head football coach Kyle Flood did not comment on Saturday's demonstration.
"It is very difficult for us to do anything from our end, since we had nothing to do with it," Rutgers spokesman Greg Roberts told CNN Sunday morning. "But the players and coaches have been in touch this weekend about the situation. We are in touch with the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference."
Roberts said that Flood did not tell him about the planned protest prior to Saturday's games. "No, we didn't know about it until after the game," Roberts said. "Our players had nothing to do with this at all."
The Knight Commission report stated that Division I universities and colleges should provide financial support for football players, including providing guaranteed four-year scholarships; funding academic tutoring programs and counseling services for athletes who need help in the classroom; giving athletic trainers access to medical care so they can attend to injuries suffered during games and practices; and providing mental health professionals for student-athletes.
The commission's report cited three high-profile incidents -- involving North Carolina, Rutgers and Penn State -- which resulted in "the death or severe injury" of football players. In two of those cases, the tragedies were attributed to head injuries sustained on the playing field.
In 2010, a study by the Journal of American Medical Association found that college athletes had a higher rate of mild traumatic brain injuries than non-athletes. The report also showed that African-American football players had a higher rate of head impacts during games and practices compared to white football players.
In October 2010, the NCAA adopted an experimental rule that required a concussed player who shows signs of it while on the field must be removed from play immediately. If a second concussion occurs within one year, a student-athlete will not be allowed back in his sport until he has been cleared by a neurologist and other medical professionals.
In November 2013, North Carolina star defensive end Greg Hardy was convicted of assault on an ex-girlfriend after the two got into an argument at their home in June 2012, according to court documents. The woman told authorities that Hardy pushed her onto a couch and began punching her in the face and torso with his closed fists. She was hospitalized for broken ribs, bruised lungs, two black eyes and bumps on her forehead after the incident.
Hardy's case is currently awaiting a court hearing that will determine whether or not he will be required to serve jail time. He has also been suspended indefinitely by the university. The NCAA has stated it could still impose its own penalties on Hardy if it deems them necessary, according to ESPN's "Outside the Lines" program.
The commission report cited a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found college athletes were twice as likely to have poor mental health than non-athletes.
Last month, Penn State University suspended football coach Bill O'Brien after he was implicated in a child pornography investigation involving an ex-assistant at the school who had previously been fired from the same position for mishandling funds. The assistant, Jerry Sandusky, has pleaded not guilty to 52 counts of sexual abuse related to incidents involving eight boys over a span of 15 years.
Last week, Rutgers fired two football coaches -- Kyle Flood and head basketball coach Mike Rice -- after the New Jersey school released videos showing him berating players with anti-gay slurs during practices and in locker room meetings.
Rice was suspended by Rutgers for three games without pay last season for his treatment of players, which included shoving a player against lockers as well as grabbing the shoulders of another and throwing him to the ground.
The NCAA reportedly is also considering a rule change that would require all college athletes -- including football players at Division I schools who are currently receiving scholarships to play -- be guaranteed four-year renewable scholarships so they can stay in school for all four years without fear of losing their scholarship should the head coach or staff members be fired.
The commission also recommended that colleges hire independent monitors to oversee the treatment of student-athletes.
"If there is a problem, you have somebody independent who would say, 'This player's not getting enough tutoring,' " Rutgers football coach Kyle Flood told CNN's Lisa Sylvester in an
