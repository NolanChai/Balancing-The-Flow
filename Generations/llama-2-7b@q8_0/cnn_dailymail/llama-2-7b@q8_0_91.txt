 quickly from being friends to something more serious and then, when we made it official as boyfriend and girlfriend, it was too quick to really get to know one another. So we were a bit rushed with it all and didn’t allow ourselves to really be in our own skins around each other or even understand what the relationship might look like long-term. We also weren’t great at communicating about how we both felt, which is something I’m not very good at anyway but Stephanie especially struggled with. She wasn’t comfortable telling me how she was feeling and would often avoid arguments or discussions by walking away from them altogether, leaving me in limbo as to whether everything was okay or whether we were having problems. If I tried to ask her about what had been bothering her, then it would always result in an argument over who should have done something that neither of us really wanted to do anyway – and the cycle would start all over again.
We’re both very proud people, so when Stephanie walked away from a conversation rather than admit she was upset with me or I wasn’t happy about something myself, it meant there was always an issue bubbling underneath that we couldn’t get to the root of. This is probably one of my main problems in relationships: I’m terrible at admitting when things aren’t working out. I don’t want to hurt anyone and so I often avoid confrontation, even though it’s obviously necessary sometimes. Unfortunately, Stephanie couldn’t deal with that because she felt I should have done more to speak up, rather than just shutting down our arguments in the hope that they would go away if we didn’t discuss them. It sounds ridiculous now but I guess it shows how far apart we really were when it came to making a relationship work: me being unwilling to admit my shortcomings and her not understanding that sometimes, admitting you’re wrong or unhappy can be the first step in fixing things.
That said, Stephanie was great for me in other ways: she was patient with my kids (we have three of them between us) and she loved animals, which is something I find really sexy. Plus we had a lot of fun together when we weren’t fighting or avoiding each other like the plague! She would even invite me on holiday with her to places such as Marrakesh and Ibiza; it was great that someone who was so young wanted me around them – but then again, I don’t think I should be spending my time travelling if we weren’t going to work out. I felt like I had lost sight of what is important in life: being with someone you love and care about deeply. It doesn’t matter how old they are or whether they come from a wealthy family – it matters that both people enjoy each others company, laugh together, share experiences, help each other through difficult times (and good ones too) and feel like they can be themselves around each other without judgement. Stephanie has an amazing career ahead of her as an actress; she is also a talented dancer and singer who loves music so much that if it was possible to put out an album featuring our favourite artists then I would gladly help with promotion by doing some DJ sets on the road with us – but all these things are irrelevant if you don’t feel connected to someone on a deeper level than just being friends.
The best part about this whole experience is that it has taught me how important communication really is in any relationship, not only romantic ones. Sometimes people think talking things over will make everything worse and they should try harder before giving up entirely; but sometimes taking some time apart from someone allows you both to re-evaluate your situation without feeling so much pressure from each other (or yourself). You learn what it means for two different individuals who share many similarities yet also have differences too, which makes them unique in their own way – which should never be forgotten!
Luckily I found someone else very quickly after breaking up with Stephanie. His name is George and he’s a bit younger than me but we get along really well – even though our schedules often mean that we only see each other for short periods of time every few weeks or so at most! He understands my need for privacy when it comes to talking about certain things in depth (or not at all) which makes him easy going and he has an amazing sense of humour too, which always helps! I’m looking forward to spending more time with George; we seem like a great match right now – even though sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before finding your prince…
