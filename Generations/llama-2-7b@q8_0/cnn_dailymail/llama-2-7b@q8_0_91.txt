lickering light of an oil lamp in a small cottage while her grandfather toiled for 12 hours a day in a coal mine, reports dailyrecord .co.uk.
The grandmother, who died when Pat was only four years old, left behind three sons and one daughter after the death of her husband. In stark contrast, Pat’s own children and their families now live all over the world, including Australia, America and New Zealand. And she can be found enjoying herself dancing in a pub every Friday night, or taking a day trip to visit one of her grandchildren.
Pat said: “I think I’ve lived more than my two grandparents combined. My grandmother would sit there, with an oil lamp by the window and she had three boys and one girl who all went off to work in the coal mines and never came home.” The widow has always been a hard worker too. Her working life began at just 13-years-old when she became an apprentice hairdresser, while her daughter Tina Ingles, 46, worked on a factory floor for six years in her teens to help support the family.
Pat’s grandfather died from coal miners’ disease – silicosis – which is caused by breathing in too much dust when digging out rocks in underground mines. He also contracted pneumoconiosis, or black lung as it was called, but managed to keep going to work until he could no longer do so and died of a heart attack at the age of 42. Pat’s grandmother stayed on working for many years after that until she died at the age of 59 when her husband was still alive.
Pat said: “She lived a very long life and I think it was because of what she went through, having to go out there every day and look after seven people.” Pat was born in 1947 and grew up in Fife where her father was a railway worker who ran the local station at St Andrews. She married David Ingles, who worked as an engineer for British Rail, when she was 21-years-old. But they divorced after 10 years of marriage because he had an affair with another woman and left home without telling her where he was going.
She recalled: “He just left the house one day to go off and see a girl that I didn’t know anything about – not even her name.” They were living in Bathgate at the time but David later moved back there after they divorced, as did Pat. She now has five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, with three more on their way.
Pat said: “My children have all lived abroad for a long time but are coming home again and I think that’s fantastic.” Now she lives in her own two-bedroom house in the town of Currie, Edinburgh, which has been her home since 1972. It is situated near to the University of Edinburgh campus where she went on to work for more than 30 years as an administrator and a secretary.
