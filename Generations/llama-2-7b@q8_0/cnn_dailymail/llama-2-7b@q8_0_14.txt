The hip-hop star, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, was on the 29th floor of the Miramar Residences at 1701 S.E. 17th St., when he heard gunfire in the neighborhood and quickly drove his $548,000 car down a ramp onto an empty street below, according to police reports.
Ross struck a black Toyota Prius that was parked in front of the building, but no one was injured. The crash happened around 2:30 a.m., and police were notified about the accident soon afterward.
"A white Rolls Royce was heard by residents to 'blow off' from the upper floors with a loud bang, then struck the front of (the) Toyota," according to a Fort Lauderdale Police report obtained Tuesday by CNN affiliate WPLG-TV. "The driver left his vehicle and fled on foot."
Another man was arrested at the scene for allegedly trying to steal the car.
Fort Lauderdale police spokeswoman Cassie May said she could not confirm that Ross had been present when officers arrived. She did say, however, that a man who fit his description -- as described in news reports and in photos of the rapper -- was arrested on an outstanding warrant unrelated to Monday's incident.
The warrant is for "criminal mischief" from 2010, May said. The warrant, however, wasn't issued by Fort Lauderdale police but rather Miami-Dade Police Department, she said.
Police in South Florida declined to confirm whether Ross was in the car that struck the Prius -- or whether he was arrested on Monday morning after crashing his vehicle.
"We have no information regarding this case," May said.
Ross' management firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The rapper is best known for 2010 hit "B.M.F.," in which he describes himself as a "kingpin" and boasts of his business savvy, along with his ability to shoot a gun: "My daddy say, 'Don't get caught up in the game / But if you gotta be a gangsta, be a boss.' ... And if I ever had to leave the building, I don't do it on foot / 'Cause all my niggas ride with me."
