 the Conservatives announce new plans to increase take-home pay by £750 per household.
Cameron is expected to argue that a more prosperous nation with higher levels of wages, investment and growth can be achieved through a lower tax burden for working households. The Chancellor has also confirmed he will press ahead with plans to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 24% by April 2015 in order to encourage businesses to invest and create new jobs.
The Prime Minister is set to say: "Government waste and high taxation are immoral because they damage the country's long-term economic prospects, which is what makes Britain a better place for people today."
Cameron will also say that the Government should focus on rewards such as higher wages rather than spending public money to prop up lower living standards. He will argue: "The answer isn’t to keep wasting taxpayers’ money, it is to get the economy growing and make sure the fruits of growth are shared out by rewarding hard work with higher wages."
In his first major speech on the economy since he became Prime Minister in May 2010, Cameron will argue that public spending cuts can be made without damaging jobs or growth. He is expected to say: "It doesn’t mean taking an axe to public services and making people poorer; it means reforming them so we get better value for the taxpayers' money."
The Prime Minister will also argue that Government needs to be ‘lean, agile, and accountable to voters’. Cameron is expected to say: "I believe Britain can become an even more prosperous nation - with higher wages, investment and growth - by reducing the tax burden for working households."
George Osborne is due to set out plans later today that will ensure 14 million low-paid households receive a £750 tax cut as part of measures to increase take home pay. The Chancellor has also confirmed he will press ahead with plans to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 24% by April 2015 in order to encourage businesses to invest and create new jobs.
