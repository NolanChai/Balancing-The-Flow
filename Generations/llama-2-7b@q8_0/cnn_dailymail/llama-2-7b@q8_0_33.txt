100 percent ruled out foul play, they are ruling it out for now pending additional testing from the medical examiner's office, according to a report from Fox 10 Phoenix.
According to the report, Yuma police say Silas and Eli were playing on a walkway near an area of a canal that has been dried up by drought, when they fell into the canal around 6:45 p.m. last Thursday. According to witnesses, their father jumped in and was able to grab one baby but couldn't reach both. Eli died at the scene while his brother Silas succumbed to his injuries later at a Yuma hospital.
Both boys were wearing life jackets when they fell into the canal, according to Fox 10 Phoenix.
According to police, Eli had been missing since about 6 p.m. that evening and Eli was discovered in the canal by police around 7:15. While Eli was still alive at that time, he died on his way to a hospital. Silas was pulled from the canal approximately two hours after his brother and taken to a local hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries.
According to police spokesman Sgt. Derek Antonio, there is no evidence of foul play at this time and authorities will be treating it as an accidental death until they have additional information from the medical examiner's office.
