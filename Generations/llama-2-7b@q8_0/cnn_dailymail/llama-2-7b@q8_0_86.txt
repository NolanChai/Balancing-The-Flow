15-game tournament which will feature sides from Germany, France, Spain and Italy as well as a select few teams from Major League Soccer.
The two English clubs are likely to face each other in at least one of their matches but with games scheduled for cities including New York, Houston and Charlotte, fans of the pair will have an opportunity to watch both sides play across the country.
The tournament kicks off on July 20th and runs until August 5th, just over two weeks before the start of the Premier League campaign in England. While it is unclear if any of United's or Chelsea's games will be televised live, a number of matches will be streamed online via Facebook Live, with more details set to follow soon.
The pair have already taken part in preseason tournaments across Europe but they are yet to meet during the current season. That is set to change when Chelsea come up against United at Old Trafford in the Premier League on October 20th. The two sides have faced each other twice this year already, with Chelsea winning 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup and 1-0 at Wembley in the Community Shield final.
The full International Champions Cup schedule will be confirmed in due course but United's fixtures are as follows:
July 25th vs Celtic (New York)
July 29th vs Inter Milan (Chicago)
July 31st vs Man City (Ann Arbor)
