ctions for England and Wales, said she believed there was enough evidence against the peer to bring charges - but the case would be hindered because many of his accusers were dead or too scared to come forward. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We have always made it very clear that we would prosecute if we had sufficient evidence, and I think that is what we have in this case.'
"You can challenge us in court over the decision not to charge Lord Janner."
It would be a big mistake for any of them to do so. The courts are not about "rights". They are about justice. And they are only for people who have done something wrong - even if that means being convicted, sentenced and imprisoned - or even executed. This is why our courts can never be used as a place to pursue personal grievances - like getting revenge on your ex-wife, or making sure you don't go bankrupt - which is what our Human Rights Act has done since it was enacted in 1998.
Mrs Saunders said she had consulted the police, who advised her not to prosecute. She also said: 'It wouldn't be fair to put him on trial with his health and cognitive ability where it is now'. However, this was a very strange comment coming from someone whose job as DPP is to decide whether or not there is enough evidence of criminal offences to make the decision for prosecution. If she had already decided that the evidence did exist - and that it was strong enough to bring charges - then why did she need to consult the police in the first place? Why didn't they just go ahead with a case if the DPP had already decided there was sufficient evidence? And why, when deciding on whether or not to charge him with rape, indecent assault and buggery of children, has she decided that his poor health makes it 'unfair' to put him on trial at all?
We know from other cases brought by the CPS that, if there is enough evidence to charge a case in court, then the DPP will bring charges regardless of whether or not the person charged may die in custody. The Crown Prosecution Service does not wait for people accused of offences to die before it brings charges against them. It seems rather peculiar that Mrs Saunders should have taken such an unusual decision here - and she must be held accountable for doing so.
The DPP has said that she did not bring a prosecution because of 'public interest issues', but these were issues relating to the alleged victims, who all died or would have been too scared to give evidence in court if brought before it. This is not a public interest issue which has to be considered by her and it is not one which should be raised at all. It is simply not her business - any more than it is hers to decide whether the public want to hear an allegation against someone they know, or even the fact that someone has been charged with offences of a criminal nature. This is not a matter for her. It is a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities to make decisions about how best to protect the interests of victims by bringing charges which will result in a fair trial - and the prosecution of those who have committed serious crimes, regardless of whether or not it would be 'fair' if they died before being convicted.
The DPP has made her decision on what she considers to be 'public interest issues'. But we should ask ourselves what is in the public interest? The public interest - according to Mrs Saunders - appears to lie with Lord Janner and his victims who are now all dead or too scared to come forward. So perhaps they can sue her for negligence? After all, if she had charged him with rape, indecent assault and buggery of children then it may well be that he would not have died in custody. That is what I think should happen next - because there are some things more important than protecting the reputations of rich and famous people accused of serious crimes by bringing charges against them which will result in a fair trial regardless of whether or not they die in custody.
