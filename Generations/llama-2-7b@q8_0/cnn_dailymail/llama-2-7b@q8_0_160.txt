The woman who killed her sister’s beloved dog has been arrested after being on the run for more than a month.
Melissa Dohman, 49, was taken into custody Monday and is facing charges of second-degree animal cruelty in connection to the death of her sister’s dog.
The animal was found emaciated, starved and eaten away by maggots on October 6 inside a home she shared with Dohman at 4001 E. Sutherland Ave in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Kalamazoo County Animal Control officials found the 8-year old pit bull-terrier mix inside the home with no food, water or shelter.
The animal was taken to a veterinary clinic where she was euthanized after it became clear that she was too malnourished and had contracted MRSA.

Dohman was arrested on an outstanding warrant charging her with a parole violation after she failed to appear in court for an unrelated matter.
She was subsequently taken into custody and arraigned on a charge of second-degree animal cruelty, according to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Office.
It is unclear if Dohman has retained legal counsel or entered pleas at this time. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for December 17.
Dohman’s sister, Marcy Hewitt, 45, had filed an animal cruelty complaint against her but the prosecutor’s office declined to file charges on October 9 due to a lack of evidence.
The prosecutor’s office later agreed to allow Kalamazoo County Animal Control officials to continue investigating the case.

Dohman had initially surrendered the dog, named Daisy, to animal control after her sister filed an animal cruelty complaint against her but the prosecutor’s office declined to file charges on October 9 due to a lack of evidence. The prosecutor’s office later agreed to allow Kalamazoo County Animal Control officials to continue investigating the case.
Hewitt told authorities she was shocked when she saw Daisy last month after not having seen her since September, according to a probable cause affidavit. She said when she went inside the home she could smell the dog’s feces and urine.
She also said the dog had a raw open wound on its face. Hewitt told officials that she tried to give Daisy food and water but it refused to eat or drink, according to the affidavit.
Hewitt took the dog back with her to her home at 3504 E. Cedar Street in Kalamazoo County where veterinarians examined him and determined that he had a fractured jaw and teeth had been removed without anesthetic, according to the affidavit.
The dog also tested positive for MRSA, which is commonly known as staph bacteria that causes serious infections of the skin. It can be contracted through animal bites or scratches but can also infect humans through contaminated objects, surfaces and foods.
Hewitt said she was suspicious that her sister may have been involved with Daisy’s care but said there were no other witnesses to corroborate the allegations.

After the prosecutor’s office declined to file charges against Dohman on October 9, Kalamazoo County Animal Control officials took custody of Daisy and placed her at an unidentified veterinary clinic where she was treated for the infections.
However, by the time authorities returned to remove the dog from the clinic for further treatment at a foster home on October 15, it was too late. Veterinarians said they could not save her and euthanized the animal.
According to Michigan law, an animal owner can be charged with cruelty if their neglect or mistreatment of a pet leads to serious bodily injury or death. The charge is punishable by up to two years in jail and a fine of $100 to $500 for each violation.

Following the dog’s death, a representative of the humane society said: ‘It is beyond disheartening that an animal could be so neglected and not receive justice. We need to ensure this never happens again.’
