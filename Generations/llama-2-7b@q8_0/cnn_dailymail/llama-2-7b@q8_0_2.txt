 priest was warned off by his successor, it has been claimed.
A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest was warned off by his successor, it has been claimed. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York and now a member of Britain's highest court, was accused last night of trying to cover up evidence that Peter Ball had sexually abused young men while working in schools.
The allegations, revealed for the first time by The Sunday Times, were made in a report by retired judge Lord Nolan into how church leaders failed to punish Ball properly. In his report, published 17 years ago but never released, he said Hope had been told of Ball's crimes but had decided not to tell police or the bishop of Lewes where Ball was working at the time.
Instead, in an extraordinary move for a man of God, Hope "offered him counselling and spiritual direction". Nolan accused Hope of trying to prevent disclosure of information about Ball to police. He wrote: "I was told that Archbishop Hope had asked Bishop Bell to hold off from doing anything further until after he (Archbishop Hope) had visited Lewes to see what was going on.
"He did not want there to be any suggestion of collusion between the two bishops and so he requested that I did not write about it. "In spite of the seriousness of the offences committed, he considered the situation at Lewes more important." Ball eventually left Lewes with an official warning after it emerged he had admitted groping a schoolboy in the 1970s and that he had also been convicted for indecent assault in 1983.
A spokesman for Hope said last night: "Lord Nolan was not aware of all the facts or, indeed, of all those involved and his report was never made available to anyone who could have provided him with a fuller perspective." It emerged yesterday that Ball had been cautioned in 1982 by police over allegations he sexually assaulted boys but no action followed. He went on to become bishop of Lewes, in Sussex, where he abused at least seven young men.
Ball, now 73 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was jailed last year for two years after admitting indecently assaulting 18 teenagers while a member of the House of Lords. Ball is alleged to have committed more than 20 offences against boys aged between nine and 17 during his time as a teacher in schools and working for charities in East Grinstead, Sussex.
His victims were subjected to indecent assaults on at least three occasions and also oral sex, according to an internal inquiry conducted by Ball's diocese. It revealed that he admitted touching a 15-year-old boy after leading him through prayers while sitting in his car in East Grinstead.
Ball had previously denied any sexual activity with boys, but the report said: "He did not deny being alone and naked with male teenagers on at least three occasions." In a statement to police after Ball's conviction last year, one of his victims said that he was told by Ball that "God had made him this way and he couldn't help himself".
Ball is due to be sentenced next week.
