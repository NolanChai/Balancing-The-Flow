, 32, told CNN affiliate WABC-TV late Thursday night he wants to run for his local council seat on Long Island as a Republican.
The owner of the pickup truck in Times Square that was loaded with explosives and fireworks said Friday morning it will be auctioned off -- if it's ever found. "I'm sure my insurance company is going to have something to say about that," said George Pataki, who owns an auto salvage yard in upstate New York.
Investigators are trying to figure out the explosive device in the truck and why its driver, Faisal Shahzad, allegedly left it on 42nd Street for the bomb squad to find. "We do not have a timeline of how long it was parked there," New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said at an afternoon briefing about the investigation.
The NYPD has increased patrols in Times Square and other parts of the city, while also warning people to be on alert for anything suspicious.
Shahzad's arrest is "just the beginning" of a federal investigation into whether he worked with others or had outside help in his alleged plot, Kelly said. Federal prosecutors in New York have charged Shahzad with attempting to use weapons of mass destruction against people and property in an attempt to kill U.S. nationals.
On Thursday night, police removed the explosives from a parked vehicle on West 43rd Street as crowds gathered, snapping cell phone videos. The device had been left there, apparently unnoticed, until the vendor Jackson alerted police about it at 6:30 p.m., Kelly said.
The bomb squad found four propane tanks and "other items that are probably components of an explosive device," he said Thursday night.
Investigators are checking out whether Shahzad is connected to any other terror plots or whether the car was part of a larger operation, FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver told CNN late Thursday.
Shahzad is an American citizen who was born in Pakistan and lived most recently in Connecticut, Kelly said. The bomb squad found fireworks inside his SUV as well as the propane tanks, he added.
In recent weeks, federal authorities have arrested suspects on terrorism-related charges in Colorado, Arizona and Texas -- cases that involved alleged plots to bomb targets such as a Fort Hood Army base and synagogues.
But Shahzad's alleged plot is different. It was planned at a single location for an intended target that could have been anyone walking by. "It really is the worst of all worlds, because it can be anywhere," said Michael Leiter, director of the National Counterterrorism Center.
Kelly told reporters Thursday night that the police investigation is in its early stages and they don't yet know what Shahzad intended to do with the explosive device or if he had help.
"We really don't have an idea of motive at this point," Kelly said, adding that Shahzad is expected to make his initial appearance Friday morning before a federal judge in New York City.
The NYPD and FBI have been monitoring possible terror threats on Times Square ever since the city was struck by a homemade bomb last year in a failed attack. Police also are aware of other terror plots nationwide, such as alleged schemes to use pressure-cooker explosives to detonate at a synagogue in New York and an Army base in Texas, Leiter said.
FBI agents on Thursday questioned the driver's father, Shahzad's father-in-law and his father-in-law's son. "They all know about this," Kelly told CNN. "They have been cooperative."
Asked whether authorities believe there could be any more explosive devices, Kelly said: "We don't think so. We are confident that we have all the components of the device in place." But he added: "I'm not going to rule anything out until we actually apprehend him and find out exactly what it was."
Shahzad worked as a financial analyst for Merrill Lynch, according to his LinkedIn profile. He also had a degree from the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut and had served as an officer in Pakistan's armed forces from 2003 to 2007, his father-in-law said in Pakistan, according to CNN affiliates there.
Shahzad was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport after trying to leave the country on a Dubai-bound flight, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday night. He was identified as he tried to board his plane because of information provided by the CIA, two law enforcement officials told CNN's Jean Casarez.
Shahzad is married with four children and lived in Connecticut for about 10 years, U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor said at a news conference Thursday night. He was arrested on terrorism-related charges after he tried to leave the country, and no other arrests are expected, O'Connor said.
After being questioned by the FBI at JFK Airport, Shahzad admitted setting the car bomb in Times Square, Kelly said.
Police had surrounded the vehicle when the bomb squad began investigating it around 6 p.m., CNN affiliates reported. The street vendor and a number of onlookers told CNN they saw the police order everyone to get away from the car before detonation charges were used.
"When we walked up, we saw all the cops with their guns drawn," one witness told CNN affiliate WABC-TV. "They had us step back because there was a bomb in that truck."
Witnesses said police ordered everyone to stay away from the area while bomb squad experts checked out the truck. One of those witnesses, Jackson, is among those who filed a lawsuit against police on Thursday over their treatment during the arrest.
Jackson told WABC-TV he was terrified when he saw the cops with guns drawn and thought they were about to shoot him. "I didn't know if it was going to be me, or the person in the car," Jackson said.
New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the officers who confronted Shahzad could have shot him, but didn't because he appeared calm and was wearing no suicide vest.
The NYPD, which has stepped up security in Times Square since the bombing last year, increased patrols after Thursday night's incident, Kelly said. The department also alerted the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities.
"We are asking people to be cautious," Kelly said, adding that anyone with information is asked to contact local authorities or an FBI hotline. "People should call 911 if they have a specific piece of intelligence."
