 images showed the thick cloud cover spreading across China, Australia, and America as locals said they had never witnessed such a thing before.
The huge dust storms have been dubbed ‘yellow sand’ in some areas after the yellowish tone given to the skies above them. The biggest dust clouds this year have been seen over China with images showing the Beijing skyline disappearing into nothingness as the thick dust blankets everything it comes near.
The storms are so big they can even be picked up from space and NASA recently released an image of a massive dust cloud that covered more than 70 percent of China on April 6.
Amazingly, there is also evidence to show that these yellow sand storms have been happening since the late 1800s, according to a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Scientists from NASA and other organisations studied dust particles and found that they had grown bigger over time, meaning it was less likely that the huge cloud of dust would disperse.
They also discovered that these dust storms were becoming larger every year with some covering more than 2 million square kilometres of land in a single day – that’s almost three times the size of Germany!
Researchers believe that this could be down to deforestation and other agricultural activities, which are causing large quantities of dust to be released into the air.
