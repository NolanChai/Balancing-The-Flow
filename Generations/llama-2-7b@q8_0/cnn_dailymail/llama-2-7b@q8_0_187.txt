 But his two-year-old daughter wouldn't let him, even after he offered her money and promises of candy.
So what did this Danish father do? He picked up his daughter, threw her into the air over his head -- and dropped her on her head, according to a police report in Odense, Denmark.
"I was simply tired of arguing with my 2-year-old," Kragh told CNN affiliate TV 2 Lorry's TV Avisen. "I tried everything I could think of -- money, sweets and ice cream. Everything."
When the child wouldn't give up her coat, the father said he put her down gently and offered to buy her a new one for a little more than $10. But that didn't do it either.
"I picked her up again, put her in my arms and then I lifted her over my head and dropped her on top of her head," Kragh told TV 2 Lorry's TV Avisen. "It was a pretty high drop."
Kragh's story made the news in Denmark last week after he filed a police report. Now, police are investigating whether he should be charged with violating his daughter's privacy or endangering her life, according to TV 2 Lorry's TV Avisen.
"It is a very difficult situation," said Pernille Hansen of the Odense Police Department. "We do not know what happened between them beforehand."
Hansen told CNN that Kragh did not appear to be intoxicated at the time, and that he was being investigated. She declined to give more details, citing Danish privacy laws.
But Kragh's story is not over yet: TV 2 Lorry reports he has received thousands of angry e-mails from parents and caregivers around Denmark. And now, it appears that other fathers -- or at least their children -- may have a little advice for him.
In a video posted on YouTube and titled "How to be an awesome Dad," a father tosses his 10-year-old daughter up in the air as he bounces her off his belly, and then catching her with his back turned. The clip has already been viewed more than 279,000 times.
