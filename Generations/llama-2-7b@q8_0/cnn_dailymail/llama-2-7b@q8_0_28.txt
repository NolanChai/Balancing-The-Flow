unt and agent on the day Louis van Gaal was confirmed as Louis Van Gaal’s replacement at Old Trafford. The Dutchman is expected to be in charge by the time Memphis arrives for talks.
Depay has been linked with several clubs across Europe, including Real Madrid who are understood to have had an £8million offer rejected by PSV. Arsenal and Juventus also reportedly hold an interest in the Netherlands international.
Reports from Spain suggested Barcelona were ready to make a move for Depay after Neymar’s move to PSG, however that deal fell through with the Catalan club agreeing a deal for Luis Suarez instead. Van Gaal has made it clear he wants at least three new signings and Depay is one of the players on his shortlist.
It was reported earlier this week that Depay had a £25m release clause in his contract, although PSV are thought to be demanding much more than that as they look to cash in on their star player after only two years at Eindhoven.
