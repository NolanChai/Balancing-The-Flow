 put pressure on his windpipe while talking about what he allegedly did to Patz 35 years ago.
The video was played at Hernandez's court hearing today in New York as prosecutors sought permission for him to be held without bail pending trial. The confession was part of a taped interview with detectives who had spent several hours questioning the ex-bus boy. In it he described how he lured Patz into his shop on May 25, 1979 and strangled him before dumping his body in a box which was then thrown out onto a New York rubbish tip. The prosecutor said Hernandez's confession came after two days of questioning by police investigators in Pennsylvania who were unaware the boy had been missing for almost three years until they discovered evidence on the internet.
Hernandez, 51, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if he is convicted on charges that include murder and kidnap. But his lawyers say he has a mental age of 12 and cannot be held criminally responsible for what he allegedly did to Etan Patz.
The judge denied the prosecutor's request for bail pending trial, saying: 'In this case I find that there is no conditions in place that would ensure the defendant's appearance.' Hernandez will remain behind bars until a hearing on Wednesday when his lawyers are expected to argue he should be released because of concerns about his health.
His mother, Rosie Patz, said she was 'shocked and very upset' by her son's death but praised the police for arresting Hernandez. She added: 'I pray that this nightmare is over.' Etan disappeared as he walked to a school bus stop in New York on May 25, 1979 - the day his parents left him home alone while they went out shopping.
