The Labour Party's election manifesto will be published on April 26, three weeks before polling day, in a bid to win over voters who are undecided.

David Cameron has warned that Scotland faces economic catastrophe unless it remains part of the United Kingdom after the General Election - but insisted he is not campaigning against independence.
The Prime Minister said he wants to "sell Scotland" as a great place in which to live and do business, but admitted there will be "bumps along the way".
As he set out his stall at his election launch at a factory near Glasgow on Tuesday, Mr Cameron was also forced into an extraordinary clarification of comments made by William Hague yesterday.
The Foreign Secretary said that if Scotland votes to leave the Union then it could face being "kicked out" of NATO and the EU, as well as losing its currency - the pound.
His remarks prompted fury among nationalist supporters who claimed they amounted to blackmail, but Mr Cameron insisted he was not against Scotland becoming independent if that is what it wants.
But he warned that separation would lead to an economic crisis and urged voters to back the Conservatives on May 7 because "I want Scotland to succeed".
"The truth is that we're all better off in the United Kingdom," Mr Cameron said.
"We are better off in the UK together, sharing resources and opportunities, working as one, taking a common approach to some of our biggest challenges - like the eurozone crisis or climate change."
Mr Cameron said the only way for Scotland to succeed is by voting no on May 7. He warned that Scottish National Party plans to cut spending on defence will have serious consequences.
"The SNP government's plans could cost £40 billion of defence expenditure and thousands of jobs, putting our country at greater risk," he said.
"And the truth is they don't want Scotland to succeed, because their whole plan depends on getting rid of Trident, which will leave us more exposed to nuclear threats."
In a speech that lasted 45 minutes longer than his original script, Mr Cameron warned against those who claim that independence would bring instant prosperity.
"The Scottish people are not interested in a pipe-dream of instant success," he said. "They know that they have to stick with something which has delivered real and lasting progress.
"And there will be bumps along the way, but together we're better off than apart."
Mr Cameron admitted that Scotland could face economic difficulties in the short term if it votes for separation. "Scotland is better off together," he said, "but that doesn't mean there won't be some bumps along the road on our way to success. And we have an obligation to make sure those bumps don't turn into potholes."
Mr Cameron insisted that Scots can rely on the Conservatives to stand up for their interests in the next Parliament, and warned Scottish nationalists they are "not the only voice for Scotland" if they win a majority of seats north of the border.
He said: "If we win here, there will be a government with a mandate from across Scotland, not just Edinburgh, or Glasgow, but right around our country."
Mr Cameron promised that if elected to power he would ensure Scotland was given powers on welfare and taxation - which are currently controlled by Whitehall. He insisted the decision on whether Scotland stays in the European Union rests with a referendum on EU membership held after an election north of the border.
But Mr Cameron's claims were contradicted by William Hague yesterday, who warned that if Scotland voted to leave the UK it would lose its pound and be "kicked out" of NATO and the European Union, as well as facing a loss of defence funding because Trident submarines are based in Faslane.
The Prime Minister was forced to insist he is not trying to stop Scotland becoming independent if that is what they want - despite Mr Hague's remarks.
"I am not against Scottish independence," Mr Cameron said. "What I'm against, and this is where people get a little confused about the issue of Scottish independence, what I'm against is the SNP's plan for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom with no credible plan for success."
He also warned that Scotland faces an economic crisis if it votes to separate from the rest of the UK. He said: "There are some very real bumps along the road and we should be honest about this. We need to make sure we don't go down the wrong path with independence, because once you've done that there is no way back."
Mr Cameron told voters: "It's a decision for you whether Scotland chooses to stay together or to break away from us. And it's a decision we can only take when we know exactly what's being asked of us and the consequences that will follow."
He said: "People in Scotland want the best for their country - they just don't think independence is the answer. They see Scottish Labour as too cosy with London, and Scottish Nationalists as not ready to make the hard decisions on our economy or education system, and I don't blame them."
Mr Cameron said he would like Scotland to stay in the UK but admitted that if it does not, England must be prepared for a constitutional crisis.
He said: "I'm not saying there is an imminent threat of break up, because I don't think so. But we need to make sure we are ready should this happen. So I want a debate in England about what will come next."
In his speech, Mr Cameron also launched the Tory manifesto, which will be unveiled at their conference on Monday and promises lower taxes for hard-working families. The Prime Minister said the Coalition's cuts had been vindicated by the "green shoots of recovery" in Britain but added: "There are still tough choices to come.
"There will be difficult decisions that will test our mettle."
The manifesto pledge to lower taxes is likely to be a response to Labour's promise of an increase for those earning more than £150,000. Mr Cameron said: "We believe you should keep the money you work so hard to earn - not give it to others who don't deserve it."
He added that the Conservatives would take 30 hours a week of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds as a "right" for all children. He said: "I know this won't be right for everyone but it will provide greater flexibility, choice and security for working parents - which is why we are going to make it a legal right."
The Prime Minister also claimed the Conservatives are "the only party with the will and determination" to reduce net migration by the tens of thousands. He said: "We need immigration that works for Britain, not against us."
