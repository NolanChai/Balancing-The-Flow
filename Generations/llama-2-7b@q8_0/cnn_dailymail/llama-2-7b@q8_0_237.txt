The club has now ceased trading and Lonsdale will pay back the money that fans paid for season tickets. The chairman of Hereford FC supporters’ trust, John Nixon, said: “We feel that a large number of our members were misled by the previous chairman about what was going on at the club.
“Some of them have lost out financially in terms of their season ticket payments and we hope that they will get some financial compensation.” The National League has confirmed it will not accept an application to be re-admitted this term, but Hereford could make an application for next season’s campaign.
