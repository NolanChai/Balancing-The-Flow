olen a few headlines too.
One such detail was the couple’s decision to include a hand-written sign made by Prince William’s mother, Princess Diana, and sent as a gift to Kate Middleton as part of her wedding bouquet. The piece read: ‘To my dearest friend, I just wanted to let you know how very much I love you. To have you in my life means everything to me.’
And another detail which caught our eye was the unusual choice of decorative items on display at Buckingham Palace for their post-nuptials reception.

As we reported back in November 2013, the couple opted for an unusual choice of decorative items that were displayed around the reception. While the couple’s wedding cake was topped with a traditional sugar paste and icing design, the table centrepieces consisted of silver vases holding white roses, as well as tiers of gilded candles.
According to The Sun newspaper, the candle decor was inspired by the Queen Mother’s wedding in 1923. These included glass holders with two tapering candles either side of a small pink rose bud on each, arranged in threes and placed on tables with white roses.

The royal wedding cake also had a very traditional look, featuring two tiered white icing and sugar paste layers with ribbon and lace detail. It was decorated with 17 piped buttercream roses and adorned by The Crown Estate's crest on top of the bride and groom's initials 'W & K'.
A closer look at the cake reveals that it was actually three tiers high, in fact. It featured a tier with white icing covered with sugar paste roses and buttercream, followed by two smaller layers of buttercream iced with sugar paste roses on top.
