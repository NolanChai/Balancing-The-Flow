't worked out quite as well as they could have hoped.
This season has been particularly tough on Soldado - and not just because of his poor form in front of goal. Last weekend he was dropped to the bench after scoring a paltry four goals from 29 appearances, but even more worrying is the abuse that comes with being Tottenham's No.9.
Soldado has had a brick thrown at him as well as being subjected to racist chants by fans and pelted with coins during matches - but his teammates insist it isn't having an effect on him.
Midfielder Nabil Bentaleb revealed: 'You have to be very strong mentally when you are a striker at Tottenham,' while midfielder Andros Townsend said: 'He is doing what he can do. It's not easy being a striker, scoring goals all the time.'
Given that Tottenham aren't exactly setting the Premier League alight either this season then it's probably wise for Soldado to try and keep his head down as much as possible - which is why there will be no trip to the North Pole in the near future.
Soldado was one of five players who flew out to Norway at the start of December for a pre-Christmas training camp, but according to The Sun he didn't join them because he was recovering from injury. Instead he's been keeping himself fit back in England and will continue his rehabilitation with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham look to end a run of two defeats in their last three games against Hull at White Hart Lane on Monday evening.
Tottenham have won six times this season from 17 games - a tally that puts them third-bottom in the Premier League table but one which is also worse than that of Stoke (5) and Aston Villa (6).
