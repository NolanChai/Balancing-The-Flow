 man who was blamed for her downfall last year after his involvement in her legal issues led to a restraining order.
Amanda’s lawyer Tamar Arminak confirmed in court today that the actress is being held at West Hills Hospital under California Welfare and Institutions Code 5150, which states she was placed there on an emergency psychiatric hold because of her own actions. Amanda has allegedly been ‘aggressive with staff’ who were attempting to help her during a welfare check after she failed to appear for a court hearing where she was charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana.
Her lawyer said in court that Amanda had refused medication at home, so hospital staff believed it would be safer for her there. After the court case, TMZ reports that Amanda’s mother Lynn Bynes, 61, told the site she was ‘shocked’ and ‘completely dumbfounded’ by the news of her daughter being placed under psychiatric hold.
‘I am shocked to hear this. I don’t know what happened,’ said Lynn. The actress was arrested on April 6, following reports that she had allegedly started a fire outside a house in Thousand Oaks and caused a crash by driving the wrong way down a one-way street in San Fernando Valley, before trying to hit an officer with her car.
She then made it to court where she was charged for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and possession of marijuana. The charges come just days after Amanda’s lawyer announced she had checked herself into rehab to try to get clean from alcohol and other addictions, but Amanda is yet to be seen there and it is unknown whether she has actually been admitted.
In the past few months Amanda has had a number of run-ins with police after getting caught driving under the influence. In March she was charged with two counts of hit and run, for allegedly fleeing the scene of a car accident where she struck a sheriff’s patrol vehicle, while driving under the influence on February 5.
The star had previously spent more than four days in rehab after being arrested for DUI on March 1, when police said they found marijuana on her in her car at the time. She was also charged with reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence after she allegedly attempted to burn down a drive-through in Thousand Oaks last month, which caused a fire and a crash.
Amanda had been due to appear in court again on April 17 for the DUI charges, but has now missed that date after she was placed under psychiatric hold today. Her lawyer Tamar Arminak is continuing with her legal work for Amanda while she’s away and claims the actress has checked herself into a rehab facility to get clean.
The troubled starlet had previously spent 14 days in a residential treatment centre last August, after being released from a psychiatric hold at UCLA Medical Centre. She was taken there after her bizarre series of driving offences and arrests left many concerned for her wellbeing. Amanda is now expected to appear before a judge on Friday afternoon (April 18), where she will face the DUI charges.
