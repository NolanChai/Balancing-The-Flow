ucks star and fellow Canadian Marie-France Ouellet, who was not charged in the arrest.
Stoll was picked up around 1 a.m. Friday after an anonymous call to police said there was "a suspicious person" outside their home on Paradise Road near Desert Inn Road, according to LVRJ.com. According to KTLA, Stoll's friends and family were inside the house at the time of his arrest.
The Kings released a statement following Stoll's arrest:
Stoll, 32, who is in his ninth NHL season, was taken into custody after police found marijuana inside the car he had been driving, according to KTLA. He faces two counts of possession with intent to sell or distribute a controlled substance. The charges are both misdemeanors and Stoll posted $20,000 bond on Friday afternoon, according to TMZ.
Stoll was arrested in 2013 for DUI outside a Las Vegas restaurant where he had been dining with Ouellet. He pleaded no contest to the charge and served three days of community service. The incident happened weeks after Stoll's older brother, Matthew, died by suicide on Nov. 7 in Calgary.
Jarret Stoll has not played since sustaining a concussion against Dallas on Oct. 24. He has seven points (three goals, four assists) in nine games this season for the Kings, who are off to their best start in franchise history at 16–3—2.
