 of the Class A drug during his time with West Yorkshire Police's Target Team and developed a habit. He said: 'I had to get my own supply and I started buying from dealers.' The officer admitted using heroin between 2013 and last month, when he was finally caught by police colleagues after they saw him injecting the drug in the street.  'I've been addicted for five years now,' he told a court in York. 'It wasn’t until I got to prison that I realised just how serious my problem is.' Carroll admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply but was spared jail when sentenced at York Crown Court on Tuesday. He will instead be subjected to a two-year community order, which includes mandatory treatment and a drug test.  Prosecutor Ben Nuttall told the court: 'The defendant's habit was well known among his colleagues and there were concerns that he was selling drugs while undercover.' Mr Carroll, who was a constable, was warned by officers to stop but he ignored them and continued. His behaviour was finally exposed when members of the public spotted him injecting heroin in Huddersfield town centre on October 16 last year. The court heard that he admitted taking heroin while posing as an addict in a bid to uncover drug traffickers, but said he had never sold the Class A drug.  During sentencing, Carroll told Judge Jonathan Rose: 'I don't feel like I’m an addict. It wasn’t me that started it all. I have become hooked on drugs and I want help.' He has now been transferred to West Yorkshire Police's neighbourhood team but was allowed to keep his job, as the force does not believe he is a risk of reoffending.
