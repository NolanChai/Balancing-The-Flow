The new legislation will not apply to all cases where evidence is given by a victim who was under 17 at the time.
Four hundred victims are expected to be affected each year, but ministers said there were fears that giving child witnesses full legal aid would deter them from reporting abuse in future. The Ministry of Justice said there had been "substantial concerns" about the way children gave evidence in criminal cases and this was "a very positive development".
It added: "This legislation will ensure that young people who are victims, witnesses or defendants in sexual violence trials have a fair hearing." The Children Act 1989 already makes it clear that children under the age of 10 cannot be called to give evidence.
Victim's lawyer: 'Protecting child witnesses is a no-brainer'
But the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which has been drawn up by Ken Clarke, will extend this protection to all children under 17.
The legislation was backed unanimously in the Lords last night after Labour raised concerns that vulnerable witnesses could be left with "no voice" because of legal aid cuts. Baroness Burt said: "I am sure we would have heard much more about this issue if it had not been for the campaign by the Centre for Women's Justice."
The Bill also introduces measures to end automatic early release for prisoners who are serving sentences for domestic violence, sexual offences and child cruelty. There will now be a presumption that all such prisoners should serve two thirds of their sentence before being considered for parole.
Last year 489 men were released from prison after serving half their sentences, while 275 women convicted of the same crimes were given automatic release.
