Ross and Rory McGrath are self-confessed 'naval nerds' who were keen to learn about the history of the Royal Navy from a real war hero.
They contacted the Royal British Legion (RBL) in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, which arranged for them to visit Mr Harding at his home in the town last month. The twins then had an hour-long chat with him about the Second World War and they even got to see one of his medals.
They also heard stories from Mr Harding's time on board HMS Sutherland when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft carriers at the Battle of Singapore in 1942, which saw more than a thousand sailors killed and wounded.
