Khan, who is also being courted by WBC middleweight champion Sergio Martinez for a bout later this year, revealed that Mayweather has been sending insults to his camp after he expressed interest in challenging him for his world titles.
Mayweather, 34, has said Khan could not handle his style and is “a bum”. The American also called the Bolton boxer’s manager Barry Hearn a con man while criticising the promoter of the British champion by claiming he had never made him any money.
Khan has been accused of being too small for Mayweather, who won a majority decision over Juan Manuel Marquez in his last fight in September, but he is determined to prove he can make the weight and become the first Briton ever to win world titles at both welterweight and middleweight.
“I don’t think Floyd’s comments are down to jealousy,” Khan said. “He’s a legend of the sport, I have great respect for him but he shouldn’t talk about me in that way because I’m not a bum, I’m going to prove my worth on May 19 [when I fight Carlos Molina].
“I know Floyd doesn’t want any competition, he wants to be the best pound-for-pound fighter but that isn’t going to happen because other boxers are getting better.
Khan said his fight with WBC light welterweight champion Devon Alexander in January had not been a waste of time and revealed he is now 160lb, 24lbs lighter than when he was knocked out by Lamont Peterson in Las Vegas last year.
