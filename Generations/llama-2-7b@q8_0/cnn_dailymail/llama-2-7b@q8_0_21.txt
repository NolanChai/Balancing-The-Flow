 find was made on March 18 while they worked near the village of Huaca del Sol, close to the town of Casma.
Local authorities believe that the mummified corpse could be of high religious importance given its location and proximity to other Inca and pre-Columbian ruins in the area. But they say it's too soon to determine more about the person who once lay within the box. The 900-year-old remains, which are currently being kept under guard at a local police station, have been subjected to x-ray scans and will be sent for analysis in the coming days, according to reports on the Spanish news site Elmundo.
