 Calvani was reported missing on 17 July last year.
The 28-year-old went to a dental appointment that morning and her car was later found abandoned near her home in Westport, Connecticut.
On Monday, Connecticut State Police arrested 49-year-old William Devin of Milford on charges including first degree kidnapping after he allegedly assaulted his girlfriend.
Devin's arrest came as police said they were investigating the disappearances of four other women.
He has been charged with violating a protective order, but state police say there is no indication that Calvani was among those who have disappeared.
Court documents obtained by NBC Connecticut show Devin had told his girlfriend he had killed someone in 2016 and then burned the body at his house. The report says authorities later found a piece of jawbone buried near his home, which has not been identified as human or animal remains.
The New Haven Register reports that a search warrant executed on Monday uncovered "evidence consistent with an industrial meat grinder" in Devin's garage and the charred remains of a large pig.
Devin is being held on $1 million bail after his arrest, but he has not been charged with Calvani's disappearance or the disappearances of four other women, who have yet to be identified by police.
In the months following Adriana Calvani's disappearance, her mother Maria told Telemundo that her daughter had been seeing a dentist in Westport for several years but was now receiving treatment from Devin. She said he had a reputation as being "very violent" and would often get into fights with other patients while waiting to see the dentist.
Investigators are also looking into the disappearance of three other women who have been missing for an extended period of time:
• Jessica O'Connell, 34, was last seen leaving her home in Meriden, Connecticut on 12 February. Her husband told police he found a suicide note at their apartment. Police later said she had no history of mental illness or depression and that there were no indications that she left the house voluntarily.
• Kelsey Cox, 30, was last seen leaving her home in East Haven, Connecticut on 26 March 2017. She has not been found since then, despite extensive searches by authorities over the past two years. The case is considered open and unsolved.
• Erica Garcia-Cardenas was also reported missing from Westport on 3 April last year. Her car was found abandoned near her home shortly afterwards but she has never been located again since then. Her family told police they believe she may have gone to California with Devin after the dentist appointment where Adriana Calvani disappeared.
Adriana's mother Maria said the family had been living in fear ever since their daughter went missing last summer: "We are not sure if we will get her back alive or dead."
