2016 winners Saracens, as well as fellow semi-finalists Harlequins, all have their fans living within close proximity to the stadium – but Wasps are at least half an hour drive away from London.
Wasps fans will be hoping their team can go one better than last year when they were knocked out in the quarter finals by Leicester and then Saracens beat them again to take home the trophy.
The Ricoh Arena has a capacity of just under 32,000 and is usually home to Premiership side Wasps – although in recent times it has been used for England’s World Cup warm-ups as well as Rugby League matches involving the likes of Wigan Warriors.
