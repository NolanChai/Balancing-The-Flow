ferred her salary for three months in order to go travelling around Asia. She got sick and was hit by what she thought were migraines while backpacking with a friend on Koh Phangan Island in Thailand. It turned out that she had been attacked by a mosquito carrying the Zika virus, which can cause severe symptoms including paralysis or blindness if contracted during pregnancy, and led to her suffering a miscarriage. She returned to London but soon became ill again after travelling with friends in India. She was admitted to hospital where she was diagnosed as being seriously anaemic and told that the virus had attacked her brain. She was given strong steroids and antibiotics for six days until doctors decided to release her, saying they could find nothing wrong. However, when she got home in January 2016, Jenny's condition worsened rapidly - she experienced violent nausea, extreme tiredness and painful blisters that covered half of her body. Her parents were so concerned that they called an ambulance but a paramedic told them to take their daughter straight back home as she was not ill enough for hospital treatment. Doctors say the Zika virus could cause severe symptoms including paralysis or blindness if contracted during pregnancy Jenny's dad, Nick Dawson, took her to his GP who diagnosed it as a type of rheumatic fever and prescribed antibiotics and painkillers. The following month she was admitted to hospital with a high temperature and felt like she had been poisoned after drinking water from an infected tap. She had two days of tests, which revealed no bacterial infections or other illnesses. By the time Jenny returned home her parents realised that something was seriously wrong and took her to hospital where she remained for a month before being transferred to another unit where doctors finally decided to admit her as an outpatient on March 28. She stayed there for three weeks but her condition worsened and she lost the feeling in both feet, causing them to go completely numb. Jenny Dawson is now trying to get better after being seriously ill with the Zika virus Last year she was diagnosed as having a viral rash and eventually doctors realised that she had been infected by the Zika virus which had caused her immune system to attack her own body. Her parents were so concerned they called an ambulance but a paramedic told them to take their daughter straight back home as she was not ill enough for hospital treatment (stock image) Jenny, from London, said: 'I don't know how I got it and no one knows. 'In the last three years since I've been out of hospital, things have been going well - but then suddenly there are setbacks which take me back to where I started.' Jenny's father, Nick Dawson (pictured with her), took her to his GP who diagnosed it as a type of rheumatic fever and prescribed antibiotics and painkillers However, things took a turn for the worse in June when doctors at London's Royal Free Hospital decided to take Jenny into intensive care because they believed she had an auto-immune disease. They discovered that her liver was shutting down so they gave her steroid treatment which helped. By September 2016, Jenny felt well enough to return home and by November her parents were able to arrange for a physiotherapist to come in regularly. She has not been back to work since getting ill but is still hopeful that she will recover eventually. Jenny Dawson (pictured), 29, from London, said: 'I don't know how I got it and no one knows' Jenny, now aged 29, went on to suffer a miscarriage while backpacking in Asia and returned to London where she was diagnosed with anemia The mosquito carrying the Zika virus can cause severe symptoms including paralysis or blindness if contracted during pregnancy and led to Jenny suffering a miscarriage. She said: 'I've been going backwards and forwards from hospital and it's hard to find time to do anything else because I need to focus on my health.' The Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes but can also be passed during unprotected sex with an infected person or from a pregnant woman to her foetus. Symptoms usually appear within seven days of infection, but they can take longer than that and are often so mild that patients don't realise that they have it. A rash lasting two to five days is common, along with fever, muscle pain, headache and tiredness. If a woman becomes infected while pregnant or within two weeks of conceiving, there is a risk that her baby will be born with defects including microcephaly - a condition where babies have abnormally small heads which can lead to developmental problems later in life.
