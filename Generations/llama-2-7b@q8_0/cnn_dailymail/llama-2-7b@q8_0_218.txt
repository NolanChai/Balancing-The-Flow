 in eight years, just days before he is expected to announce his retirement from all forms of professional cricket.
The timing means that there will be a great deal of attention placed upon Pietersen's return at the Oval next week and how it affects Surrey's title hopes. If, as expected, the England player plays for just one game, against Gloucestershire on Tuesday, it will be in front of thousands of his countrymen who have not seen him in an England shirt since the end of last summer's Ashes series.
Pietersen had been working with Surrey's coaches and players for some months but only recently agreed to make himself available for selection after completing rehabilitation from hip surgery he underwent at the start of May. His arrival back on a cricket field is an unforgettable moment in English sporting history – Pietersen was a prodigiously gifted young player who made his England debut as a teenager and went on to make 4,445 runs in 104 Tests for the national side.
Surrey are desperate not to mess it up but the prospect of having Pietersen playing one-day cricket at The Oval has caused some concern among supporters who fear that a large crowd will descend on the ground in support of a player whose place in England's Test team is under threat.
Surrey had initially intended to hold a press conference for Pietersen next Tuesday morning, but it was cancelled at the eleventh hour as they moved to try to avoid an awkward situation. The club say that there will be no media availability on his first day back with the team, which would allow for "a seamless and uninterrupted return" ahead of the game against Gloucestershire.
The club did not respond when asked if they had any concerns about a large crowd turning out to support Pietersen at The Oval next week. The cricket season is coming towards the end but, with Surrey's chances of winning promotion from Division Two and claiming their first County Championship title since 2002 still in the balance, the game against Gloucestershire could attract a large crowd.
Pietersen has not played for England since August 2014, when his future with the national team was called into question after the South African-born batsman appeared to criticise Peter Moores, the head coach at the time, and members of the England team. Pietersen's contract with Surrey was terminated last year by mutual agreement after he fell out with the county chairman, Richard Thompson, who is also the vice-chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.
Pietersen had been playing for Surrey in a "friendly" capacity this season but is now available to be picked against Gloucestershire. He will play one-day cricket only next week before joining the team on an overseas tour. A statement released by the club read: "Surrey Cricket are delighted that Kevin Pietersen has agreed to return to The Oval, and help the side in pursuit of promotion from Division Two of the LV= County Championship."
"He will train with us as normal during this week, before joining the squad on our overseas tour. We look forward to welcoming him back into the squad for Tuesday's clash with Gloucestershire at The Oval – and wish him well in his first-class return after a long period out of the game."
