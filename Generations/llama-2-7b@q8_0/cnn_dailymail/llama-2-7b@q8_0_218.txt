2012 draws to a close it seems there will be another new trend that will stick around well into 2013 – the resurgence in popularity of the retro style.
In the UK and all over Europe, many women are turning back time by embracing the 50’s and 60’s fashion styles for the first time or returning to them after an absence of a few years. This is particularly true with womenswear as it seems that men still have some way to go before they take up retro style on a large scale. But why are so many women choosing to dress in this old-fashioned style?
The simple answer is that we all love fashion, but after years of experimenting and playing with different looks, the ‘new’ has lost its appeal for some people. After trying out a number of styles they eventually come back around to what works best – and comfort is always high on the list of priorities. So, it seems that women are turning back to the 50s and 60s as they are comfortable, stylish and easy to put together for everyday wear or special occasions alike.
And whilst some women like the idea of returning to a fashion trend from years gone by, there is another reason why they have chosen retro style: money. These days, everyone is feeling the pinch financially and many people are looking at ways to save cash on clothing, so returning to old-fashioned style seems like an obvious choice when money is tight. It’s also a way of making something special look quite cheap by embracing retro styles which are still on the high street, or picking up pieces from vintage stores.
Vintage clothing is big business at the moment and is worth considering for people who want to create an outfit with their own stamp without breaking the bank too much. But even though there is a wide range of retro styles around, many women are choosing to embrace the look in their own way – rather than replicating it exactly as it was worn in the past. This means that they have been able to create their own retro style with pieces from different decades, and this has made it a popular look all over Europe.
