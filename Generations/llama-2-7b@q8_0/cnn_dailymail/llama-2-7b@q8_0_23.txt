 side were denied their best chance of a European scalp since 2014 thanks to referee Romain Poite’s decision not to send off Exeter flanker Jacques Venter in the final moments of regulation time at Sandy Park.
In the context of England and Europe, it was a momentous occasion as Wasps lost 38-36 on aggregate against a side who had won seven out of their eight previous encounters since 2009. The Chiefs came into the clash having beaten Worcester, Racing 92, Toulouse and Bath to make it five successive victories for a first time in the club’s history, while they are now on a seven-game winning streak at home, also a first.
Wasps led 13-7 at half-time after Joe Launchbury had opened the scoring with his maiden European try and Tom Varndell finished off a swift counter attack midway through the opening period. Exeter responded quickly as Jack Nowell’s deflected try came via two Wasps turnovers to make it 13-12 at the interval, but they were level for the second time after Jake Cooper-Woolley was tackled into touch by his own team-mate following a strong run from Matt Kvesic.
Exeter made the most of the extra man advantage to take a 28-24 lead in the 57th minute as Nowell’s brother Joe crashed over in the corner after a fine piece of play involving Henry Slade, Jack Maunder and Stuart Hogg. However, Wasps replied in kind shortly afterwards through James Gaskell on his first senior start for the club and the hosts were made to rue their missed chances when they lost wing Tom O’Flaherty to injury before Venter was ordered from the field late on.
Wasps had been forced into a number of changes with Brad Shields, Christian Wade, Nathan Hughes and Tommy Taylor all missing out after suffering head knocks in the opening win over Worcester. In came Jack Willis for his first European start since December 2016, Gaskell made his maiden top-level appearance and former Harlequins tighthead prop Phil Swainston was handed a debut off the bench following an injury to Ashley Johnson.
The hosts were dealt a double blow early on when Dylan Hartley was ruled out due to concussion – as confirmed by chief medical officer Dr Steve Hampson, who had been part of England’s backroom team at the World Cup – and Tom Hendrickson withdrew through illness. Jack Maunder and Harry Williams took their places in Exeter’s starting line-up while Venter came into the pack off the bench for his first European outing since 2015.
Wasps had won all of their last three games against Exeter and they got off to a dream start when Launchbury powered over from close range, with Tom Varndell also celebrating his first senior appearance in Europe as he finished off a swift counter attack involving Matteo Minozzi and Dan Robson. The hosts had not lost their opening European game for the past seven seasons and they responded instantly through Nowell’s deflected effort that came via two Wasps turnovers.
Several Wasps players were guilty of missing tackles as Exeter threatened to score from a set-piece position after 25 minutes, but Robson did well to keep his cool with the clock winding down and he made up for his error at Worcester in round one by making an excellent clearance kick. The visitors also had the last laugh when Varndell sprinted away from Exeter’s line and he was tackled just short of the half-way line, before Minozzi set up Gaskell to finish off a superb counter attack with the hosts again guilty of conceding possession in dangerous territory.
Exeter had made a habit out of coming back from losing positions under Rob Baxter’s leadership and they levelled the scores for only the second time on the day when Kvesic was tackled into touch by his own team-mate, before Nowell was driven over after some enterprising play from Jack Maunder and Henry Slade. However, Wasps had a golden opportunity to take the lead in first-half stoppage time as they broke out of defence with an excellent move involving Willis and Gaskell, but Robson was tackled short by Williams in a crucial passage of play at a critical moment for the hosts.
Exeter continued to press after the break when Nowell crashed over following another strong piece of play from Slade and Maunder. Wasps then enjoyed their best period of the night as they moved 31-28 ahead through Gaskell’s second try – but it was not to last for long. They conceded a penalty shortly afterwards and Exeter went in front for the first time after Slade produced an accurate crossfield kick that Jack Nowell managed to collect before he raced clear to score his third try of the night.
Wasps hit back with a try from Gaskell on the hour mark, but they were then handed a glaring opportunity to go ahead when Venter was sent for an early shower after picking up two yellow cards in quick succession. However, Poite opted not to send him off despite seeing his second yellow card for “tackling without using hands” and Exeter immediately went down the other end where Slade chipped through for Nowell to score again and make it 36-31.
Wasps were left with an uphill struggle at this point and they failed to find a response as Exeter took their foot off the gas and Wasps’ final act in front of the posts came after Venter had been dismissed – but there was still time for the home side to strike again through Kvesic, who managed to cross the line despite being held up by Willis. That proved to be a case of too little, too late as Wasps fell at the last and they must now recover ahead of next week’s Gallagher Premiership trip to London Irish in round four of the Heineken Champions Cup on Saturday, December 7 (KO 3pm).
