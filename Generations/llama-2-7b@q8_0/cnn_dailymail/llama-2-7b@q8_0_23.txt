34 years his senior, and Nancy Jo Sales, 26, fell in love at first sight and tied the knot in May last year.
Allen, who lives on the Upper East Side and works as an architect, met Sales when she was a waitress at Sette Mezzo Restaurant in Manhattan's West Village, where he was dining with his wife and friends. "She came over to clear our table," said Allen. "We hit it off instantly."
Allen, who had been married for 29 years before meeting Sales, fell head-over-heels and decided to leave his wife, Nancy Jo. They were married two years later after a whirlwind romance that saw them jet around the world on luxury vacations in St Barts, Paris and Dubai. "I know she's not a gold digger but I wanted to show her that I could treat her well," said Allen. "She deserves the best."
But how did his friends and family react when he left his wife for her? "It was an instant disowning of me by most of my relatives, all the women in my family, including my mother," he said. "They weren't very accepting at first but they have come around to accept our relationship."
While Allen has always been open-minded and liberal about such things, his wife Nancy Jo was not so happy when her husband fell for a woman 14 years younger than their son. But the couple were determined to get married in a civil ceremony at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, which offers all couples an appointment on short notice, no matter their sexual orientation or age difference. The wedding party included 26 guests who flew into New York from all over the United States for the big day.
"It was one of my proudest moments," said Allen. "We were both very happy and excited." Sales has since moved out of her apartment in Brooklyn to live with Allen at his Manhattan townhouse, which is decorated in white and gold - the couple's favourite colours. It features an ornate chandelier and 12-foot Christmas tree.
"I was living alone," said Sales. "The house has been a complete change for me but I really love it." The pair now travel around the world together, visiting his home in Florida, where they also spend time with their families - Allen's son is 37 and Nancy Jo's daughter is 24.
Their romance may seem like an odd match to some people, but what do friends think of it? "It's a little strange," said one friend, who knew that Sales was dating the older man. "I have no idea how they met each other or what she sees in him." Another friend agreed: "I don't know if he has anything to offer her apart from money but I guess it works for them. It seems like an unusual relationship but people are different and I wish them all the best."
For now, Allen is happy that his wife Nancy Jo is accepting of their new relationship. The couple have no plans to get divorced - although they could eventually split up if they want - and intend to spend as much time together as possible before either one of them dies. They are planning on having a baby, which would be the first child for both of them, but they are not yet sure how they will do it: "I don't know what I feel about that," said Sales.
