TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over its content.
In Tuesday’s episode, Buddy Valastro was shown being fitted with a back brace for pain caused by a tumor on his spine.
“We are sensitive to the concerns expressed by some viewers about an upcoming episode of Cake Boss,” said Amy Winter, senior vice president at Discovery Communications (which owns TLC) in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. “The health and welfare of Buddy Valastro is always our top priority.”
Discovery Communications said that it decided to pull the episode from further broadcast because it was concerned about its graphic nature. The episode will not be rebroadcast on TLC or any other Discovery Communication network, a spokesperson for the company told People magazine.
