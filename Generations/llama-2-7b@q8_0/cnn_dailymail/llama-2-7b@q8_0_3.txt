Ho, whose channel Blogilates has 2 million subscribers, says she wanted to show how cruel people can be with their comments on the video-sharing site — which is why she decided to film it in a mirror.
‘I didn’t want to pick and choose what comments were left or not,’ Ho tells Australia’s Sunday Telegraph of the two year old clip, which has been viewed more than 5 million times.
The video features a series of comments made by YouTube viewers, which range from ‘you are not attractive at all!’ and ‘I think you need to lose some weight’ to ‘you look like a pudgy panda in the eyes’ and ‘you’re too fat to be considered as an inspiration. I would say that it takes more than 20 pounds of weight loss for someone to be seen as a role model.’
‘I don’t take it personally,’ Ho says, adding that she is inspired by other celebs like Kirsten Dunst, who has also been criticised in the press and on social media. ‘My goal with this video was not to focus on weight loss or my body but rather to show people how mean they can be when they do not know me.’
A graduate of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Ho, who is 30 years old, has also recently launched a new clothing line.
