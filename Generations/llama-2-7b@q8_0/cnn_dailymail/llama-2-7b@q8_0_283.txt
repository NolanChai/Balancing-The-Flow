onnina blue and white robes (and the same socks), with the sun streaming in through the windows of his Milan hotel room, he addressed a handful of reporters who had been waiting patiently for him to surface. He seemed to have trouble finding the right words – and indeed it would take him the whole day just to describe how he felt about lifting yet another Serie A title with his new club – but when asked what was in store for his team’s next match against Fiorentina, Ancelotti’s answer was unequivocal. ‘We will win,’ he declared.
That, of course, is exactly what happened. With the world and its dog seemingly expecting a celebratory lap of honour from their new champions (‘You must be so happy after winning your first Scudetto in 17 years…’), Carlo Ancelotti’s side lined up with one intention: to beat Fiorentina at all costs. In the end, the Viola were on the wrong end of an uncharacteristically violent encounter which saw them reduced to ten men within five minutes and a 4-0 defeat, leaving Milan just one point behind arch rivals Juventus in their quest for UEFA Champions League football next season.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves: Ancelotti has been the talk of Italian football ever since he took the reins at AC Milan back on January 21st, and in many ways this was his moment to shine. In the days that followed, the media and fans alike were united in praise for both his team’s performances during their recent run-in to the title (which saw them take a maximum of points from the last seven games) as well as their ability to triumph over Juventus once more after being pipped at the post by the Bianconeri only six months ago.
Nevertheless, some still had reservations: ‘But what if he goes for a celebratory lap of honour and takes his team out?’ they asked. ‘What happens when he’s given two days off with his family after winning a trophy? Doesn’t he have a job to do then?’
And so it was that Ancelotti had the chance to silence some of his critics on Sunday afternoon, when he was called upon by club owner Silvio Berlusconi to make a speech at the end of Milan’s season-ending party. After all, it wasn’t just about winning trophies and lifting titles – Ancelotti knew that he had made a real impression on his new club, too.
In response to questions about whether or not he would be taking the team out for their next match against Fiorentina, he said: ‘I think I will win [the match] because my players are great. They’re also very young and talented so they can do anything if we work hard together as a team.’ And when asked what kind of mood he was in after such an amazing victory over Juventus last week, Ancelotti replied: ‘I am very happy right now because I won this title but at the same time I know that there are still two games left and if we don’t win them then our season will be over.’
So it seems that despite all of his critics who were trying to convince everyone else that he was a failure, Carlo Ancelotti has proved himself once again. Not only did he manage to lead Milan to victory against Juventus in their final game but now with two matches left on the season he has also given them hope for another successful campaign next year as they battle it out for second place behind their city rivals Inter Milan.
