The shootings happened in Helmand province and were the deadliest since two Americans died August 28 at Camp Bastion when their armored vehicles were attacked by insurgents dressed as Afghan commandos.
Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said one U.S. soldier was killed in Friday's shooting. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack, and a senior ISAF official told CNN that three were killed.
Azimi did not immediately provide any information on whether there had been an arrest of suspected shooter or how he could have entered a U.S. military installation in Afghanistan without being detected. He said the incident is under investigation.
"The commander and the entire security force are shocked," said Army Col. Brian Tribus, the ISAF spokesman. "We have been working very hard with our counterparts to identify people that shouldn't be on the base."
Tribus said the shooter was dressed in an Afghan National Security Forces uniform when he entered the U.S. military facility where he killed one and wounded two others.
"It is unfortunate that we have some individuals who want to kill their fellow Afghans," Tribus told CNN. "We will continue to work closely with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Afghan national security forces and other partners to provide the best possible environment for our troops and civilians."
The NATO force has suffered numerous so-called "green on blue" attacks this year. In July, a lone gunman dressed as an Afghan soldier killed two U.S. officers. In May, a man wearing Afghan military fatigues opened fire at a base in eastern Khost province, killing six U.S. and three U.S.-allied soldiers before being shot to death by a coalition soldier.
The latest shooting came as NATO is in the midst of an operation to clear Helmand's southern districts -- where most of the Taliban are based -- ahead of the start of the Afghanistan fighting season, which typically begins in late November and ends with the onset of winter in mid-March.
In July, about 25,000 international troops launched Operation Panther's Claw to clear Taliban-held areas from the Helmand districts of Sangin and Now Zad, but was unable to gain significant ground. The operation is considered a prelude for a planned offensive in Kandahar province later this fall.
