Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League.
Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star peformance as Chelsea claimed a 1-0 victory over Sunderland in their final Premier League game of the season.
Terry scored what proved to be the winner with just under ten minutes remaining after Gylfi Sigurdsson had equalised for the Black Cats from the penalty spot.
The win, Chelsea's eighth on the bounce, means they can no longer finish outside of second place in the table, while it also means that Terry will not be part of a top four side this year after he was banned from participating against Liverpool for his racist comments to Ferdinand.
Speaking about Terry, Carragher said: "He's had a superb season and I believe he is the best defender in Premier League history."
"When you look at what other centre-halves have achieved in this league over the last 20 years, I believe John is No1.
"He has been outstanding for Chelsea ever since he joined and if we are talking about great players who have won trophies, then I'm not sure there is any player in history that could boast the same honours as John."
Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Martin Keown thinks Terry is a "disgrace to the game", but admitted that he cannot take away from what he has achieved.
"I don't think we should forget about what Terry has done over his career," added Carragher.
"Yes, I feel he's a disgrace to the game and we shouldn't forget how he behaved towards Rio Ferdinand but it can't take away from all he has achieved in football."
