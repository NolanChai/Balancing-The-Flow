 years ago, right through to the present day, we have been a nation of immigrants – in terms of both peoples and ideas – but do these still shape our sense of English identity today? And if so how can they help us come together as an ‘English’ people?
This event will explore the multicultural character of modern England through the voices and stories of people from all backgrounds. How is identity shaped by place, personal narrative or other elements – such as class, ethnicity or gender? What does it mean to be English in a multi-ethnic Britain today and how can we use these identities to build bridges between communities?
