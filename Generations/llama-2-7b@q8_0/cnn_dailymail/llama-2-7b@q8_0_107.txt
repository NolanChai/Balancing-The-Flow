As the whales breach the surface of water they throw up huge fountains of saltwater which can be up to ten metres high and fifty metres wide. The whales often breach several times before sinking back below the surface of the ocean. These powerful displays are known as spy hopping or lob-tailing.
The humpbacks, migrate along this stretch of coastline each year on their way to Antarctica and then north again during summer. The whales often spend time in Sydney harbour and also appear off the coast at Bondi. It is thought that these two areas provide good rest stops as it is easier to feed around the shallow water compared with deeper water.
Humpbacks are a sub-Antarctic species of whale and have been seen breaching in other places such as New Zealand, Tasmania, Argentina and Tonga.
The humpback whales will be in Sydney harbour until they leave for Antarctica around July time.
