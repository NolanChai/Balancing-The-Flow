According to research from the University of Otago in New Zealand published online in Tobacco Control on Friday (09/28), 6 percent of US high school students reported trying an electronic cigarette at least once in their life and nearly one third had considered it, but only a small minority became regular users.
"There's been a lot of talk about the potential harm that e-cigarettes might cause young people, but there are limited data about how they use these products," said lead author Dr. John Hart, senior research fellow at Otago. "Our findings suggest that while teenagers may be tempted to try an e-cigarette, very few end up smoking them."
The study surveyed 15,743 high school students in the US who took part in the 2010 National Youth Tobacco Survey. Students were asked if they had ever tried e-cigarettes and then how often they used the devices during the past year. Just over 9 percent of respondents said that they had never smoked a conventional cigarette, but almost one third (32 percent) reported having tried an e-cigarette at least once in their life.
The researchers also found that, although teenagers were tempted to try an e-cigarette, few became regular users of the devices. In fact, just 5.6 percent used them on a daily or almost daily basis and 32.4 percent said they had tried them within the past year.
The study also found that those students who were more likely to have considered trying an e-cigarette in the past year were white males, living in low income households and having easy access to tobacco. The authors concluded that further research is needed into how these young people perceive electronic cigarettes and whether they are aware of their potential harms or health benefits.
"While it seems unlikely that e-cigarette use will lead to smoking among non-smokers, the risks associated with long-term electronic cigarette use remain unknown," Dr Hart said. "It's important that young people are aware of this potential harm and only experiment if they think an electronic cigarette is a healthy alternative."
