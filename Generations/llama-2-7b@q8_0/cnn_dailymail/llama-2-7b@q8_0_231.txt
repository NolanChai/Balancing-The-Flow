 according to a new government report. A government report released Thursday says the rate has hit an all-time low of 31.3 births per 1,000 girls and women ages 15 through 19. That's down more than 8 percent from last year and 40 percent since peaking in 1991 at 56.1 births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the decline is "particularly striking" because it came during an economic downturn that reduced government programs to prevent pregnancy, as well as access to contraception and health care. A similar drop in rates has been observed in Mexico, where births to girls under 18 have dropped 53 percent from the early 1990s until now, says Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, director of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC report found that teen birth rates declined in all but two states and Washington, D.C., last year. Hawaii had the highest rate at 42 per 1,000 women under age 20. Mississippi had the biggest drop, falling nearly 7 percent from the previous year to 51.5 per 1,000. Overall, teen births have dropped 62 percent since their peak in 1991, when there were more than 640,000 a year. The report was released as Congress considers measures to cut costs for women's health services and block-grant Medicaid. The measures are part of the GOP budget passed by the House that would also limit future federal spending on family planning programs. The CDC says teen pregnancies and births can have serious consequences, including higher rates of maternal and infant mortality and adverse childhood outcomes.
