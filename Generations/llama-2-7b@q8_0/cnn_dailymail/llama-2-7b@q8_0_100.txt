The family of Stephanie Scott’s accused murderer have offered their condolences to the Leeton school teacher’s friends and relatives ahead of her funeral on Wednesday.
Vincent Stanford, 24, is accused of stabbing the 29-year-old more than 100 times after a night out at a pub in Murrumburrah, on the New South Wales south coast, on Saturday morning.
Her family have written letters addressed to friends and relatives asking for privacy ahead of her funeral this week.
The letter was published online by news.com.au.
‘To those who knew Stephanie: I want you to know that the last thing we wanted or intended was for this tragedy to occur,’ it said.
‘We want only what is best for everyone and especially our daughter. She has been loved, cared for and raised with all of the attention she deserved and more. We ask for privacy at this time.’

Mr Stanford’s family also sent a letter, asking those who knew Mr Stanford to ‘please accept our most sincere apologies for the untimely passing of your loved one’.
It said: ‘We too are suffering at this time and would like to express our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Stephanie.’
Ms Scott was found dead in bushland about 15km from Murrumburrah early on Saturday morning, hours after she left The Criterion Hotel with Mr Stanford.
She had been stabbed more than 100 times, police allege.
Mr Stanford has been charged with murder and refused bail and will face court again later this month.
