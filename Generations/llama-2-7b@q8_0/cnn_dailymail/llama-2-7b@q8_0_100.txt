20% in a year. And the rate of gonorrhoea, syphilis and genital herpes in 16 to 24-year olds is now at its highest level for more than 25 years.
Public Health England said young people need to be made aware of how important it is to use condoms every time they have sex. It said the figures are ‘worrying’, and urged doctors to ensure that under-25s were tested for STIs when they went for a check up.
It comes after the number of 16-year old girls having abortions climbed by more than 40% in three years. Health chiefs said girls aged between 15 and 18 are not getting sufficient sexual health advice from their doctors. The figures show that there were 1,974 cases of gonorrhoea reported to the Public Health England surveillance system for under-25s in 2012, up from 1,681 in 2011.
Syphilis rose from 370 to 378 while there were 948 cases of genital herpes among the age group – 30 more than in 2011. A total of 4,590 chlamydia infections among under-25s was reported to Public Health England for the first time in 2012. The figures also show that there were 3,784 cases of genital warts and 135 cases of hepatitis B among the age group.
Public Health England said it is particularly concerning that STIs are increasing at a ‘significantly faster rate’ among men than women. It warned: ‘This rise in young people diagnosed with these sexually transmitted infections has serious implications for their health and well-being.’ Dr Paul Cosford, director of communicable disease surveillance at Public Health England, said the increase is ‘particularly worrying’.
He added: ‘The majority of cases are occurring among young people aged 16 to 24 who are having unprotected sex with multiple partners. ’Dr Cosford called for health professionals to ensure that under-25s are tested when they attend a routine check up, and get a test if they suspect they have an STI.
The number of young women diagnosed with gonorrhoea is now at its highest level since 1990, according to Public Health England figures Dr Cosford said: ‘Young people need to know how important it is to use condoms every time they have sex. They must also be aware that the only way to prevent STIs such as gonorrhoea, syphilis and genital herpes is by not having unprotected sex with new partners.’
There were 156 cases of HIV reported among under-25s last year, but Public Health England said these are likely to be a ‘true reflection’ of the prevalence of the disease. It has called for more research into whether gonorrhoea is becoming resistant to antibiotics – as it has in Japan.
Dr Cosford said: ‘The fact that there has been an increase in syphilis, which can be treated with one course of antibiotics, and genital herpes, a viral infection, may point to the emergence of resistant gonorrhoea strains in England.’
A Public Health England spokeswoman said: ‘STIs can cause serious health problems. Infections such as chlamydia and syphilis can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy which could lead to stillbirth or neo-natal death. Gonorrhoea is also becoming resistant to antibiotics, meaning there is no treatment for the infection.’
Professor Peter Weatherby, vice president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), said: ‘It’s very worrying that STIs are on the rise in young people. BASHH and other sexual health organisations have been working hard to tackle the problem in this age group with a focus on schools, colleges and universities.’
Dr David Delvin of the Royal College of Physicians said it is ‘crucial’ that doctors are aware of the risk factors for STIs. He added: ‘If they are not treated quickly then serious health problems can arise – including infertility and in women pelvic inflammatory disease.’
Male and female condoms are highly effective at preventing HIV, genital herpes and gonorrhoea. Infections with Chlamydia, syphilis or trichomoniasis may be prevented by using latex condoms correctly every time you have sex. Other methods of protection include a dental dam during oral sex, and avoiding contact between your genitals and theirs if they are infected.
The Sexual Health Forum said: ‘Raising awareness that STIs can be passed on from person to person through sexual activity is essential in stopping this rise. It’s also important that everyone who has sex, regardless of age, gets tested at least once a year.’ A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘It’s vital our children are taught about the risks and consequences of having unprotected sex from an early age so they can make informed decisions. ’The DfE is also working with Public Health England to provide additional guidance for schools, colleges and youth organisations on how best to protect young people.’
