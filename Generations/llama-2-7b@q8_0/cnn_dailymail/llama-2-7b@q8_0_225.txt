 their own 'cancer immunity' could help fight off tumours, researchers claim.
CANCER patients could be given their own ‘cancer immunity’ after doctors discovered that people who survive the deadly disease have an increased ability to tackle it in others.
British scientists believe they have found a way to give those with cancer a higher chance of recovery by tapping into their bodies’ existing natural defence mechanism.
Researchers at Imperial College London have tested the treatment on mice, whose survival rates were boosted more than 50 per cent by giving them the immunity gene in the form of a drug.
Experts hope that one day the findings could lead to patients being given their own cancer immunity if they are diagnosed with cancer for the first time - effectively giving them a 'vaccine' against it.
But researchers were unable to carry out trials on humans because such an approach was deemed too unethical, and instead tested the treatment on mice.
Researchers have been trying to find ways of boosting immune response for years but their attempts had largely failed until now.
The new research shows that it is possible to enhance a person’s own cancer immunity in a way that is safe.
Because the therapy makes use of genes that are already present inside our cells, it would be ethical to give people with no prior history of cancer their own immune system's response to a tumour, the researchers say.
