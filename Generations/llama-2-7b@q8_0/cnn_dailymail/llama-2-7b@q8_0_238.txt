Climbing Dubai’s ‘Inside-Out’ skyscraper
A daredevil Frenchman known as the 'French Spiderman' scaled Dubai's world record breaking twisted tower - without a safety harness.
Cayan Tower in Dubai, also known as The Inside-Out building, is 1007ft tall and was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM) with the architects HOK.
