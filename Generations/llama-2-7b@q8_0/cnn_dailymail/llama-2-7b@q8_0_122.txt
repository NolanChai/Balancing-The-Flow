The Mars Science Laboratory -- a $2 billion spacecraft that includes an unmanned rover named Curiosity -- had been scheduled to launch in late 2010, but has suffered a series of delays since then. The new schedule calls for a November or December 2011 liftoff on the Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Mission officials have said that the delay is partly due to technical problems with the rocket's thrusters, as well as issues involving flight software, a parachute and a key piece of equipment used to steer Curiosity when it lands on Mars. NASA also wants more time to test components in simulated Martian conditions.
The latest delay was prompted after a meeting with the project's top managers Thursday.
"We have put together a plan that has been accepted by both NASA and our industry partners," Cooke said, referring to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company of Denver, which is building Curiosity for NASA. "There are some areas where we need more time for additional testing and we want to make sure we do the right things."
Cooke declined to provide further details about what types of tests will be performed or how they will be conducted.
He also said NASA had not yet finalized its plans to test Curiosity on Earth prior to launching it toward Mars, but that engineers were working on a plan and would make the results public in the coming months.
"We have a schedule right now that is based on the fact we're going to do some testing and evaluation," Cooke said. "We still are not sure if we will do all of the tests here on Earth or just parts of it."
Cooke noted, however, that NASA did not plan to conduct any additional flight tests prior to Curiosity being launched.
The mission's primary goal is to determine whether Mars can support microbial life today and has been capable of supporting it in the past. The rover will also seek answers about the red planet's climate history, which might reveal clues about how Earth became habitable for living organisms.
Curiosity was designed to carry 10 instruments that will measure Martian rock and soil samples for chemical ingredients needed for life. The 2-ton rover also has a drill that can collect up to 5 feet of core material, which will be analyzed by the scientific instruments in search of clues about whether microbes ever thrived on Mars or if conditions were once suitable but now are too harsh.
The project's previous schedule called for NASA to launch Curiosity in November and have it land on Mars in August 2012, after a journey lasting between seven months and one year. The new schedule calls for the rover to arrive at its destination in March of that year.
Cooke said NASA has already spent about $1 billion on the mission, including development costs. He said NASA was still discussing whether there would be any cost overruns related to the delay, but added that he did not expect them to exceed $350 million.
"We believe we will be able to manage within our current budget," Cooke said. "This is a very, very difficult program, but I think we're managing it well."
