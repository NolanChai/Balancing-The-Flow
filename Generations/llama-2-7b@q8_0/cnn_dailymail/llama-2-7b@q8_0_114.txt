ystanders, a group that formed in the wake of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri and which has staged dozens of demonstrations across the country over the last few months.
The march began at Union Square Park before heading south toward police headquarters on Centre Street. Marchers chanted "No justice, no peace" and "We can't breathe." Many participants wore black clothing and carried signs that read, "Black Lives Matter," while others held their hands up in the air with fingers spread in a gesture of surrender.
The crowd eventually made its way to Columbus Circle before moving down Broadway toward Union Square again where they were met by police who blocked them from proceeding any further downtown due to "safety concerns." In response, protesters began throwing bottles at officers and lighting fires in garbage cans which prompted police to fire tear gas into the crowd.
As of Wednesday morning there have been 34 arrests made for various charges including disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration among others; however it is unclear how many more may be pending. The march comes just days after another demonstration against police brutality took place in New York City which led to numerous arrests as well.
It remains unclear what will happen next following these incidents but one thing seems certain: more people are becoming aware of issues surrounding police brutality than ever before and this trend is likely only going to continue growing over time until real change can finally come about.
