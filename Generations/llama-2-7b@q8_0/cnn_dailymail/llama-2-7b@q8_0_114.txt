 Brits say that they have never even been on a date and almost two thirds (64 per cent) feel they can’t afford to go out to eat or do something fun with their partner on Valentine’s Day.
A new survey from travel company, First Choice Holidays has revealed that 51% of Brits would love to escape on a romantic break this Valentine’s Day but only 29 per cent are likely to actually go away. A third (36 per cent) say that it is simply too expensive and more than two fifths (44 per cent) think that Valentine’s Day isn’t really the best time of year to take a romantic break together as they can’t afford one at another time.
The study revealed that over half of Brits (54 per cent) still like to surprise their partners with a romantic gesture, but a third (32 per cent) prefer to let them know in advance what they are planning and only 12% would like an entirely unplanned experience. The most popular choice was flowers for two-fifths of the public (40%) and a meal or drinks out together was the next most common gift at a quarter (25%).
The study revealed that almost one in ten Brits don’t think Valentine’s Day is very romantic. Almost two fifths (38 per cent) believe it has become too commercialised and they are tired of being bombarded with all sorts of marketing gimmicks, but 40% say they like to have something to look forward to on that special day.
First Choice is offering a romantic getaway to the idyllic island of Tenerife for only £69pp based on two sharing and includes return flights from Manchester Airport, one night in a three star hotel with full English breakfast and accommodation at the 4* Royal Park hotel or similar.
