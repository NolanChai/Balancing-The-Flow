idi after a court granted him relief due to his deteriorating health, according to reports by the Dawn.
Reports of the decision have not yet been verified by authorities on either side of the border and are being questioned by Indian officials. However, Lakhvi's lawyer told The New York Times that his client was free and "alive".
The release has been condemned by India with the Ministry of External Affairs calling it a "travesty" in its official statement. It is now believed that Lakhvi may be planning to travel to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where he will meet militant leader Hafiz Saeed â€“ who is already at large and was recently allowed to hold public rallies after India called him an 'international terrorist'.
A source told the Times: "They (Lakhvi's lawyers) are going to tell you that they don't know where he will go, but it looks like he is being sent for treatment and then will be taken somewhere else. It could mean that he will end up in Kashmir."
Lakhvi has been charged with plotting the 2008 Mumbai attacks which were orchestrated by Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). He and three others were arrested in connection to the attack on a cricket stadium, two trains, hotels and other buildings.
India has repeatedly asked Pakistan to try or extradite LeT leader Hafiz Saeed who is wanted for his involvement in planning attacks on India. However, so far no progress has been made regarding the arrest of either man.
Reports have suggested that Lakhvi may be held in custody again before being sent to a hospital. The Pakistani government has also said they are "studying" the case and will make a decision at an appropriate time.
