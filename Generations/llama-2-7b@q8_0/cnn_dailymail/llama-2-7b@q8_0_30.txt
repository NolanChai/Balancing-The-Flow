­record-breaking egg she has seen since taking up poultry farming three years ago.
The tiny egg weighs just two grammes and is half the size of a normal hen’s egg. It was found by Shannon in the nesting box with her pet hens and could be entered into the record books because it is an actual record-breaker — not a plastic one. She has sent pictures of it to Guinness World Records for verification but they have yet to confirm whether the egg, which was laid on September 14, will be accepted.
The official Guin­ness rules state that “to qualify as a record-breaking egg, the eggs must not be plastic or artificial”. The current smallest egg in their records weighs just three grammes and is half the size of Shannon’s. She said: “I was surprised when I found it because it is so tiny.
“I have always been interested in farming and I asked my parents if I could get some hens for my 12th birthday.” The family got five chickens from a local farm shop, one of which was an Orpington cross. They now have nine hens including a pure breed Orpington, Golden Phoenix and Silver Phoenix.
Shannon said her interest in poultry had developed over the past three years — she even has her own Facebook page called The Hen House — but she still manages to find time for studying maths, chemistry, biology, history, geography, French, English and ICT at St John Plessington Catholic College.
Her mother, Clare, said: “She loves getting up in the morning to do her chores before school.” She added that Shannon is “a very organised person who has a talent for maths”.
