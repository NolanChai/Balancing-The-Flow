 was pulled from a creek where she had been trapped by the torrent on Tuesday afternoon. She had been driving home to her unit in West Wallsend when her car was swept away as she drove through flood waters near Maitland yesterday.
Her son Andrew Jarmain said his mother, who had recently returned from a holiday at Coffs Harbour, was "the salt of the earth" and loved being around children. Mr Jarmain, 50, of Glendale Heights in western Sydney, told The Daily Telegraph his mother was visiting her grandson when she went to buy milk yesterday.
"She's a real character, really hardworking," he said. "We're just devastated by what happened." Police divers yesterday retrieved Ms Jarmain's body from the Nepean River near Bakers Lane Bridge in Maitland at 4pm.

Mr Jarmain said his mother had only just got back from a holiday with friends to Coffs Harbour after staying at a resort for about four weeks. "She loved living life and was very independent," he added. Mr Jarmain said he was flying in tomorrow night to be by her side as she is laid to rest on Friday morning.
Ms Jarmain, who lived alone, had been married to her husband Ian Jarmain for 51 years before his death two years ago. She leaves behind three children - Andrew, John and Sue - nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. The family has established a fundraising page on the YouCaring website with a goal of raising $30,000 to cover funeral costs.
Maitland was hit by major flooding yesterday when heavy rains lashed NSW overnight, causing widespread damage and disruption across the state's Hunter Valley. The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert on Tuesday warning that "heavy, long-lasting falls may cause flash flooding in some areas", but said it was too soon to predict where exactly this might occur.
The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) received more than 500 calls for help as the heavy rain caused havoc across the state, with Maitland and Singleton being hit the hardest by the floods. The SES said it had rescued at least three people from flood waters in the Hunter Valley yesterday.
Two men were trapped on a roof near Singleton after their vehicle was swept away in flooding. One of the pair managed to escape and sought refuge inside the house they were driving past. He was rescued by the SES. The other man was airlifted to hospital after being rescued from the roof where he was trapped for 20 minutes.
A third man, who was trapped on a roof near Maitland, also required help from the rescue team. Meanwhile, the SES received more than 150 calls in just 18 hours and was forced to close its headquarters in Singleton yesterday afternoon after being swamped with emergency calls.

The SES said it had rescued about 30 people from their flooded homes and cars in Maitland yesterday, many after their vehicles became stranded in rising waters. One woman was also rescued after her car became stuck on a river bank near Singleton. The vehicle was being towed when the tow line broke and it veered off into the water.
Police said one man had been taken to hospital for minor injuries after his car was swept away in flood waters at Maitland about 1pm yesterday. His wife, who was also in the vehicle, was able to clamber out a window onto some trees.
The SES is urging anyone with water entering their home not to turn off power points or electrical equipment as this could cause more damage. "You don't want anything to catch fire or explode," an emergency spokesman said.
"Turning off power may actually increase the risk of it starting a fire."
