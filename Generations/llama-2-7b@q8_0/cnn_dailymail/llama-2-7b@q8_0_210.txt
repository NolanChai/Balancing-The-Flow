 comes on the heels of a trip to the region by Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during which they heard an array of views about what role the United States should play after 2014 when its combat forces are scheduled to leave the country.
Obama's meeting with leaders comes as members of his national security team headed back to the region for more talks.
"The president is going to be talking to our congressional leadership about Afghanistan and Pakistan," White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said Monday.
The meeting, which was first reported by CNN's Brianna Keilar, comes at a time when members of Congress from both parties are questioning the U.S.'s role in the region and whether there should be an exit strategy after 2014 -- if not sooner.
"There is a lot of unease that we could stay in Afghanistan forever," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. "I think it's very clear to most members that we can't keep going and going."
The meetings come at time when the United States faces a series of deadlines -- including the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces by 2014 and the transitioning of responsibility for Afghan security to Afghans.
Some senators say they are not convinced that the White House is doing all it can to ensure the success of this transition.
"I think our focus has been on how do we get out," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts. "We don't seem to be focusing as much on what happens after that and how we have an Afghanistan that is stable and not a terrorist breeding ground."
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry told CNN he was hoping for a more "open, candid" discussion about the war Tuesday.
"We need to hear from the administration on what they really see happening," said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, who has been briefed by Obama's national security team in Afghanistan. "And we also need to learn a lot more about what other countries think."
Congress will debate this week whether to send 10,000 additional troops -- on top of the 68,000 already there. It's not clear that will pass, but Congress is likely to vote soon after Obama returns from Asia on how much money to continue sending overseas.
Republicans are threatening to withhold funding for next year unless they have more information about what the White House plans to do in 2014. But Democrats argue that such a move could endanger U.S. troops already there.
The president's top national security adviser, Tom Donilon, told CNN on Friday that Obama is still reviewing recommendations by his military commanders for next steps after 2014 in Afghanistan and he hopes to make a decision soon.
