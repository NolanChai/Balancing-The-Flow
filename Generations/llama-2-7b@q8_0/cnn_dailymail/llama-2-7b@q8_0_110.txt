 police said the man had been riding the bike for some time when he lost control while attempting to overtake another driver, but were unable to say what led to him losing consciousness. The thief was spotted at 3am by traffic cops on their way back from a night of drinking who chased down his motorbike after they caught sight of the suspect stealing cars in the area.
The incident happened on Kampot Street near a garage where a car has been parked for two days without its owner knowing, as thieves were preparing to steal it. Police managed to catch up with the thief and overpower him by using a Taser, which is only used in Cambodia by police and not available for public use. The man was taken to hospital before being arrested when he came round.
The man is accused of being involved in eight separate car thefts on Kampot Street and two on Phnom Penh's Norodom Boulevard. Police have now arrested one person after the latest spate of motorbike robberies, which took place last weekend when a gang targeted foreigners living in the capital. The thieves were also suspected of breaking into cars to steal mobile phones and other valuables before making off on stolen scooters.
Those who live in Phnom Penh or any Cambodian city need to be vigilant against crime, including car robbery as well as pickpocketing which has been on the increase lately due to people carrying more expensive mobile phones and other items of value that thieves can target.
