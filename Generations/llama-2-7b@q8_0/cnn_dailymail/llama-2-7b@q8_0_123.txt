100 per cent record at the top of the Premier League. However, Ramsey believes QPR need all three points if they are to avoid dropping into the relegation zone and says it is just as crucial for his side, who have lost both league meetings with Chelsea so far this season. 'It's a big game for us,' he told the club's official website. 'Obviously for Chelsea they are not going to be thinking about that. They will be looking at it as another chance of three points, but we have to treat it like any other game.' QPR have lost four straight league games and are bottom on goal difference, while Chelsea's only defeats in the top flight this season came against Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. 'It's not just about how many wins you get or points you get,' Ramsey continued. 'If we can win that game it gives us a lift going into a tough game on Saturday at Newcastle, then to Norwich. 'We have got to pick up some points and there are no easy games in the Premier League.' Chelsea have been crowned champions by many pundits after a 3-1 win over Aston Villa last weekend extended their unbeaten run to 27 matches in all competitions. Ramsey knows that his players must be at their very best to avoid being overrun on Sunday. 'It's not about being brave or taking risks,' he said. 'We just need to keep doing what we are doing - we have been on a good run of form lately and we have to make sure that continues.' Chelsea and QPR will meet again at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday, April 19.
