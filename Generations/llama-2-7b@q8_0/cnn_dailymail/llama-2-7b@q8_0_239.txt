it of blue could be seen where the sun shone through the storm clouds.
The weather phenomenon had locals excitedly taking photos and posting them to social media. One Twitter user even commented that they would "stay in Paris for good" if it meant seeing such a beautiful sight.
The rainbow appeared at around midday local time, as France was battered by winds reaching 80 miles per hour in some areas. The Eiffel Tower itself, which stands more than 300m tall, has survived several other storms throughout the years. It is made of a metal that can resist the elements and weathering, but last year's strong winds still led to its closure for safety reasons.
While some were quick to take in the scene and capture their own photographs, others took advantage of the uncommon rainbow sight by running across it as if they were chasing a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. One man even made his way onto the Seine River, which runs underneath the structure, to try and catch the sun's light.
France has had some spectacular weather in recent months. In June a rare celestial phenomenon known as an "Aurora Australis" was seen over the country for the first time since 2013.
