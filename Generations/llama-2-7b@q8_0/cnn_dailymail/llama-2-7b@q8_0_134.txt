-ahead for a fresh offensive by its proxies in eastern Ukraine.
Video of what appeared to be the aftermath of an explosion near the village of Semyonovka, 10 miles from rebel stronghold Donetsk on Sunday afternoon, was posted online by Russia's defence ministry.
The footage showed two burnt-out vehicles and a large hole in the ground – apparently caused by a missile strike – but no signs that anyone had been injured or killed. A Russian news agency later claimed five pro-Russian separatists were killed in the attack, although the rebel leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, dismissed it as “fake”.
The ministry claimed a Ukrainian military plane had been intercepted near Donetsk and was suspected of carrying an air-to-surface missile. It said two missiles were shot down by Russian fighter jets over the rebel territory and one exploded after falling in a nearby residential area, leaving five rebels killed.
The Ukrainian military has rejected claims that its aircraft had been intercepted and has insisted there was no attack on civilian areas.
Moscow's propaganda machine is engaged in an information war over eastern Ukraine which is being fought with weapons as well as words. Both sides are using artillery, tanks and mortars, while Ukrainian government forces have recently received U.S.-made Javelin missiles for use against Russian-backed separatists.
Ukraine's military chief said yesterday that Russia has built up 65,000 troops near the border with eastern Ukraine, a claim dismissed as “nonsense” by Moscow. The Kremlin denied it was planning an offensive but rebel commander Zakharchenko warned on Monday that he would launch one if Kiev did not halt its military operations against pro-Russian separatists in the region.
Zakharchenko said his forces had been put on “full combat alert” and were awaiting a green light from Moscow to begin fighting.
The latest violence comes after the worst outbreak of hostilities since August 2014, when Kiev halted its military operation against pro-Russian separatists following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over rebel territory with the loss of 298 lives.
Moscow has blamed Ukraine for the disaster and has since accused Kiev of deliberately stoking the war, while accusing NATO – which has provided Ukraine with non-lethal military aid to help it fight pro-Russian separatists – of seeking to “finish off” Russia.
The Ukrainian government has said it is in talks with the rebels on a ceasefire and amnesty, but says fighting continues because Russia does not want a peaceful settlement in its neighbouring region.
