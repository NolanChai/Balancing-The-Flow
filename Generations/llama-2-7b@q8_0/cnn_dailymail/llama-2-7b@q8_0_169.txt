28 times at provincial level with Connacht, said he heard shots being fired from outside while inside his house in Ballina, Co Mayo.
Gardaí said a lone gunman fired ten rounds through windows of his home after he was confronted by two men who challenged him to a fight. The incident occurred shortly before 5am on Sunday morning and left the Connacht player shaken but unhurt.
It is not known if the suspect, who fled in a silver car, had any connection with McBurney or knew of his occupation as a professional rugby player.
The man was wearing a black balaclava at the time and gardaí are appealing for witnesses to come forward, particularly those living in the surrounding area between 4:30am and 5am on Sunday morning.
