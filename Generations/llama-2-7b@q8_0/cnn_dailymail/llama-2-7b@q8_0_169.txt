A homeless man could help unlock the disappearance of schoolgirl Alice Gross.
Police have been searching for the tramp who had been living on a railway embankment close to where the 14-year-old was laughing and joking before she vanished, sparking an international hunt.
Officers believe the man may have seen Alice – who has not been since August 28 – or know of her movements after she met friends on the canal bank near Brentford in west London.
He had previously been living rough around a mile away in Ealing, West London. The Metropolitan Police’s missing persons unit is now hunting for him as part of its investigation into Alice’s disappearance.
A source said: “We think he might be able to help us answer a few questions that we have about where Alice was and what she was doing on the day before she disappeared.”
The man has been described by officers as being in his late 40s, about 5ft 8in tall with short brown hair. He is believed to be either homeless or travelling around.
Alice’s mum Rosalind said last night: “I hope this man will come forward so that we can get some answers.”
