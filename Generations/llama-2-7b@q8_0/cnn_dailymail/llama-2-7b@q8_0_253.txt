‎out for the Australian drug traffickers after Indonesian President Joko Widodo rejected their pleas to stay alive.
The chilling reenactment of how executions are carried out in Indonesia which was broadcast to millions of viewers is set to become a brutal reality for Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran.
Time has run ‎out for the Australian drug traffickers after Indonesian President Joko Widodo rejected their pleas to stay alive, and refused any mercy overturning death sentences imposed by firing squad.
The pair are now awaiting a final decision from Bali’s governor Made Mangku Pastika before they are shot. It is not known how many days he has left to decide the fate of Chan and Sukumaran, who were convicted along with eight other people for drug trafficking after they were found in possession of heroin in 2005.
Chan’s wife Janet told Sky News host Peta Credlin earlier today that she was still hopeful her husband would be granted clemency by President Widodo, who said he had no power to stop the executions after his request for a one month extension was rejected.
“I am hoping that maybe we can get some help from Jakarta and Bali in helping Andrew and Myu win their clemency appeal,” Mrs Chan told Credlin.
“I’m really, really, really hopeful I think the Indonesian Government will see sense here and see they have made an error of judgment with this decision to go ahead and execute Andrew and Myu.
Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2006 for drug smuggling and sentenced to death after being found guilty of conspiring to traffic heroin into Indonesia from Australia. The pair have maintained they are innocent and have appealed the sentence, with Chan’s family even offering to pay $2 million in compensation to cover the cost of a new trial.
But as their fate hangs in balance, the Australian government has refused to interfere despite repeated calls by the Indonesian government for help from Canberra to stop the execution.
“We have been told there’s nothing more we can do,” Mrs Chan said.
