entee Paula Broadwell, who's said to be the woman at the center of the sex-scandal. Then there's Jill Kelley -- a socialite in Tampa, Florida, who was being investigated by the FBI for alleged harassing emails and has also become entangled with Petraeus and Broadwell. And then, there's his biographer, Stephan Talty.
But what is their connection? And how did they all become so connected to David Petraeus and each other?
It appears that the man at the center of this scandal met Kelley through her husband -- a military officer also being investigated by the FBI for harassing emails to another woman. Kelley was one of the women in town who could be counted on to throw parties and attract a crowd, according to Talty, who wrote Petraeus' biography "American Patriot: The Life and Wars of Colonel David H. Petraeus."
Talty and his wife were invited to these social gatherings, but their relationship with the Kelleys was more than that. They became friends. And that friendship seems to have blossomed into a bit of an intimate affair as well -- one that Talty had been having during his book tour while on the road from New York to Los Angeles.
"I got together with him (Talty) when I visited him in New York," Kelley told CNN's Barbara Starr, referring to the first time they met. "We were both married at that point and had an intimate relationship."
Kelley said Talty had written to her just three days before the scandal broke about a possible job opportunity.
"I wanted him to do some consulting for me," she told Starr, but Talty never responded.
It seems strange that Kelley would suddenly be emailing with Petraeus last spring -- after he'd left his position as the head of U.S. Central Command and was taking a sabbatical from Harvard University. After all, why wouldn't she go straight to the CIA director?
But then, Talty wrote about their relationship in his book, which came out this summer. He told CNN that he wasn't surprised that Kelley emailed Petraeus after reading the book and felt betrayed by him.
"I know from experience as a biographer that your subject is going to be angry if you write about things they don't want written," Talty said. "She had every right to be angry, but I don't believe she was angry at me."
He added: "It wasn't my intention to hurt her or David Petraeus in any way."
