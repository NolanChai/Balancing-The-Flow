The country has been in chaos for nearly five months after clashes erupted between two factions in Juba that eventually led to a civil war and Kiir and his supporters versus Machar and those loyal to him.
More than 20,000 people have died -- half of them civilians -- since the crisis began in December, according to the United Nations. The violence has forced more than two million South Sudanese from their homes, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
A new round of peace talks is scheduled for Wednesday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A first attempt at negotiations was canceled last week because of fighting near Juba.
The two sides have agreed to a 60-kilometer (37-mile) buffer zone along their lines of control where all shooting will be stopped, U.N. special representative David Shearer told CNN. The agreement is aimed at helping civilians who've fled their homes and farms in the area.
"It's an immediate relief to them," he said. "But it does create a problem for people because they are not able to move freely as before."
He added: "The real challenge ... is to try and ensure that this zone remains peaceful, and that if there's any fighting at all the parties are able to hold their fire and not engage each other in those areas."
South Sudan has faced a civil war since December, when Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. Machar denied the accusation, saying he was being targeted because of his ethnic background -- he's an ethnic Nuer, while Kiir is a Dinka.
The violence in South Sudan has led to what the United Nations calls "the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis." The U.N. warned last week that fighting in South Sudan could cause a famine, as well as wipe out much of the nation's cattle herds.
"If we don't get aid in quickly and help those people who have been displaced, then we will have a humanitarian catastrophe on our hands," Shearer said. "And that would be a disaster for South Sudan."
