low has caused the tanning industry to produce an increasing number of harmful products.
One such product is DHA – which stands for ‘dihydroxyacetone’ and is a chemical that creates a sunless tan in hours. It can be found in creams, sprays, lotions and even oral strips and is often sold as fake tan. However, DHA isn’t just used to create a temporary tan; it’s also added to tanning beds and used for sunbeds.
But, according to the UK government, DHA has been linked with a range of cancers including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer as well as other health risks like allergic reactions and nausea. So should you be avoiding fake tan? The short answer is yes!
You might be surprised to learn that some of your favourite celebs have gone without a fake tan on the red carpet. Take Meghan Markle for example: she has been known to let her naturally beautiful skin shine through and instead, opts for subtle makeup or none at all. Even A-listers like Emma Stone are often seen looking glowing but natural thanks to their own skin rather than a spray tan!
When it comes down to the brass tacks of it, you don’t need fake tans in order to look good on your wedding day. In fact, many brides who opt for an airbrush tan are left with orangey-brown or streaky skin after their big day is over. So why not go au naturel and let your real beauty shine through?
There’s no need to worry about getting a fake tan when it comes time for you to get married – there are plenty of ways that you can keep looking glowing without resorting to tanning products! If you want something subtle but still beautiful, then opt for a subtle highlight or contour instead.
If you’re really feeling confident in your skin, go all-out and try using some bronzer with an orange undertone so that it looks natural rather than too dark or streaky (you can apply this with foundation brushes).
As well as avoiding tanning products on your wedding day, there are plenty of ways that you can keep looking glowing all year round! Make sure to use a good moisturiser every morning and night so that your skin is well hydrated. You should also exfoliate regularly with an appropriate product for your skin type (don’t forget the elbows and knees).
You’re probably aware of the health risks associated with tanning products, but there are other ways that you can keep looking glowing without using them! Here are some tips to help:
Stay out of the sun as much as possible. If you do need to be in direct sunlight, make sure to wear a high SPF sunscreen and reapply it every two hours (or more often if sweating). You can also cover up with clothes that have UV protection built-in – this will help prevent skin damage from both UVA rays and UVB rays.
Use bronzer in lieu of fake tan – this way, you don’t have to worry about streaks or orangey-brown skin when it comes time for photos! Just make sure that your chosen shade matches up with the rest of your face so that no one notices where your makeup ends and begins.
Another way is by using self-tanning products instead – these tend to have a more natural look than fake tan but still give off some color if used correctly! They should be applied evenly across all areas of skin (including elbows, knees) before going out into the sun or other UV light source so that there aren’t any harsh lines where they begin and end.
Use a bronzer to contour your face instead of using fake tan – this will make you look more defined and natural than if you were wearing orangey-brown skin! Just remember: less is always more when it comes to makeup, so don’t go overboard with bronzing products on top of what already exists in nature.
Tanning beds are not the best option for getting a nice sunless tan – they produce UV rays that can damage your skin and increase your risk of developing skin cancer! If you must use one, make sure that it is equipped with protective shielding so that no harmful radiation enters through its openings (or use tanning lotions instead).
The sun’s ultraviolet radiation may lead to premature aging signs like wrinkles and saggy skin on the face as well as an increased risk for developing melanoma – this type of cancer typically forms in moles or freckles caused by overexposure from tanning beds during childhood years!
It can also cause cataracts which are cloudy areas within your eye lenses that reduce vision quality significantly over time if left untreated for too long (this usually occurs around age 40). You should try to avoid sun exposure altogether, especially when it comes to tanning beds.
If you’re looking for a tan on your wedding day but don’t want the harmful effects of fake tan or spray-on bronzer then consider using self-tanner instead! This product works by adding color to the skin from within without exposing any harmful UV rays like those emitted by tanning beds and sunlight alike.
It should be applied evenly across all areas of your face so that there aren’t any harsh lines where it begins and ends, which makes this method perfect for brides who want to look natural yet still glowing! Just remember: less is always more when it comes to makeup – use a bronzer instead of fake tan or spray-on products.
If you must have an artificial tan then consider using tanning lotions instead because they don’t contain harmful ingredients like DHA which can cause cancer in some cases (but this risk is significantly lower with low doses). These products also tend to be less expensive than those containing DHA so if budget constraints are holding you back from getting the glow without having to worry about cancer risks then consider giving tanning lotions a try instead!
The use of fake tan for your wedding day can lead to several health problems. It is best that you avoid using fake tan and opt for an alternative. Self-tanners are more natural ways to get that glow without the harmful chemicals. So, before deciding on a tanning product, consider the consequences of using them as well!
