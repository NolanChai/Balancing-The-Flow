ed gang broke into the house while they slept.
The intruders were so violent they smashed a window with a rock before dragging one of them through to prevent her alerting neighbours. Mrs Stiff tried desperately to stop them from leaving, but was hit on the head with the rock when she stepped out of bed during the raid.
Mrs Stiff said: 'Katie is devastated because of what happened - not just for herself but for the fact that it could have killed her baby. I didn't even know we had been robbed until I saw the broken window and saw some jewellery on the floor.' The burglars made off with two Rolex watches, a gold bracelet, Â£300 in cash and a set of golf clubs.
After they left, Mrs Stiff went into labour at 6am the next day and delivered her son Charlie nine days early. Katie had to undergo an emergency Caesarean section after developing pre-eclampsia - high blood pressure - as she was so frightened by the incident.
