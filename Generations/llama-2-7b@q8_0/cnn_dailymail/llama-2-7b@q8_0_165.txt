The court's decisions were among its most historic ever, according to many legal scholars, and paved the way for gay marriage in more than a dozen states. The high court also left open the possibility that other states could recognize gay marriage even if they choose not to do so on their own.
Still, 35 states continue to bar same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment or statute, and another six still ban it through voter referendum or other means.
As 2014 gets underway, here's a look at where the fight for gay rights stands in those states:
Alabama is among 35 states that ban same-sex marriage. Its constitution bars all state recognition of marriage except between one man and one woman. That provision has been on its books since 2006.
The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down key provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in June had no direct impact on Alabama because the state already bans gay marriages, said John Hurst, an attorney with Equality Alabama. The Supreme Court also struck down part of California's ban on same-sex marriage earlier this year.
"The ruling from the Supreme Court did not have any effect at all here in Alabama," Hurst told CNN. "In Alabama, we still don't recognize gay marriages."
Alaska was one of two states where a judge ruled to allow same sex marriage. In October 2013, U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess struck down Alaska's ban on same-sex marriages because it violated the U.S. Constitution's due process and equal protection provisions.
The state appealed that decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied a motion by Alaskan officials for an emergency stay in December while they pursued their appeal.
Arizona is among the states where gay marriage remains banned because of a voter-approved ballot measure that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The ban also was approved by the state's Legislature, which means it will be harder to overturn, said Victor Viramontes, an attorney with Lambda Legal, a national gay rights group.
"The Arizona law is unique because it bans all recognition of same-sex relationships and not just marriage," he told CNN. "It is a ban on any sort of official recognition of same sex couples."
Arizona's ban was upheld last year by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that the state has no obligation to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because it does not recognize civil unions. The ruling came in a case brought by two women who were denied a marriage license by an Arizona county clerk after they had a civil union ceremony in Iowa.
Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer has refused to appeal the decision, which means that same-sex marriage remains banned in the state.
"The people of our country are changing their minds on this and moving toward it," Brewer said in December 2013 after her office announced she would not seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. "That's the direction we need to go in, I think."
Arkansas is among five states that have banned gay marriage through constitutional amendment or voter referendum. The ban was approved by voters in 2004 with 75% of votes cast for it.
The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act does not impact Arkansas, which already bans same-sex marriage, said Rita Sklar, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Arkansas. But she thinks that could change soon because a federal court ruling last year overturned the state's ban on civil unions for gay and lesbian couples.
"In light of the Supreme Court decisions we are waiting to see what happens in Arkansas," Sklar told CNN. "We expect to have an update about our lawsuit by early this year."
California is one of 13 states that now allow same-sex marriages, after its voters approved Proposition 8 banning them in November 2008. The decision was overturned on June 26 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
"The ban never took effect because it had not been put into force," said Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California, one of the plaintiffs that challenged Proposition 8 in federal court before the state's highest court.
Kors says he is optimistic about same-sex marriage in California after the Supreme Court decision and believes other states will follow suit in 2014.
Colorado is among a handful of states where same sex marriages remain illegal but where there are lawsuits pending that could eventually overturn them, said Joanne Pedersen, executive director at the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
"I think we will see a number of decisions this year in the courts across the country," she told CNN, referring to pending cases in states like Colorado where same sex couples have challenged bans on marriage or other benefits.
Connecticut was among five states that approved same-sex marriage through legislation rather than court rulings or referendums.
Its ban on gay marriages was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to strike down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denied many legal benefits to married same-sex couples. The Connecticut legislature approved a bill that allows same-sex marriage last year; it took effect on October 1 after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signed it into law.
Connecticut was the third state in New England to approve same-sex marriages, following Massachusetts and Maine. A federal court had struck down Connecticut's ban on gay marriages last year but the decision was appealed by the state.
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling soon on two cases challenging the constitutionality of bans in Ohio and Kentucky that were approved by voters or legislatures. The justices will consider whether same-sex marriage bans in Michigan, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin also violate the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause because they deny benefits to same-sex couples who are legally married in other states.
In 1992, Delaware passed a constitutional amendment that banned recognition of gay marriages. A bill pending before lawmakers could overturn the ban if it becomes law.
"We think this is going to be an important year for same-sex marriage in Delaware," said Greg Smith, director of communications at the American Civil Liberties Union in Delaware. "If the Supreme Court rules that states have a duty to recognize marriages performed by other jurisdictions and they're not doing so then it would be likely to lead to same sex marriages being recognized here."
Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, the son of Vice President Joe Biden, has said he thinks same-sex couples should be allowed to marry in his state. His father has supported gay marriage rights since 2012.
In 2004, Florida voters approved a constitutional ban on gay marriages by a margin of nearly two-to-one. It was the first state to do so and has remained among the most difficult to change because of the amendment process for changing its constitution.
"I think we're looking at 2016," said Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, one of several organizations working with same-sex couples who want to marry or get other rights in Florida. "If we can pass a statewide bill we would have the ability to go directly to voters and overturn it."
In 2013, the Florida Legislature voted against a proposal that would have allowed gay marriages and civil unions. Smith said she is hopeful about same-sex marriage in Florida, given recent trends and support by more elected officials. She pointed out that last year's state legislative elections gave Democrats control of the Florida Senate for the first time since 1926.
"We are at a point now where we have a Democratic majority in the Florida Senate," Smith said. "I think it is possible to pass (a) bill, but it will not be easy."
Florida has one of three lawsuits that were consolidated by federal courts before the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling from the court could come early this year or later in 2014, Smith said.
In 2006, Georgia voters approved a ban on same-sex marriages after a divisive campaign that was heavily criticized as biased and misleading. The vote came two years before voters in California approved Proposition 8 banning same sex marriage there; both were approved with overwhelming support from conservatives.
A bill to allow same-sex marriages has been pending before lawmakers for more than a decade, but it faces stiff opposition and is not expected to become law this year despite increased support by Georgia's residents for gay marriage rights, said Jeff Graham, executive director of
