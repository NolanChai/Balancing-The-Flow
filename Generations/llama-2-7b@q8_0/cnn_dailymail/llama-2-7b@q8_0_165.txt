Williams, who is bidding to become only the second player after Billie Jean King to capture nine major singles titles, will face Roberta Vinci today for a chance to advance into next year’s elite eight-nation final four. The other American matchup is between No. 15 Sloane Stephens against Camila Giorgi.
The first set was marred by several lengthy delays as Williams had trouble getting the ball over the net and Vinci struggled with her timing, but both eventually began to find their rhythm in the final three games of the opening set.
In a see-saw battle, Williams saved three set points at 5-4 before she was broken serving for the set. At 6-5, Giorgi had an opportunity to win it on her serve, but Williams broke back when the Italian served a double fault and then held.
“I think my opponent played a really good match in the first set,” Williams said afterward. “She made me work hard for every point. I was able to hold it together.”
