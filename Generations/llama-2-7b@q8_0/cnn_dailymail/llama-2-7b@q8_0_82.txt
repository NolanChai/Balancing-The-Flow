The Gunners striker has been warned by his team-mates that he could face a lengthy ban if found guilty of the alleged assault.
He is under investigation for punching one of the supporters and also appearing to kick him at a training session on Sunday, following Arsenal's 1-0 win over Southampton in the FA Cup quarter-finals last weekend.
Bendtner was suspended for the game against Everton and has since been offered the chance to speak with chief executive Ivan Gazidis about his future at the club.
Gazidis said: "I can confirm that Nicklas Bendtner is under internal investigation, but I cannot comment further until we have completed our enquiries."
It's understood he could be fined by the club for his actions.
