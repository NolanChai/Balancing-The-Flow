Brown, 32, suffered concussion in the Heineken Champions Cup defeat by Racing 92 on Saturday and is likely to miss the rest of Harlequins’ campaign – which resumes with a European Challenge Cup quarter-final against Worcester next weekend.
The former England captain was taken off after he collided with Rory Kockott in the early stages at Stade Yves-du-Manoir and had to be substituted on his 246th appearance for Harlequins. He missed all of last season through injury, having suffered concussion during a Premiership game against Bath.
Brown’s latest injury is the most recent in a series of high-profile head injuries and comes two weeks after Exeter chief Rob Baxter admitted he was concerned about the “overt force” in rugby.
O’Shea, the Harlequins director of rugby, said: “It is obviously disappointing for Mike, but also the fact that there are so many concussions going on at the moment.”
