"The evidence suggests there is an association between mould and paranormal experiences," said Dr Caroline Watt from the University of Edinburgh. "Much remains to be learned about this area and we have plans for further research into this phenomenon."

In the mean time, if you see something white and misty, don't be alarmed - it could just be fungal spores from a building nearby.
