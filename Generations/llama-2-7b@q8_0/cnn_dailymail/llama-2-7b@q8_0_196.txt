2D images, you could soon be able to create and share them with friends. The latest version of Firefox is to include a new add-on called Web Animations API that will enable users to create animated GIF files on a website.
The web browser is also set to support GIFs created in HTML5 Canvas which means that more people could soon be able to share their creations with the world, as well as browse those posted by other users. Mozilla said the addition of Web Animations API and support for HTML 5 Canvas will come to Firefox sometime after version 27 arrives in early 2014.
While many web browsers are now able to view GIFs, none offer the ability to create them on-site. The new add-on could help Mozilla catch up with rival browser Internet Explorer and its own rival Chrome which both support HTML5 Canvas. Google also supports GIFs in its popular image sharing service Picasa Web Albums.
Web Animations API is a proposed addition to the HTML standard that will enable developers to create animations and use them across multiple websites using JavaScript. Mozilla’s add-on will allow users to drag and drop images onto a canvas to create animated GIF files, which can then be shared with other people through social networks like Twitter or Facebook.
The new version of Firefox is due to land on 24 November, just in time for the start of Firefox OS phones. The operating system from Mozilla will come preloaded on the first smartphones from ZTE and Alcatel in select markets next year, with more handsets set to arrive by 2015.
