 world away from his Hibby days when he was just another player who didn’t quite make it at Celtic Park and ended up in Edinburgh.
There has also been the embarrassment of a social media ban that followed a series of offensive tweets during the 2016-17 season, something Griffiths said he is now working hard to rectify after being dropped by Hibs last summer.
However, the main reason his old stomping ground seems more serene these days may be down to one man: David Milne. A former footballer, now a successful property developer, Milne has been building homes on Edinburgh’s waterfront for two decades and, as Griffiths puts it, “has been like a father figure” to him in the last six months.
“I’ve known Dave since I was about 17,” says Griffiths, sitting alongside Milne at his office at Fountainbridge on Tuesday morning, before they take part in an interview with the Evening News. “He was a big supporter of my football when I first came out to Hibs and he’s been there through good times and bad.”
The 26-year-old says Milne has played a huge role in helping him become a better person, as well as a more effective striker.
“He was the one who sat me down and said ‘Listen you have to change your ways’,” says Griffiths. “He was there through all that stuff last year. I know people will see it as selfishness on my part because of what happened but he had a lot more patience with me than I deserved, in terms of the things I said and did.”
Milne adds: “It’s hard to go down that road again. But Leigh was one of those players who you would have no hesitation in having him as part of your team. He works extremely hard off the pitch at his fitness. As a person he is a lovely guy and has never had an issue with me. We have always got on really well.
“I think when he went to Hibs, he was not getting the opportunities that he wanted. There were things he could have done differently but you look at him now and I wouldn’t say he is a 20-goal a season player because he has too much of an impact on games where he doesn’t score.”
Griffiths’ return to Celtic Park in November, after making his move to the club permanent for an undisclosed fee, came at an interesting time. Ahead of him, Hibs had just beaten Rangers 2-0 thanks to a first half goal from Leigh Griffiths, which meant they had climbed above their rivals into second place in the Championship.
The result prompted Hibs chairman Rod Petrie to tell The Evening News: “We are delighted with what we have achieved.” He was talking about the club’s achievements on and off the field during his tenure.
However, Griffiths has come under some stick for scoring against Rangers after he left Easter Road. On Twitter, one Hibby described him as a “b****** c***”. Another called him a “fat pig” while another said: “I’m glad to see you leave Leigh. Hopefully you fade into obscurity and are never heard of again.”
Griffiths says he didn’t read the comments but is aware they were there. He adds that he was only interested in joining Celtic because his team-mate Scott Allan, who joined Hibs from Hibernian last summer, had persuaded him to make a switch. “I was speaking to him after the Rangers game and I told him: ‘Don’t worry, they will say that but it doesn’t bother me,’” says Griffiths.
“I wanted to prove a few people wrong, especially after the stuff that happened last year and because of all the bad publicity about things I said and did on social media. Allan had a big influence in getting me to come here as well. He told me how well he was getting on at Hibs.”
However, Griffiths has already been criticised by some Hibs fans for his comments after scoring against Rangers. “I am not going to apologise,” says Griffiths. “I just said: ‘It’s good to be back.’” He admits he got a lot of stick from Hibs fans, but points out that Celtic fans were more supportive.
“My wife and kids are in Glasgow and I am living here [in Edinburgh] for a bit until they move down,” says Griffiths. “I was always going to come back at some point but I wasn’t expecting the reception from Hibs fans when I got back to Easter Road.”
Griffiths, who is expected to feature on Monday night against Spartak Moscow, admits that he has been surprised by what happened when he left Edinburgh. “I have been overwhelmed by how much support I’ve had from the Celtic fans,” says Griffiths. “My wife and kids are here for now but I want to get them down as soon as possible.”
Celtic have a deal to buy him back next summer if he reaches 20 goals in this season and, with six months left on his contract at Parkhead, it is unlikely they will let him go. Griffiths says: “I am still Celtic through and through and I will be until my time here is done.”
Griffiths’ return to the Scottish Premier League has also surprised those who have been following him over the past six years. “There was a point last year where he thought he was a bit better than everyone else,” says Milne. “He felt his social media profile was bigger than it actually is and he wanted to be treated like some sort of star.”
Griffiths admits that there were times when he acted inappropriately on social media but denies that this was down to arrogance. He said: “There are no excuses for what I did and I will have to live with it for the rest of my life. There were a couple of times last year, towards the end, where things got out of hand and I wish I could take them back.”
Griffiths admits he was drinking too much in 2016-17 but says that is no longer an issue and he has been trying to use his experience as a warning to others. “I was just being immature,” says Griffiths. “Everyone makes mistakes and it’s only when you look back on things like that you realise how bad they were.”
The 26-year-old is now working with the SFA, advising young people about social media abuse and has also started a website where he talks about his battle to become a better person. “I didn’t think I would ever be in that position but it’s made me stronger as a person,” says Griffiths. “I have taken on board what happened last year, so if there is one positive for me I can use my experience and help others.”
However, there was one aspect of his social media account which did not make him feel so bad – the number of followers who believed he was a victim of trolling. Milne, who was on hand to help Griffiths through some difficult times in recent years, says: “I am sure Leigh didn’t go out looking for that type of attention but it was clear there were people who genuinely felt sorry for him.”
Griffiths, who admits he struggled with depression and anxiety during the 2016-17 season, says: “I do regret some of what I said in retrospect but, at the time, it was something that I needed to get out. When you are dealing with issues like that, it’s easier if you don’t have to deal with other stuff as well.”
Griffiths admits that he has become a more effective striker since returning to Hibs in 2015 but says: “I am not here for my goalscoring stats. I can only do the best I can for Celtic and it doesn’t matter what the critics say.”
