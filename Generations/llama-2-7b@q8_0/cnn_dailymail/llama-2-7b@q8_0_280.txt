 which Tehran has lost control of its vessels while sailing through international waters near the Strait of Hormuz.
The 19-man Iranian crew left Qatar on January 26 to transport cement from Kuwait, but "was apparently adrift for days and reportedly took on water," according to a statement by U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region. The ship was taking on water when it contacted Iranian authorities.
The sinking occurred during heavy rains, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. "The vessel was sailing with a broken propeller and had sent its crew to rescue a fishing boat that was stranded in the sea," said an official from the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL).
An unnamed IRISL employee told Fars that authorities were alerted about the distressed vessel by maritime radio. "It seems the ship ran into bad weather, but we are investigating." The cargo ship sank early Sunday near Kuwait's Shuwaikh Island port, and the body of a crewman was found nearby.
Iran has lost control of at least five other ships over the past three years in incidents that were not disclosed to the public until later. Those included two tankers, which collided with other vessels near Kuwait. The military's Central Command said it rescued seven people from those shipwrecks.
"The U.S. Navy responded to the distress calls and recovered a number of Iranian crew members, but unfortunately three died in the accidents," said Capt. Timothy Hawkins, spokesman for Central Command. He did not provide details on how the ships lost control or what type of rescue operations were conducted.
Iranian authorities have refused to comment publicly about the shipwrecks. Iran's state-run media has only reported that they occurred during stormy weather near Kuwait, but it is unclear whether the ships had been adrift for days without contact with their home country before those incidents were reported.
The U.S. military's Central Command also did not explain how a cargo ship sailing in international waters came to be adrift. An IRISL official said he was unaware that the company had lost control of one of its vessels. Iran is the world's second-biggest exporter of oil, and about 20% of it goes through the Strait of Hormuz.
The area has been a focus for security concerns in recent years as tensions rise over Iran's nuclear program and threats from extremist groups in Iraq and Syria. Ships are often required to carry armed guards on board when sailing near the strait because of increased attacks by pirates, although they do not have authority to stop or board other vessels unless they pose a direct threat.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized 15 British sailors in March 2007 and held them for weeks after their boat strayed into Iranian territorial waters near the Iraq-Iran border. That incident prompted Britain to temporarily shut down its embassy in Tehran and a number of senior military officers from both nations met at sea to discuss how to avoid further confrontations at sea.
Another cargo vessel disappeared while sailing through international waters off Japan's coast last month, but it was eventually found floating with no sign of crew members on board. The ship had been under investigation by the Japanese Coast Guard because its owner failed to pay debts and fees after docking in a harbor, according to media reports.
Iranian authorities also lost control of an oil tanker off India's coast last year and later found that it was carrying cocaine worth more than $100 million. In 2011, the country lost three cargo vessels near Qatar and another one in the Strait of Hormuz.
