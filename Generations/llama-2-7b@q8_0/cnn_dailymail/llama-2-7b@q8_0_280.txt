ian-themed house of ill repute in Tampa was raided last week after neighbours complained about loud music and the sounds of sex emanating from it late at night.
When officers arrived, they discovered a fully functioning brothel with stripper poles and sex toys - but no illegal activity. The four women living inside - aged between 18 and 25 - told police that the property was used for 'social gatherings' and their employer had given them permission to live in the house, according to Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister.
The women were not arrested but were interviewed by deputies and released. The home belongs to 43-year-old Scott Lange, a married businessman who owns a construction company which builds new homes for high net worth clients in Florida. His wife was also present during the raid on the property in Old Seminole Heights in Tampa Bay but she was not arrested or charged with any offence either.
Sheriff Chronister said: 'This is a home that has been completely transformed into a brothel - there's nothing normal about this house other than it being valued at $2million.' The sheriff said that officers also found nude pictures and sex toys inside the property, which he described as 'abhorrent'.
He added: 'That is not acceptable behaviour for anyone in the community - let alone an owner of a home worth $2m. It's really disturbing on several levels.' The sheriff said that his deputies found nothing to suggest that any illegal activity was happening at the property but admitted they were left with no choice but to charge Lange.
The man, who owns the house, and his wife have been charged with operating an unlicensed business. It is not yet known what will happen to their marriage following the incident - or whether Lange's construction firm will lose clients as a result of this scandal. Lange has since sold his home for $1.4million - well below its previous valuation.
