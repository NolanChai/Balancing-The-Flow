17 years ago -- were executed by firing squad early Wednesday morning in Indonesia, there was hope that Veloso herself could be spared. It came from an unlikely source: the son of the nation's notorious former dictator, who has been trying to make amends for his father's brutal regime. The son, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who is also known as Puck or Puki, was a member of parliament in Indonesia until 2014, and she had written an open letter to President Joko Widodo expressing her "deepest sorrow" over the executions. Her letter didn't reach him before his deadline to sign off on the executions, but she delivered it Wednesday morning, just hours after the killing of the other inmates. It wasn't clear if her father's regime was responsible for Veloso's death sentence, which is based on the false testimony of an unreliable witness who said she was involved in a drug-smuggling plot 17 years ago when Veloso was 20 and living in Indonesia. But it did not seem to matter that much. After Veloso's execution at about 4:30 a.m., her supporters started showing their displeasure with the way the government had handled the case by ransacking the Indonesian Embassy in Manila, throwing eggs and tomatoes and breaking windows. Police were trying to restore order Wednesday afternoon as anger spilled into the streets of the Philippine capital, Manila. It was the worst violence since the election of Rodrigo Duterte, who has been a fierce critic of drug dealers. The 71-year-old president won office in May, promising to be harsh on crime and drugs in what is one of Southeast Asia's most lawless countries. His crackdown has claimed more than 3,000 lives so far, according to Human Rights Watch. It was not clear how many people have been killed by police or vigilantes. But even with that level of brutality, the execution of Veloso -- a mother who had been spared in previous cases after it was shown she was an unwitting drug mule for her former boyfriend -- caused widespread outrage on social media and led to a rare call to action from the Indonesian ambassador. "We hope the public will remain calm," Ambassador Dino Patti Djalal said Tuesday evening in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. "This is not just about an execution." He urged people to focus on other issues affecting Veloso, who was convicted of drug smuggling 17 years ago after police found heroin and cocaine in her luggage at an airport near Jakarta as she prepared to board a flight back home. A witness testified that Veloso's boyfriend had planted the drugs on her, but prosecutors have never revealed his identity or why he chose Veloso to be his drug mule. Prosecutors said they would appeal for clemency based on an Indonesian law that gives presidents discretion over drug sentences, but Widodo's spokesman, Johan Budiyono, said the President had signed a decree to execute all eight death row inmates "within hours," according to CNN affiliate iNews TV. Veloso was a mother of two young children when she was arrested in 2010 as part of a drug ring that involved at least six people from various countries, authorities said. But a spokesman for the Indonesian embassy in Manila told CNN that Veloso was only a "low-level" drug courier and her arrest should not have led to death sentence. She has said she had been recruited by a man named Maria to transport drugs from India, but it is still unclear why she was arrested or if the case against her had anything to do with former dictator Suharto's son Tommy Suharto, who was convicted of murdering a teenager in 2008. In a statement after Veloso was executed, the Indonesian Embassy in Manila said it was "deeply saddened and disappointed" by her death, adding that it had tried to save her life by presenting her case for clemency in court and writing to the President. "The government of Indonesia has always been consistent in its commitment not only to uphold all relevant international laws on human rights but also the dignity and value of human life," the statement said. The spokesman told CNN he didn't know if Veloso's case was being investigated as part of Tommy Suharto's trial, or why authorities never shared that information with her before she was arrested in Indonesia 17 years ago.
