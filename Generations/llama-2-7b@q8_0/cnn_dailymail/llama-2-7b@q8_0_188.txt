­should easily smash Sir Bobby Charlton’s record goalscoring tally of 49, and even his century of caps is within touching distance.
If Rooney could only keep up this kind of goal rate for a couple more years, he would soon be the greatest player this country has produced since Charlton himself. But it is not enough for England’s biggest talent to keep the same level in such an important match as tonight. The only way to guarantee goals and win the World Cup is to produce a performance that can lift you above your opponents and allow you to create your own luck on this occasion – the type of game where players must give it their all if they want to claim success.
There are few players in football capable of such a feat but there is one player, Lionel Messi, who has shown his ability in this way time and time again. The Barcelona forward will not win you a match on his own like Cristiano Ronaldo but he will create enough chances for a team to do so.
The fact that the England captain, Steven Gerrard, is currently out of favour with Roy Hodgson means that it was only ever going to be Rooney who would take the armband for tonight’s match.
What Hodgson did by choosing his star man as captain was right on one level but it does not represent the type of leadership needed if England are to stand any chance against a team like Argentina in this fixture.
Hodgson should have taken out Rooney and gone for a more experienced captain, such as John Terry or Ashley Cole, who may well be rested for the match anyway but could still bring that calm authority and guidance required at important moments of this game. The only man to take over from Gary Lineker as England’s all-time leading goalscorer has shown on many occasions that he lacks both the experience and the necessary mental capacity to lead an England side in a World Cup semi-final.
This is not Rooney’s fault, of course. He has been chosen because he has the best scoring record for this generation but it does mean that Gerrard will be sitting in the stand on Tuesday night when his team require someone with that winning experience and calmness to lead them to victory. This may seem like a small thing – even if England do win, Rooney will probably still be given man of the match – but Hodgson is not playing mind games here or trying to get under Argentina’s skin in any way. He just doesn’t have an experienced enough player to hand over the armband on this occasion and it could come back to bite him later in the tournament.
England supporters will be hoping Rooney can perform as a captain, whether he likes it or not – and if they do then there is every chance England fans will win again tonight.
