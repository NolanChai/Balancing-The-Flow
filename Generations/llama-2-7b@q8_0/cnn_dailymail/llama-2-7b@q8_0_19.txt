The Foxes are in deep trouble and could go down as they sit bottom of the table with just 14 points from their opening 20 games, while City have lost a club-record eight successive league games without scoring.
But if Nigel Pearson's men beat Manchester United on Sunday, Cambiasso says the relegation battle will be all but over and he would take great pride in being involved in such an achievement at his age.
The 37-year-old has only been playing regularly for City recently after a hamstring injury restricted him to just four Premier League starts prior to January, but now that he is back Cambiasso says he wants to make the most of it as long as possible.
He said: "It's always difficult when you have not won games or scored goals because we are all talking about what has happened in the past and how things were going before Christmas.
"We are thinking about what should be done now to change the situation and, if that is successful, we will start thinking about what has already happened.
"I know that people are talking about this being a bad season for me but I am happy because every day I think it could be my last in football.
"In Argentina they have an expression - 'que viva la vida' or something like 'live the moment'. In the Premier League you don't play more than five, six or seven years so you cannot say that we are going to play here for 10 years.
"I am enjoying myself a lot and I think this club is giving me a really good opportunity because they have a great manager in Nigel Pearson and I can see the fans supporting him more than anyone else in the team or in the club.
"People are asking why we lost those games but for me it's important to know that if we play like this every time we go onto the pitch then things will get better, and if it doesn't work then I want to stay here and try to change the situation."
