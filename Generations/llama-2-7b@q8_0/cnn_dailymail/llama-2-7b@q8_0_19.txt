18 times early Saturday morning on an access road near the medical center where he worked, according to investigators.
The victim was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. A motive for the shooting has not been released.
Gonzalez's death comes after a rash of similar crimes in the Houston area this year that left several doctors and dentists murdered or wounded in their cars or offices.
"It is possible the murders are related to professional association," Sheriff Ken Moll said at a news conference on Monday, according to CNN affiliate KTRK-TV. "We don't have any evidence to that effect yet, but we are looking into it."
In June, two men were arrested in connection with an attack on a dentist who was shot in his office outside of Houston. His wife was also killed in the incident.
And in May, a doctor and his 12-year-old daughter were found murdered in their home after they had been carjacked and robbed at gunpoint. In that attack, authorities say one man has already pleaded guilty.
