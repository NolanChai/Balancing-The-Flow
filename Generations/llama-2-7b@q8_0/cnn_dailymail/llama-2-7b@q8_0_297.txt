BBC Top Gear's presenter Jeremy Clarkson has been sacked by BBC. Clarkson, who has fronted the motoring show for 22 years, has become "a global brand", said director general Tony Hall in a statement released after an emergency board meeting on Sunday evening.
The BBC is to review its use of celebrity presenters and contributors, following the suspension of Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear. Clarkson was suspended � pending an investigation into the alleged assault of Oisin Tymon, one of his producers � on Thursday evening.
Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is a British broadcaster and writer specialising in motoring. He writes weekly columns for The Sun newspaper , TVTimes magazine , DrivingSport , and the Sunday Times, and used to write for the now-defunct weekly title Fast Lane .
Jeremy Clarkson 's days of being able to insult entire nationalities on live television are seemingly over. BBC 's Top Gear presenter has been suspended from his duties after allegedly punching a producer in the face and knocking him unconscious.
A British radio station is being investigated by Ofcom, the broadcast watchdog, after it offered its listeners free tickets to watch Jeremy Clarkson 's public execution on television next week. The offer from talkSport - which was removed from the website on Wednesday afternoon - came in response to an online poll asking if listeners would prefer a public hanging or live burial for Clarkson .
Jeremy Clarkson 's Top Gear days are numbered after BBC suspended him following claims he punched a producer. The host and star of the hit motoring programme has been suspended pending an investigation into an alleged �dust-up' with one of his producers in Chester, North West England
Jeremy Clarkson 's days at Top Gear may be numbered after he was reportedly suspended from BBC duties over allegations he had "punched a producer." The popular host and star of the hit motoring programme has been suspended pending an investigation into an alleged �dust-up' with one of his producers in Chester, North West England , on Thursday.
Jeremy Clarkson was born on April 11, 1960 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, UK as Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson. He is a writer and actor, known for The Grand Tour (2016), Top Gear (2002) and It's the Stupidity That Kills You (1994).
BBC has suspended Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson after he punched and injured one of his producers.
Clarkson, 55, is being investigated over a "fracas" with Oisin Tymon , who was working on the show at the time in Chester .
The BBC said it has launched an independent investigation into the incident that led to Clarkson's suspension from filming.
BBC Director General Tony Hall said: "It is with great regret and considerable sadness that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC has decided to terminate his contract.
"There cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another dictated by either rank, or public relations and commercial considerations - these rules apply to us all.
"In the last two weeks, Mr Tymon has very bravely put his side of the story in writing, giving a compelling account of what happened on that day."
A BBC spokeswoman said: "The BBC has taken swift action and Jeremy Clarkson will not film any further episodes of Top Gear . The incident happened more than two weeks ago and we've been investigating it since.
"We suspended Jeremy from the show on Thursday morning following a fracas with one of the producers, Oisin Tymon. We are taking legal advice and we will be talking to Mr Clarkson about how to proceed."
Tymon has not been available for interview as he continues to recover from his injuries, but in an email released by the BBC , he gave a detailed description of what happened on the day of the alleged attack.
He wrote: "I was informed that Jeremy would like to take me out for lunch before I began my annual leave and I agreed to meet him at 12.30pm in a public house within walking distance of his hotel, so that we could discuss various work-related matters.
"As I arrived and sat down with Jeremy, I said: 'I'm on annual leave now, so we don't need to talk about work.' He asked me what I wanted to drink and I ordered a Coke.
"Jeremy then became angry when the waitress delivered his food rather than mine and said something like, 'You shouldn't have got that until my order arrives'.
"I explained this was not the case, but he continued to be aggressive towards me. At one point, Jeremy lunged forward and I recoiled backwards, banging the back of my head on a stone pillar behind me.
"I don't know what could have caused his behaviour as we had never had any problems before and we were friends."
Clarkson was taken to hospital for treatment after sustaining facial injuries but has since been released.
A statement from Clarkson, Tymon and Top Gear producers said: "As you will no doubt be aware, a fracas happened on March 4 between Jeremy Clarkson and one of the show's producers. The producer was taken to hospital for treatment to cuts he received in that fracas.
"Jeremy has expressed his regret at what happened and it is clear from conversations we had with him over the last few days that he realises he made a big mistake by reacting as he did."
Clarkson was dropped by Top Gear 's previous production company, BBC Worldwide , earlier this year. The motoring programme has since been in limbo while bosses at the corporation try to find him a replacement.
He is expected to be offered an £80-a-year consultancy deal, which would enable him to continue making appearances on the show he has presented since 1988.
Top Gear 's executive producers, Andy Wilman and Rachel Yates , are also under investigation by the BBC following the alleged attack.
Tymon is a 36-year-old Irish citizen who was hired as a production assistant for Top Gear last summer to help out during filming of the show's annual winter special in the Arctic Circle .
He has also appeared on the show, providing the voiceover for a short film that featured Clarkson racing his own Porsche 918 against one of the show's stuntmen.
BBC bosses are now investigating whether the incident could be made into an episode of Top Gear . It is understood BBC executives have been discussing how to proceed with the investigation and have not yet decided if the storyline should make it on to air.
Announcing Clarkson's suspension, Hall said: "I am aware that many will be very angry about this decision - but trust me when I say it was not taken lightly or quickly."
He added: "We have a contract with Clarkson and his team. That is our starting point and we are meeting to discuss it in detail today. We want them back on air. Our focus now is on making sure that everyone affected receives the support they need. It's right and proper that we give all of those involved time to reflect on what has happened."

It is understood that, in light of the suspension, work on the next series of Top Gear will be put on hold.
The next episode is due to air on March 29. A BBC spokesman said: "BBC Two has an array of other shows airing from Monday 17th March."
Clarkson's contract was last renewed in October, when it was extended for two years with the option of another year if he met certain ratings targets. He had originally signed a three-year deal with the corporation in July 2005 which is due to expire at the end of this month.
He has also been offered £80-a-year consultancy terms, enabling him to continue making appearances on Top Gear . The presenter's salary was £160,000 a year. BBC bosses had hoped to start discussions over his future in the new contract earlier this week but were forced to postpone them because of the allegations that have now led to Clarkson being suspended from all BBC programmes.
