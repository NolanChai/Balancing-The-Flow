 
Officers were alerted on April 5 by an alarm at Hatton Garden Safety Deposit LTD, but only sent two officers to check its offices in Finsbury Square after the security company warned it had been broken into overnight.  
However, when they arrived at 7am, they saw no signs of any break-in and left - not realising that thieves had cut through an air vent behind the building to get in and stolen millions of pounds worth of jewels. 
Incredible footage shows the moment a worker found himself face-to-face with one of the robbers - who was armed with a crowbar - after he came back on April 7 for an 'inventory'.  
The thieves returned three more times over four days, before police finally raided Hatton Garden Safety Deposit LTD in Finsbury Square on Tuesday. 
Six suspects have already been arrested as part of Operation Elveden - but many experts fear there could be hundreds of millions of pounds worth of jewels stolen from the vaults, which had been broken into through an air vent behind the building to get in.  
The first dramatic footage shows how one worker who opened up the safety deposit box storage facility at 7am on April 5 - before he left after seeing no signs of a break-in. 
However, two days later, workers returned and found themselves face-to-face with a man armed with what was believed to be a crowbar as they entered through a service door to the back.  
The second worker can be seen walking up to a set of metal shutters - which are believed to have been broken into using a crowbar or other tool 
As he approaches, another worker turns around and points at him before looking to his left where there is what appears to be a man with a masked face holding a weapon in front of him. 
He then walks towards the pair and tells them: 'Just to let you know I'm here' - before the clip cuts off, suggesting he was stopped by security staff or police. 
The worker, who is wearing white overalls and a hat, can be seen walking up to a set of metal shutters, which are believed to have been broken into using a crowbar or other tool.

The thieves returned three more times over four days - but police only raided Hatton Garden Safety Deposit LTD after the sixth visit on Tuesday, April 21.  
'It would be an understatement to say I am disappointed with the lack of response from the Met Police,'  said Mark Jenkins, director at security firm Chubb.     
A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: 'Officers attended Finsbury Square shortly before 7am on Friday, April 5 and saw no evidence to suggest a break-in had taken place.'  
The Met Police would not reveal how much money the force could be forced to pay out. 
However, experts believe it may run into the hundreds of millions of pounds - meaning the force's insurance company may refuse to pick up the tab for compensation to the business owners.  
Dubbed 'one of London's biggest burglaries ever', police are now investigating whether 215 workers are complicit in the raid, which has been linked to other similar attacks around the capital over recent months. 
One security worker at Hatton Garden Safety Deposit LTD told MailOnline: 'I worked there for two years - and I think it was a big mistake leaving that place unattended.'   
One of the workers can be seen walking towards the pair - who appear to have been stopped by a member of staff or police, after he tells them: 'Just to let you know I'm here' before the clip cuts off. 
The worker is believed to have returned on April 7 at around 2pm and was asked for an inventory by managers - as part of standard checks. 
A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: 'Officers attended Finsbury Square shortly before 7am on Friday, April 5 and saw no evidence to suggest a break-in had taken place.'
