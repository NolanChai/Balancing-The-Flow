​Menendez has been charged with bribery, conspiracy and false statements related to his acceptance of gifts and contributions from Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen.
The investigation began when Menendez intervened on Melgen’s behalf in contract negotiations between the Medicare program and a portfolio of medical practices that Melgen co-owned, including one where Menendez underwent eye surgery in 2013, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department. The pair were accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of flights on private jets to Paris, Spain and the Dominican Republic.
The Senate Ethics Committee announced it was launching an investigation into Menendez last month. This morning, the panel’s chairman said that the committee would consider holding a hearing on the matter as soon as this week.
Menendez has not yet entered a plea in response to the charges filed against him today.
Melgen also faces federal bribery and conspiracy charges related to his dealings with Menendez.
