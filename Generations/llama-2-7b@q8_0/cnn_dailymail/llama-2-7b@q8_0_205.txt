1860 Munich of his desire to leave, but he is now in talks with the Italian club over a proposed switch. "We have talked and agreed on an important part (of a contract)," Dzeko's agent Nurettin Sari said to German news website kicker.de. Milan director Ariedo Braida confirmed the discussions last week, while Italian sports daily Tuttosport has claimed that the player has already signed a five-year deal with the Rossoneri, although Wolfsburg are reportedly demanding around $30 million for his services. "I will probably play at AC Milan next season," Dzeko told German TV station ZDF. The 24-year-old would be an excellent replacement for Antonio Cassano and Robinho, both of whom have been linked with moves away from the San Siro in recent weeks.
Milan eye up $30 million swoop for Dzeko

This would be a great signing and a very good replacement for Robinho, he would fit in really well at the San Siro. He can also play as a winger which will be good when Robinho gets back from injury and Milan have no other options up front then Cassano or Seedorf who I think should play in midfield with their talents being wasted upfront. Dzeko is young so he could potentially stay at the San Siro for the next 10 years, this would be a very good signing if it happened, it's not definite yet though and it could still happen.
I don't know much about him but i have seen some videos of him on youtube playing for wolfsburg in european matches against teams like arsenal and ac milan and he looks good at the very least but I agree with you 100% he would be a great replacement for robinho, not that we'll miss him as much as most of us think.
I am sure he is an excellent striker, just watched his highlights on youtube (the one where they did a quick review of the players in the league) and he looked very good. He looks a great replacement for Robinho too although he's young so if Cassano were to leave as well then Milan would have some problems upfront.
I think it should be a good move, Milan need more striker options. I really don't know how good or bad Dzeko is, but you never know until you try. If this transfer materialize, I hope he scores enough goals to get Milan to CL next season!
He is very talented and has a lot of potential, it would be nice if we could sign him before the summer transfer window closes because he's 24 so he will only get better as time goes by. He will also add depth and competition for places in attack.
I really don't like this move...
It feels like Moggi is still in charge of the club..
Milan have a lot of issues with strikers and they're spending millions to buy another striker that's not better than Cassano, Seedorf or even Borriello. It just doesn't make sense for me at all...
He's very good though and if he does come I hope he scores a lot of goals for us!
I like the signing.. He seems to be talented enough to play with Milan but I think we should not spend much money on him, unless Borriello leaves. We need more defensive midfielders than strikers right now. If Cassano or Seedorf leave we have enough options already.
I hope this transfer is finalised as it's a good one and he could be used as the main striker when Robinho gets back from injury too, but I think Dzeko will be more suited to playing further forward rather than in midfield, he can play anywhere upfront though. Borriello may not leave if this transfer does happen, although Cassano could go and Milan have been linked with a few strikers recently so it's all possible.
It doesn't really matter what position Dzeko plays as long as he gets the goals. I think Cassano is more likely to leave than Borriello because he has struggled to get into the side after his injury and Seedorf is ahead of him in the pecking order. It would be nice if we could get one more striker but I don't know how much money Berlusconi wants to spend this year, it should still be enough though.
