ed in a scene, they are nearly impossible to spot at first glance...
The wacky photographs were taken by French artist and photographer Guillaume Herbaut, who has been working on his new book called 'Camouflage'. His work is inspired by military camouflages but he also uses his creative skills to put models into a scene with the ability to blend right in.
The incredible images are part of a book by French photographer Guillaume Herbaut and were taken in different countries around the world, including Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, as well as parts of France.
Camouflage: Where's Wally? meets Photoshop
These are some amazing shots. I just love to see how each person blends into their surroundings. They are truly works of art! I would like to know if the people in these photos are aware that they are being photographed. In some of the photos you can't even tell there is a person until you zoom in on them and focus in on details, then you can see how they blend right into their surroundings. I bet that it must take quite a bit to get just the right amount of detail so they don't stand out too much but not so little that you would miss seeing one at all.
These are some cool shots!
Wow! Great work!! Amazing and beautiful...
This is incredible. I love these photos.
