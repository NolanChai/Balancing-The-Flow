yepiece in Alaska's Denali National Park.
Drumm was shooting from a small blind at about 60 yards away when he realized that something wasn't right. 'I turned around and saw the bear coming up behind me,' Drumm told ABC News. 'It took me off guard, but I knew enough not to move.'
The bear circled Drumm for more than ten minutes before deciding to investigate his camera and lens. It sniffed the eyepiece and then started licking it - a sign of curiosity rather than aggression. 'I was kinda amazed by the whole thing,' Drumm told ABC News, but he didn't try to intervene or distract the bear.
Drumm has been shooting for about five years and now works as a freelance photographer. He's just returned from Antarctica where he got up close with penguins. 'I had heard that polar bears can get aggressive around cameras, but it was one of those things you don't think would actually happen,' Drumm said.
