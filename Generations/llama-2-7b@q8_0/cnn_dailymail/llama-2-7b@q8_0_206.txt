ool asked an excellent question, and instead of answering it, the Commander in Chief took the opportunity to lecture the young man about the Constitution.
“Osman, I’m going to answer your question but before I do,” said Obama. “You might want to take notes.”
Obama then went on a three-minute rant about how the press has no right to ask him tough questions and that reporters are required by law to give his answers uncritically, or else risk being thrown in jail.
“We have freedom of speech here in America, Osman,” Obama continued. “That means you can say whatever you want without fear of reprisal from the government.”
Osman was visibly shaken after the president’s diatribe but he held his ground. After Obama finished speaking, the boy took a deep breath and asked his original question again: Why do you lie to us? The crowd erupted in cheers.
“Wow,” said Osman as he walked away from the lectern. “That was totally awesome.”
