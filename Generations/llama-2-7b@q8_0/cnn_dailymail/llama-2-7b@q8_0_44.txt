The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer.
Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers with Apert syndrome - which makes his head bend backwards and can also lead to hearing loss.
He is now unable to walk or eat properly because of the condition but his parents said they would rather he died than continue living like that.
Doctors have told them their son will be unlikely to survive for much longer, saying he was likely to die in the next two weeks from a suspected brain haemorrhage.
Mr Ahirwar has admitted it is now time for his son to go and that they should end his suffering so they can be with him as he dies.
He said: “I am very sad but at least I know my son will not have to suffer anymore. It’s better we end his life rather than let him continue.”
