10 seconds of the opening session and a left hand finished him off with 67 seconds remaining on the clock to seal a 24 second knockout victory, as well as the biggest win of his career. McGregor's only previous defeat came at the hands of Nate Diaz in March 2016, but this was an emphatic response. Poirier had been tipped by some to take the Irishman deep into the later rounds - a prediction that proved completely unfounded as he found himself unconscious on the canvas within two minutes. McGregor's first title shot since April 2016 could come next year when he is scheduled to fight interim champion Max Holloway, who beat Brian Ortega by decision at UFC 231 earlier in the evening.
UFC featherweight champion Max Holloway was left with a suspected broken jaw following his successful title defence against Brian Ortega at UFC 231 on Saturday night (December 8). "The Korean Zombie" Chang Sung Jung claimed a unanimous decision victory over Dennis Bermudez in the co-main event, while former welterweight champion Tyron Woodley stopped Darren Till after five rounds.
