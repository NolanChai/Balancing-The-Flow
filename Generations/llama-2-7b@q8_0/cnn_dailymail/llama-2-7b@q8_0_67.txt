afeteria at his high school last week and boasted about where he’d got it, according to police.
The boy, who is a freshman, had reportedly stolen the money from his 54-year-old grandfather earlier that day when the man left him alone while making a bank deposit. When he returned home, the boy’s grandmother told him that her husband had been robbed of $25,000 in cash and that it was missing from his car. The boy allegedly confessed to stealing the money after being questioned by authorities but claimed he hadn’t given it all away; he said he’d kept some for himself.
The child reportedly gave out wads of $100 bills in cafeteria lineups at his Medina high school as well as to other children during lunch, telling classmates that his grandfather had paid him for doing chores. He also allegedly told friends where he’d found the money and instructed them to take it from their parents if they wanted some.
The boy’s family took him in for questioning after his grandparents received reports of what he was saying at school, according to police. When confronted with claims that he had given out stacks of cash, the child allegedly confessed to stealing it from his grandfather and handed over $800, telling officers he’d kept some for himself.
He also told authorities where he’d hidden the rest of the money, which was later found in a nearby cornfield by police after an extensive search. He will now likely be charged with theft and given probation.
