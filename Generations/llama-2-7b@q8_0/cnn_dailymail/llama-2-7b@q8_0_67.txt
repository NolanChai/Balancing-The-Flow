­Bulldog with the cute little bat’s wings for ears is an endearing character who will bring smiles to everyone he encounters.
However, despite his looks of cuteness and charm, Alan has a tough life ahead of him as he has been diagnosed with a heart condition that could shorten his life dramatically unless he gets proper treatment soon. His owners, ­Nicole and John Bragg who are based in Birmingham, have had the pooch since birth but only recently found out about his ­condition.
The couple were told by vets that Alan’s heart was enlarged and had fluid around it – a condition called ­pulmonary stenosis. This means that blood is flowing back through the heart into the lungs which makes them fill with fluid. It can lead to breathlessness, coughing and even death in dogs and cats.
“He’s only five-months old but he’s been showing signs of his condition for a couple of months,” said Nicole. “When we were told about it at the vet we were shocked because he doesn’t really look ill. He hasn’t lost any weight or anything and he certainly is not looking like he has been sick with a cold.”
Pulmonary stenosis is present in many animals and although there are several different types, most cases are inherited. This means that the dogs have inherited one or two genes from their parents which predispose them to develop the condition. The other main cause of pulmonary stenosis is a disease called rheumatic heart valve ­disease which may occur in older dogs and cats as they become affected by heartworms.
Nicole, who works at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, has been told that her beloved pet will need major surgery on the valves of his heart to replace or repair them. “The only treatment is to operate to replace all four valves in the heart,” Nicole said. “He would have two replaced and two repaired. It costs around £5,000 for this operation alone but without it he will be dead within six months.”
But that’s not all as Alan also has a congenital heart defect called aortic stenosis where there is an abnormality in the valve which controls the flow of blood leaving the heart and into the body. “He could also have an irregular heart beat or atrial fibrillation, but this hasn’t been diagnosed yet,” said Nicole.
“The problem with a dog like Alan is that you can’t see how ill it really is as they look quite healthy – that is until something goes wrong,” she added. “But there are other animals out there who have been through the same thing and lived to tell the tale.”
Nicole has set up an online campaign page which aims to raise funds so that Alan can receive the necessary treatment he needs in order to live a long, happy life. So far, the couple have managed to gather just £150 of the £5,000 needed but they are hoping to reach their target before Christmas.
“Alan is such an affectionate dog and loves nothing more than cuddles,” said Nicole. “He’s a lovely pet who we would do anything for.”
