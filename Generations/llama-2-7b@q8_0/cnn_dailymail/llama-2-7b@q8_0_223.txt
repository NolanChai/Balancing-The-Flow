New Zealand has been captivated by the royal couple since they touched down over two weeks ago. As the Duchess of Cambridge neared the end of her pregnancy - the couple will soon have their second child - she was met with gushing crowds as far as the eye could see, and a legion of royal fans hoping to get up close and personal. Here are some of our favourites...
Jillian Rae - Auckland, New Zealand: 'I'm an English teacher from Wellington in New Zealand,' said Jillian, who was decked out in Union Jack face paint. 'I just love the Royals, I think they're amazing people.'
Sarah Breen – Cambridge, England: 'I was here for a wedding and loved it so much that I came back,' says Sarah, whose hat is adorned with a giant yellow feather. 'The atmosphere is wonderful; everyone is just so friendly and happy.'
Anna-Marie Fletcher - London, UK: Anna-Marie has been to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge three times during their tour - her first time was for Kate's wedding in 2011. 'I'm from London but I've come here to New Zealand because my family are living here at the moment,' she explained. 'It's such a special occasion; they're such good people, such lovely people.'
Holly – Cambridge, UK: Holly is a first-time royal fan. She has been in Auckland for nearly two weeks to see William and Kate as part of a working holiday. When asked why she had come all the way from the UK, Holly said: 'Because they're really nice people...I'm not sure what I expected but it is very different to what we experience at home.'
Lisa Sutcliffe - Brisbane, Australia: Lisa was in London on a trip to see her daughter when William and Kate married. She said she has been back every year since for the royal wedding anniversary as it's 'the only thing to do'. A mother-of-two with one husband and three children, this is Lisa's first time in New Zealand and she said she was loving it so far: 'It's really beautiful here...it's very nice weather too.'
John Ritchie – Brisbane, Australia: John was at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011. He had been to New Zealand many times before for work and said he loves it so much that he has decided to move here permanently. 'I have friends who live there,' he explained. 'It's a beautiful place.'
Anthony Squire – Cambridge, UK: Anthony has seen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge three times in New Zealand for royal occasions; their wedding, the Jubilee and now on their tour of the country. A keen Royalist who said he had always been interested in the monarchy ever since he was young, Anthony described William and Kate as 'very down to earth and normal' and explained that he loves the fact they are so approachable: 'When you're at a big royal event it is quite daunting,' he said. 'The way they just walk amongst everybody and are very friendly means they can relate to people...they don't put on airs and graces.'
Anne-Marie Squire – Cambridge, UK: Anne-Marie has been in New Zealand for four days and said she had already seen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge twice. 'It was amazing,' she said. 'We love them to bits; they are just brilliant people...they're very down to earth.'
Tammy Chung – London, UK: Tammy is from Hong Kong but has been living in London for ten years where she works as a manager at The Royal Exchange shopping centre in the City of London. She said that William and Kate were 'very caring people' who are 'easy to relate to'.
Helen Tuck – Cambridge, UK: Helen has seen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge four times since they got married - she was even at their wedding, which is a tradition amongst her family. A retired teacher from London with five children and nine grandchildren, Helen said that the royal couple were 'lovely' and that she loved the fact they had decided to become parents again: 'I think it's fantastic,' she said. 'They are lovely people...they will bring up their child with love.'
Pamela Barker – London, UK: Pamela has been a member of the Royal Family Fan Club for 30 years and has travelled to New Zealand twice before to see William and Kate; once on their wedding anniversary in 2011 and then this year during the royal tour. 'I think they are very down to earth,' she said, adding that she was 'delighted' that William and Catherine were going to have another baby.
Joan Drew – London, UK: Joan has been a member of the Royal Family Fan Club for 41 years and said that she loved New Zealand - she was even married here once upon a time. A grandmother-of-three with five children, Joan described William and Kate as 'lovely' people who were 'very down to earth' and added: 'The royal family is an institution; they are the people we look up to.'
