A father has hit back at critics who left racist comments on a picture of him adeptly taking care of his two young daughters. When Los Angeles, California resident Doyin Richards shared the heartwarming image with his 69,000 Twitter followers this week it was quickly inundated by hundreds of hateful tweets from bigoted trolls who left comments such as “Baby snatcher” and “Why don’t you just go home?”
Richards has been sharing photos of himself looking after the youngsters on his social media for years, but this weekend he was flooded with messages from those expressing their disapproval at him being a black dad. In response to all of these vile tweets and hate-filled posts, Richards posted an emotional blog explaining how it made him feel, and encouraged fellow black dads to also share their pictures online. He told Huffington Post:
“I have always felt that my daughters’ best interests would be served by a loving father who is available for them whenever they need me, who lives in the same community as their mother and who has the time, energy and financial resources to support them emotionally, physically and materially.
“Having grown up without a father myself, I always knew that was something I wanted for my children. It is very difficult for many fathers like me to achieve that goal. Our communities are inundated with violence and crime, economic disparities abound and the stress of work can often keep us from spending quality time with our families.
“I’ve been raising my daughters alone since their mother left home when they were babies and I have never taken this responsibility for granted.”
In his blog post Richards explained how he felt when he saw all those vile tweets: “I was saddened by the comments, but not surprised. They are part of a bigger trend in our society that suggests it is okay to publicly attack black men who are raising their daughters in communities where many are struggling to make ends meet.” He added:
“Most people don’t understand how hard it can be for a man to become the best possible parent he can be when his circumstances, community and society don’t support him. I would like to invite all fathers, including those who may not be raising their daughters by themselves, to share images of fatherhood on social media using hashtags such as #BlackFatherhood or #MyBlackFamily.”
Richards concluded: “I think that black dads can change the world. It is up to us to do so.”
