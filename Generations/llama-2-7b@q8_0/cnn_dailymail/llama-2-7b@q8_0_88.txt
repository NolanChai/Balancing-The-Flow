end said: "It's puberty, not procreation."
"The second time you find a penis, it is too early to have sex," he added.
The contestant replied, "What is the first?"
During his interview on Wednesday, the host of Jeopardy said that he was shocked by the response. "I thought I had heard every possible answer before this one came up in a recent taping," Trend wrote in an Instagram post. "My mouth dropped when I read it."
Alex's wife Emma is also the host of Jeopardy, and she responded to the incident by saying: "Donâ€™t know what you just did but it made me feel like crying."
This was not the first time that Trend has come across a question that he felt uncomfortable with. Last week, viewers were shocked when he said in response to a question about "What is penis envy?": "I don't want any of your penises."
