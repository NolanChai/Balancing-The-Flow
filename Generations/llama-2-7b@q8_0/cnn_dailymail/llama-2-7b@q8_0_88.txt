A Hong Kong woman who was jailed for 18 days after whistling at police has launched an appeal against the sentence, her lawyer said on Wednesday.
The 25-year-old was handed a 14-week jail term last week by a local court over her conduct in front of a march to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre earlier this year.
She has now taken her case to Hong Kong's Court of Appeal, claiming that she should have been allowed to express her opinions on political matters without being charged with offences.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested by police after refusing to stop whistling and walking alongside a group of other people during a march earlier this year in Hong Kong.
The woman - wearing a white mask and a black shirt - is seen shouting at protestors before whistling towards the police horses as they move down the street. The incident took place on July 1, when tens of thousands gathered in Hong Kong's streets to mark the 24th anniversary of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown.
The woman is later seen to be standing next to a man who is being arrested by officers. He had reportedly been involved with another protester throwing an egg at police horses, according to local media reports. The pair were found guilty of causing public nuisance in court earlier this month.
