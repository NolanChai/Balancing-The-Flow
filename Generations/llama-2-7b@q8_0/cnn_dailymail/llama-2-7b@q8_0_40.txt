An Australian family who put more than half a million Christmas lights on their house have claimed a world record - for the second time. Father-of-three David Richards from Canberra first won the title in 2015 with his display, which includes an inflatable Santa and reindeers, but had to relinquish it last year when new entrants took over. However he's back on top of the leader board after being certified as the record holder by the Guinness World Records organisation. Mr Richards said: 'I didn’t expect to win the record for a second time, but I’m extremely excited and proud'.
