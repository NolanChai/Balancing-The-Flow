ag order to journalists covering the upcoming elections in 2015.
On January 27, 2014, the Media Services Act was passed by Parliament and signed into law by President Jakaya Kikwete on February 3. The media now have 60 days to apply for licenses under the new law. If they fail to do so, they will lose their right to operate freely in our country.
The government says the Media Services Act is designed to protect and promote freedom of expression, but that's not how it works in reality.
Under this legislation, media houses will have to obtain licenses from the Broadcasting Council at a cost of $50,000 (USD) for radio stations and $37,000 (USD) for television stations. They must also pay an annual fee of $15,000 (USD).
Furthermore, if they fail to renew their licenses every three years or do not comply with the government's directives, their operating licences will be suspended and the media will be forced to close down. This means that media houses must pay a total of $105,000 (USD) to operate in our country for each broadcasting cycle of 3 years!
In addition, the Media Services Act imposes stiff penalties on media houses and journalists who violate its terms. They could face up to seven years imprisonment or a fine of $15,000 (USD) for each day they broadcast without a license.
This legislation also places severe restrictions on the content that can be broadcast. Media houses will have to obtain permission from the Broadcasting Council if they want to air "any message that may undermine the public interest and national unity." And if any media house wants to conduct a poll, they must first apply for approval from the National Electoral Commission (NEC).
This is a serious threat to freedom of expression in our country. If this law goes ahead as planned, it will be very difficult for Tanzanians to get accurate information about their government and political leaders. It will also stifle debate on important issues such as corruption, poverty and human rights abuses.
We need your help to stop the Media Services Act from becoming law in our country! Please take action now by signing this petition calling on President Jakaya Kikwete and Parliament Speaker Rebecca Kadaga to repeal or amend it immediately. Together, we can make sure that freedom of expression is protected in Tanzania!
