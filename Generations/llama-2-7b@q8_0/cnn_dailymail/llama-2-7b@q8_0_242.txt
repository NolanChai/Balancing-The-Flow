igrini’s side are now eight points off leaders Leicester with six games remaining.
However, Pearce says it is unfair to judge a man that was not given sufficient funds during his first season in charge at Eastlands.
Pearce told Sky Sports: “I think the biggest problem Manchester City have had this year is they didn’t make the signings they needed to strengthen their squad. They could get away with it last year because of what happened in the FA Cup, but this year they didn’t.”
“He has a very good record as a manager – he got Villarreal into the Champions League and I think that is his biggest achievement.”
“The team won’t be performing like this if you look back to how it performed when Roberto Mancini was in charge. He changed it around, he brought young players in, gave them chances. But this year it has stalled a little bit.”
City face Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur before the season’s end and Pearce admits both games will be tough, but feels they can still achieve something special if they get on a good run of form.
“The two remaining games against Arsenal and Spurs are going to be very difficult,” he said.”If City win those two games I think we could go into the last three games feeling that we have an opportunity, even though you would say Leicester would be favourites to win it. The way they are playing at the moment is exceptionally good. But if City can pull it off then you never know what might happen.”
“I don’t think anyone really expected them to go out of the Champions League after a couple of defeats, so I wouldn’t rule them out because it just shows how quickly things can change in football,” Pearce added. “They are still favourites to finish second and they will be going into those remaining games with that mindset.”
City face Arsenal on Sunday before heading to Spurs a week on Wednesday, and I think City fans should prepare for a difficult ride against two of the Premier League’s best sides. Both teams have plenty at stake with both battling for Champions league qualification. But with the club not even in control of their own destiny anymore, Pearce may be right that they could still finish second if results go their way.
It is a real shame to see how City’s title challenge has unravelled so quickly and it does appear Pellegrini will not get any more time to turn things around in the remaining games this season.
