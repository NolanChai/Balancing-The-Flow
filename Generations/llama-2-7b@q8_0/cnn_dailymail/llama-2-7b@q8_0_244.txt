The duo met while attending college in Hawaii, but have since been jetting around together, with their first trip to Paris being the inspiration for a new series of photos.
Together they have created The Honey Pop, which sees them taking candid snaps and selfies throughout the world's most incredible cities - including Miami, Ibiza and Bali.
The duo have even been snapped by the likes of Kate Moss, who took a photo of herself posing with Jay at Coachella last year, calling him 'a living doll'.
Jay, from Los Angeles, California, is a model for H&M, Calvin Klein and Abercrombie & Fitch, while Alexis is a professional surfer. The duo met while studying in Hawaii - and they've been inseparable ever since.
Their jetset lifestyle has seen them jet off to Ibiza, Bali, Miami Beach and the French Riviera this year alone. But the couple still manage to find time for each other in between their busy work schedules.
When not working together on The Honey Pop or modelling separately, Jay is a full-time student at USC's Marshall School of Business with a major in entrepreneurship and marketing. He hopes that one day he will be able to start his own business.
Alexis has been surfing for the past ten years. She also holds degrees from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (CA) as well as California State University Long Beach, where she studied communications and media.
