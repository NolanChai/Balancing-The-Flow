, and Roderick Dantzler, 20, were arraigned for felony murder as well as aggravated assault, false imprisonment and other counts. The fourth teen charged in the death of 16-year-old Justin Smith was not present in court Monday because he is being held at a juvenile detention facility, authorities said.
All four defendants are accused of beating Smith to death on November 27. Police say Smith died after being stomped and punched by the teens when they mistakenly thought that another teen, who was actually not at the party, had raped one of their girlfriends. The case is currently in Gwinnett County State Court but will be moved to juvenile court soon, according to police.
