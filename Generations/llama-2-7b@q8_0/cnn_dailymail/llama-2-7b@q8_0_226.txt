By Lee Moran These are the ‘Ghost’ killer thugs pumped up on steroids who are proving key to keeping Syria’s brutal President Bashar Assad in power.
Covered in tattoos of images of their leader, they are among a secretive army known as “Shabbiha” (“Ghosts”) that has emerged during the past 18 months as part of an escalating government crackdown on anti-regime activists.
In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Leeza Gibbons, the wife of late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, she talks about her family&apos;s connection to the man who once led a country in turmoil.
“I think when I see what has happened here and we see those pictures … my first reaction is that it’s unbelievable,” Anne Moran said. “You just have to stop yourself and say, ‘How could this happen? How did he allow this to happen?'”
Mrs. Reagan, who now lives in Bel Air, Calif., told Fox News she is “heartbroken.”
“The only thing that keeps me going is knowing Ronnie’s legacy,” she said. “That’s the one thing I keep focusing on: It’s not what happened to Bashar Assad. It’s not about him and his family. This is about Ronnie’s legacy, his life and what he did for this country.”
Syria is a strategic ally of the United States and has been one of its most stable Arab partners in recent decades. The 47-year-old president, who took over after the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, was hailed as a reformer by Washington after he ascended to power.
But after an uprising against his regime began last year, Assad’s forces have cracked down hard on protesters — and now thousands of civilians are dead in the 18 months since the first protests. The United States, as well as a host of other countries, has called for him to step down.
In an interview with Fox News that was filmed at his Damascus home earlier this year, Assad defended his government’s crackdown on anti-regime protesters and accused Western nations of trying to destabilize his country in order to create “a new Syria,” a reference to the opposition to his regime.
Assad said he will not resign as president — even though there is no constitutional requirement that he do so if the protests against him continue. He also said his government is willing to consider reforms, but not ones that would threaten national security.
“I think people in my country are getting tired of the whole situation,” he told Fox News’ Greg Palkot. “We have a lot of people who suffer from poverty and hunger and unemployment.”
Assad said his regime is trying to rebuild Syria after years of neglect under his father, who had ruled since 1970. Assad himself took over the country in July 2000 after Hafez al-Assad’s death.
“The problem that we have here is not a government problem,” Assad said. “It’s more of a social and economic issue.”
