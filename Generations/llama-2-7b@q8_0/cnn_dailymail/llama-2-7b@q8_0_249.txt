93 fewer than the previous record high and 53% less than average.
It was also one of the deadliest years on record with 9 fatalities (an increase from 6 in 2008). It is the deadliest since 1978, when there were 12 deaths.
The report said that shark attacks declined last year by 45% over a 20-year average and 39% over a 25-year average. The numbers are based on reports from the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida's Florida Museum of Natural History, which has tracked shark attack data since 1837.
The report said that most attacks occurred in Florida (61), followed by South Africa (5). Other countries reporting attacks were Hawaii (2), Reunion Island (1), Bahamas (1) and Indonesia (1).
Sharks have long been blamed for many attacks on humans, including a fatal bite on New Year's Day that killed 70-year-old Charles Holder in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida Panhandle. It is believed to be the first shark attack since 2008 in the state.
According to the report, two people were injured after being bitten by tiger sharks on New Year's Day off Australia's Gold Coast, and a man was attacked by a bull shark off South Africa on Dec. 31 while surfing with his brother. He suffered severe lacerations in his legs but was expected to recover from the attack, which occurred about 60 miles north of Durban.
The report said that no fatalities were reported from the Americas for the first time since 2004. It noted there were a total of 86 unprovoked shark attacks last year in the Americas (down from a record-high 97 in 2009), but only two deaths -- both in Florida, where three fatalities occurred in 2009.
Last month, two surfers were bitten by tiger sharks on a reef near Hawaii's Big Island and suffered serious injuries to their legs.
The report said that a record-high 75% of the attacks involved bite marks, which has been true for every year since 2003. The number is up from 64% in 2009. The report noted that 81% of attack victims were males and 79% were adults.
The report said that the average age of a victim was 28 years old, with an age range of 5 to 73. The oldest victim was 69-year-old Bill Brantley, who suffered injuries after being bitten by a great white while surfing near Santa Cruz, California, on Sept. 12 and later died from blood clots in his lungs.
