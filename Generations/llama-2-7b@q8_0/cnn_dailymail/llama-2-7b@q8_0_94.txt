The first sign was the manner in which Laurent Blanc’s team were able to turn what had been a difficult week into something approaching joyous as they saw off the challenge of an under-strength Swiss side who never really got going despite having some good periods and two chances from Xherdan Shaqiri that both came within yards of finding their mark.
The tone was set early, with Blanc’s team beginning the game with a high intensity as they pushed forwards in waves, the one caveat being they rarely looked like getting anywhere near the Swiss goal until Blaise Matuidi got through after 15 minutes and fired wide from 20 yards out.
That was a sign of things to come, however. France continued to press forward with a relentlessness that saw them enjoy more than 64 per cent of possession – their highest share in the competition so far. They created numerous opportunities but could only take one as they took control over what was meant to be a tricky game against an opposition who had won all four of their previous games in this World Cup and were bidding for qualification, even though they had to do so without an array of top names including Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka and Stephan Lichtsteiner.
By contrast, France had the option of playing with a team that was almost entirely made up of players who have been at club level on some of the biggest stages in Europe and in most cases won something major. The difference between the sides was never clearer than when it came to their approach to defence. Switzerland were often caught out of position and unable to make up ground, while France kept their shape better and had the pace to cover for each other.
That was no more apparent that in the second half, which saw them move through gears as they began to control matters with a clinical efficiency. The first goal arrived after 55 minutes when Karim Benzema played in Paul Pogba on the right and he pulled back across goal for Mathieu Valbuena to tap home from close range.
France then hit the woodwork twice, first through Antoine Griezmann whose shot flew just wide of the far post, before Blaise Matuidi struck a free-kick that cannoned off the underside of the crossbar and out – albeit after Valbuena had handled in the build up.
Within two minutes, however, France doubled their advantage when they capitalised on the kind of mistake Switzerland rarely make, as Samir Nasri intercepted a pass from Fabian Schar and was fouled by Stephan Lichtsteiner 35 yards out. He stepped up to take the spot kick and converted it with his usual nonchalance.
With the match now effectively over, France were able to play some of their more enterprising football in an attempt to stretch Switzerland’s resolve further – although the task was made difficult by the loss of Lucas Digne on 68 minutes through injury, a development that could yet prove pivotal given how well he has played for Laurent Blanc.
Still, they did not give up and in fact came close to scoring again when Yann Sommer tipped Benzema’s header away from the line with just over five minutes remaining. That was France’s last real effort on goal but Switzerland had one good chance as Shaqiri found himself clean through and fired a shot narrowly wide of Hugo Lloris’ far post, the best they have looked in this tournament by some distance.
But they still left the pitch having not won a single match – or even scored a goal. By contrast France now head into their final group game against Ecuador with real belief that they can get to the last 16 as one of the two qualifiers from Group E, even if Switzerland will be hoping for them to fail after failing so miserably themselves.
