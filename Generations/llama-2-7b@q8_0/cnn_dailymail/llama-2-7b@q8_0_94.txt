ens of thousands attended the trial, which started last week and was held at Cairo’s Police Academy.
The defendants are accused of murdering seven people during the firebombing and arson attack that destroyed a 130-year-old church and left another Christian dead in September 2013, according to state-run Al-Ahram newspaper.
One person was sentenced to death and eight others received prison terms ranging from one year to nine years for inciting riots during the attack on Saint Samuel’s Coptic Orthodox Church in Kafr Hakim village near Cairo. A ninth defendant was acquitted of all charges, according to a court statement.
“The church is not only a symbol but it also has historical value. It’s a symbol that unifies us,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi told the defendants during his visit last week to Kafr Hakim where he attended the trial, according to Al-Ahram.
The arson attack and burning of Saint Samuel’s Church in 2013 was one of a series of attacks on churches that year.
In September 2014, ISIS militants attacked a church in North Sinai province, killing seven people before blowing themselves up. The group also posted images online showing militants attacking and burning an Egyptian army checkpoint near the Saint Samuel Church.
A month later, gunmen killed at least eight Christians attending Sunday mass inside Saint Mark’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria. The attack on the historic church — which was bombed by Muslim extremists more than a century ago — is still considered one of the most violent acts against Egypt’s Christian minority.
In April 2017, at least 45 people were killed and dozens injured when two suicide bombings struck Coptic churches in Tanta, northwest of Cairo, and Alexandria. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
