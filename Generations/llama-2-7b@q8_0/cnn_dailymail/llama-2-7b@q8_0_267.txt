­Tiananmen Square tank was displayed on the stage as part of an act. The artist who made the image famous, Liu Xiaobo, won the Nobel Peace Prize last year but is serving an 11-year sentence for 'inciting subversion' after publishing it in the China Information and Publishing Administration (CIPA). The Chinese government has tried to wipe his picture from history and even banned the production of a film about him. But an act by theatre company Zi Lan that was staged at Beijing's NJZ Art Theatre on August 13th used a stage full of lights as a backdrop for projected images including Liu Xiaobo, Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi.
