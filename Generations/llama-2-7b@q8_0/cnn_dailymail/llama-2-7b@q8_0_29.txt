The undefeated boxer, who is thought to weigh in at just over 150 pounds for his fight against the Filipino superstar on Saturday night (UK time), had previously been ridiculed for his diet which was said to have consisted mainly of pizza and cheeseburgers.
However, Mayweather's personal chef Melissa Gorga claims that her boss has in fact become a little more health conscious since his training camp started in earnest back in January.
"He loves pasta," she told the New York Times. "So I make him rice-pasta with chicken, broccoli and cauliflower."
However, when it comes to the 38 year old's other vices - drinking beer and smoking cigars - Gorga has no problem indulging her boss in his hedonistic habits.
"I have a couple of cold ones," she said. "Sometimes we get a couple of cigars."
