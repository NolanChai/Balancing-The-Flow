On Thursday night, after Duncan's death, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins held a news conference where he also criticized how the patient was handled when he first sought treatment at the hospital and asked for prayers for those who took care of him.
Jenkins told reporters that Duncan called the emergency room on September 25, complaining about "low back pain."
"They never asked about symptoms or a history of recent travel," Jenkins said in a statement Thursday night.
A spokeswoman for Texas Presbyterian Hospital disputed his characterization, saying that Duncan's sister told the hospital staff he had recently traveled from Liberia and that they began asking questions about his symptoms immediately upon admission.
"The patient's travel history was initially taken when he entered the ER on September 25," said Candi Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Texas Presbyterian Hospital, in an emailed statement Thursday night.
When asked about Duncan's request to be tested for Ebola on Saturday, September 27, Varga told CNN: "It's very clear that we fell short and we fell short several times."
The hospital was aware that Duncan was sick and had a fever of at least 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, but didn't put him under isolation until Monday -- even though the CDC warned health care workers about Ebola cases in West Africa three days earlier, Varga said.
Varga noted that a traveler coming from one of those countries should be considered at high risk for having been exposed to Ebola and should be placed immediately under isolation, which Texas Presbyterian did Monday night, he said.
"In retrospect, we believe it would have been better for the patient had he been placed under isolation when he was first brought in," Varga said. "The hospital, on a number of occasions, should have asked questions about travel and history."
He also said that Duncan's symptoms didn't suggest Ebola -- even though he was experiencing diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, all potential signs of the virus.
During his second admission to Texas Presbyterian Hospital, on Wednesday evening, when the hospital had learned that Duncan may have had exposure to Ebola, Varga said they again didn't ask the right questions -- like how much contact he'd had with those infected or what types of protective gear were used.
"These are the kinds of things we're looking at, so that we can prevent these infections from happening to other patients and health care workers," Varga said.
The hospital will continue to review its practices in treating Duncan "in an effort to improve our processes going forward," Varga said Thursday night.
