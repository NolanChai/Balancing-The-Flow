The secret drawings and letters belonging to the co-pilot of Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945, have emerged after nearly 70 years.
The bombing of Hiroshima killed more than 140,000 people and the dropping of a second nuclear weapon three days later over Nagasaki resulted in 80,000 deaths.
But in his private letters to his brother, Captain Robert Lewis expressed intense guilt following the mission in which he said it was difficult for him to look at the faces of the Japanese people and know that he had just killed them all.
He described seeing the 'horrible effects' of the bomb as a result of what he called 'the only good bomb ever invented'.
The secret drawings and letters, which were donated by Lewis's niece to the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum in Washington, reveal how one of the Enola Gay crew members reacted to their part in the mission.
Mrs Lewis gave her consent to publish her uncle's notes as she is 'determined that history will be told honestly and accurately'.
In a letter to his brother on July 31, 1945, he wrote: 'I don't think I can write about the experience without making you feel uncomfortable.
'It seems like murder of men, women, and children. It's difficult for me to look at the faces of the Japanese people and know that I have just killed them all - with one exception.'
He added: 'The only good bomb ever invented is this one.'
Lewis, who was born in Kansas in 1918, died on Christmas Eve in 2004. He had been the co-pilot of Enola Gay and had flown 35 missions over Japan during World War II.
He also flew a number of other missions after he was demobbed. He said in his letter that he did not intend to 'just sit around here'.
The Smithsonian is exhibiting the drawings alongside other items including the logbooks and flight manuals belonging to the crew members, photographs and film footage from the mission.
Enola Gay was named after Captain Lewis's mother and named by his father, Paul, who piloted a B-17 in World War I. He wrote on a form requesting that the plane be named Enola Gay: 'Because she is my mother.'
Mrs Lewis said her uncle had no problem with anyone seeing the letters which reveal his guilt and regret at taking part in the mission, and he did not ask to have them back after they were made public.
She added: 'Bob didn't want to hide it - he wanted people to know. He was a person who thought very deeply about these things.'
The bombing of Hiroshima killed more than 140,000 and the dropping of a second nuclear weapon three days later over Nagasaki resulted in the deaths of another 80,000 people - mainly civilian.
But the US government has long maintained that the use of the weapons was necessary to save lives by ending the war quickly and avoiding a ground invasion which would have cost thousands more lives on both sides.
The Japanese surrendered shortly after the atomic attacks and World War II came to an end in August 1945 with Japan accepting defeat.
Mr Lewis's brother, Joseph, said his father had been proud of his son's part in history and that his actions were consistent with how he always felt about war.
He added: 'It was a sad day for my father when Bob came home and told him that he had dropped the bomb.'
