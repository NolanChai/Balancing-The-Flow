How much of this stuff is actually produced in the United States? It's difficult to say for sure. According to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, honey production in 2013 was estimated at 2.9 billion pounds. Of that total, about a third (36 percent) came from domestic producers; the rest was imported.
So, how much is produced here? "It's probably somewhere between one-third and half of what we consume," said Mark Mulligan, executive director of the American Beekeeping Federation. But he noted that there are a lot more hives in this country than a decade ago; that means even if domestic production remains flat it may still account for most of what consumers buy.
The U.S. has about 2.5 million beehives, Mulligan said -- an increase from the 1.6 to 1.7 million hives in 2008. If one-third are domestic, that means they may account for more than half of what we buy.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun taking steps to make sure consumers who buy honey are getting what they think they're getting. In February, it issued a final rule requiring all honey sold in this country to be labeled with the country where it was produced. That was intended to prevent producers from misleading consumers by labeling their products as "honey," even if they contain sugar or other sweeteners like corn syrup, rice syrup or high-fructose corn syrup -- ingredients that can be cheaper than honey.
"The agency is taking this action because honey sold in the United States contains an average of 75 percent imported honey," the FDA said. "Therefore, labeling honey simply as 'honey' does not provide consumers with sufficient information to make informed purchasing decisions."
Mulligan called it a step in the right direction, but he noted that there are no regulations for honey from within the country. So, beekeepers could continue selling their products without disclosing exactly where they got them -- if the FDA doesn't get around to enforcing those provisions, too.
The rule requires all honey sold in this country to have a label indicating its country of origin beginning on Sept. 16. Mulligan said he didn't think that would solve the problem of misleading labels. The beekeeping federation has been advocating for several years that any imported honey be required to clearly state whether it is "packed in" or "processed in" another country.
The FDA has not responded to a request for comment on what, if any, enforcement actions it may take regarding the new rules.
The United States is one of the top importers of honey in the world; it imported about 250 million pounds last year. The European Union was the No. 1 supplier. But Canada and Brazil were next on the list, followed by Argentina, Australia, Ukraine, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Russia and South Africa.
What's most interesting to me is that no one else in this country seems to have a problem with honey not being "honey." You see it all over -- at Costco, in the supermarket next door, on Amazon.com and even at the farmer's market. They all carry the label "organic" or "raw," but no one is willing to say that they are selling "honey."
The beekeeping federation has asked the FDA for a compliance date of Sept. 1, 2018 for any imported honey with labels saying it's organically produced or raw. It would give companies time to update their labels but wouldn't affect consumers.
"We believe that by establishing an implementation period, the FDA will send a clear message to our trading partners that the U.S. takes its honey laws seriously and is committed to protecting domestic markets," Mulligan wrote in his letter to the agency.
The FDA said it had no comment on when those rules might be adopted.
Here's what we know: The FDA has issued a rule requiring that all honey sold here must include its country of origin, but there are no regulations for "honeys" produced within this country. There are also no plans to enforce the new labeling requirements, either -- yet.
