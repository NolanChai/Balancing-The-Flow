antour bus. The incident happened in Thailand when a group of Aussies and Brits boarded the bus from Phuket to Bangkok.
One of the tourists who witnessed the brawl said it started after one of the passengers put their foot down too close to another’s seat. But before long, around 20 people had joined in, according to the tourist.
“We were just sitting there and a lady got her foot out,” he told the Daily Mail. “Then everybody started shouting at her.” He said one of his friends asked if she could move her foot away from her seat as it was making him uncomfortable. But instead, passengers who didn’t know the tourist began yelling at the Brit to tell them where they were from.
When he replied, “England,” they turned on him. The tourists then got up and tried to leave but found that all of the doors had been blocked by people. One woman even threatened to kill them with a knife, according to the British travelers. Eventually, one of the men was able to get his friends off the bus after telling the group they were going to call police.
The tourists then alerted the Australian Embassy and authorities in Thailand and asked that the brawlers be arrested for their actions. The group even told their embassy that the attackers had tried to take one of them hostage, but it’s unclear if there was any truth behind this claim.
The Thai-based Australiantour bus company has yet to comment on the incident.
