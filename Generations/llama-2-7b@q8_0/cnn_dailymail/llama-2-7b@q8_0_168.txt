Clint Hill reckons the pressure is on QPR's relegation rivals and insists Rangers can survive if they keep their cool.
Chris Ramsey's side are still in the relegation zone but the defender believes other clubs should be feeling the heat, not them.
And Hill believes a good run of results from this point could see QPR climb up the table and get out of danger.
"I think we have to stay calm and keep working hard," said Hill. "It's important for us to just focus on ourselves. We are in no man's land at the moment but I am confident that if we keep plugging away then we will climb up the table."
