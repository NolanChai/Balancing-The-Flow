16 GoPro cameras as they went out to work outside the station, giving people back home a chance to see what it’s like up there.
The videos are truly incredible – showing exactly how difficult it is for astronauts to conduct spacewalks, let alone do the job properly. The pair were seen wearing helmets and protective suits, as well as gloves which had been designed by NASA specifically to assist them in carrying out their tasks.
One video shows Wilmore making his way along a length of cable on the outside of the ISS, while another shows him hanging off one end with Virts floating next to him. The pair can be seen moving through space without gravity to aid them and doing so at incredible speed.
Wilmore has also recorded some incredibly impressive time-lapse videos from his journeys on the station, which he then posts online for everyone to see – including one video that shows the Earth rising over the horizon of the ISS.
