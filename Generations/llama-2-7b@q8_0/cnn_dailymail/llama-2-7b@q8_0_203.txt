A University students&apos; union has been forced to apologise after  using a Nazi SS victory symbol to advertise a German-themed drinking event.
DoZens of studentS at Aberystwyth University complained after the Students' Union posted an image on Facebook that showed two glasses filled with beer in front of a Swastika flag and a German eagle.
The Students' Union has since deleted the post, apologised to students and said it had been removed because it was deemed 'inappropriate'.
An investigation is underway and it is believed those responsible may face disciplinary action. (more...)

So they were forced to apologize. Who exactly did the forcing?
I've heard that students can be very sensitive and easily offended by certain things, but I didn't think it had gotten that bad. It seems to me like this was done as a joke or to poke fun of the SS. The fact that so many people were able to become offended is disturbing.
This would have been more shocking if it happened 10 years ago. This shows us just how far we've come in terms of accepting and ignoring evil.
"Students can be very sensitive... I didn't think it had gotten that bad."
They are the future leaders, as well as voters. That is not good.
