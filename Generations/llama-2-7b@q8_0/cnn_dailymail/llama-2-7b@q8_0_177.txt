1-0 victory over QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday.
In the first half of that particular game, many of them were pictured sitting with a flipchart and markers, before making doodles all across its pages. Some of the more interesting designs included an unidentified player’s take on the QPR crest, along with a stylised Manchester City badge complete with a yellow ribbon as part of their club motto.
The images were shared by a number of City fans during the game itself on Twitter and Reddit, and subsequently found themselves published in most of the national newspapers this Sunday. It’s unclear if City players realised how much attention they would get after leaving those drawings behind.
