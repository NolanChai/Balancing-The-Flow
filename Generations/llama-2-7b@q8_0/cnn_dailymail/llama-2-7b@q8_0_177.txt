CNN's John D. Sutter spoke to Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, director of Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, and the author of "Daddy Was A Number Runner" about Lawrence, his work and its legacy as it goes on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
CNN: In your opinion, what makes this series so powerful?
Guy Sheftall: I think there's a number of things that make this series very important. It's important because we have not seen black folk represented this way before on American canvas. You know, they were either the butler or the maid or you had this kind of exoticized representation of them.
So when he made this work, it was groundbreaking for us to see a realistic and raw depiction of African-Americans living in urban centers.
And then the other thing I think is important about this series are these little vignettes that talk about the migration experience and what's happening as people were leaving the South. And they were fleeing oppression, not knowing if there was going to be opportunity up north or down south because of the Depression.
And so he paints all these different things: You have the police arresting the migrant, you have the people in New York saying, "You know, this is too much." So it's very powerful. It makes me teary eyed every time I see that work. And I think that's the power of art -- when it speaks to your humanity and resonates with you on an emotional level and you just start feeling like, "Wow, this is a true story."
CNN: Was he trying to be polemical? Is there a political message in his work?
Guy Sheftall: I think the only way that Jacob Lawrence can be thought of as polemicist is because we know how the series ends. And so when you look at it from afar, you start seeing these little vignettes and you don't really understand what they mean until you get to the last work in the series which says, "The migration of the Negro had come to a virtual standstill."
And so I think that he was painting this series as an artist and not as a polemicist. He was painting his experience as an African-American boy living in Harlem in 1941, looking out on these migrant workers who were coming up north from the south because they had no other choice, fleeing oppression and violence that they could no longer take.
And he just thought about this and put it on canvas for us to see as a historical document of what was happening in African-American life at that point in time.
CNN: What does it mean to you today? How is it relevant to our times?
Guy Sheftall: I think the work resonates with us because we've had migrations since then. We have people who are moving across borders, we have people who are moving out of rural areas into urban centers, and I think that they can see themselves in this narrative -- "Oh my gosh! This is what it means to be a migrant."
But also, we're seeing the same kinds of racial violence today. We had lynchings back then and now we have people being killed for no reason. So I think that people can see themselves in this narrative from 1940-42. And it doesn't just talk about African Americans, but Latinos -- as many Latino migrants are coming up north from the south -- they are going through the same kinds of experiences that Jacob Lawrence was painting.
CNN: It sounds like you feel this series is a reflection on our time?
Guy Sheftall: I think it's always relevant because we have racial violence in our country, we have racial prejudice, and when he painted these works, he was living in Harlem -- an urban area that had all kinds of racial tensions. And so even though the work was made 70 years ago, it resonates today as much or maybe more than when he first painted them because we still have many of the same issues that were going on back then.
CNN: How has the series been preserved? Who is taking care of them? Is there a special conservation effort needed to keep these paintings safe?
Guy Sheftall: These paintings are owned by The Museum of Modern Art, so they do all the maintenance and preservation of the works themselves. So I know that they're doing everything that they need to do to make sure that we can continue to see this work as much as possible. They have them on tour right now, they've been traveling for many years from different institutions in New York City because it was an exhibition that traveled when he first exhibited it at The Museum of Modern Art back in the 1940s.
CNN: How do we get this work into more museums? Into more schools so kids can see it and have conversations about race and migration? Is there a plan to show these works around the country or maybe even worldwide?
Guy Sheftall: Yes! They're planning on having an exhibition in Washington, D.C., at The National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2015 when they open their doors. But in addition to that, they are trying to do other shows. They've already had one show here in Atlanta.
So the plan is to continue showing this work as much as possible because it's such an important piece of our history. And I think we have to put it out there for people to see so that they can reflect on and understand what their experience has been like, and maybe to create a dialogue about race in America today.
CNN: What is the legacy of Jacob Lawrence?
Guy Sheftall: His legacy is that he was an African-American artist who created art during one of the most difficult times in our history and he made it through. He fought for his life as an artist, so to speak, and then he went on to become a successful teacher and to have many works exhibited and collected by museums around the world.
And he was also a friend to many African-American artists -- like Romare Bearden, who was a Harlem Renaissance artist -- so I think that they were both friends and they shared this idea about creating art as an act of resistance in our society. And so his legacy is that he was part of the group of black artists who fought for their place within the art world.
And then his other legacy, of course, is these works because they are historical documents and they're very powerful images to look at today. So I think that all together he has had a pretty substantial impact on our history as African-American artists working in the 20th century.
