According to Dr Rita Rakus of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, fat dissolving injections can give you a slimmer jawline within a few days and reduce stubborn pockets of unwanted fat. But she warns it is not suitable for every patient. 'Fat cells do not disappear entirely with ageing or weight gain,' said Dr Rakus. 'So if you're overweight, you can still get excess deposits. 'Fortunately we have several ways to combat this problem.' The procedure, called Kybella in the US, works by melting fat cells so that they are eventually absorbed into the body. It has been approved for use on the chin and jawline but not the neck or any other area. Injecting the drug is painless and there's no anaesthesia needed. The doctor makes a series of tiny injections under the chin, with about 20 to 40 given per treatment session, which is usually done every four weeks over several sessions until you achieve your desired result. 'There may be mild discomfort that can last for a day or two,' said Dr Rakus. The cost varies between $1,500 and $3,500 (£900 to £2,000) depending on how many injections are needed. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this week and is expected to be available next year, Dr Rakus said. There's no downtime for fat dissolving shots but you should avoid exercise or strenuous activity for a day because it can cause bruising. 'You will notice results within 10 days,' she said. The jury is still out on whether the procedure is safe as it has only been available in America since August and has not yet been tested with large numbers of patients, she warned. There's also concern that there is no way to know how many injections are needed or how long they will last. 'It may be better to have an elective plastic surgery procedure like liposuction if you want more predictable results,' said Dr Rakus. But the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) claims it is effective in removing a double chin and has a safety record similar to other fillers. 'Kybella does have one of the highest satisfaction rates for any cosmetic procedure, so that's good news for anyone who wants to get rid of a double chin,' said ASAPS spokeswoman Dr Anita Shah. A 2011 study by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found that nearly three out of four men and women were concerned about their submental fat, or double chin. However, liposuction is more invasive - it involves inserting a tube into the skin to remove excess fat cells, and there are concerns over bruising and potential infection.
