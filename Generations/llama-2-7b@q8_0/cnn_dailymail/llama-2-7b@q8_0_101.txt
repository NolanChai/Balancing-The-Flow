An Australian artist has penned an impassioned message to Indonesian President Joko Widodo in the final hours before his treasured friends, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, are expected to be executed.
Myuran, 33, and Andrew, 31, have spent nearly a decade on death row for their roles in drug smuggling into Indonesia. They were sentenced to hang after being found guilty of attempting to traffic heroin and cocaine out of Bali in 2005.

“Mr Widodo, it is an honour for me to present these portraits to you,” he wrote in his letter. “I have never been prouder to be Australian or of Australians than I am today.”
Myuran and Andrew are set to be executed on Wednesday morning at 6am local time (3pm AEST). The two men’s families and the Australian government have both made a last-ditch appeal for clemency.
“This is not about us, this is about you,” Mr Quilty continued in his letter to Mr Widodo. “I’m sure that on your journey you’ll find many other people who will inspire you and help make the decisions which shape our nation’s future. Please reconsider these executions.”
Mr Widodo has insisted he is not swayed by pressure from Australia or the international community, instead pointing to his country’s “rule of law”.
