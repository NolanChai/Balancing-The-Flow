demeanor charge of solicitation of prostitution, police said. "Mr. Wihby apologizes to Senator Ayotte and to his family for this lapse in judgment," the senator's office said.
Wihby has worked at the senator's Manchester headquarters since 2010. He is a senior policy advisor on education issues, according to Ayotte's website. The Republican lawmaker represents New Hampshire and was narrowly re-elected in November after winning a tight race for a second term against Democrat Jeanne Shaheen.
Wihby did not immediately return calls seeking comment. An attorney for the suspect could not be reached for immediate comment. A police report said Wihby solicited prostitution from an undercover officer between 9:45 p.m. and midnight on Friday in downtown Nashua, which is about 30 miles north of Manchester.
"It's a little unusual," said Nashua Police Captain Robert Eaton, adding that he didn't know if Wihby had worked with law enforcement before or was a public official. He said the police department would not disclose what the senator's office told them about Wihby.
Wihby faces up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, but the police report said he did not have to appear for arraignment on Thursday because it was a first-time offense. Eaton said that if Wihby has no criminal history and the charges are dismissed, "he's pretty much finished."
"It doesn't make sense for a public official," Eaton added. "I guess it could happen to anybody. I don't think you could predict that someone would do this sort of thing."
