 and two driver championships over the past five years. But after a break-in at their Hinwil base just outside of Zurich, Switzerland, only one trophy remains to remind team staff what they have achieved in recent times â€“ Max Verstappen's maiden title last year.
The thieves smashed their way through an upper window in the early hours of Friday morning before emptying the trophies from their cabinets and making off with them in a vehicle, according to Swiss police spokesman Daniel Klotz. The break-in came just as Verstappen was enjoying a celebration dinner for his father Jos, who was crowned 1995 Formula One champion more than two decades ago.
Red Bull has issued a statement condemning the "sickening" attack, and says it is working closely with police in their investigations."We are outraged by this sickening act and would like to thank everyone for the messages of support that we have received," read the statement from the team.
The stolen items include the championship trophy from 2019, as well as others for Verstappen's maiden title win last year and a host of other podium finishes, according to Red Bull.Verstappen is currently in Switzerland for pre-season testing after spending time training with his national ski team ahead of the new season.The burglary occurred at around 1:30 am local time (2430 GMT on Friday) when five men used a vehicle to force their way through the large double doors into the building and smashed windows. They then went directly to where they knew there were trophies, breaking open several cabinets before loading them all into an awaiting van."We are working closely with the Swiss police who have set up a special taskforce and we will do everything possible to help them find those responsible," added Red Bull's statement.
The 2023 season is Red Bull's first full campaign since it acquired the title from former champions McLaren. But before they can worry about defending their championship, the team has to get through pre-season testing and a race in Bahrain on March 5.
