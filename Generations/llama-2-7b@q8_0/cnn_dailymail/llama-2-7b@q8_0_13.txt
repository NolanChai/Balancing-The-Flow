 and instructions on how to make bombs.
A former Syrian doctor who lived alone with his cat was jailed yesterday after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and instructions on how to make bombs in his flat. Faris Al-Khori, 62, had been living at the top floor apartment on St Leonards Road in the suburb of St John's Wood, London for almost three decades without anyone knowing what he was doing behind closed doors.
The Daily Telegraph reports that he is said to be a 'hermit with few friends and no social life', who lived off his modest pension while carrying out experiments in the bathroom of his apartment.
On one occasion, the pensioner told police that he had been 'playing with firecrackers'. On another, he claimed to have been trying to make a homemade oven cleaner but failed.
Mr Al-Khori, who was described as a man of low intelligence with an IQ of 59, denied having any criminal intent and pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court last year to making explosives for terrorism purposes.  He has now been sentenced to two years in prison and a further three on extended licence after admitting to possessing 20 items of  'chemical precursors' - chemicals that are used to make bombs or illegal drugs - at his flat last September.
The court heard how police officers were called to Mr Al-Khori's home in September last year by a man who was concerned about the pensioner, whose cat had died and whose sister had moved into a care home.
When officers went inside they found 20 items of chemical precursors - some which could be used to make bombs or illegal drugs  - at his flat along with instructions on how to make explosives.  He told police he had been storing them in the bathroom for nearly three decades as he did not want people to know what they were.
Mr Al-Khori was born in Damascus, Syria and arrived in London from Aleppo in 1984 and has lived there ever since.
