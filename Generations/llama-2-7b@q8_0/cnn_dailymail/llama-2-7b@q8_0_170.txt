, but the sport's image remained unscarred in the eyes of some supporters.
Judge Mark Gargan of Southwark crown court was not convinced that every cricketer could now be trusted because it had been established that players would take bribes to cheat on behalf of bookmakers, but said: "I do believe that the vast majority of cricketers are genuine and honest. The game can survive."
The three Pakistanis - Mohammad Ata-ur-Rehman (37), Mazhar Majeed (50) and Waqar Younis (46) - were given 21 months, five years on probation, a ban from cricket until at least 2020, £90,000 compensation to victims and an £80,000 costs bill.
The judge said he had been faced with "an appalling catalogue of deceitfulness" after the Pakistanis were accused of fixing the outcome of at least nine one-day internationals between 2010 and 2011, as well as three Test matches in Australia between December last year and January.
The scandal has damaged not only cricket but also Pakistan's reputation around the world. But supporters such as Mohammed Sharif (48) of Walthamstow were sanguine about the men who had been convicted. "They are good people. They have made a mistake and paid for it. I don't think it will affect cricket."
Ata-ur-Rehman, from Birmingham, was the only one to accept his guilt, but Majeed denied conspiracy to cheat at all stages of the trial and Younis denied agreeing to bowl no balls on behalf of bookmakers. All three were convicted unanimously by a jury at Southwark crown court on Tuesday evening after an eight-week trial.
Gargan, sentencing yesterday, said he accepted that Ata-ur-Rehman had "probably" not been part of the conspiracy to cheat but felt Majeed and Younis were guilty because they had lied about their involvement in match fixing. He said: "The conduct of each of you has damaged cricket, a game which is loved by millions of people throughout the world."
He added that bookmakers would be "happy" with the convictions, saying that betting on cricket was an important source of income for them and they had paid "a lot of money" to fix matches. He said: "There are those who believe that this verdict will help restore integrity to the game. I do not think we have done so. It is likely that there are other players who would be willing to cheat in order to make a quick buck."
The judge added that although the jury was split 11-1 on Younis's guilt, he had found him guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence and agreed with his conviction. The court heard Younis was arrested at Heathrow airport last June in possession of £60,000 in cash.
The judge said it "might have been expected" that the Pakistan board would have stopped Younis from playing for Pakistan if they had found out about the allegations against him. But he added: "I accept that you did not seek to mislead them."
