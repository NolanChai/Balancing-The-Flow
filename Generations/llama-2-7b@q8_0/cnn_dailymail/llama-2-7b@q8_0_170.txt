10 minutes out from Denver International Airport recalled a "jarring" drop that brought the Boeing 737 down some 20,000 feet before he began to regain control.
The aircraft, a SkyWest flight bound for Phoenix and carrying 66 passengers and nine crew members on board, was forced to make an emergency landing at Colorado's Centennial Airport, where it landed safely just after 9pm Mountain Time (4am UK time) with no injuries reported.
The incident is the second in a week involving SkyWest Airlines, which has suffered a series of safety incidents since 2013 that include emergency evacuations, smoke inside the cabin and a plane fire.
"The aircraft was experiencing a loss of pressure in the cabin," said NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss, who said he did not know what caused the drop or whether it resulted from a mechanical malfunction. He added that the plane had been cleared for an emergency landing at Denver International Airport.
Passengers said they first felt their ears pop and then saw cabin lights dim as the altitude indicator dropped suddenly to 10,000 feet.
"We hit a patch of air turbulence," passenger Jana Stouffer told KUSA-TV in Denver. "And right after that we just started going down." She said passengers began screaming and praying as the plane went down rapidly through 25,000 feet before stabilising at about 12,000.
The pilot radioed to ask for help from a United Airlines crew on standby at Centennial Airport who took over control of the aircraft until it landed safely just after midnight local time (7am UK).
Passenger Shawn Means told Fox News he was sitting in coach and felt like someone hit him in the head as they went down. "I think we were probably 10 minutes out," Means said. "And there was just a jarring that happened to everybody on board."
"We asked if anyone got hurt, and the flight attendant said nobody got hurt, which is great news because I know several people on the plane, so it's good to hear everyone made it back in one piece," he said. "It was unnerving."
