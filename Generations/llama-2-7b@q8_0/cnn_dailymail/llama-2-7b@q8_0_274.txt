Crash investigators have released a photo that reveals the aftermath of a planeâ€™s dramatic landing at East Midlands Airport.
A set of wheels broke off the Boeing 737 moments after it touched down at the airport in Derbyshire last month, forcing it to skid off the runway and into grassland.
Fortunately there were no injuries on board the flight from Newcastle, which was operated by Flybe.
