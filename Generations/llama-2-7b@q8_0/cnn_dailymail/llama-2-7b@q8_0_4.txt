Cook said: "It was a very hard decision to switch from GB but I am sure that I made the right choice for me as well as my family.
"I had some good chances to be part of Team GB in London and I always felt that if I didn't make it then there was every chance I could in Rio 2016.
"The decision wasn't easy but now that I have made it, I am looking forward to the challenge."
Cook, who won a bronze medal at the world championships last year, and his family moved to Moldova earlier this month.
He was married to former Russian Olympic gymnast Alla Kudryavtseva in 2013.
