 at how she looked in her new family photo. She used to weigh 20st and had a size-26 waist but now she's trimmed down to 10st, 3lbs and a size-8. Katy Winter was overweight from the age of seven and suffered from low self-esteem as she got older - she felt that her weight held her back in life. 'It's funny how you can look at pictures from your past and feel embarrassed by what you were, then when you see yourself now it's all 'how amazing are you,' she told The Sun. Mum of two Katy said she used to be ashamed of her appearance but now she is happy with herself after losing 10st and reducing her dress size from a 26 to an eight.
Having the baby weight was not easy, it was hard work and I've had to retrain my body and mind to get there. My weight loss has taken two years - I used Slimfast as a starter but now I eat healthy, balanced meals.' She says her weight gain was due to stress at home, 'My weight increased gradually over the years because of stress at home, I didn't feel good about myself and my self-esteem wasn’t high. But when I got pregnant with my daughter, I found myself in a happy place.'
She added that her confidence has grown since her weight loss. 'I can honestly say that losing all the weight was worth it for this picture alone,' she said. She continued: 'My mum and dad were so proud to see their baby girl looking so fit. They’ve seen me at my fattest, so they are as happy as I am.'
She says her children, 10-year-old Sophie and six-year-old Liam, have helped inspire her weight loss: 'I think that it was a combination of my daughters telling me off for not being skinny and then seeing them running around without a care in the world,' she added.
