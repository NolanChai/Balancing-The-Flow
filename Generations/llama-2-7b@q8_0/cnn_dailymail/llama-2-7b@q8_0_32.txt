Bayern Munich are already a world class side with two Brazilians, Arjen Robben and Frank Ribery, at its core and have signed another from Fluminense – Douglas Costa for £30m.
Their manager Pep Guardiola has been known to get the best out of Brazilians in his teams, notably with Dani Alves.
With two great Brazilians already at Manchester City, Fernandinho and Jo – I don’t know if they are actually Brazilian but their names suggest so – City could be a force to reckon with next season.
Liverpool have Luis Suarez in their ranks as well as Lucas Leiva who is a very good midfielder when on form. They will need both for their Champions League campaign and to qualify from a tough group containing Real Madrid, Basel and Ludogorets.
