 may be to blame, they suggest
A third more youngsters now develop the bowel condition than in 2004, doctors warn today.
The rise comes as part of a trend for chronic diseases which are becoming increasingly common in children, according to researchers.
Chron's disease is a genetic disorder where the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed and damaged.
It is caused by an overactive immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue.
The condition causes severe abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss. It is notoriously difficult to treat with many sufferers requiring lifelong medication or surgery.

Experts suggest that a combination of factors are behind the surge, including obesity caused by poor diet and antibiotics given to young children for conditions such as coughs and colds.
The condition is usually first seen in people between 20 and 30 years old.
But experts from St George's University Hospital Foundation Trust in Tooting, London, say they are increasingly seeing cases in younger patients - with the number of children requiring hospital treatment for the disease doubling over a decade.
The findings were published in the British Journal of General Practice today.
A team led by Dr Michael Caffrey analysed data on all 15 to 24-year-olds admitted to St George's Hospital and diagnosed with Chron's disease between 1985 and 2016, totalling nearly 3,000 patients.
During that time the number of young people admitted for treatment rose from about 70 in 1985-87 to 145 in 2012-14 - an increase of more than 100 per cent.
In 2015, there were almost twice as many cases in patients aged between five and nine compared with a decade before.
The study suggests that factors including increased obesity and the overuse of antibiotics are behind the rise.
Obesity is linked to an increase in conditions such as type 2 diabetes, which can predispose people towards Chron's disease, Dr Caffrey said.
The team also found a link between the use of antibiotics - given for things like coughs and colds - and childhood obesity with both linked to changes in gut bacteria.
This in turn could increase susceptibility towards inflammatory diseases, including Chron's disease, they suggest.
However, Dr Caffrey said more research was needed to understand the impact of antibiotics on developing conditions such as Chron's disease in children.
He added: 'Inflammation has been linked with obesity and increased risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
'It is possible that factors leading to obesity in children could increase the risk of developing these diseases and therefore increased rates of inflammation seen in this study.'
Chron's disease affects around one in every 250 people in England, according to figures from the charity Crohn's and Colitis UK.
Symptoms include chronic diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain and loss of appetite and weight.
