10-time champions Atletico's match against Rayo Vallecano at the Vicente Calderon stadium.
Koke has been a key part of Diego Simeone's team over recent seasons, making his first appearance for the senior side in March 2013 and becoming one of their star performers during a hugely impressive campaign that saw them win both La Liga and the Copa del Rey before losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League final.
The Spain international has also been linked with Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal while Chelsea are reportedly looking at another possible signing from Simeone's side, with Costa Rican midfielder Joel Campbell said to be an option for the west London club too.
