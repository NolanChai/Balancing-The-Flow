ize and sell items from criminals when it started its auction site last April.
The initiative has proved so successful that it is now being rolled out across the country by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), which represents all 43 forces in England and Wales. The NPCC hopes other forces will follow Leicestershire police’s lead, with plans to expand the site beyond its current offering of jewellery and watches to include personalised number plates and designer clothing.
Leicestershire has so far raised £276,000 in confiscation income – 14 per cent above the force’s target of £239,000. This represents a total of 840 items sold by police over the past year through ebay, with all sales being advertised and completed online without any physical presence on the website.
In September last year Leicestershire Police joined forces with the NPCC to launch an online auction site selling items seized from criminals and offenders. It is one of a number of initiatives aimed at creating new sources of income for police forces in England and Wales as funding cuts begin to bite.

The initiative was announced on 4th May this year at a press conference attended by Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner, Lord Willy Bach, as well as Chief Constable Simon Cole.
At the time of its launch in April last year, it was estimated that the online auction site would be able to raise £60,000 for the force within 12 months, and a total of £250,000 over five years. Since then, however, sales on ebay have been much more successful than expected with Leicestershire Police making around £80,000 in six months – double its original target for that period alone.
