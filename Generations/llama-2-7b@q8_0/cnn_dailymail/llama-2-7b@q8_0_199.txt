looker can believe what he's seeing: a young man with one eye using two fingers to throw a ball 90 mph.
In his first season at Southeast Missouri State University, Austin Gomber has been called "the best story in college baseball." And as the team tries to qualify for postseason play this weekend, the Tigers are doing it with the help of one-eyed pitcher Gomber on the mound.
"I have never had anyone tell me that they've seen a person throw a baseball with only one eye," coach Mark Hogan told CNN affiliate KFVS. "Normally we lose people in their career because they can't throw strikes, and here he is throwing 90 miles an hour."
The story begins three years ago when Gomber, then just starting high school, was fishing with friends on the Mississippi River. As a big catch dangled from his line, he felt something hit him in the back of his head. He thought maybe it was another kid tossing a rock. Then the pain grew excruciating and he realized what had happened.
"I got up there and my hand looked like I was holding an octopus," Gomber told KFVS. "It looked pretty bad, but the other guys said they've seen worse."
Gomber went to a hospital in Cape Girardeau, Missouri -- his hometown. A CT scan revealed he had suffered a severe brain injury and needed surgery immediately. During a four-hour procedure, doctors removed a large part of his skull to allow the swelling in his brain to recede.
Doctors were optimistic at first, but when Gomber woke up after surgery he was having trouble moving his left hand. They told him that it was paralyzed and might never return to normal function. After a few months of therapy, he regained the ability to move his hand -- but he also lost most of his vision in his left eye.
"I could see fine when I first woke up," Gomber said. "But by the time my parents came home it was all gone." He's left-handed and has been pitching for as long as he can remember, so he began to learn how to throw without his dominant eye.
"The first few times I had a coach out there to help me," Gomber said. "After that it was kind of on my own. I did a lot of experimentation."
Gomber began pitching in high school as soon as he could see again, and last fall he received an athletic scholarship from the Southeast Missouri State University Redhawks baseball team.
"He's just the most remarkable young man," said his mother, Shannon Gomber. "The whole situation has been amazing." She is trying to find a way to keep her son's story alive after he graduates in May: an autobiography or maybe even a movie deal.
Last spring at Southeast Missouri State University the team went 45-16, finished second in its conference and advanced to regionals. It was Gomber's first year on the roster and he became the most dependable pitcher on the team. He'll be back with his teammates this weekend as they try for a spot at the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.
"It's not easy," Gomber said. "But I just go out there and do my best."
