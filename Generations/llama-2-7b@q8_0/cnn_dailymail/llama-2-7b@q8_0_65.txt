But top law enforcement officials and gun control advocates alike said Congress needed to act, because current laws are failing to stem the flood of illegal weapons from Arizona's border towns southward across Mexico.
"The firearms coming out of our border town ports in Arizona have become a real crisis," said ATF special agent George Gillette, who oversees gun enforcement operations in southern Arizona. "It is a concern to us and we're doing what we can with the resources that are available to us."
At least 90 percent of the firearms seized in Mexico originated from the United States, according to statistics presented Wednesday at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing.
In the last year alone, Mexican authorities have confiscated more than 132,500 guns and arrested nearly 18,000 suspects tied to weapons trafficking, according to the State Department. That's an increase from years past in large part because of stepped-up efforts by the Mexican government, but it's still not enough to stem the flow.
Arizona residents have been caught up in the middle of this as criminals use their guns for crimes elsewhere, said Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Tucson who serves on the committee and called Wednesday's hearing to examine what Congress should do about it.
Grijalva said he received 43 calls in January alone from constituents whose firearms were used in crimes south of the border -- including the killing of a Mexican police officer by an Arizona resident who was also wanted for murder back home. The gun was found at a crime scene in Mexico and later turned over to federal officials, Grijalva said.
"The fact that these guns are being smuggled into Mexico and finding their way into the hands of drug traffickers is obviously problematic," he said. "What's even more troubling is that many of the individuals who commit crimes with these firearms in Mexico, they have records here in the United States."
The hearing came a week after Attorney General Eric Holder testified on Capitol Hill about a report he commissioned last year from the Justice Department. It concluded that Mexican drug cartels are using American guns to fuel their rampant violence, and called for congressional action to strengthen firearms laws and curtail the flow of weapons into Mexico.
It was one of several recent calls for tougher laws or better enforcement from lawmakers on both sides of the border. Holder's report also recommended increased funding for law enforcement on both sides of the border, including $39 million to help train police in Mexico and an additional 105 agents at the ATF.
Grijalva said the money was needed because Mexican authorities have been working with fewer resources than their counterparts in the United States.
"You're talking about a country that is essentially bankrupt, that has to do more with less," he said. "We want them to be successful."
But lawmakers were also told Wednesday that current laws are not adequate and it may take new ones. The Justice Department report said U.S. gun trafficking laws need strengthening so that criminals face tougher penalties for obtaining guns illegally, even if they never cross the border or use those firearms in crimes here.
Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who is the ranking member of the committee and has made gun control issues his signature cause, said Wednesday that he intends to push legislation that would close loopholes in current laws and help law enforcement better track illegal guns.
He called for tougher penalties against those who sell stolen weapons or provide them to felons -- crimes that could lead to a minimum 10-year prison term under the proposed law.
"The Mexican people should not be treated as second class citizens with respect to gun laws and regulations," he said, citing Holder's call for tighter firearms laws in Mexico. "We don't need to do it on our side of the border. We need to fix it at both ends."
Issa has sponsored similar legislation previously, but it went nowhere last year when Democrats controlled Congress and were able to block Republican-led efforts. It is unclear whether any version will gain bipartisan support this time around as Republicans took the House majority in the November election.
But Holder was more cautious Wednesday about what could be done. He said that while the federal government had stepped up enforcement along the border and was trying to get more resources for both sides, it still needed help from Congress to address what he called "the firearms piece."
"We have a problem with the flow of weapons south," Holder told members of the committee. "That is something that we need to address in terms of our federal laws and regulations."
