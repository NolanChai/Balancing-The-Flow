Redditor mikrospores was bored, so he decided to test his fellow users’ self control and sense of humor. His instructions were simple: “Whenever you feel like pressing the button (which is actually a link to an image), try your best not to press it.” It was then followed by another statement that read: “I know this isn’t a very good pun, but I tried.”
It didn’t take long for users to begin breaking down. Some were just too curious and had to click on the button to see what was behind it, while others thought they were being tested by some sort of sadistic experiment. The results are hysterical!
