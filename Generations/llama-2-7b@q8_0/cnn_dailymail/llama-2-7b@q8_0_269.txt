“I know I did it. I own it,” said Major Heidi Brown in a statement to military prosecutors at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. “I am sorry that I let down my fellow Soldiers and the Army as a whole.” She was charged with stealing $450,000 from taxpayers.

Her attorney said Major Brown had been under “incredible pressure” when she decided to take money from the company’s accounts and that she had taken steps to correct her wrongdoings.
Brown faces up to 10 years in prison for what prosecutors called a “brazen scheme” and will be sentenced on September 25, according to court documents. She was released on bail but has been ordered not to leave the area.
According to an indictment, Brown diverted money from the company’s bank accounts between March 2011 and May this year, making hundreds of unauthorised transfers from the funds meant for a training center in Fort Bragg into her personal account. She is also accused of using false accounting records to cover up the embezzlements.
Brown’s attorney Michael Sullivan said: “Major Brown, in her own words, recognizes that she made mistakes and should have never taken a penny from the Army.”
“The facts will show that she has always been loyal to the Army and she deeply regrets that she let down the people who trusted her,” Sullivan said. “She is very grateful for the support of her fellow Soldiers.”
Brown’s plea was revealed in a court filing on Wednesday, following a pre-trial conference with prosecutors and Major Brown’s attorneys. In a statement read during that conference she admitted to the charges and said she had “defrauded” her employer of more than $450,000.
“I am not here as a victim or blaming anyone else,” she said. “I know I did it.”
“The Army is committed to ensuring that all of its Soldiers and leaders are held to the highest standards of conduct,” Army spokesman Major Chris Ophardt told Reuters in an email, adding: “Major Brown’s case has been referred for administrative action by her chain of command.”
Heidi Brown was the executive officer of the 528th Engineer Battalion. She became the first female commanding officer at the battalion last year and was promoted to major just three months ago in June, according to a press release from the military’s Public Affairs office.
