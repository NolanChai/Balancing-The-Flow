 as I could talk," said Brown of his musical career. He began writing songs in the seventh grade at age 12. His first big break came when he was 20 and signed with Atlantic Records.
"I would go to work at 3:30 a.m., get off around 8 o'clock, pick up my guitar, write a song and put it out there," said Brown. "This is the way I grew up."
He has made a name for himself in the music industry, but this chef knows how to do something else exceptionally well: cook Southern food. He is now the head chef at Southern Ground.
"I think my mom was really good when it came to meals and her Southern style," said Brown. "She always had these incredible dinners that were full of flavor."
Brown has been using music as a vehicle to get his message across since he started singing at the age of 12, but in recent years, he's also been able to do it through his love of food and Southern cooking.
"It's funny because you can make something that is really good for your body or for healthy eating, but if it tastes bad, nobody is going to eat it," Brown said. "I believe that the best things in life are simple."
So far this year, he has been cooking at festivals like Bonnaroo and BottleRock Napa Valley. He will soon be hitting the road with a tour called Southern Ground Live. The first stop is on May 29th at Virginia's Red Rocks Amphitheater.
"I'm very excited about it because I feel like we have so much to give," said Brown. "This has become one of my passions, and I am just trying to get better."
