 example of how the Gulf states are spending billions to invest in London's luxury hotels.
Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has snapped up a majority stake in Claridge’s, which is one of the world’s most famous hotels. The hotel was owned by the Cadogan Group but it is unclear how much the group paid for the property as the transaction remains undisclosed.
The move comes weeks after QIA also bought a 12% stake in London's Connaught Hotel and a 50% share of the Berkeley Hotel, which are both five-star hotels that have recently been renovated. The purchase by the wealthy Gulf state is just one of many examples of how foreign investors are snapping up properties in central London, hoping to make a profit when prices recover from the shock of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as US President last November.
This deal has further cemented Qatar’s position as the biggest buyer of prime London real estate, with its portfolio already including Harrods, The Shard and Chelsea Barracks. Many experts are expecting that QIA will continue to make purchases in 2017, especially when it comes to investing in hotels in London as this is a market which they know very well.
There were also rumours that QIA could be interested in buying the Savoy Hotel after it was put up for sale last year. The property is currently owned by Fairmont Raffles Hotels International, but Qatar has denied that it wants to buy it. In a statement on its website, it said: “We do not have any plans at this time to purchase the hotel and will continue our active investment in the United Kingdom.”
London's hotels are proving to be popular with international investors but it is unclear how long prices will stay high in the city. A recent report by CBRE stated that there was a 15% drop in the value of prime central London property between May and June last year. The price has since recovered, however.
London’s hotels are proving to be popular with investors from abroad who can see the potential for future growth. The city is currently enjoying an influx of Chinese tourists as well as those travelling for work purposes. This has led to a boom in luxury hotels being built across central London, although many have struggled to keep their prices up amid growing competition from Airbnb and other short-term renting platforms.
The acquisition by Qatar shows that investors are still keen to take advantage of the current situation as they hope that prices will start increasing once again after a period of stagnation caused by Brexit and Trump’s election victory last November.
