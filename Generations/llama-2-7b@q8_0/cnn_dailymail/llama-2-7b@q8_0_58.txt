In Walter Isaacson's authorized biography, "Steve Jobs," set for release Monday, Isaacson details how Jobs was diagnosed and treated in 2003 and 2004. In early 2004, Jobs went to an oncologist who told him he had pancreatic cancer. The doctor gave Jobs a year to live if the tumor were not removed.
According to Isaacson's book, Jobs postponed surgery for nine months -- which the biographer describes as "a typical Jobsian delay" and said was against his doctors' advice. He continued taking nutritional supplements and adopted a macrobiotic diet he felt would help fight cancer, according to Isaacson.
In the end, though, Jobs underwent surgery in 2004 and had part of his pancreas removed. His tumor was caught early enough that it was successful and didn't spread.
"Jobs later said he regretted that decision," Isaacson writes, according to an excerpt provided to CNN. "In a way, it made him appreciate what people go through when they get cancer." Jobs told Isaacson about the incident in 2010 shortly before his death last year at age 56.
Jobs' pancreatic cancer recurred in 2008 and was diagnosed again in 2009, according to a statement from Jobs' family released by Apple after his October 2011 death. He died of the disease on October 5 at age 56.
Jobs co-founded Apple Inc., along with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, in 1976. The company -- which was named for its original address, 2068 Crist Drive, in Cupertino, California -- has since become one of the most influential companies in American history, introducing the iPod, iPhone, iPad and a whole host of other products that changed how we communicate with each other and access information.
"Steve Jobs," published by Simon & Schuster, is based on more than 40 interviews Isaacson conducted with Jobs and 150 others, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; Tim Cook, Apple's chief operating officer who succeeded Jobs when he resigned in August; Bill Gates of Microsoft; the late Steve Covey, author of "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"; and the late Albert II, prince of Monaco.
