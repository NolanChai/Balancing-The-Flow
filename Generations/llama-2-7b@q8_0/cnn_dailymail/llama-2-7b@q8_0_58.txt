irteen year old brother Sam panicking for four hours as they searched for him.
The schoolboy was found dead at 5:20pm (15:20 GMT) on Tuesday by a group of French skiers who alerted police, said local authorities in the Haute Savoie region near Mont Blanc. His body was flown to the nearby town of Annecy for an autopsy.
Police spokesman Xavier Bailly-Chambard said: ‘It is a very sad incident but we have no indication as yet that it wasn’t accidental.’ Sam, who returned home yesterday, told his mother in tears how he had tried to find him and called him ‘over and over again on the phone. “It was like torture,’ she said.
Carwyn and Sam Scott-Howell of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire were part of a group of nine British children staying at the Chalet du Lac in Megeve. The family arrived last Thursday to begin their ski trip but returned home on Sunday after Carwyn fell ill.
On Monday morning, Sam and his sister Carys, 12, went back for another day’s skiing while Carwyn stayed behind at the chalet with parents Linda and Dave. The couple decided to go up to the nearby resort of La Giettaz, leaving their son in charge. But later that afternoon he disappeared from the chalet while his younger brother was playing outside.
When Sam and Carys returned they could not find him and so went to speak with a police officer who arrived at the chalet. Sam told investigators how his brother had set off on his own as soon as they got there after saying that he ‘just wanted to go skiing’, but did not return.
He said he called Carwyn again about three hours later and the phone rang out. He then tried to call him for a third time before getting a busy signal. The police search was launched immediately but with no luck, as it had been snowing heavily all day.
The boy was found near to where Sam fell after losing his way. The family have asked friends not to make any comments and declined to give details about the funeral or inquest.
