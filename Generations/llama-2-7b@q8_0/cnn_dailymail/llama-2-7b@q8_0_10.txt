 one group of young people is giving their time to help raise money and awareness for others.
The "Kidz on the Block" program started in 2007 when two high school friends wanted to give something back. The organization was founded by Michael Leibowitz, now a college student at New York University, and Adam Cohen, now an actor who has appeared in several Broadway shows.
Leibowitz said they were inspired after seeing people perform on the street for donations, which he says can be quite disheartening. So they decided to do something good.
Their first performance was at a local homeless shelter and since then they've been performing in places like hospitals, day cares and senior centers all over Manhattan, as well as in Washington and Los Angeles. They have also traveled to Canada twice to perform for kids who are less fortunate than they are.
Their act is unique; instead of playing instruments or singing, the group dances to songs like "Happy" by Pharrell Williams or "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift while wearing oversized masks and costumes. The audience members have no idea who's behind the mask and get a chance to interact with them as they perform.
Leibowitz said the group has made an effort to create a sense of community among kids, not just by dancing but also by helping others. One example is a "Give-Away Day" where members donate clothes that are then given out to other kids in need. The group also does charity events such as collecting toys at the holidays and food for homeless shelters around New York City, and recently started a project called "Tell Someone You Love Them," which encourages people to send letters of appreciation to people who have helped them during their lives.
"I think what really inspires me is seeing how the kids react. They're always so excited and it just makes you realize that everyone has something different they can offer, whether its your time or money," said Leibowitz, now 21 years old.
The group also hopes to spread awareness about homelessness and poverty issues among children who have never had a personal connection with people in those situations. While performing for kids at schools and day cares, they hope to teach them how to be compassionate towards others as well. The members of Kidz on the Block also plan to keep spreading their message far beyond New York City's borders.
"It's definitely something that I see myself doing in the future and it's a passion that will continue for me," Cohen, now 21 years old, said about his involvement with Kidz on the Block.
Kidz on the Block has also received support from celebrities including actress America Ferrera, who gave money after seeing them perform in New York City last year.
