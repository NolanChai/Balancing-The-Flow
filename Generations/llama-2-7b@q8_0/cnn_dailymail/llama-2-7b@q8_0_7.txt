24-year old man calling himself Dr Musa Cerantonio, who was born as Christopher Cornell and grew up in Melbourne.
Dr Cerantonio, who has been described by experts as a "radical Islamic extremist," says that the new service is called the Khalef Medical Centre and is launching its first mobile clinics in Aleppo. He said he hoped to see dozens of hospitals built within months.
"We will bring medical assistance to our people who are dying on a daily basis due to Western attacks," Dr Cerantonio says in the video. "We ask Allah that you send us good doctors."
The propaganda video shows several injured people being treated at a hospital, which appears to have been constructed with help from prisoners, and claims that the service is already operating 20 clinics across northern Syria.
Dr Cerantonio has been in contact with Australian law enforcement officers since leaving Australia for Syria in 2013, but said his contacts were limited to "friendly greetings" and he was not a target of an investigation. It is understood that he returned to Australia last year, but did not breach any conditions on his return as he had been away for less than six months.
The Australian government has warned against travelling to Syria because of the threat from Islamic State (IS) militants and the danger posed by terrorist attacks.
"We do not want Australians going over there," Prime Minister Tony Abbott said last year. "If they go, if they are captured, we will do everything within our power to bring them home."
