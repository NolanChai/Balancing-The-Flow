Seven U.S. Marines were killed in the midair collision of two U.S. military helicopters along the Arizona-California border, officials said Thursday. Six killed in the crash were based at Camp Pendleton, California; one was from Nevada. They died when their HMH-362 Sea Knights crashed around 1:40 p.m. MST (1540 GMT) Wednesday near Yuma, Arizona. A second helicopter also went down nearby, and four people were rescued. The Navy said it was searching for survivors of the second crash but called off the search late Thursday night due to dangerous conditions caused by high winds, low visibility and desert temperatures. It did not provide a tally of those rescued from the second helicopter. All five passengers on that craft were Marines, officials said.
The 173rd Fighter Wing of the Nevada Air National Guard was conducting night training exercises at the time and spotted the crash site with infrared equipment late Wednesday, said Capt. John Higgins, a wing public affairs officer. The unit’s members immediately called 911 to report they had found survivors.
“They were in an area that is extremely remote, very rugged and steep terrain,” Higgins said in an interview Thursday with NBC News. “We’re still searching for the missing aircrew.”
He added: “This has been a difficult week for us.”
The helicopters were conducting routine training when they crashed, he said. The two crews did not have any scheduled drills, Higgins said, though it was unclear why the helicopters flew so far from the base to start with. He added that the pilots are trained and experienced, though he declined to provide their names.
The U.S. Marine Corps also confirmed on Thursday that three of its helicopter units had been called into active duty in response to an unspecified “event.” The 1st Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; the 2nd Helicopter Squadron from Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and the 5th Marine Regimental Combat Team from Quantico, Virginia — each a unit that has participated in previous missions to Iraq and Afghanistan — were on alert for possible deployment.
“We don’t have any details at this point,” Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, head of the Marines Corps’ Joint Task Force 160, told reporters during a briefing Thursday in Yuma. He declined to say whether he believed a military mission was imminent or if it would be an air or ground operation. “This is not an invasion force,” Hertling said.
He added that the Marine Corps had not received any requests from the Defense Department for troops to deploy, but would continue to provide support as needed. The Pentagon did not immediately return a request for comment on why it sent in the three units.
