A Malaysian air traffic controller is accused of deliberately misleading Vietnamese authorities into believing the plane was in one place when it had in fact crashed elsewhere in the region – and no one seems willing or able to say where that might be.
Experts have suggested a number of possible locations for the missing Boeing 777, which disappeared almost two weeks ago with 239 people on board after leaving Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. But despite intensive searches by aircraft and ships in each of these areas, no trace has been found.

Because Vietnamese military radar operators were tracking the plane as it flew over their country, they might have a vital clue about its ultimate fate. But so far none of them are willing to speak out and reveal what they know.
That has prompted speculation that an attempt is being made to cover up for failure to provide adequate air defences on the ground in the region.
"It's a massive international effort, but no-one wants to say where it's at," said Paul Beaver of aviation consultancy firm Aviation Safety Investigation. "I have no idea why."
He said that it was not only Vietnamese officials who had so far refused to talk about the missing plane. Even those in neighbouring countries such as Thailand and Myanmar appeared reluctant to open up, he added.
Mr Beaver, a former pilot for British Airways, said that the most likely location for the aircraft would be somewhere in the south China sea, close to Vietnam's coastline. There is currently an intensive search operation ongoing along this stretch of water. But he said it was possible the plane could also have gone down further west, off the coast of Myanmar and Thailand.

"We are looking for a needle in a haystack, but there has to be something out there somewhere," he said. "Someone is obviously trying to keep this under wraps – possibly military people who don't want to reveal any gaps in their air defences."
Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines said on Saturday that it would take legal action against satellite communication company Inmarsat, which has played a key role in the search for MH370. The carrier accused Inmarsat of making "unsubstantiated statements" about its commercial relationship with the firm.
The airline is trying to establish whether any of the passengers or crew on the flight had been due to attend an event at the Beijing International Airport, where it was expected to arrive around 6am local time on March 8. The company said this could shed more light on the possible whereabouts of the aircraft and its fate.
Meanwhile, the wife of one of the passengers has spoken for the first time since her husband disappeared. Hu Zhenhua said she had no idea why his plane was flying over the Indian Ocean rather than heading to China or the nearest land mass of Indonesia. She added that he had been in touch with family and friends just before he vanished.
"He called my brother, who lives in Guangzhou, and told him he loved us all," she said. "It was so strange. My brother asked him 'What's going on?' but he didn't answer."
