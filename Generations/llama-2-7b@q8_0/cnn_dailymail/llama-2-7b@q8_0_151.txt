26, came off the bench to score against his old club in a 3-0 win at Santiago Bernabeu.
This has led to speculation that the winger is unhappy with life in Spain and would be prepared to leave Madrid this summer. Real are believed to have offered him an increased contract but Bale turned it down, while he also recently revealed that his family had moved back home from Spain so they could help his children settle into school.
There was a time when the 26-year old was expected to be a key member of the Real Madrid team for years to come. However, the Wales international has played just seven minutes in their last two matches and is currently out injured after suffering an abdominal strain at the start of this month.
As reported by The Sun, his agent Jonathan Barnett recently claimed that Bale was not being paid enough. Speaking to Sky Sports News HQ, he said: "They are paying him too little for what he is delivering on the pitch and for what he does off the pitch."
Barnett went on to reveal that his client has asked to be left out of Real's squad for next weekend's league game against Barcelona. But Madrid insist they will not accept a transfer request. It is reported that Bale would like to return to former club Tottenham, although it seems highly unlikely he could persuade the Londoners to let him back as Spurs are currently doing very well and have just signed Eric Dier from Leicester City.
Real Madrid's victory over Atletico on Wednesday means they stay in second place behind Barcelona with four matches of the season left, although a win for Pep Guardiola's men against Villarreal this evening would leave Real trailing by one point if Lionel Messi and co. get past Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.
