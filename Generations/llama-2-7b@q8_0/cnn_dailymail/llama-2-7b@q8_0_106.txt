hlers, 38, had been on antidepressants and suffered with depression and anxiety for years.
The mother-of-two lay down on the tracks at Blackfriars station, central London, after learning her husband Rami Oehlers was having an affair, it is alleged. A jury yesterday heard Donna had become upset by her husband's relationship with another woman and decided to kill herself and her son after leaving him a suicide note.
Mr Oehlers, 51, who married Donna in Egypt in 2003 and moved them from London to Germany in 2008, has been charged with the manslaughter of his wife and son on March 4. He was arrested at his home in Berlin after police found his passport.
The Old Bailey heard Donna's brother-in-law Mohamed Awad had seen her the day before she killed herself and her son and described her as "very, very depressed". Mr Oehlers was said to have been unaware of how ill she was and believed his wife had recovered from a period of mild depression after their son's birth in 2008.
He has denied he knew about the affair between Donna and her lover, Mohamed Al-Hajjar, who lived near him in London.
The jury heard that Ms Oehlers had become "very, very upset" on learning Mr Oehlers was having an affair with his colleague and former lover, Mrs Justice Falk said.
She added: "She became so upset she took her son down to the train station where she put him on a bench, sat herself down next to him and then got up, went over to the edge of the tracks and jumped."
Mrs Oehlers had told a relative she intended to kill herself before she travelled from London to Berlin at the end of February.
She took an antidepressant drug but also drank heavily, according to the jury heard. Mr Oehlers said he did not know how ill his wife was and believed her depression was caused by the arrival of their son.
The couple had lived in Berlin for the past two years but Ms Oehlers had planned a return trip to London. She wrote a suicide note, telling Mr Al-Hajjar she loved him and wished they could be together. The letter found after her death is said to have been addressed to Mr Al-Hajjar's wife.
Mr Awad said he spoke to his sister on the day of her death. He told the court: "She said everything was OK. She asked me if I thought Rami would be back in London soon."
He said his sister had a history of depression and he did not believe she intended to kill herself or her son.
The trial will continue today.
