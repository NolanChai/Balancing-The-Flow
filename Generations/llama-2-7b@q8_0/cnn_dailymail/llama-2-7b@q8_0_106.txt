year-old daughter and for injuring his other children. The father of two daughters and a son was convicted on 16 charges, including aggravated child abuse, in connection with the August 2009 death of 10-year-old Sara Mohamud. The jury returned its verdict after deliberating for about five hours at the Hamilton County Justice Center. The jury heard that on the day Sara died, her father went to their apartment in West End and beat all three children with a belt or his fists. Prosecutors argued during the trial that the youngster was beaten so severely that she sustained internal injuries, including two skull fractures, brain swelling and hemorrhaging. Mohamud also suffered head injuries and his 8-year-old daughter required hospital treatment for a broken arm, prosecutors said. The girl's older sister testified on Wednesday that her father had beaten them before but never so severely. He faces a possible death sentence when he is sentenced Jan. 25 by Judge Stephen McIntosh. "We're very pleased with the verdict," prosecutor Jim Neal said. "The jury was able to see and understand that this defendant did some terrible things." Mohamud, who has remained in custody since his arrest more than three years ago, appeared stunned as McIntosh read him his rights Thursday morning before the trial began. His attorney, Mike Allen, declined comment outside the courtroom after the verdict was announced. Ali-Mohamed Mohamud's daughters were beaten in 2009 by their father. (Photo: Provided/WCPO)
