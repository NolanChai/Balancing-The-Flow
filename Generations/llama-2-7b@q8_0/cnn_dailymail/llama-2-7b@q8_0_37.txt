Roberto Carlos: My dream is to be Brazil coach
Roberto Carlos has revealed his desire to one day become manager of Brazil and the former Real Madrid defender claims he finds coaching 'very easy' after the pressures he faced as a player.
The 42-year-old played more than 100 times for Brazil in a career that spanned two decades, playing with some of the best players around and winning countless trophies including two Champions Leagues at Real Madrid and one FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea in 2002.
As well as his exploits on the pitch Roberto is also known for his 'Rullo' free-kicks that were often converted into goals. He will always be remembered as being a player of pure class with a never ending desire to win trophies and it seems he wants to stay in football after retiring from playing.
Speaking to Sky Sports, Carlos said: "I was very young when I started, 21 or 22-years old when I arrived at Real Madrid for the first time. At that moment I had no idea what pressure is and now, having played many years in my career, I know exactly how it feels.
"This [coaching] is another world but I'm not scared about this. For me it looks very easy. I really like to manage players because you have a lot of time for your family."
When asked what the key to winning games is, Roberto said: "I think the key is to believe that you are going to win and enjoy yourself on the pitch. Then after that, in every situation you can find good solutions."
And despite having no managerial experience as yet Carlos is certain he would be able to succeed at the top level. He added: "The main problem is how many years [I've played] but this is not a problem for me because I have an experience of 20 years in football and I have another four or five years ahead."
He also revealed that his time as assistant coach with Brazil has given him a lot of insight into what it takes to win matches.
