2010 African Cup of Nations winners Cameroon at the World Cup finals after being suspended for four games by his country's FA for disrespecting coach Paul Le Guen, according to the Associated Press.
Eto'o was fined £6,844 ($12,000) and given a three-match ban following the incident with Le Guen, who is stepping down from his post after Cameroon failed to qualify for next year's Olympics. The striker refused to leave the pitch at half-time in an African Nations Cup match against Burkina Faso on October 6 last year and was later fined by the country's football federation.
The fine has been reduced, but Eto'o will not be allowed back into training until he has paid £132 ($240), the report states.
City have been in talks with Barcelona over a potential £35 million ($66 million) move for 28-year-old Eto'o, who is in his third season at Camp Nou and won Spain's league title last year. However, negotiations broke down earlier this week when City refused to meet Barcelona's asking price of around £40m ($70m).
City will now continue their pursuit for a new forward with Emmanuel Adebayor in doubt as to whether he will join the club permanently after failing to agree personal terms with owner Thaksin Shinawatra.
Meanwhile, Manchester United have confirmed that they will make a bid to sign Real Madrid defender Ricardo Carvalho following his reported interest in moving to Old Trafford earlier this month.
"Manchester United's executive vice chairman has spoken with the player and the club will submit an official offer for him," a statement from the Portuguese star's agent, Jorge Mendes, read on Friday morning. "I am confident that the transfer of Ricardo Carvalho to Manchester United will be finalized very soon."
The 29-year-old has been linked with a move away from Madrid since he was left out of Los Blancos' Champions League squad for this season. The Portugal international made only 10 starts in all competitions last season and was reportedly offered to rivals Barcelona by the European champions as they looked to free up space for the return of Sergio Ramos following his recovery from knee surgery.
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had indicated that he would be prepared to bid for Carvalho, who played under the Scot during their time together at Sporting Lisbon and helped Portugal win Euro 2004. But United have been linked with other defenders in recent days and will not sign another center-back until they know whether Rio Ferdinand is able to resume playing after his serious knee injury.
"We've got a good group of players, we're looking forward to the season ahead," Ferguson said last week. "Carvalho was a very good player at Chelsea. We would be interested in him because he is a top class player."
