100 people a celebratory shindig on Saturday (08.12) in the hope of raising more cash to pay off her hospital bills - which amount to over £4,500. She's already been branded a 'waste of space' and a 'porn star wannabe' after having taxpayers stump up for a breast enlargement and liposuction in 2015.
Josie Cunningham - who has previously claimed her boobs have made it difficult to find work - will be celebrating with friends at the Leeds pub The Cross Keys on Saturday (8 December). She will also be auctioning off a number of gifts she was given by various companies, including an overnight stay for two in a top London hotel and tickets to a West End show. The 23-year-old mother-of-one said: "I'm really excited for my birthday party next weekend, I hope everyone can come along and have fun on the night.
"The main aim is to raise some money but also to celebrate my boobs because they've been an amazing gift." It comes after she hit back at criticism over her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, which was arranged by Channel 5 to follow up on a controversial story about the NHS funding. She said: "People think I have done nothing with my life but they forget that I lost all of my money and had to start again from scratch after the operation.
"I also had to take care of my daughter whilst all this was going on." Cunningham recently posted a picture online saying she has now paid off her NHS bill in full - but has admitted she owes £2,000 to the private company that carried out her surgery. "I've raised enough money to pay off my hospital bills so I don't have to pay any more," she said. Cunningham went on: "But unfortunately there are still outstanding debts from the private cosmetic clinic in Leeds where I had my liposuction and fat transfer as well." She added that she is now looking for a new job but claims her appearance has hampered her prospects - adding: "I have been turned down for every single job because of my boobs.
"People don't understand why I went on Celebrity Big Brother when they think it will help me to get work."
Lets hope they make you pay back all the money you owe, plus interest and add on a few more hundreds for being an idiot!
The bitch is having a party? Good for her. She has every right to have one. And I'm sure that she will be able to invite anyone she wants to if she pays the price of entry, which, I am certain, will not exceed £20 per head. If people are unable to afford it and want to go then they should just stay home - or perhaps take a look at themselves in a mirror before complaining about her boobs!
Hmm... interesting. And a good point too.
