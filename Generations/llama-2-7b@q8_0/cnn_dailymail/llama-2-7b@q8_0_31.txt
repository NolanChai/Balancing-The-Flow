uz Atkinson all joined compatriot Stefano Belleri in refusing to play.
French striker Souleymane Doukara was the latest player to pull out of Saturday's game against Charlton Athletic after suffering an injury on international duty with France U21s, and manager Steve Evans has called for a stop to the mass exodus of players from the club.
The Championship side are in disarray after losing seven games in a row to leave them 15th in the table. Evans wants his senior squad at his disposal to turn the club's fortunes around, but he admitted on Thursday that he cannot guarantee their future if they continue to quit the club in such numbers.
"We want all our players and we are happy to have all of them," said Evans. "I think it is quite clear that I need senior professionals on the pitch for me and if you can't get those senior professionals, which is what you need as a manager, then you find yourself in real trouble."
Del Fabro was reportedly injured in training and Bellusci has a groin problem after returning early from Italy duty, while Atkinson was not even on the Leeds squad that went to Austria. Antenucci and Belleri were released for international commitments but have now pulled out of the match with Charlton as they battle to save their club's season.
Evans has had a huge number of players leave this month alone, which he admitted on Thursday would be difficult to rectify. "We are in a position where we have to use every single one of them and we have to use all our resources," he said. "If the players who do leave us can't find it in their hearts or whatever else it is that is motivating them, then they are not really good enough."
Leeds are now without three defenders after Liam Cooper left to join Norwich City on loan until the end of the season and Sam Byram has joined West Ham United. The Leeds boss has been forced to play his teenage striker Dominic Poleon at centre-half in recent weeks, while he also tried to recall striker Souleymane Doukara from France duty with the under-21 side after his latest injury blow.
"The players are looking for a way out and they've got one," Evans said on Thursday. "If we continue like that we will be in massive trouble."
