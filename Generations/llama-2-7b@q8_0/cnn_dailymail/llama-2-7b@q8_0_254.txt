emy's constant posts that they decided to make a bit of fun out of it.
The group of women from Cincinnati, Ohio, came together to create the Facebook page ‘Baby Boredom’ and have shared pictures of their children making faces that would make even the most experienced photographer cringe - but they are actually pretty cute! The pictures are a response to a friend who is constantly posting photos of her newborn baby and after being inundated with images of him she decided to start uploading pics of her own kids as revenge.
“We were all friends on Facebook when we realized that one of our friends had posted over 30 pictures in a matter of days,” said the page's creator, Ashley Cummins-Powell. “This was ridiculous! We decided to create an alternative place for us to share our 'boring' pics.”
Since it’s been set up just 24 hours ago, the Facebook group has already amassed almost 10,000 likes and the women are encouraging other people to join in. Ashley added that she didn’t think it would become so popular when they first decided to create a page but now it's more of an online support group than anything else.
“We knew we weren't alone, which is why I think this has worked,” she said. “It was kind of therapeutic for us, and made us feel better about our boring pictures.”
