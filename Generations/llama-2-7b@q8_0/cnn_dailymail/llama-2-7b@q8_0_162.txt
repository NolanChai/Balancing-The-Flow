 moon phase is over and they're in the thick of married life, Jessika Power has confessed that she and her husband Mick Gould do have sex and even admit to being "in love".
In an interview with New Idea published on Saturday (July 7), the blonde bombshell made it clear that they do have a physical relationship. "I know, I know," Jessika said when asked by the publication if she and Mick are still intimate. "We're in love."
Speaking of their sex life, the reality star explained: "It takes time to build up a sexual chemistry with someone but it's definitely there now. It's just about getting that comfort level." When asked whether they use protection when having intercourse, Jessika replied: "Of course we do! We are responsible and considerate of one another."
The couple tied the knot in June after deciding to get hitched on the first day of the show. Since their wedding, viewers have been left wondering whether Mick and Jessika are actually in love or if they're just playing up for the cameras. However, during her interview with New Idea, Jessika revealed that she is "definitely falling in love" with the 38-year-old, adding: "I definitely love him."
While it seems like their relationship could be on a rocky path from the start due to Jessika's infamous comment about her future husband being "unattractive", she and Mick have been determined to make things work despite any issues. While speaking with New Idea, the 26-year-old admitted that they don't spend a lot of time apart since their wedding as well as revealing what he does for her when she's feeling down.
"He’ll go and give me hugs all day," Jessika explained. "That is definitely something I love about him." She added: "[Mick] always makes sure he's there to support me, even if it doesn't seem like I need his help at the time because I'm independent."
The Married At First Sight star said that Mick will often do things for her "without expecting anything in return" and she explained: "He is just so sweet and kind. It really does melt my heart every day to see how much he cares about me and my happiness."
