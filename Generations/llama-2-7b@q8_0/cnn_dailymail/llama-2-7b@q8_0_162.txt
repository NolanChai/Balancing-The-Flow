A Florida judge ordered a rude public defender to leave his courtroom before punching him in the head, witnesses have said.
The scrap began during a court session in Viera, where Jared Ficklin, 28, was representing a client.
He told the judge he had a motion for dismissal, according to Newsweek, but did not specify which case it concerned.
District Court Judge Wendy Berger was apparently less than impressed by his lack of attention and gave him an earful as she asked him to sit down before punching him in the head.

Berger told the 28-year-old: ‘Sit down and listen to me!’ before turning her attention to another defendant.
But Ficklin did not sit down as expected and instead responded by yelling back: ‘You don’t want to talk to me? You’re not going to be talking to anyone if I get out of here alive.’
He then walked over to the judge, grabbing her by the shoulder, before punching her in the head.
The judge immediately tried to calm him down and told him: ‘You can leave. If you don’t leave now, I will arrest you on the spot,’ according to WFTV.
She then called for backup and was later seen crying at the courthouse as she waited for paramedics to arrive.
Ficklin has reportedly since been arrested after leaving the courtroom, where he told police that he had no memory of the incident.

In a statement on Facebook, Ficklin said: ‘It is with great sadness that I accept full responsibility for my actions today.
‘I will fully cooperate with authorities and take any punishment that comes my way.’
Berger also posted an update to her Facebook page on Thursday.
She wrote: ‘Thank you all who have reached out regarding yesterday’s incident at the Court House.
‘As many of you know, I am a tough judge but very fair and respectful to each party and their attorneys that appear before me.
‘I was not expecting what happened with Mr Ficklin yesterday.
Berger said: ‘I appreciate the many well wishes.’
She later told her husband during an interview that she was ‘fine’ after the incident and had no broken bones or bruises, but was still feeling sore following a doctor’s check-up.

The judge said: ‘He punched me. I mean it was like a man hit me.’
‘I will fully cooperate with authorities and take any punishment that comes my way,’ Ficklin wrote (pictured) in an update to his Facebook page on Thursday morning after being charged with misdemeanour battery
Her husband, who was not named by the outlet, said: ‘I don’t even know what to think of it. You see this stuff on TV, but I never thought I would be living through it.’
He also told his wife that he had no idea why she hadn’t told him about the incident earlier and he was only alerted because someone called him in a panic.
The judge’s husband said: ‘I just thought it was crazy. It doesn’t seem real.’
‘He punched me. I mean it was like a man hit me,’ Berger (pictured) said of the incident, according to WFTV
‘I wasn’t really scared for myself, but I was very scared for my wife. I’m still in shock.’
The judge told her husband that the 28-year-old lawyer had hit her and punched her in the face ‘like a man’.
She added: ‘It felt like he didn’t know what he was doing, but he hit me very hard.’
Berger said that she did not think Ficklin was sober at the time of the incident as it seemed to be a ‘premeditated action’ and because he was using his right hand.
The judge also said that she had never seen him before and that she had not done anything to provoke the alleged attack.
She told WFTV: ‘I’ve had some pretty bad people in front of me, but I have always treated everyone fairly and equally.’
Ficklin has reportedly been charged with misdemeanour battery and was being held at the Brevard County Jail on Friday.
