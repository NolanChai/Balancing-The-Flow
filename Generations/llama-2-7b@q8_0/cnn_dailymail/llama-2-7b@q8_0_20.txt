The man once dubbed 'Sir Porky' by Margaret Thatcher has lost much more than just 50 lbs. By Tom Leonard and Martin Beckford Updated: 07:19 EST, 3 June 2016 Sir John Stanley, who famously boasted that he was so fat the Queen could ride on him when he was an MP in the 1980s, has lost a court battle to keep his wife and £5.5million fortune. The former Tory politician – nicknamed ‘Sir Porky’ by Margaret Thatcher – failed yesterday in a bid to overturn divorce proceedings that had been brought after he boozed and binged on cakes with his mistress.
A judge said at the time that Sir John, 83, had been 'living out of control' as he ordered him to give up the £50,000 a year flat he shared with wife Lady Diana Stanley in Chelsea and move into a smaller property. The former MP, who was known for his extravagant spending while working as an MEP after leaving Parliament, is now living at his daughter's home on the outskirts of London. He was told to pay £300,000 in legal costs, which will be taken from a £7 million fortune built up during his career as MP for Colchester.
