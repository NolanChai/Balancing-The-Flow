In a statement, Obama said he has authorized U.S. government assistance to help those seeking safe haven and that his administration was working closely with Egyptian authorities "to ensure the safety of all Americans who are returning home."
"As we have from the start of these protests, my number one priority continues to be the protection of American citizens," Obama said in a statement. "I have directed my Administration to continue coordinating with international partners and local authorities to help facilitate the return home as quickly as possible for U.S. citizens who are currently abroad."
The decision came after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke Thursday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit about "the return of Americans from Tunisia to the United States," according to a statement by her spokesman, Philippe Reines.
In a separate statement, Clinton said she also was working on getting U.S. citizens stranded in Libya to leave. "We are taking all steps necessary to assist our nationals who have chosen to return from the country at this time," she said.
"This has been and will continue to be an extremely fluid situation, but we believe that every effort should be made by individuals to return home as soon as possible."
Clinton's call with Aboul Gheit came after a White House meeting with Obama on Libya in which the president also discussed U.S. assistance for Egyptian citizens leaving Tunisia.
The United Nations announced Thursday that it has launched an "urgent appeal" to help refugees, as the crisis in Libya enters its fifth day.
It said aid efforts are needed to provide shelter and emergency assistance to hundreds of thousands who have fled their homes amid clashes between forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi and opposition fighters.
"The violence, which has already resulted in significant human loss and huge damage to Libyan cities and towns, is severely disrupting the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of families who are struggling to find food or shelter," said John Holmes, United Nations under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs.
"We must now help these people who have been forced from their homes by this conflict."
The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is coordinating the appeal, says it has received reports that more than 300,000 people have fled Libya as fighting continues across the country.
Among them are at least 125,000 refugees who have sought safety in neighboring countries, including Tunisia and Egypt, according to UNOCHA's latest estimate.
UNOCHA also says that many of those who fled Libya lack basic necessities such as food, shelter and medical care and that some are being prevented from returning home by fighting in their area.
In an appeal launched Thursday at the UN headquarters in New York, UNOCHA said it is seeking $36 million to help humanitarian relief efforts for people fleeing Libya. It has already received pledges of more than $8 million.
UNOCHA is asking for donations to cover shelter, health, water and sanitation, protection and other needs.
