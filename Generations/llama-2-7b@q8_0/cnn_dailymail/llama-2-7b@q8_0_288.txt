13th May will mean forever
Mike Bonsor, who scored the final goal at Valley Parade, has died aged 58
The fire was a tragedy for Bradford City in every sense – and it continues to affect us more than forty years on. We lost lives that day, but many more people were devastated by events which have left so much uncertainty about what happened and why.
For the people of Bradford, the fire has also created a collective memory, as well as having a profound effect on our identity – with memories of the disaster often being used to define us. But for me there is one thing that will always stand out: the aftermath of the fire. That was a time when my community came together and supported each other in ways I had never experienced before, or since.
The day after the blaze I returned from my holiday in Cyprus to a phone message telling me about the disaster at Valley Parade. The BBC had invited me to commentate on City’s game against Lincoln City and so as soon as I was back I joined them for the Sky Sports broadcast.
The BBC were understandably keen that there should be some kind of report on their local news bulletin before we kicked off, but they were struggling because it wasn’t clear what had happened, or how many people might have died. And then just a couple of minutes before kick-off I heard John Helm say: “It is believed that the fire started in Blocks 9 and 10.”
In an instant everything changed. I knew we were about to lose a great number of lives, including my best friend Peter Jackson who was a season ticket holder on the Stirling Road End. I have never felt so helpless or as if the world had suddenly gone cold and dark. The whole experience made me very sad for a long time.
Soon after that Lincoln scored with their first attack and we were into the game. The sun shone, the crowd cheered, and it was business as usual at Valley Parade. But I knew it could not go on like this forever.
I had been friends with John since our early days in local radio, so when I got back to my hotel that night he took me for a walk around the city centre where we saw many of his old friends, some of whom were badly burnt in the fire and still suffering as a result.
One person I met was Mike Bonsor whose wife had been sitting next to him when he felt himself being sucked upwards by smoke on that fatal night. He was badly burned and has spent the past forty years working hard to try to make amends for what happened, often in unsung ways.
It wasn’t until after midnight that I returned home to find my family sitting there watching a special programme on Yorkshire Television, presented by one of its regional news correspondents named Michael Parkinson – who was to go onto present the BBC’s flagship chat show for over twenty years. In between updates from the scene he spoke to other people affected by the disaster and told us how many were missing.
That night my wife Lizzie and I sat there, stunned and horrified. We couldn’t believe what we had just seen or heard, because we didn’t want to accept that so many people could be dead – particularly since news of a death toll would only emerge after the tragedy was over.
The next day I reported on the funerals in church and at Valley Parade for a local radio station called BBC Radio Leeds (which was then part of the original national network). It’s hard now to remember how shocked everybody was by those events, but that day – which would turn out to be Lizzie’s 21st birthday – made us realise just how tragic life can suddenly become.
Later that same week I went to Valley Parade for what was then the official funeral service and saw first hand just how many people had lost their lives in the blaze, as well as the sense of loss among those who had suffered so much damage from the fire or smoke. There were also stories about footballers and others who were injured, with some never playing again, and people whose houses were destroyed and needed to be rebuilt.
A few days later I was in Valley Parade again when they began clearing up after the disaster – and that’s where it really struck me for the first time how much had been lost. There was so little left of the stadium, but there was an even deeper sense of loss among people who had so many memories associated with the place and what it meant to them.
That sense of loss was something which I experienced myself after Valley Parade closed. It was like having a chunk missing from your life – and I still feel that way because Bradford City is more than just a football club, or even a set of buildings in Odsal Way. In fact it’s hard to imagine how much we will lose when the National Football Museum closes later this year and moves out of its home on Valley Parade for good.
I don’t think I have ever forgotten what happened that day at Valley Parade, but if I’m honest I haven’t been able to really talk about it or share memories from that time – and I know many others feel the same way. But I am glad people are now more open about what they experienced because we all need to remember how awful things were on May 13th 1985.
