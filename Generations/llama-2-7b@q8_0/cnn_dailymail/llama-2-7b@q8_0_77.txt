. The ability to recall past events may be at risk for some people with chronic insomnia, according to a study conducted in Sweden.
In a series of studies published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, researchers assessed more than 130 participants on their sleep habits and brain functioning. After completing questionnaires related to sleep duration, quality and chronic insomnia, subjects were asked to perform several memory-based tasks.
The ability to recall past events may be at risk for some people with chronic insomnia, according to a study conducted in Sweden.
Researchers assessed more than 130 participants on their sleep habits and brain functioning. After completing questionnaires related to sleep duration, quality and chronic insomnia, subjects were asked to perform several memory-based tasks. Those who had trouble sleeping during the week performed significantly worse when it came to remembering information from the past week than those with normal sleep habits.
"Our findings suggest that sleep deprivation may disrupt memory function in certain regions of the brain," said researcher Per Johansson, a professor at Stockholm's Karolinska Institutet, in an email interview with LiveScience. "These results may be important since insomnia is very common and associated with impaired cognition."
People who have trouble falling asleep or wake up often during the night are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who get a full seven hours of shuteye, according to other research. While these studies cannot prove cause-and-effect relationships, it is possible that people with chronic insomnia could be at risk for brain damage because their lack of sleep causes them to lose out on the benefits associated with deep sleep.
"In general, when we are not able to have a good night's restful sleep our brains function poorly," Johansson said. "For example, we tend to experience difficulties in concentrating and may find it hard to remember things." [Top 10 Things You Didn't Know About Sleep]
Those with insomnia are at particularly high risk of experiencing memory issues because they don't get the deep, restful sleep associated with a slow-wave brain activity. While the brain is awake but not completely conscious during this phase, it is when memories and learning abilities are most active.
"Memory consolidation occurs in phases that we call sleep spindles and slow-wave sleep," Johansson said. "Both of these phases appear to be impaired in insomnia."
Johansson told LiveScience that chronic insomniacs who have difficulty with recalling past events may simply not get enough restful, slow-wave sleep during the night. However, he also cautioned against overstating the effects of poor sleep on memory problems.
"In general, there are so many other factors which influence our memory," Johansson said, pointing to stress as a particular threat. "Although we found that insomnia affects memory functioning and is linked to dementia, it does not mean that the cause of all these problems is bad sleep."
For those with chronic insomnia who are concerned about their lack of memory, Johansson recommended changing their sleep schedule or taking a short nap in the afternoon. But, he cautioned, people should avoid sleeping more than usual because this may only make matters worse by disrupting the body's circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycle.
