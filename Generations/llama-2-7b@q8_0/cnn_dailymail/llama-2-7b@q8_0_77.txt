(CNN) -- The man suspected in the shooting death of an Army private in Colorado on Tuesday was arrested after fleeing police, authorities said Thursday night.
John Patrick Bedell, 23, is accused of shooting Lt. Col. Juanita Warman at Fort Hood, Texas, last May before killing himself with a shot to the head, according to an Army spokeswoman and two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.
Bedell was wanted in the shooting deaths of 13-year-old Jessica James and her father, Michael James, on August 6 outside their home in Silver Springs, Nevada, according to a statement from the Carson City sheriff's office. The suspect was believed to be armed and dangerous and had been driving a dark blue Nissan Maxima with California license plates, authorities said at the time.
Police were tipped off Thursday night that Bedell might have fled to Colorado, where his car was spotted in an area known for marijuana growers, police said. Officers from a federal fugitive task force stopped and arrested him near Denver's Union Station after a chase on foot, Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said.
Warman, 44, died Tuesday morning at Fort Hood. She was shot twice in the back as she walked through her home to get ready for work, authorities said. Her husband, Stephen Warman, was injured during the incident and remains hospitalized.
Bedell had a grudge against military personnel who were deployed overseas and he "was preparing to engage in an attack on soldiers returning from combat," the Army said Tuesday evening in a statement. Authorities declined further comment Wednesday, saying the investigation was ongoing.
