Van Gaal’s side beat bitter rivals Manchester City 2-1 at Old Trafford thanks to a pair of late goals from Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial as United leapfrogged their neighbours into second place in the table.
The result saw Van Gaal’s men close in on the top four for the first time since November, with his team now just five points adrift of league leaders Chelsea – a gap which could be cut to three if the Blues slip up at Crystal Palace this evening.
Van Gaal has been accused of taking too long to establish himself as manager and failing to get United firing early in his time at the club but Cantona believes the Dutchman’s approach is perfect for the modern game – and that United will benefit from it next season.
‘It was a great result,’ he said on French radio station RMC. ‘There were two very strong teams, Manchester City are also playing well and we had a lot of possession but they were not playing with a lot of intensity.
