 list included government officials, celebrities and foreign media.
The hotel closed after a local woman who worked there tested positive for swine influenza A (H1N1), commonly known as "swine flu."
About 200 guests from the Grand Hyatt Hotel were quarantined until Wednesday when the Hong Kong Center of Health Protection deemed them no longer at risk. The woman who tested positive worked in a laundry room at the hotel and is believed to have caught the illness from her family, not another guest.
The guests were released Thursday afternoon and said they had mixed feelings about leaving the building. Some expressed worry that their bills would be paid despite missing out on three days of work or leisure time.
"I am very happy and excited, but I'm also worried," one guest told CNN affiliate TVB Hong Kong. "The government said they will compensate us for lost income. But we still have to pay for our accommodation. How can they be sure the other guests are not carrying swine flu?"
Another man expressed concern about how he would get around the city, but one woman said she was glad to be out of her room and able to mingle with others again.
The hotel's manager told CNN Friday that all those quarantined were compensated for their time. He declined to discuss any details of the case or whether the guest list included foreign media.
"We're not sure what kind of compensation they will get," he said when asked about the issue. "That is something we will talk about with them."
Hong Kong authorities quarantined another hotel in Kowloon on Tuesday after an elderly tourist who had been to Mexico contracted swine flu at that location. A few dozen guests were kept indoors, but none tested positive for the disease. They were released Thursday afternoon.
Authorities have not said how long they plan to keep the hotel quarantined in Hong Kong's Kowloon neighborhood, or when the guests will be allowed back into their rooms.
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has advised all travelers to China that swine flu is spreading rapidly across the country and urged them to take precautions to prevent getting infected.
