Scientists have programmed a computer to read people’s dreams.
They claim their invention, the ‘dream catcher’ is 60 per cent accurate. The level of detail is still far from that of the mind-reading machines of science fiction films such as Minority Report.
But the dream catcher could one day be used to predict epileptic fits or even a heart attack in its early stages, say researchers.
It works by reading brainwaves and then comparing them with a database of previous dreams recorded using electrodes attached to people’s heads.
The computer can then ‘guess’ what someone is dreaming about – if the electrodes are picked up signals similar to those in a dream. The researchers say the technology could one day be used by hospitals, doctors and police officers to predict how patients will behave in stressful situations or whether someone is lying.
Dr Michael Thaut of Colorado University believes that even a low level of accuracy in reading minds could be useful for psychiatrists looking after depressed people, who sometimes cannot explain what they are feeling.
He said: ‘A patient might say “I’m happy” but you can tell by their brainwaves they’re not.’
The technology was developed at the University of California in 2007 to detect epileptic seizures. Scientists believe that dreams and emotions are linked – so perhaps if we are thinking about a loved one or an unpleasant incident, our brains might send out signals which can be picked up by electrodes.
