Crystal Palace have shown signs of life under Roy Hodgson, although their performance at West Brom was far from convincing. They can’t afford any more slip-ups with Arsenal and Burnley to come in March.
On Saturday, Everton welcome Brighton after a 5-1 mauling by Watford left them three points off safety. The Toffees have the best attacking record of anyone in the bottom half, but their leaky defence is costing them dearly.
Another team with plenty of goals in the bank and an abundance of poor defending are Stoke City, who face Swansea at home on Saturday. The Potters have lost all five of their Premier League games since they beat Chelsea 4-2 – a performance that has left boss Paul Lambert facing some tough questions.
Watford’s win over Everton was impressive, but the Hornets can hardly be considered safe after dropping points against West Brom and Bournemouth. They are up to ninth thanks to the points deduction handed out to Manchester City for breaches of Uefa's Financial Fair Play rules.
If they can win at Burnley on Saturday, Watford could move to within one point of sixth-placed Leicester, who are back in action against fellow strugglers Bournemouth at the King Power Stadium.
Few people will be surprised if we see a relegation battle between Brighton and Stoke in May – but it is worth remembering that those two teams finished 14th and 15th respectively last season.
