ame viral.
The couple had been together for a year when Hayleigh Mcbay of Elgin in Moray, Scotland, decided to dump him by text message on April Fools' Day last week - only to see the message go viral and be shared almost 18,000 times on Facebook. The prank was meant to make her boyfriend, David Clarke, laugh but it backfired when she did not realize how popular it would become online.
The teenager is now seeking a way of taking down the post after discovering that her joke had made global news. Hayleigh wrote: 'To my dearest David, I'm breaking up with you. It's not because you cheated on me or beat me, it's because you are so boring and unattractive.'
David replied to the text message with a screenshot of her post which he then shared on his Facebook page, which has 186 friends. Hayleigh wrote: 'I cannot believe this is happening to me. It started off as a joke but now it's gone viral and I can't take it down.
'Everyone thinks that I really have broken up with my boyfriend of one year, and all the comments are horrible. I had no idea how popular David was online.'
The joke is thought to have been shared at least 17,962 times on Facebook. Hayleigh added: 'I don't know what to do as this has gotten so much attention on social media and everyone thinks it's true.' David told local newspaper The Press and Journal he did not mean to hurt his girlfriend.
He said: 'It was a bit of fun at the time, but now I can see how people are taking it seriously. I never meant any harm by doing that. I'm really sorry.' Hayleigh was also unimpressed when her boyfriend sent screenshots of her message to all his Facebook friends after she had sent him a text saying he was 'boring and ugly'.
She told the Press and Journal: 'I think it is stupid for him to share this because I have never been called those things before, not even in primary school.' But David insisted he was only trying to make Hayleigh laugh when he shared her post. He said: 'We had a bit of banter over the message and I thought it would be funny if I put it on Facebook. I didn't expect that many people to see it - I knew a few friends but I didn't realize how popular David is online.'
David, who has been together with Hayleigh for 12 months, added: 'I still love her and nothing has changed between us. It was all just a bit of fun on April Fools' Day. We have had our differences before and we have split up but I will always love her'. Hayleigh said: 'When David told me what he had done my face went red. He never meant any harm by it but it is not right to send private messages out publicly.'
