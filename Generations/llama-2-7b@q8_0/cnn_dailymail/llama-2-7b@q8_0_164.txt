The campaign is a sickening attempt to link the activities of young students to those of the animal rights movement by offering them money on the basis of their beliefs and experiences.
The poster states: "Earn £100 - tell us how you are treated by Cambridge University. Are your views heard? Are your needs met?" It then offers to pay students up to £20 for each survey they fill in, with a further £75 paid if they meet certain criteria.
The animal rights groups claim the university has failed to provide them with "a fair and equal platform". The campaign is being carried out by a group of animal liberation activists including People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) and Viva!
Animal rights campaigners have launched a poster campaign on the streets of Cambridge.
The posters, which offer students cash in exchange for information on their treatment by the university, were first spotted last weekend. The activists claim they want to show that young people do not feel heard and are not getting their needs met. They are offering £20 per survey and £75 for a fuller report.
A Cambridge University student, who did not wish to be named, said: "It's quite sickening to see it on the streets. I just don't understand how they can offer people money in exchange for personal information."
An activist involved in the campaign called Simon told The Times that the survey would include questions such as whether students felt safe and heard at Cambridge University. He said: "It's not a big deal, we are offering students £100 to spend an hour filling in questionnaires. It's quite a lot of money."
The campaign has been condemned by the University. A spokeswoman said: "We were disturbed and appalled to hear about this. We can not imagine what the university could do that would warrant such a poster campaign. We take very seriously our responsibility to make students feel welcome, safe and happy at Cambridge."
