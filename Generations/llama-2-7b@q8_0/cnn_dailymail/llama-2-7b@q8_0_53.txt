­injuries to the head after he was struck by his friend ­Alexander Miller while they were playing outside their house in Brampton, Ontario, on 20 December. The victim's parents have said they will never get over the loss of their son and have vowed that they will never let their child out of their sight again after a series of violent attacks left him dead.
The accused boy, who cannot be named, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the incident. He made his first court appearance on Wednesday (23 December) via video link from CASY youth detention centre in Brampton.
In a statement released by his parents on Facebook on 24 December, they said: "We are devastated at the loss of our little angel... We will never get over this and we have vowed to not let Lee out of our sight again." They also added that their son was known for being 'kind-hearted' and had a 'gentle spirit'.
The statement read: "Lee was loved by everyone. He was kind-hearted, he was gentle, he would never hurt anyone. Our hearts are broken forever as we try to deal with this tragedy."
Father of the accused child, who is said to be in a state of shock following the incident, said: "We're trying to understand what happened and why it happened, but right now, I just don't know. I just hope that my son is okay; he's getting help – we're all getting help. It's going to take time."
According to reports, the accused child went home claiming that a 'big guy' had struck 6-year-old with a rock and threatened him not to tell anyone or else he would die. The family of the victim said their son was playing in the backyard when the incident took place at around noon on Sunday.
Police have refused to comment on what happened after the child went home but have confirmed that they are investigating an assault on a child as a result of a complaint by one of Lee's relatives. Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
