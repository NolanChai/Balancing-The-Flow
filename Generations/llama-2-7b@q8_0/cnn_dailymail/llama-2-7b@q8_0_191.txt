 has ever seen, is now causing problems for local residents who are being forced to cut through the waste on their daily commute.
Officers from Suffolk Police’s Neighbourhood team were called out after locals complained that a large pile of industrial waste was blocking their access road in Southwold. The area is notorious for fly-tipping and officers are now investigating what they describe as an “ongoing problem”.
The rubbish includes tyres, construction materials, wooden pallets, bricks, metal bars and other household items dumped on the verges of the road in several mounds. The piles have forced some people to walk through the waste to get to their cars.
A large area of the pavement has been blocked off with signs warning against access.
Local police officers are now attempting to identify those responsible for fly-tipping and are asking anyone who may be able to provide any information to call PCSO Andy Burch on 101 quoting reference CF014887.
