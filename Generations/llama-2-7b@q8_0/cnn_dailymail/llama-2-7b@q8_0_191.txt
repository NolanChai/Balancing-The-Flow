Today is Tuesday, January 14th, 2011 and we are broadcasting from the CNN Center here in Atlanta, Georgia. We start with a look at a major wildfire burning in Arizona which has destroyed hundreds of homes. Plus, we have an update on political unrest in Tunisia.
Those stories and more, coming up next right here in the CNN Student News.
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz reporting. Today, we start with a look at one of the largest wildfires in U.S. history. So far it has burned through more than 80-thousand acres near Tucson, Arizona and destroyed hundreds of homes.
CNN's Casey Wian reports on what's called the Sawtooth Fire.
CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wildfires in the U.S. Southwest are a fact of life during this time of year and sometimes they get out of hand. In Arizona, at least 400 homes have been destroyed by what's known as the Sawtooth Fire. It has burned through more than 80-thousand acres in the past few days, forcing thousands from their homes.
This is video that was posted on YouTube of a family in Tucson fleeing the fire on Sunday. The city's fire chief says he hopes the situation improves soon but for now more evacuations are likely.
REVIEW THE MAPS:
BRAZIL: President Dilma Rousseff's approval rating has gone up in recent months and she wants to use that support to pass her legislative agenda. But what does a presidential veto mean, especially when it comes to one of the most controversial issues facing Brazil?
DAVID GALLOWAY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Dilma Rousseff has just cast her vote in Congress. She's a member of the Workers Party, the party that won power in last October's election. It's trying to pass its agenda through Congress by passing legislation through an extraordinary procedure called "enabling laws."
The law will allow the government to privatize some state-owned companies. Rousseff says that it's needed to encourage private investment, but there is a lot of resistance in Brazil, even from her own party. For example, this week the presidential candidate for next year's election said she doesn't support any change to Brazil's mixed economy.
In the past few days, Rousseff has also vetoed four other laws passed by Congress. They would have allowed civil unions and prohibited police from using torture. Rousseff says she vetoed those bills because of constitutional concerns over federal power, which are often a source of disagreements in Brazilian politics.
In fact, this is not the first time a president has vetoed an enabling law. President Fernando Collor did so three times. And when he was impeached for corruption charges in 1992 it sparked riots by his supporters and it's thought that contributed to the end of his presidency.

NEVADA: With all those caucuses on February 4th, Nevada is getting a lot more attention these days than usual. It has a long tradition with the Republican Party, but this year it has attracted Democrats and Independents as well because of a controversial law that makes voting easier for some.
DAVID MILLER, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: For years Nevada's been known as a state with the most Democratic voters per capita in the country. But in this year's presidential race it may be better described as a swing state. And that's because of an election law change that makes it easier for more people to participate.
MILLER (voice-over): On January 19th, Nevadans who don't have the right to vote in other states will be allowed to participate in this year's Democratic and Republican caucuses and primaries. The move is expected to increase turnout by as much as five percent or more, says one political expert.
ERIC PARKS, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS: The problem that we have in our electoral system right now is not people who are going to the polls and voting; it's the people who aren't. And so this would give them an opportunity to exercise their voice.
MILLER (voice-over): Those who don't want to participate can opt out of voting in both parties or just one party, but that may be hard for some, says a political expert from UNR.
MICHAEL MCQUARE, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO: You're going to have people who are registered with one party or another party and then they will be presented the opportunity of voting in both parties. That's where you'll probably see more people opting out because they feel like if I vote Republican here, it may hurt me at my primary on Tuesday.
MILLER (voice-over): But there are also other reasons for not participating. Some who are registered to vote in another state say they don't have enough time to deal with the paperwork to switch their registration status and become Nevada voters.
"There are a lot of people that we know want to get involved, but it takes work," says one Nevada activist, "and you have to do something for somebody else."
MILLER (on camera): You're looking at pictures here from the 2008 caucus. And what I think is interesting about this is that, in fact, the people who are voting here were registered Republicans or Independents or members of neither party and they were voting for Democrats because there was a lot of disillusionment with the Republican Party in 2008 -- David Miller, CNN, Reno, Nevada.
ANNOUNCER: In Tunisia, protestors are still occupying a central square despite their victory over long-time dictator Ben Ali. Today, they're preparing for another big rally on Wednesday as they call for a government that represents all the people of Tunisia.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy says he will not interfere in the situation there and is supporting a transition to democracy. We get more information now from CNN's Phil Gast.
PHIL GAST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Protests have been ongoing for weeks here in Tunisia as demonstrators demanded the ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali who fled to Saudi Arabia last Friday after more than two decades in power. The country's military has announced it will not take sides, but said it supports a peaceful transition.
The protesters have taken over this main square and are calling for a government that represents all of Tunisia -- Phil Gast, CNN, Tunis.
ANNOUNCER: In Libya, anti-government protests have been met with violent crackdowns by security forces. But demonstrators say they're not backing down in the face of possible attacks by the government. And it seems to be paying off in Tripoli as the demonstrations there continue for a fourth day.
Protestors say that they are prepared to die if necessary, but they believe that their cause is just and that change will come one way or another -- Isha Sesay reporting.
ISHA SESAY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The government has been trying hard to keep the lid on these protests, which have taken place in this city for four days now and across Libya as well.
But despite the efforts of security forces who fired live ammunition at demonstrators on Monday, those demonstrations have not stopped. I'm joined now by a member of one group that has been active here today, Mohamed Dahshan (ph) -- he is an IT technician and a human rights activist in Libya.
Mr. Dashen (ph), thank you so much for joining us on CNN International today. What do you think of what's going on?
MOHAMED DAHSHAN, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Well, I think that people have taken to the street now in a way that they didn't before and the government is facing this problem where it has to either kill all of them or give up. And I don't think that the security forces can kill all of these people who are willing to die for their rights.
SESAY: How does the situation compare to
