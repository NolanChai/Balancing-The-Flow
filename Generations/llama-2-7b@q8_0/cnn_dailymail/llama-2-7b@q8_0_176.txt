With his team's season on the line, Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton made a bold decision to start sophomore Devon Bookert in place of freshman Xavier Rathan-Mayes during this afternoon's matchup against Michigan State.

According to ESPN.com, Baylor coach Scott Drew has informed his team that it will be suspended for one game during next week's NCAA Tournament and will have its scholarship limit reduced by two players due to an academic fraud scandal involving athletes on the football team.
