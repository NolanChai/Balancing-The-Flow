 comes to a close we look back on some of our most popular race previews and reviews from this year.
Tiger Roll became the first horse to win all three of Ireland's Grade One races when he beat Djakadam by a length in the Drinmore Novice Chase at Fairyhouse last month, while Sizing Australia was successful in both the Irish Gold Cup and National Hunt Challenge Cup.
The highlight for us though came with our analysis of the Tingle Creek at Sandown on November 29th, when we tipped the odds-on favourite Sprinter Sacre to take a fall at the final fence in what proved an extremely tricky race. In fact, it was the only time Sprinter Sacre has fallen over fences throughout his career.
We also had success with our analysis of the 32Red Celebration Chase at Ascot on November 16th and we tipped a 9/2 winner in the form of Riverside Theatre, who beat Al Ferof into second place. This was the first time he's been beaten for almost two years.
The New One picked up his fourth straight win in Cheltenham's International Hurdle on February 15th and our analysis paid off when we tipped the horse to win at odds of 7/2, with Nicky Henderson's charge brushing aside the opposition by a length.
We also had success when it came to picking out the winners of races involving horses trained by the legendary Paul Nicholls, who picked up a hat-trick in the Champion Hurdle, RSA Chase and World Hurdle on March 14th. We tipped My Tent Or Yours to win at odds of 3/1 but he fell at the last fence and we backed Big Buck's at odds of 6/4 to win in the World Hurdle, a race that he has won on four consecutive occasions.
Hurricane Fly was again successful in Cheltenham's Champion Hurdle for a record fourth time when beating My Tent Or Yours by just two and a quarter lengths on March 13th and our analysis of the race paid off, with the Irish superstar winning at odds of 4/6.
However, our best result came when tipping Hurricane Fly to win in Cheltenham's Champion Hurdle Trial, when we backed him to beat second favourite The New One and he won by four lengths. We recommended the horse at odds of 5/4.
Dunguib was also successful for us when winning in Ireland’s Champion Chase on December 21st at odds of 7/2, while we had success with our analysis of the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham's November Meeting on November 9th and recommended Al Ferof to win.
We also backed Quevega to make it six wins in a row in Ireland’s Champion Hurdle on February 12th, but she finished second behind My Tent Or Yours by just under two lengths. The odds of the horse winning were 4/5.
Our analysis was also correct when predicting that Sizing Europe would win in Cheltenham's Queen Mother Champion Chase on March 13th, as we backed the horse to beat Sprinter Sacre at odds of 2/1. We had success with our analysis of the Punchestown Gold Cup on April 28th when backing The New One to win at odds of just under 9/4 and he finished second behind Dunguib who won at odds of 10/1.
Sizing Europe was successful in Ireland’s Champion Hurdle Trial, beating Our Conor by a length, and we backed him at odds of 3/1 to win.
We also had success with our analysis of the BetVictor Handicap Chase on February 2nd and recommended Ptit Zig to win after he fell when second favourite in last year's race. We tipped him to be successful again but this time he finished third.
