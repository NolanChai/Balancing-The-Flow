 forceful than any impact likely when landing on the runway and so could only have happened whilst taxiing for take off or parking.
Incredibly, there were no injuries sustained from either aircraft. A video uploaded to YouTube by local news channel UzMetronom shows the moment of impact between the plane (a Tupolev Tu-134) and bus which was driving along the runway at an airport in the city of Tashkent, Central Asia.
The crash occurred yesterday morning when the Tupolev took off on its way to Dushanbe, capital of neighbouring Tajikistan. The aircraft had been travelling slowly as it made its way down the tarmac to taxi towards its departure gate at a rate of about 10 kilometres (6 miles) per hour.
At that moment, a bus which was being used for maintenance and cleaning the airportâ€™s apron area suddenly appeared in front of the plane. The impact between the two vehicles was so forceful that it broke the windscreen of both aircraft and resulted in extensive damage to the passenger jet.
