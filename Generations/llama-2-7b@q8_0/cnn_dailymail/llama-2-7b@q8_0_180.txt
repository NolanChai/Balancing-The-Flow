Uruguayan lawmakers have approved a same-sex marriage measure, leaving just one more key step — the president’s signature — before such couples can wed in the South American country.
A marriage equality bill that won passage Wednesday would permit civil unions for gay couples, though not religious marriages. It still needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed into law by President Jose Mujica before it becomes official.
“We’re a step away from equality,” said Uruguayan Senator Elena Aranda, one of the bill’s co-authors. “It’s not about marriage itself but civil unions.”
The proposal was backed by 52 of 47 votes in the Lower House and 19-6 in the Senate on Tuesday.
“We were already halfway there, now it’s complete,” said Juan Carlos Martini, president of a Uruguayan association that advocates for gay rights. “Now we’re just waiting to sign the bill.”
Aranda said that though she has doubts about whether Mujica will sign the bill into law, her optimism was high given his stance on the issue so far. She added that if the measure were rejected by the Senate, a referendum could still take place next year.
“He’s a president who doesn’t like to lose battles,” she said in reference to Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter and leader of Uruguay’s Tupamaro movement, which ruled from 1967 until 1972. “I don’t think he’ll veto this bill.”
Mujica has said he supports civil unions but is against marriage between gay couples — something that has irked activists in Uruguay.
The president also has called for a national debate on the issue, while acknowledging his own personal opposition to same-sex marriage. He was raised Catholic and has six children from two marriages, with one of his sons recently saying he’s gay but not coming out publicly yet.
“I think it’s good that the president is thinking about what he wants,” said Martini, adding that he hoped Mujica would sign the bill into law if it is approved by the Senate on Thursday and Friday. “This way there won’t be any delays.”
The lower house passed an equal marriage bill last year but Mujica vetoed it.
“There will never, ever, in my life be a marriage between two men or two women,” he said at the time. “But civil unions are another matter … I’m going to have to think about this.”
