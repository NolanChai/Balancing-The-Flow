2016 and hosted his own chat show on Channel 4, was clearly terrified as he squirmed around in an effort to catch the unwanted guest in a jar.
Limmy later posted the spider-infested video to Instagram with a caption which read: "This is what I woke up to this morning."
In the clip Limmy can be heard shouting, “I got a big f***in’ spider in my mouth”, as he attempts to catch it. However, when that fails and he has no choice but to let the creature out onto his face, he begins screaming. At one point Limmy even tells the spider: "You're getting me nervous."
He can also be heard asking: "How do you get rid of this?" before telling himself not to look away from it or else he will never catch the insect.
But his fears were put at ease when a friend arrives and manages to capture the spider in a glass jar for him.
The post attracted more than 250,000 views and Limmy's followers quickly flooded the comments section with their horror.
