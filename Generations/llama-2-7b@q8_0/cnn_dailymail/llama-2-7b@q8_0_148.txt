 Polo Club applied for trade mark protection for the club’s iconic emblem, which is displayed on all match programmes and features in the logo at their clubhouse. However, an appeal court ruled that fashion firm Vilebrequin had been using its version – known as a “Ladybird” logo – since 1974, making it too similar to the club’s to be trademarked.
In January last year The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club launched with Prince Charles and his sons among the founding members, and has since seen its membership numbers grow from about 150 people at launch to around 3,000 today. The club’s website boasts a “highly regarded” team of 42 qualified umpires as well as an international polo school – which teaches children aged from six years old upwards how to ride and play the sport.
In legal proceedings that have been ongoing for several years, the Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd applied to register the club’s emblem with a trademark application on March 15th 2017. However, its application was blocked by Vilebrequin UK, who said it had already registered their version of the logo – known as “Ladybird” - in 1974 and has been using it since to promote their own products. The French fashion firm are famous for making swimwear and accessories but have also designed a range of clothing with luxury British brand Burberry and launched their first capsule collection last year with tennis star Novak Djokovic.
Vilebrequin said the application from The Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd was “absolutely not in compliance” with its own registered logo because it features a lion in front of a shield – something which has also been used by other clubs and organisations overseas, including teams in Argentina. In court papers filed at the High Court last year, Vilebrequin said they have never claimed to be the first company to use such an emblem but that they do own rights to their version of it.
The fashion firm argued that since their version was registered earlier than The Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd’s application and is still currently being used by them for commercial gain, then the trade mark should not be awarded to another company who has also used a similar emblem in recent times. However, Judge Mr Justice Nugee ruled last month that he did not agree with Vilebrequin UK's claims as it had been registered after the Berkshire club and therefore could not be protected. The court documents filed by The Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd state that their application was originally denied by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) on March 27th last year but then appealed against following a number of “errors” made during its assessment process by an IPO employee called Mr Shaun Kelly.
Mr Justice Nugee ruled in favour of The Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd’s appeal, stating that there were clear errors made in the IPO’s decision to deny their application and saying that it had failed "to consider any relevant matters". He also agreed with Vilebrequin UK's argument that there was no evidence as to why such similarities existed between two logos which are not usually used for commercial purposes.
The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd has been in touch with the IPO about its case and said they had received "a favourable decision" from Mr Justice Nugee's ruling but that they were still awaiting formal confirmation from them before they could move forward with their plans to launch a range of accessories featuring their own branded logo.
In other news, the Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club has also been working hard to raise funds for charity in recent months and was recently featured on an episode of BBC's 'The One Show'. The club’s president Prince Charles said he wanted to help promote his sport as it is “one of the most important things that young people can do”. He added: "Polo is something I have been doing for years and years but only recently have I really started playing again".
With over 350 horses, ponies and riders attending this week's event in Windsor Park (2nd October), the club hopes to continue its success as a leading polo team around the world. The Royal County Of Berkshire Polo Club Ltd’s CEO Jonny Mapp said: "It has been an incredible journey and we are so proud of everything that's happened since 2016 - especially with our recent wins at the Royal Windsor Polo Cup."
