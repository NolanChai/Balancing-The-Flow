President Bush met earlier with leaders from Germany and Japan, two of the five permanent members of the council, to try to gain support for his call to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons in North Korea, Iran and Syria.
"The United States has worked tirelessly to achieve an agenda focused on peace and prosperity," he said at a news conference with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder following the session, "and now we're working very hard to ensure that this resolution moves forward."
Asked what his expectations are for the Security Council meeting Friday, Bush answered, "We want the council to do its job and work together. That means everybody agrees with a resolution, we don't have some countries who are reluctant to speak out against Iran and North Korea.
"There's no question but that there is a need for all of us to express our concerns about Iran and North Korea," Bush said in remarks at the end of Thursday's session. "These two nations represent a threat to world peace, and this Security Council must respond appropriately."
In addition to Bush, Schroeder and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, council members invited were French President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The session was called by the United States to try to rally international support for its position that Iran is moving toward becoming a nuclear power and has not taken sufficient steps to curb its enrichment of uranium, which can be used to fuel reactors or create nuclear weapons.
In his remarks to reporters Thursday, Bush said the council was united in seeking "to convince both North Korea and Iran that they need to forsake their pursuit of nuclear weapons." He said he hoped a resolution would come from the session Friday.
The White House has been trying to win support among other members of the Security Council for tougher sanctions on Tehran. Last week, the United States tried unsuccessfully to get a council resolution condemning Iran passed. (Full story)
In his meeting with Bush and Schroeder earlier Thursday, Koizumi said he supported the United States' call to take action against North Korea, adding that "this is not just a problem for the countries in this room," referring to the Security Council members. He added that Japan would contribute $100 million toward the World Food Programme's efforts in North Korea, according to news reports from Tokyo.
The United States has been trying to isolate Iran and North Korea after both nations announced they were withdrawing from international treaties aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. (Full story)
"Iran has broken its promises under the nonproliferation treaty by announcing a program to build nuclear power plants," Bush said in his statement Thursday. "Iran is also actively seeking uranium enrichment technology, which is used to make weapons-grade material."
