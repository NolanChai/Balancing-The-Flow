fuls of drugs for the camera, flashing a toothy grin as he boasts about the money he is making.
Yet this is no celebrity; nor are these images a work of artistic expression. It's just another day in the life of the American teenager.
Such pictures have become an accepted part of the internet's visual vernacular, especially on sites like Facebook and Twitter where people use photos to share details about their lives with family and friends.
But while most posts are relatively innocuous - showing a cake in the oven or a new dog - some contain explicit images which could potentially damage the youngsters involved.
It's not illegal, but it can leave them vulnerable.
Last year, an 18-year old man from Hertfordshire was jailed after being convicted of possessing indecent images of children aged under 13, which he had downloaded from Facebook.
A year earlier, a woman from Birmingham received two years' probation for uploading a photo of her four-month-old son in an adult sexual act to Twitter. Both cases were brought after the images were reported by other users.
Experts are concerned that sites such as Twitter and Facebook could become a gateway to harder drugs, weapons and gang membership for young people who are curious about the criminal world but reluctant to get involved.
They say it is crucial parents understand how their children's digital lives can be damaging in more ways than they may realise.
Some are also concerned that as social networks grow in popularity, there could soon be an abundance of youngsters with a criminal record who might have otherwise led normal lives.
As a result, experts are advising parents to take every opportunity they can to explain the dangers of social networking sites to their children.
But not everyone is convinced that it's the parents who need educating; they say teenagers should be aware of what they share online and with whom.
Many social media users upload photos of themselves at parties, wearing alcohol or holding drugs - things that may seem harmless when shared between friends but can have a more sinister undertone when shared publicly.
And then there are the images that parents just don't want to see; such as their children in compromising sexual positions.
There are countless stories of youngsters being bullied online or falling prey to paedophiles after revealing too much information about themselves, their families or where they live.
The internet has given them access to a global audience and that can be both exciting and potentially dangerous.
Sites such as Facebook and Twitter have become so popular they now have a user base of more than 500 million people around the world.
Twitter's website allows users to post tweets - which are limited to 140 characters, or around six words - on their profile page for all their followers to see.
There is no way to filter who can view your profile unless you decide not to share it with anyone at all and keep everything private; a decision that will prevent people from 'following' your updates.
Facebook works in much the same way, but there are several options which allow you to control how publicly visible you want to be.
By default, all new users have their profile visible to everyone who has an account - even those who aren't connected with them - and can also see all photos uploaded by their friends unless they choose not to.
Many users prefer this because it allows them to connect more quickly with people they already know; however others find the idea of strangers viewing their profile, pictures or information unacceptable.
While Facebook offers a way of hiding your profile from strangers, there is no such option on Twitter where your updates are by default visible to everyone.
So how do you keep your children's profiles safe? There are several simple steps parents can take to protect their kids online and one of the best ways is simply to have an open conversation about it with them.
They should know that although there are rules in place, as long as a site is accessible via the internet it cannot be censored by any one country or region.
Because Facebook and Twitter are global companies, they will be subject to laws in whatever country they operate from and, if you live outside America, for example, your children's profile page may still be visible to anyone who tries to access their account from the UK - even though it is not available for viewing to someone located in France.
That's why it's so important for parents to regularly monitor what they do online and how they are using their profiles on sites such as Facebook or Twitter.
You should be aware of the people they are connected with, what types of content they upload and if any posts could potentially cause them harm.
If you decide your child is not mature enough yet for a profile on these sites then it may be better to wait until they reach at least 13 before allowing them access.
Most social media services require users to register as over-13s and they can also use privacy controls to control what people see.
If your child is already using these sites, you should make sure that they are set to the most private settings possible so they only share information with people whom they know personally.
Young people shouldn't just think about who will be able to see their profile page; they also need to consider what images they upload and where they upload them.
Facebook has strict guidelines that dictate what types of pictures can or cannot be posted on the site but, as we have seen with Twitter, there is no such control when it comes to images uploaded directly from a mobile phone.
It's possible to prevent someone from seeing certain content on Facebook by blocking them if they try to view something you don't want them to see; however this won't work on sites like Twitter as the content will be publicly available for anyone to access.
The other thing young people need to understand is that there are a lot of unscrupulous people online and no matter how many privacy controls they use, it doesn't guarantee their safety.
Just because you don't want your son or daughter talking to someone, it doesn't mean they won't want to. That's why it is also crucial for parents to discuss with them the risks of speaking to people online and what they should do if things get out of hand.
Parents might also want to think about installing monitoring software on their child's computer or phone, although this can sometimes be a sensitive issue that will depend on your relationship as well as your child's age.
The NSPCC has teamed up with Facebook and the UK Safer Internet Centre to produce guidelines for young people using social media sites safely.
These include setting privacy settings so only friends or approved followers can see what you share online, not accepting friend requests from people you don't know in person; and avoiding posting information about your school such as where it is located.
It also recommends that children use a nickname instead of their real names when they are online, so if the wrong person finds out who they are they will be unable to track them down using search engines.
