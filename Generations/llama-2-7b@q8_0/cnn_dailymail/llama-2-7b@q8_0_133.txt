isticly_steph, is anything but simple, with over 180,000 followers on Instagram and a burgeoning career as an influencer and creator of viral content on the social media platform.
Tattoos are one way that Hendry expresses himself - and he has more than enough ink to back up his bold personality. With over 50 tattoos covering almost every square centimetre of skin, it is hard to pinpoint what makes this particular look so unique. It’s a blend of tribal and traditional styles, and some might even say that there are elements of new school in the mix too - but ultimately you can't quite put your finger on what exactly it is that gives Hendry’s tattoos such an unmistakable character.
We’re not sure if he has a favourite tattoo, but the one that stands out to us is his “Love conquers all” tattoo on his arm, which was inked by legendary London-based artist Nick Scott (who also tattooed Hendry’s “Through strength comes greatness” piece on his back).
In an interview with Inked Magazine, Hendry reveals that he first got into body art when he was a teenager. He said: "I've always been inked since I was 17 - but I'm going to change it all over again soon! That way I don’t have to explain why there are no tattoos on my chest!"
He also shared the story behind his “Through strength comes greatness” piece by artist Nick Scott, explaining: "Nick Scott is one of my favourite artists and he was so humble when we met. The only request I made to him was that if anything ever happened to me then this tattoo should be a reminder for my kids."
While Hendry’s impressive collection is certainly something to behold, the star has revealed that he isn't finished getting inked yet! In his words: "I still have some more coming up - but it will be a while before they are complete. I'm waiting on my back piece which should happen in April 2019."
In an interview with ModBargains, Hendry was asked what the biggest mistake he’s made during his career as an influencer and creator of viral content is, to which he responded: "The only mistake I've made is being myself. If you love what you do, then do it for the right reasons. Don't worry about other people's opinions or whether they think you look good."
Hendry’s body art has been featured on Tattoofilter and Inked Magazine, among many other sites around the world. It is a testament to the fact that even if you don't have any tattoos yet, there are plenty of ways for someone like Steph Hendry to inspire you - whether it’s through his work as an influencer or just by being himself!
