led or seriously injured on the stretch of road between Chelmsford and Basildon which is one of the worst accident blackspots in Britain.
They have made an urgent plea to Essex County Council for the speed limit to be cut from 60mph to 40mph. The family’s petition has attracted more than 2,300 signatures and is being discussed by the council next week as part of its consultation on new road safety plans.
“It feels like we’re living in a car park,” said Lisa Pinnock, who added that she could not understand why it had taken so long to take action over safety concerns on the A127. “We’ve been talking about this for 18 months and it is still nothing but promises. We don’t want people injured or worse.”
The Pinnocks are calling for a speed camera to be placed outside their home in Station Road, Wickford, and a traffic-calming system to slow the speed of vehicles coming off the A127. “I can stand out my front door and see cars flying past at 60mph,” said Pinnock. “It is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously hurt or killed.”
Essex police, which has recorded ten crashes in the last year where people have been seriously injured, says that reducing speed limits along the stretch of road would be a good idea as it is a blackspot for accidents. But it says that installing traffic calming measures or cameras at the Pinnocks’ property could be counter productive if they deter motorists from driving safely around junctions and cause an increase in collisions elsewhere along the road, which has more than its share of speeding drivers.
In a survey earlier this month, The Guardian found that 69% of people believed that Britain was becoming too dangerous for children to play out on the streets or go to school unsupervised.
The number of youngsters killed or seriously injured in traffic accidents has almost doubled since 1970 and now stands at more than 3,000 a year. In addition, there are about two million road traffic accidents involving children every year and about seven out of ten of them occur on local roads.
More than half the deaths involved youngsters being hit by cars and the majority are caused by careless drivers, but collisions between pedestrians or cyclists and motor vehicles account for about 8% of the total number killed or injured in traffic accidents involving children every year. About four out of ten fatalities are caused when a car hits an unlit cyclist on a road at night or a pedestrian who has wandered onto a main road without checking for approaching motor vehicles.
“There is a serious problem with the number and type of collisions involving children in this country,” said Stephen Lane, managing director of Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT), which campaigns to reduce accidents affecting youngsters. “As well as fatalities there are thousands more being seriously injured or requiring hospital treatment for their injuries.”
The charity says the number and type of road traffic collisions involving children have changed in recent years because more youngsters now cycle and walk instead of travelling by car, but it adds that “we’re still not seeing the reduction in child casualties we want to see”.
More than 130 local authorities, including Basildon Council, are considering introducing 20mph speed limits on residential roads, according to CAPT. However, there is opposition from some councils and police forces, which say that a blanket approach would not be suitable for all areas because of the different types of roads involved.
Lane said: “There are still many more casualties than we would like and too many deaths and serious injuries as well. The good news is that there have been improvements in some parts of the country over recent years, but it’s clear to us from our research that more needs to be done.”
