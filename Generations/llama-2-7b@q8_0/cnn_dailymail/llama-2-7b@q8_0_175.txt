ish sisters-to-be insist their story is anything but unique…
Niamh Geaney, right, and her future sister Karen Branigan
A couple of weeks ago Niamh went to a club for women’s football training with her boyfriend, Aaron.
He was chatting to his mate James, who mentioned that his sister was in the Irish squad.
Niamh thought: “What Irish team?” and then realised he meant Ireland as in the country…
“I said: ‘Oh no way.’ And he went: ‘Yeah!’ I thought it would be a few years down the line, but she is actually playing at the moment.”
Within minutes of meeting Karen, who plays for Irish women’s international team, Niamh knew she was looking at her future sister. They are both from the small village of Kilnamanagh, Co Offaly, and were sitting side-by-side on a bench when they first discovered their uncanny resemblance.
“It is so weird,” says Karen who plays for Liverpool in England. “I didn’t even know what to say at first.”
Niamh agrees: “She was like: ‘Is that me?’ I said: ‘Yeah! We are twins!’”
The pair discovered they were cousins, not sisters, after chatting for hours and comparing childhood pictures. But this did nothing to lessen the shock of their uncanny resemblance.
Niamh is a full-back on the Ireland Under 19 team while Karen plays centre half. Both girls have blonde hair but different-coloured eyes; Niamh’s are blue and her sister’s green.
Karen says she never noticed how much they looked alike until Aaron told her to have a look at the pictures of his sister. The pair went home together, checked out family trees on the internet and compared childhood photographs before making their discovery. They are now going for DNA tests to confirm that they really are related.
Niamh says: “Karen is 29 and I am 26 but we could be twins. She was born two minutes after me in a different hospital, though.”
It’s thought the girls share at least four great-grandparents, who were all from Kilnamanagh. Niamh says she is so used to her mother saying: “That’s your father,” when she talks about other family members that it came as a shock when she was told that the person she resembled most in her life was not actually related.
Karen, who has been playing for Liverpool since 2010, is more reserved than Niamh but both are fun-loving and friendly. They now text each other every day.
“She doesn’t seem to mind that I have stolen her story,” laughs Karen. “I am sure she will get over it.”
Niamh adds: “It is amazing, really. People keep telling me how lucky I am and how much they love the story but I don’t know why. It just happened.”
And, like so many other famous twin stories that have been told down through the ages, this one will most likely be repeated over and again.
Karen says: “I think we could open up a new industry in twinning.”
Niamh agrees: “We’re not going to make any money from it but I guess we can sell our story.”
