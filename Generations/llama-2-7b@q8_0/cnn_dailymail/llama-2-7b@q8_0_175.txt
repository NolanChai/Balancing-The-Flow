 U.S. city -- home of South by Southwest music festival and film conference -- has been approved by FIA World Motor Sport Council. It is expected that the first F1 race will take place in 2012.
The 3.4-mile, $250 million track has been designed by German Hermann Tilke and will be situated on the outskirts of Austin -- about an hour from Houston. The circuit is part of a larger plan to transform the area into a sports and entertainment complex that would also include hotels and office space.
The F1 announcement comes just two years after Austin was chosen as the home for the U.S. Grand Prix, which had been held in Indianapolis since 2000. That race was canceled at short notice because of financial problems caused by Bernie Ecclestone's desire to change the track layout.
Tilke told CNN Sport that he was "very happy" about Austin's selection and described it as "a very strong project, a very nice track with many possibilities."
The German has built or redesigned more than 20 circuits across Europe and Asia over his career but said: "This is the first time in North America. It's quite an adventure for me, because I know how much people like American cars -- so it will be very special to create a circuit."
Austin's selection ends the U.S.' 10-year wait since Formula One returned from Brazil.
