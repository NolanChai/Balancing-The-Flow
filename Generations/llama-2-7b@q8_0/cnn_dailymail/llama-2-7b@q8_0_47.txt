ala organised by his niece, Mariela Castro Espin, on Saturday night, where she unveiled 10 new works of art created from blood collected from Cuban citizens. The show - which includes a work of Castro's own hand and was designed to encourage tolerance - is called 'Via Crucis: Blood, Tears and Pain'. "The exhibit has an educational purpose," Mariela Castro Espin said in the invitation. "It seeks to generate discussion and reflection on how the Cuban people are suffering." The works were created by local artists using blood taken from doctors treating Aids patients, as well as from sick children, victims of domestic violence and former prisoners, according to AFP. They also include a painting made with Castro's own blood donated earlier this year, which he signed. The Cuban leader was last photographed in public when he attended the funeral of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in March 2013. He has not been seen at all since his brother Raul took over the presidency a few months later. A statement on Sunday confirmed Castro's attendance, but it did not include any photos and there was no explanation for why he had turned up. Aged 87, Castro is in poor health and spends most of his time at his holiday home in Cuba's eastern Sierra Maestra mountains or working from the presidential palace in Havana, according to AFP.
