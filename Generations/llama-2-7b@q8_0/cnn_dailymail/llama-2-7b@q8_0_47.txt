​over his future at the club.
The Daily Telegraph claims that Juventus have made enquiries over a potential move for him, although they will face stiff competition from Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp looks to strengthen his midfield options this summer. It is suggested that Oscar could be available on a cut-price deal, but there are doubts about whether he would want to leave the Premier League at this stage of his career.
Arsenal have been linked with a move for Valencia defender Shkodran Mustafi, according to The Sun. They face competition from Inter Milan and Bayern Munich for the Germany international's services. It is suggested that he could be available for around £20m.
Mustafi is reportedly unhappy in Spain after having been made to train alone by Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo. However, Arsenal will need to act quickly if they want to get a deal done as their rivals have also shown an interest in the player.
Juventus are eyeing up a summer swoop for Manchester United full-back Matteo Darmian, according to The Sun. The 27-year-old is out of favour at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho and could be on his way out this summer.
Darmian has previously been linked with Napoli but it appears that Juventus are the latest club to express an interest in him. He would represent a good addition for them as they look to bolster their options at full-back. However, there is still time for clubs to make their move and United may need to consider keeping hold of him after all.
Arsenal and Everton target Dani Alves has been offered a new contract by Paris Saint-Germain, according to The Mirror. It was thought that the right-back would leave PSG this summer but he has now been handed fresh terms until 2018 with the option of an extra year at the end of the deal.
Alves has played down rumours linking him with a return to Barcelona, however there could still be interest in him from England if he decides against staying in France. Arsenal and Everton have both been credited with an interest in him this summer and Alves is now expected to remain at PSG for the time being.
Arsene Wenger has reportedly put Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista up for sale as he looks to raise funds for new signings, according to The Mirror. The French manager is eager to strengthen his backline this summer and could look to cash in on one of their current options in order to do so.
Gabriel has struggled to hold down a regular place in the Arsenal team since joining them from Villarreal last summer but he is still considered a top-class defender by many in the game. Wenger could be tempted to cash in on him for that very reason if he feels his side would benefit from a fresh face at centre-back this season.
