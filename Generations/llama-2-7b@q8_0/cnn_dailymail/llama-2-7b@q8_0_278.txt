Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are billed as two great rivals of modern day football but if former Brazil striker Ronaldo has his way, they could one day be in the same team.
The 2002 World Cup winner spoke at a ceremony to launch an online training app for Barcelona's latest starlet Ansu Fati on Saturday and said that he would love to see Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on the same side of the pitch one day.
"I hope someday I get to play alongside my biggest rivals, Lionel Messi and Cristiano," Ronaldo told fans at Barcelona's Camp Nou Stadium.
"My dream is that you see me playing with Messi and Cristiano in one team."
Fati has already been dubbed the next Ronaldo by many but he now faces a race to be fit for the second half of the season after suffering an injury against Valencia on Saturday, which could rule him out until April.
"I want you all to know that I love Barcelona very much," Fati told fans at the event in Catalonia's capital before taking photos with the youngster and his father, who also spoke about the teenager's meteoric rise since joining from Portuguese club Porto.
Fati's debut came on Oct 30 against Real Betis and he has since scored five goals for Barcelona including a brace in last weekend's 2-1 win at Valencia that secured Ernesto Valverde's side fourth spot in La Liga.
The 17-year-old will not turn 18 until Jan 14, but already has three caps for Spain's under-19 team and he is one of the rising stars on a team which also features players such as Sergi Roberto, Lionel Messi, Frenkie de Jong and Luis Suarez.
The Barcelona Academy product was also given an honorary membership to the Spanish Olympic Committee, with IOC President Thomas Bach among those in attendance at Saturday's event.
