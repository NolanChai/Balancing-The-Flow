The Uganda People's Defense Force, or UPDF, and the Congolese army's ninth brigade carried out the abuses between October 25 and November 13, 2012, near Beni, a city located in North Kivu province in eastern DRC.
The two forces are part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in DRC, or MONUSCO.
"Instead of protecting civilians from armed groups, Congolese and Ugandan troops raped women and girls, killed civilians, and looted homes," said Joe Amon, HRW's director for health and human rights. "The peacekeepers should have stopped the attacks but instead they took part in some of them."
HRW said that while MONUSCO soldiers did respond to initial reports of an attack on October 25 by the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group active in the eastern Congo, the soldiers failed to intervene when the ADF returned and attacked civilians.
The report also highlighted allegations by witnesses that MONUSCO troops shot indiscriminately at fleeing residents during attacks on three other days. The UPDF "may have killed scores of civilians" with a helicopter gunship, HRW said.
HRW's report said it spoke to 60 witnesses and collected medical records from two health facilities that treated victims. It also interviewed residents in DRC who fled to Rwanda after the attacks.
