 from France after the 14 year old was killed in an off piste accident at Val d'Isere.
"The parents are very devastated, and we have taken steps to help them return to their home in Australia as soon as possible," said Pierre-Yves Michau, the state prosecutor responsible for handling the case. "The body was repatriated on Thursday by ambulance."
In his first interview with news media since Carwyn's death, Mr Scott-Howell told News Limited his family were still struggling to come to terms with their son's death in a freak accident while off piste skiing at Val d'Isere.
"We were there for 10 days and we were skiing every day," Mr Scott-Howell said. "Carwyn was skiing just behind me on a gentle slope. I heard him yelling 'I can't stop, Dad', but before I could reach him he slammed into a rock face.
"I ran to the spot where he went down and found him still alive. He was conscious for five minutes but he had a broken neck and couldn't move."
Carwyn died from his injuries in hospital three days after the accident, on January 9, with his parents by his side.
A French investigation into the incident has been completed, Mr Michau said. "This is an accident due to the combination of extreme skiing, off piste and bad luck," he said.
