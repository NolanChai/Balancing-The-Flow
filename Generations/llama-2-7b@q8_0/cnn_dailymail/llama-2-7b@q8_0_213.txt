 piece of video footage, shot by a Dallas police officer as he raced to the scene of Kennedy's murder on November 22, 1963: A film that some say proves the official story about the assassination isn't true; one that has been hidden from public view since it was shown in court back then.
A legal battle now underway could finally resolve this mystery and clear the way for release of this long-suppressed footage.
The controversial film comes to light as a lawsuit by Judyth Vary Baker, author of "Me & Lee: How I Came To Know, Love And Lose Lee Harvey Oswald," moves through U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. In her suit, she claims that the footage was obtained illegally from an attorney who obtained it from a Dallas detective and that this attorney, William T. Martin, has refused to turn over the film as part of discovery in Baker's lawsuit against him.
The lawsuit was brought by Baker, whose 2008 book claimed Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy but was being manipulated by the CIA.
Officially, the footage is known only to have been obtained from a Dallas detective by Martin and then sent on to film archivist Robert Groden, who obtained the footage after learning of it through Martin. This information came to light during testimony in an unrelated lawsuit in Texas last year, where Groden was testifying about his research into the JFK case as part of a legal challenge to the official story that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy alone.
Martin did not return phone calls seeking comment for this article.
Asked about the footage by CNN in 2009, Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said his office had received an inquiry about it from "somebody outside Texas" but that he knew nothing about it and couldn't confirm or deny its existence.
Watkins said he was aware of the suit brought by Baker against Martin and had been approached by both sides, though he did not know how they learned of him. He said he couldn't discuss it further because of attorney-client privilege, since he had been hired to provide legal services for the City of Dallas at that time and might be called upon later in the case.
Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez didn't respond directly when asked if she was familiar with the footage, saying only that "as sheriff I can assure you my office will continue to work diligently to unravel any conspiracy theories and protect our citizens."
Baker said in a written statement that she had never heard about the film before seeing it at an airport newsstand shortly after Kennedy's murder. It was published as part of a 1964 photo essay on the assassination, "Who Shot JFK?," by William T. Martin, a Los Angeles attorney who has been in private practice since then and is not to be confused with William Gurvitch, also an attorney, whose name appears elsewhere on the book.
The film was taken by Officer James Leavelle of the Dallas Police Department, assigned to drive Kennedy's body back to Washington for burial, along with a colleague, Officer Marrion Baker. It shows the officers driving in their patrol car with the president's body draped over the front seats and shows them arriving at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas after being flagged down by a police dispatcher and turning onto Elm Street -- the last street seen before Kennedy was shot dead from behind, according to an official story that Baker disputes.
The film shows Leavelle's patrol car pulling away from the hospital with the president's body still draped on the front seat. According to Baker, this footage was never publicly released by Dallas authorities and has only been seen in court testimony where it was shown by Baker during her 1981 perjury trial -- a trial that resulted in her conviction for lying about being a CIA agent while living with Oswald in New Orleans.
Baker was acquitted in an appeal of the conviction, which also cleared her name on charges she had tried to kill her ex-husband after their divorce by putting poison in his food and drink.
In 2008, Baker's book claimed that Oswald acted alone but that he was being manipulated by the CIA. In a telephone interview with CNN from her home in New Orleans, she said the film supports this claim, showing that Kennedy had been shot from behind as the motorcade moved slowly down Elm Street.
She said the film shows Oswald standing on an overpass with two other men watching the presidential motorcade -- something she said has never been shown publicly before now and that the FBI denied doing for years after the assassination. Baker claims these men were CIA agents who had arranged to meet up with Lee Harvey Oswald, whom they had trained at a secret CIA facility in New Orleans where he was being prepared as a spy.
Baker said she has been told by experts that the film is genuine but declines to name them for fear of reprisal.
She said she obtained the book from Martin and showed it to the Warren Commission investigating Kennedy's assassination, which concluded Oswald acted alone in killing the president. Baker says it was not entered into evidence at her 1981 trial or during the trial of Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman found guilty of conspiring with Oswald and others in the murder of Kennedy. She says she also has documents that show her name wasn't entered into police records until after her death; her mother died shortly after giving birth to Judyth and the child was given to her parents by adoption.
Baker said her ex-husband, Kenneth Rufo, who died in 2009, told her she had been recruited as a CIA agent when she was living with Oswald but she says he never named anyone or described the agency's alleged plan to set up Oswald to kill Kennedy. She said Rufo and others have also insisted that she is not the "Mary" referred to in notes written by a Dallas detective about his investigation into the JFK assassination and published in the Warren Commission Report as part of an FBI interview with Dallas Detective Paul Bentley on December 2, 1963.
The note says: "Mary, Dallas, Tex., stated that she has known Lee Harvey Oswald for about one year. She states that he had been in her company on several occasions and that he had told her of his dissatisfaction with the U.S. He also told her that if he were ever called upon to do something, it would be a difficult task because he was not a 'killer.' "
Baker said she had known Oswald but never lived with him and knew nothing about Bentley's note until she saw it in the Warren Commission Report. Baker says it is evidence of her status as a CIA agent who had been sent to New Orleans to live with Oswald, whom she says was recruited by the agency and trained as a spy.
Baker said that she was told about the film by Martin after he showed up in court where she was testifying during her 1981 trial for perjury, which resulted from charges of lying to police investigators about whether she had tried to kill her ex-husband with poison after their divorce.
She says that Martin told her the attorney had obtained it by chance after he received a call from Dallas detective Jim Leavelle. Baker said her ex-husband, Rufo, was present during this courtroom conversation between herself and Martin and described Leavelle as "very devious" and the footage he showed them as "the most convincing evidence I've ever seen."
Baker said that when she left Dallas after testifying in her trial for perjury, she was given a tape of an interview with Leavelle by a journalist who had been working on the JFK case. Baker says she sent it to the FBI but that they never responded and eventually it disappeared from the journalist's possession.
"The fact is this film has been suppressed since 1963," Baker told CNN. "It was not put in evidence at my perjury trial or the Clay Shaw trial."
Baker said she tried to get her book published but that publishers were afraid of possible government retaliation and refused to publish it, though it did receive favorable reviews after a short-lived limited release in 2008.
"I think you can be sure they're not going to release the film," said Baker. "It would undermine the entire official story."
Douglas Weldon, the author of "Facts Are Facts: The JFK Assassination & The Media Cover-up That Rocked The World," published in 2008 by Skyhorse Publishing, said he was surprised to learn recently about Baker's legal action. He says her suit may have been launched as part of an attempt by some conspiracy theorists to show that Oswald had been set up and could not possibly have acted alone in killing Kennedy.
Weldon, whose book claims that authorities covered up evidence supporting the theory of a government conspiracy behind
