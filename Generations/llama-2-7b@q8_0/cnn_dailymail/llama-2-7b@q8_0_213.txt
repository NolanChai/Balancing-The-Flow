 Junction Correctional Centre, Massachusetts, where he was sentenced to fourteen years for murder and weapons offences earlier this month. He is currently held in a protective housing unit (PHU) which provides 23 hour lockdown, with three hours of recreation each day. The PHU has been described as the 'worst of the worst' units where prisoners are isolated from other inmates and even their own lawyers for months at a time. Hernandez is expected to serve out his sentence in the unit which is designed to protect those who may be under threat within jail. In an attempt to escape attention, prison officials have covered Hernandez's face on their books and removed all reference to him from public documents. He is described as 'not eligible for any programs', meaning he will not participate in any of the educational courses or workshops available to other prisoners. Inmates are also barred from leaving the unit for meals, medical appointments, family visits and any other reason unless accompanied by an officer. Hernandez is considered a danger both within jail and outside as he is currently being sued for wrongful death in several different cases. He has also been accused of sexual assault in at least three more cases, one of which was dropped because the alleged victim refused to testify against him. The former New England Patriots tight end has consistently denied any involvement in the violent crimes he is being sued for and his lawyers say they are confident he will be exonerated. Hernandez was sentenced to life without parole after being convicted of first degree murder for shooting dead friend Odin Lloyd in 2013, after a night out together in Boston. The victim's body was found less than a mile from where Hernandez lived and he has been accused of orchestrating the attack with his associates, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are serving sentences for accessory to murder after Lloyd's death. Prosecutors said Hernandez shot him because he feared being exposed as gay by Lloyd.
