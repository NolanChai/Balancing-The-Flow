BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona will have Lionel Messi in their squad for Wednesday's Copa del Rey last 16 second leg at Alaves but Ernesto Valverde said it was unlikely the Argentine would start the tie.
Messi, who has a calf muscle problem, did not travel with his team mates to Spain on Monday after Barca's weekend win over Sevilla and is set for a place among the substitutes at Mendizorrotza stadium.
