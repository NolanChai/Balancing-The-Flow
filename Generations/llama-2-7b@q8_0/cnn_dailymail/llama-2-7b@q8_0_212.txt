 Eccles has been left permanently disfigured and his family is now calling for the man behind the attack to be identified. He says he was set upon by an acquaintance who had previously helped him out financially. The 35-year-old, from Salford , Greater Manchester, had his skull pushed in and suffered life threatening brain damage after being punched by Mark Owen last Christmas Day.
Officers have now launched a public appeal to identify the man who was seen at the time of the attack. Eccles told the BBC that he had been attacked by someone known as 'Big Boy', but said it wasn't his friend, despite their similarities in appearance and height. "I wouldn't say I was friends with him," he said.
"He helped me out financially a couple of times when I couldn't pay my bills. He said that he had nowhere to live and asked for somewhere to stay." Eccles said Owen, who he believes is in his 40s, came over to the house on Christmas Day where he had been drinking with friends.
"He started chatting to me," he said. "He kept asking if I wanted something to eat and then he said: 'Let's go for a walk.' We walked to another nearby pub and that was the last thing I remember." Eccles spent several days in hospital but has since been released after undergoing extensive surgery on his face and skull.
Police have now appealed for information from anyone who saw Owen walking around with Eccles. He is described as a white man, aged between 40-50 years old, 6ft tall, of stocky build with dark hair which was short and spiked on the top. At the time he had a round glasses frames and was wearing a black and red hooded jacket.
Det Insp Mick Jackson said: "We know that this is a difficult case for John's family to deal with but I would appeal directly to his former friend who he knows as Big Boy, or 'Big John', if he is watching, to come forward." Eccles' brother Peter, 32, said the pair had known each other from when they were children and grew up together in Salford.
"He's a nice guy," he added. "I don't know what happened on Christmas Day but it is not his character to do something like this."
