, gummy bear, marshmallow and coconut ball - will be available at two outlets in Bradford.
The company is also trialling a halal-only ice cream counter after Muslims complained about non-halal products being stocked.
Halal counters have been introduced at some other stores across the country, including Birmingham, Manchester and London.
The decision to launch halal pick and mix was announced by Morrisons in Bradford on Tuesday morning when the store was visited by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell as part of his tour of Yorkshire to talk about how Labour plans to boost the economy.
Mr McDonnell said: "Morrisons' decision is a welcome one and I congratulate them for doing this in Bradford."
Morrisons says it has stocked halal products for years but decided to take things further after listening to customers who wanted more choice.
The company was approached by the Muslim Council of Britain, which said: "This will be a great initiative for Muslim shoppers and we hope other supermarkets follow suit."
