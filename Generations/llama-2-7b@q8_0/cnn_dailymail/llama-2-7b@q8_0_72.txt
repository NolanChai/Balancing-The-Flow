The chaos that ensued at the Century 16 theater in Aurora on July 20 was the scene of a dozen shootings and hundreds of injuries sustained in a bloody rampage during a midnight showing of Batman.
Witnesses, some with gunshot wounds to their arms or legs, told police that suspect James Holmes had fired at least five weapons. The suspect was armed with four handguns and an assault-type rifle, according to court documents.
One officer described a scene of "people lying on the ground ... people sitting on the floor with blood all over them."
He also recalled a pungent odor of chemicals in the air.
"I saw that there were victims laying on the floor, bleeding," Sgt. Gerald Jansen told Aurora District Court Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr., who is presiding over Holmes' preliminary hearing. "There was a lot going on."
Holmes, 25, is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 70 in the deadliest mass shooting in Colorado history. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Samour, who is presiding over the hearing without a jury, called it a "trial within a trial" and asked whether witness testimony was relevant for deciding if there's enough evidence against Holmes.
Defense attorneys have said they intend to show that law enforcement officers violated his constitutional rights during the arrest after the attack. They say that information should be excluded from the hearing because it is prejudicial and may confuse the jury at a later trial. Prosecutors disagree.
Officer John Neville, one of two to confront Holmes as he left the theater in an armored vehicle, testified Wednesday that when his patrol car first rolled up on the scene, police saw people running out of the building with their hands held over wounds.
"They were telling us not to come inside," Neville said. "There was a lot going on."
Witnesses told him that there had been a shooting and an explosion. "I looked through the window and I could see people in theater 9 lying on the ground and bleeding, yelling for help," he testified.
Inside the theater, other officers were helping wounded patrons to the emergency room while others escorted victims to safety outside.
Neville said there was no way to know what happened inside the auditorium. Holmes' apartment was rented out by his landlord and police had never been in it before, he testified. There were no signs of forced entry and no obvious indication that anything bad had happened, he added.
A few hours later, as officers went to take Holmes into custody, he tried to throw them off the scent by setting his apartment on fire and tossing grenades in all directions. "We could hear explosions coming from inside," Neville testified.
When police finally got Holmes under control, Neville said, they found him crouched behind a couch wearing a gas mask and ballistic gear. He was also carrying two assault rifles. Police confiscated the weapons.
