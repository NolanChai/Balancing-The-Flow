 no plans to let him forget what he did.
The Made In Chelsea star is said to be ready to hit back at the 26-year-old former model by releasing a sex tape of them in an attempt to keep Matthews' new love interest from her clutches.
A source told The Sun: 'Lucy was absolutely devastated when she found out what had happened and she thinks Stephanie is the worst type of person. She's just the type of girl who would try something like that, so Lucy wants to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
She's going to release a tape they made while they were together and has been very confident in telling friends about her intentions.'
Lucy Watson and Spencer Matthews broke up after he was unfaithful
Spencer is yet to comment on the rumours that his relationship with Stephanie is over. A source said: 'He’s furious at Lucy releasing a sex tape of them both.
'It's totally wrong and Spencer wants nothing to do with it. But he thinks it will really p** off Stephanie. He doesn’t want her to have anything to do with him ever again.'
The pair were last seen together on the same boat, The Sun reports.
