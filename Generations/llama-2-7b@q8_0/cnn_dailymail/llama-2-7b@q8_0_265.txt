“It’s just a small puddle.”
At 16, he had already shot one man to death and was in court on another count of murder when he killed again, this time in front of two young boys: the driver and passenger in a car that he claimed had stolen his bike.
Now, at 25, he is dead himself — executed by lethal injection for killing those three people in his life’s first blast of violence, one that was followed by even more killings. He was among the youngest on death row at age 20 when he received the injection Tuesday morning, hours after his last-minute appeal to the US Supreme Court failed.
The execution of Rodney Reed, a black man with light brown eyes and an athletic frame who played football in high school, came as a twist ending to one of Texas’ most scrutinized executions in recent years. It was also another example of how difficult it is for those on death row to get their sentence overturned after they’ve been sentenced.
“The case of Rodney Reed has taught us a lot about the state of our justice system today,” said Jason Clark, who teaches law at Southern Methodist University and co-wrote a book with fellow professor Emily Berman called “Ending Lethal Injustice.”
“He was innocent,” Clark told CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday night. “We do not have an adequate system of capital punishment in the United States, and this case illustrates how badly that is true for African-Americans.”
Reed’s death sentence came after a jury found him guilty of beating 19-year-old Stacey Stites to death on May 23, 1996. He was convicted by an all-white jury in Bastrop County in Central Texas and sentenced to die by lethal injection. His lawyer’s appeals and post-trial petitions for a new trial have been rejected over the last two decades as he waited on death row at the Walls Unit of the Huntsville State Penitentiary, one of three locations in Texas where executions are carried out.
In 2015, the state’s highest criminal court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, declined to hear arguments from Reed’s lawyers who wanted to have DNA testing done on the crime scene that could exonerate him or provide new evidence in his favor.
The case drew national attention after supporters of Reed claimed he was innocent and said race played a role in his sentencing.
Stites’ mother, Linda Stites, testified at trial that she believed her daughter had been killed by an intruder who entered the house through a back door, not by her son-in-law who lived with her. Reed told police he had never seen Stites before May 23 and that they did not know each other.
But in the years since his conviction and sentencing to death, prosecutors have faced questions about the evidence against Reed — specifically, a semen sample taken from Stites’ body, which has been widely questioned by supporters who believe he was innocent.

The semen sample was found on Stites’ body after her death and police initially believed that the sperm came from Reed. But later, it was discovered that the DNA of a male relative of Stites matched the profile found in the semen. That relative has not been publicly identified, but his existence cast doubt on whether the semen sample actually belonged to Reed.
That evidence of possible misconduct by police did not stop Gov. Greg Abbott from rejecting all appeals for clemency from Stites’ family and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
“Rodney Reed is guilty,” Abbott said in a statement. “The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has taken extensive action to ensure that all evidence was examined before tonight’s execution.”
The Innocence Project, which supports exoneration and reform of the justice system, also questioned whether Reed could be innocent in its analysis. The group pointed out a lack of evidence linking him to Stites through DNA testing or any other means, as well as his own testimony that he had never been alone with her.
But on the eve of his execution, a judge appointed by Texas’ highest criminal court ruled that further examination of the semen sample would be “extraordinary.”
On Monday, the US Supreme Court declined to issue an injunction in the case, citing Reed’s age when he committed murder (17) and the lack of evidence tying him to Stites.
Texas has executed more people than any other state since capital punishment resumed in the United States after a ban was lifted by the Supreme Court. There are currently 245 men and women on death row in the state, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The youngest person on death row at the moment is a black man named Kwame Rockmore who was sentenced to die for killing an elderly woman when he was 19 years old; his case is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Amid calls from activists and some lawmakers, Texas officials in recent months have approved more than 40 DNA tests that may help free people convicted of crimes. The state’s Department of Justice has said the test results could lead to exonerations or convictions based on “new evidence.”
Last year, a bill was signed into law that allows for people with sentences of life without parole in Texas to be eligible for commutation if they are proven innocent through DNA testing. It is not retroactive — only covering people who were sentenced after October 2017.
