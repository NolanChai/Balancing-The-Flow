Liberian boy, 13, who contracted Ebola during outbreak is finally reunited with his family
A Liberian boy who danced his way through the horrifying ordeal of coming down with killer disease Ebola has made a full recovery after falling ill on May 18. He was discharged from the hospital, where he spent more than a month in quarantine, and is now back at home. The video, which has been watched more than 700,000 times, shows a group of boys dancing in an isolated clinic on the outskirts of Monrovia to keep up their spirits during their recovery. One boy's eyes light up as he dances along with his friends. A child holds up two fingers in praise. He was discharged from the hospital, where he spent more than a month in quarantine after falling ill on May 18 and is now back at home.
Health officials say there are now just 26 confirmed cases left of the disease in Liberia. A total of 300 people have died during an outbreak that has seen more than 4,500 people infected across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. The video, which was shot by a nurse on May 29 at the ELWA clinic in Monrovia, shows the boys dancing to cheer themselves up as they spend a day outside their ward after being tested and given the all clear. In one of the clips posted on Facebook last night, two children can be seen jumping around to music while one boy smiles and points at his friend before bursting into laughter. A second clip shows him dancing with others as he waves his arms in time with the song. The boy's mother, who is not named, said: 'I want to say thank you for all that Liberians are doing to help my son.'
The nurse who shot the video told Metro she was overwhelmed by their recovery. She said: 'It brought tears of joy to me and I cried while watching it. The boys were so happy they danced through the pain. They were happy, smiling and jovial. The first time I saw them on Sunday (June 1) after two weeks in isolation, I could not recognize them. They were happy.' Another Liberian man who survived Ebola said he was 'happy to see' his friends alive despite the devastating outbreak. He said: 'I am very happy that they are alive. I can see from this video how much my boys enjoyed themselves. 'My heart is filled with joy and I will continue praying for Liberia, Africa and the world.'
