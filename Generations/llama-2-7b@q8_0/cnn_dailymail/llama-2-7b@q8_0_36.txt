Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which owns the QQ messaging service with more than half a billion active accounts, also runs QZone, which is a social networking and microblogging site similar to Facebook's platform. QZone has 390 million users in China and allows its users to create profiles that display their interests and other personal information for friends to see.
QZone, whose mainland operations are headquartered in the southern city of Guangzhou, did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney for comment about its plans to add an online shopping function to its platform.
