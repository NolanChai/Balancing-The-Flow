 unlike its natural predators, this little reptile escaped with just a few scratches and bruises. This remarkable picture shows how it fought back against the huge saltwater crocs in what has been dubbed a 'battle of the beasts'.
It's not clear where the extraordinary battle took place but according to experts it could have taken place in Australia or New Guinea, two popular haunts for the predatory creatures. The tiny turtle was trapped between two large saltwater crocodiles, the second largest living reptile after its cousin the Komodo Dragon.
The animal is seen using both front and back legs to propel itself away from the predator's jaws as it desperately tries to escape. The fight happened in a lagoon where there were no other crocodiles or humans around, according to the picture-taker. But experts said that while the turtle was lucky to get out unharmed, they were not surprised at what had happened as saltwater crocodiles are known to attack and eat turtles.
Steve Murphy of Crocwise, an Australian reptile rescue charity, told MailOnline: 'I'm pretty confident the two crocs got their dinner. The little guy is obviously not going to get away unscathed'. He said that saltwater crocodiles are very intelligent animals and know exactly what they are doing when they attack prey.
Salties can swim at speeds of up to 16 miles an hour and have been known to launch their huge bodies out of the water in a bid to grab prey. The picture was taken by wildlife photographer and crocodile expert, David Yarrow, who lives in Australia with his family but originally comes from England.
He said: 'I've seen several pictures and videos that have gone viral on social media of this kind of event before so I thought it was time to see for myself'. He added: 'You can tell just by the look on its face how much adrenalin is flowing through his body, he's terrified'. The turtle eventually managed to escape after a few minutes and Mr Yarrow said that although it had been scared, it was not badly injured.
He added: 'When you see this kind of attack take place the turtles often suffer serious wounds. But I think this little fella got off lightly'. He believes that as it was a lagoon, the water in which it took place would have been shallow enough for the crocodiles to see where their prey was going and be able to move with speed.
Mr Yarrow said: 'You can see from this picture how clear the water is. And when these guys attack they do so very fast'. Saltwater crocodile attacks are rare in Australia but they do occur - and have been recorded as far north as Cairns, Queensland where this battle took place.
