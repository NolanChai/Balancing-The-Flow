 and would have been Chan’s 29th had he not been killed by firing squad in April last year.
This day is now known as #DontForgetThemDay, a call for us to remember that these young men were sons and brothers who made a terrible mistake but also deserved the right to be heard - that their stories should have been told.
In an interview with SBS in April this year Sukumaran's mother, Carla, said her son was not just a drug smuggler he was "a child of God".
"He has done things wrong but he is not a monster," she said. "I don't think we should kill him."
Chan’s family have also pleaded for clemency and asked the Indonesian President to release Chan early on compassionate grounds because he was terminally ill with liver cancer. They also made a last-minute appeal to the Australian government to help secure his freedom.
Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop has maintained Australia cannot intervene in the case as it is now a matter for Indonesian courts. However, she said she did not support the death penalty.
"I understand the sentiments of their families and friends and of course Australians," she told reporters on Wednesday.
However, many members of Australia’s parliament are outraged that the government has been silent in Chan's case and have criticised Bishop for her “wilful blindness” to the issue.
"It is simply unacceptable that Indonesia will now hang Andrew Chan while Julie Bishop remains silent on the matter," Greens MP Adam Bandt told ABC radio. "The Prime Minister should be raising this with his Indonesian counterpart."
Several other politicians have also expressed their anger at Bishop’s silence and pleaded for the government to intervene in Chan's case before he is killed. The majority of Australians agree that the death penalty should not be used, but there has been a sharp increase in calls for Sukumaran and Chan to face justice in Australia rather than Indonesia.
On Wednesday the Australian public were given their first chance to speak about the issue when the ABC's Q&A program invited the families of Sukumaran and Chan, as well as former Bali Nine members Matthew Norman and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, onto the show for a special episode.
The two families were also joined by former attorney-general Robert McClelland who had written an open letter to Bishop calling on her to intervene in Sukumaran and Chan's cases and help them seek clemency from Indonesian courts before their execution.
Nguyen said the government was ignoring Australia’s relationship with its closest neighbour because of a "small vocal minority".
"I think we need to understand that Indonesia is our very important neighbour," he told the ABC's Tony Jones. "If something happens on this side of the world, it's going to affect us and there will be an impact on business and tourism."
McClelland said the issue was too important for the government to ignore.
"I have no doubt that this has been considered by the foreign minister but I think she is being very timid in not making her position crystal clear," he said.
"It's really important we understand what the options are, that if indeed it is a matter of clemency from Indonesia then the Australian government should be seeking to have diplomatic discussions with our most important neighbour."
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi will visit Australia next week for talks and is expected to discuss Chan's case.
