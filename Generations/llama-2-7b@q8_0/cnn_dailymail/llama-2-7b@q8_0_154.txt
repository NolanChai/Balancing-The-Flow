The Bronx Zoo’s male gorillas have been getting all of the attention lately since the birth of two female babies. The zoo is home to the Western Lowland Gorilla troop which has only eight members including three juveniles, one adult male and four adult females. They are all healthy, active members of the group who enjoy a variety of activities at their exhibit that spans across 12,000 square feet.

These include the ability to see them play and interact with one another as well as watch their favorite food, fruit, being fed directly into their mouths through the bars of their enclosure. This allows visitors to get an up-close view of how much care each member puts into eating their meals in addition to getting some interesting insight into the social dynamic that exists within this group of animals.
The gorillas were born to a 16 year old Western Lowland Gorilla who is the only female in her troop at present time and has been successfully breeding offspring over several years now. She had one other baby before she delivered these two newest arrivals just 48 hours apart earlier this month, making them her first triplets.

Bronx Zoo’s Western Lowland Gorilla troop has been home to eight members since last year when a male adult gorilla was added after leaving another facility where he had resided for more than 20 years before that time period concluded. Since then, both of these animals have remained happy and healthy while also growing into their own personalities under careful observation by zoo staff members who are trained experts in understanding how best to care for them on an everyday basis throughout all four seasons here at this facility located within New York City itself – making it one-of-a kind amongst similar establishments nationwide when it comes down to keeping these creatures safe inside our midst!
