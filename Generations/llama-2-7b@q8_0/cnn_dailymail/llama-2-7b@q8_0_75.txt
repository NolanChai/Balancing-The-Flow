The ruling covers 31 antibiotic drugs, including penicillins, cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones, that are used to treat bacterial infections, including sinusitis, pneumonia, and skin infections, the FDA said.
"Tendon injuries can occur spontaneously or during treatment with these drugs and are more likely to occur if a patient is older than 60 years, has been taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), has had kidney failure treated with dialysis, or uses quinolones for a prolonged period of time," the agency said in a statement.
The warning applies to both brand-name antibiotics and generics. The FDA is requiring that drugmakers add this black box warning within three months -- by March 27.
A black box warning is used only for drugs with "a serious or life threatening adverse event, or a condition where the benefit of the drug outweighs the known risk."
"The FDA believes that these warnings are necessary to inform health care professionals and patients about the possible increased risks," the agency said.
Last year, the FDA required new label information for cephalosporin drugs, including Keflex and Cefzil, warning of this potential risk of tendon rupture in adults and children with or without a history of tendon disorders.
Citing data from studies done overseas, the agency said Tuesday that fluoroquinolones may also have "an increased risk for serious tendon disorders when compared to other commonly used antibiotics."
The warning also includes advice to doctors and pharmacists to avoid prescribing or dispensing these drugs in patients who are older than 60 years, who use corticosteroids (such as prednisone), who have had kidney failure treated with dialysis, or who will be taking them for a prolonged period of time.
The FDA also said that the public and health care professionals should report side effects from these drugs to the agency's MedWatch program.
