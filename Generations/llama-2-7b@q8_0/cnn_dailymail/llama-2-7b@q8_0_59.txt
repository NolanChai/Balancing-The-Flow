1/5 favourite for the fight, while the 41 year old has odds of 6/4 to win.
However, Pacquiao has refused to be complacent and will take every step with a view to winning what is likely to be his last ever fight, the Filipino having said he will retire after May 2nd regardless of whether he wins or loses.
"I have to prepare for this fight like it's my last because I don't want to lose," Pacquiao said. "If that happens, then I am going to be out of boxing. Floyd is one of the best fighters in history. He has a perfect record and I respect him."
Mayweather has been accused of running scared for not fighting Pacquiao previously when the 40 year old was considered to be unbeatable. But Mayweather insists that the fight never materialised because he didn't see how it could make money as a PPV. He also said he wanted to retire undefeated and that is why he has never fought in the UK.
"The fight never happened," Mayweather said. "When we met face-to-face, I told him the reason the fight wasn't made was because there was no money involved for me. I told him my business venture was to be undefeated. He was a very nice guy and he apologised."
Pacquiao has been trying hard to get into shape for May 2nd after being inactive last year, fighting just once since his knockout of Ricky Hatton in December 2009. While many boxing experts have criticised Pacquiao for that, the Filipino insists he had no choice but to take time off and recharge his batteries.
"I am happy that it is now here," Pacquiao said. "We have been waiting a long time for this fight to happen. I was hurt last year when the fight didn't go through because we were already in shape, had trained hard, but Floyd still wouldn't make the fight. That made me angry."
Pacquiao is also confident that he will beat Mayweather on May 2nd and become a seven time world champion in eight weight classes. He insists that Mayweather is "scared" of fighting him because, at 41 years old and coming out of retirement for this bout, the American will be afraid to get hurt.
Pacquiao said: "Floyd has never been knocked down or stopped in his career so he does not know how it feels when you are hit like I have done many times. If a 41-year-old man is scared of getting hit and having a cut, then this fight will be an easy victory for me."
Mayweather's only defeat in the ring was against Mexican Saul Alvarez at the hands of a majority decision loss in September last year which has since been overturned by the World Boxing Association to make it a no contest. Mayweather still thinks he won and is confident that if they had another go, he would beat Pacquiao once again.
"I don't see Manny Pacquiao being able to hit me," Mayweather said. "It will be the same result as when I fought him in 2009. He couldn't hit me then and I don't think he can do it now."
