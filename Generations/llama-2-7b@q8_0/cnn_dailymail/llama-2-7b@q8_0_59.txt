17 second video struggling to keep his vehicle from careening off the road and crashing after he loses control of his car as it enters a ramp leading into the North Washington Tunnel in Boston at around 10pm on Sunday.
The startling footage shows Lin swerving across three lanes, narrowly avoiding police cars before crashing into the barrier lining the tunnel and being detained by officers who had been alerted to his erratic driving behaviour.
The incident happened when a state trooper spotted Lin speeding on I-93 northbound in Boston around 10pm Sunday, according to Massachusetts State Police.
The trooper pulled up alongside the car and began pursuing it but soon lost sight of the vehicle as he approached an exit for the North Washington Street Tunnel.

The trooper was able to radio ahead to other officers that a dangerous driver was entering the tunnel and warned them to be careful.
Lin, who lives in Malden, entered the North Washington Street Tunnel ramp just as he was about to lose control of his 2011 Nissan Sentra.
The vehicle veered off its intended path, into three lanes, narrowly avoiding the cruisers.
It then crashed into a concrete barrier lining the tunnel.
Lin was placed under arrest at the scene and charged with operating a motor vehicle to endanger.
He will appear in court later this week.
