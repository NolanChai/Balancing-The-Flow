 was reunited with her sisters, who had been born in the country before fleeing as children when they were caught trying to defect across the border into China. The family were taken on a tour of Pyongyang, the capital, and visited a market where the siblings were given their first taste of local foods, including kimchi – spicy pickled vegetables. But the biggest thrill came when they took photos with leader Kim Jong-un. The images show Dami and her sisters smiling for the camera on a visit to Mansu Hill in Pyongyang where Mr Kim is said to oversee state affairs, including the nation's nuclear programme. On the ground: A family of five South Koreans were allowed into North Korea after escaping across border as children A rare glimpse: Dami I was reunited with her sisters who had been born in the country before fleeing as children when they were caught trying to defect across the border In 1997, at just nine years old, Kim Ji-young and Kim Soo-yeon tried to cross over into China after being separated from their parents, but were captured by North Korean authorities. They were sentenced to three years of hard labour in a camp and made to work on farms during the day and watch propaganda videos at night. But in 2014 they fled the country again with their sisters Dami (then 23) and Kim Yong-sun, who are now all living as free South Koreans in Seoul. The four sisters have kept in touch since then and their journey has been documented on a TV show. During filming, Kim Ji-young, 25, said she would be 'shocked' by life inside the secretive state but hoped they would be given a tour of a farming village. She said: 'I have never seen an apple or pear before in my life. The first time I saw it was when I came here to South Korea.' Despite being separated for over 16 years, Kim Ji-young's voice broke with emotion as she recalled the day her family fled the country and was reunited with her two younger sisters. 'I don't think any words could express how we feel,' she said through tears of joy. The group also travelled to Damsan, a city just across the border in China, where they had been captured by North Korean authorities after fleeing in 1997. On their journey back into Seoul, they were shown off to a crowd who shouted 'Welcome!' and waved flags. The sisters were seen beaming as they passed through immigration at Incheon International Airport where they were met by a team of cameramen waiting for them. Speaking about her time in the country, Dami said: 'When we came to this country, I felt like everything was different from what I had experienced. 'Everything was so beautiful.' She also added that it was 'so sad' seeing her sisters living in North Korea before she left. The family have previously told of their ordeal crossing the border into China and being caught by guards and imprisoned. They were all given the option to return home but their parents could not be traced after they fled the country, according to Kim Yong-sun's testimony at a hearing in Seoul. During filming, she recalled how she was sentenced to hard labour for three years, along with her sisters and her mother, who had been caught by guards in 1997 after trying to flee across the border from North Korea to China.
Sisters' shock as they meet their brother for first time - BBC News
A pair of South Korean sisters have met their brother for the first time after being separated at birth. The young siblings were born in different hospitals and adopted by different families. The girls, now 30 years old, found each other on Facebook three months ago and decided to meet, despite having very little information about their biological parents or family backgrounds. Their mother left the family when they were young and their father died when he was a baby. They had never been told where their real families lived. The sisters' first meeting happened in front of reporters on Tuesday as they watched each other's faces for the first time. "I have seen you several times, but now I feel like I've finally met her," said younger sister Jung Hye-in, 30. Jung Eun-seok, the middle sibling, also said she felt a sense of relief to meet her long-lost sister at last. "It was hard for me to see her teary-eyed because I didn't want her to cry," Eun-seok told reporters after their first meeting in Seoul. "I feel like my parents and my brother are watching over us." They had decided to keep the identity of the birth family hidden from the public, but South Korean media said they were born in a rural area of North Hwanghae province, near the border with China. The two sisters have been staying together for the past three months while Jung Hye-in was looking for her brother. They decided to keep their identities secret until their mother's permission is obtained and their background can be investigated in more detail. South Korea has a "baby box" adoption programme that sees infants left at a government office where they are placed with new families without knowing any details about the birth parents, or vice versa.

BBC Documentary - The Sisters: A Strange Love Story
This is a documentary on how two women found each other after 20 years apart and the bond that developed between them. Two sisters, who were separated as babies and reunited nearly two decades later thanks to Facebook, have made their first public appearance together in Britain. Astrid Goulding and Sarah Hitchings, from Oxfordshire and North Wales respectively, were born minutes apart 19 years ago at the same hospital, but grew up unaware of each other's existence until they met on a dating site. The pair - who have taken separate names to protect their identities as it was agreed neither would be named in newspaper reports without permission from their family - were brought together by their mothers after an emotional search for the babies that both women gave up for adoption, and which they never stopped believing they had. Ms Hitchings, 31, a hairdresser from Wrexham in North Wales, was born prematurely at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on July 25, 1992. Her biological mother was a young woman of Irish descent who did not know she was expecting until she went into labour. The baby had to be delivered by emergency Caesarean section and Ms Hitchings was taken home within two weeks. She has no memory of her birth or her mother, but does recall that the adoption agency told her as a child it would get back in touch with them when she turned 21. Her adoptive parents were married with one other daughter already and decided to raise Ms Hitchings as their own.
