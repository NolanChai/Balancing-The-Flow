 on Tuesday night, features fictional Top Gear boss Clarkson having a “blow-up” with his assistant producer, played by comic Hugh Bonneville.
The scripted spoof comes after Clarkson was suspended from BBC One’s most popular motoring show this week after he hit the junior producer. The presenter admitted in an email to colleagues that he had “losing his temper” with the woman but did not use the word “punch”.
W1A, which features Bonneville as fictional BBC boss Ian Fletcher, has taken the incident and run with it by portraying a foul-mouthed Clarkson’s tirade on a film set. Clarkson, played by comic David Mitchell, is seen shouting at his assistant producer in front of other staff and saying “don’t ever stand between me and my coffee again”.
A BBC spokeswoman said the scenes were filmed before Clarkson had been suspended from Top Gear this week. “The script was written well in advance,” she added. Clarkson has said that he had never heard of the show, which follows a fictional BBC department called W1A (the address of Television Centre) and is made by the makers of The Thick of It.
W1A will be broadcast on Tuesday night on BBC2 at 11pm. A scene from the latest episode was screened during the opening credits for last week’s episode of Top Gear. In it, Clarkson is shown complaining to Bonneville’s character that he is not being treated as a celebrity on set.
Clarkson, who has co-presented Top Gear for 10 years with Richard Hammond and James May, was suspended from the BBC programme this week after allegedly striking his assistant producer over claims that she had used her mobile phone in his presence. Clarkson admitted he had been “losing his temper” but denied using physical force on the woman.
He will remain off air for the show’s upcoming Indian special and a forthcoming Grand Tour show. His suspension has left Clarkson unable to collect this year’s National Television Award, which was due to take place at London’s O2 Arena next Monday, when he is nominated in the best television presenter category.
In a statement issued after being suspended, Clarkson said: “I would like to apologise to everyone I have worked with over many, many years of my career for the hurt, upset and embarrassment I have caused them.” It came as it was revealed that 80,000 people had signed a petition calling on the BBC to reinstate him.
Actor Peter Capaldi, who is set to play Doctor Who in an upcoming series, added his voice to the campaign and said he thought Clarkson was a “lovely man”. It comes as Clarkson’s co-host Hammond told how he had been left “shocked and saddened” after learning of the allegations.
He wrote on Twitter: “I have never witnessed, or even heard about any incident of violence towards anyone in the whole time I’ve worked with Jeremy.
