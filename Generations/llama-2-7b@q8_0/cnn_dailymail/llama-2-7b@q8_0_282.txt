-hosts – Chris Harris and Richard Hammond – laugh when he revealed the downside of losing his job was that he had to stop “saying bad words on air”.
The 57-year-old has always been a controversial figure, but he is rarely seen without some sort of provocation from fans and viewers. He became even more of an internet sensation during his final appearance in the BBC’s motoring show, when he was apparently hit by a car in front of millions of people while filming for Amazon Prime Video.

The incident was later reported to be an accident and not the result of sabotage as some fans believed at the time, although it still caused a stir when it aired. Now he has been sacked from Top Gear following an internal investigation into his controversial column about Meghan Markle published in The Sun newspaper earlier this year.
The article was seen by many to be racist and sexist towards the Duchess of Sussex, who had just given birth at the time, and it led Clarkson to say he would take a break from the BBC to reflect on his actions. However, the presenter has now spoken out about losing his job saying it means he can “say bad words on air”.
The clip was shared by Jeremy on Twitter earlier today as he uploaded a photo of himself sitting in the studio with Chris Harris and Richard Hammond. He said: “It’s official – I’m free from censorship! As of now, you can swear as much as you like on air without being told to change it!”

Several fans expressed their shock that the Top Gear presenter was not censored on air during his time with the BBC. One person commented: “You were never censored!!!” Another said: “What?? We always hear swearing! Don’t believe everything you read.” A third asked: “Is this a joke?”
Clarkson is currently filming The Grand Tour for Amazon Prime Video, which will air its fourth season in the summer. It follows on from his time with Top Gear and was created alongside Richard Hammond and James May when their former show ended.
