911 a report about an abandoned vehicle with no plates at a home in Silver Spring, MD. When the dispatcher told him or her it was a civil matter, the anonymous tipster insisted that she could hear two children inside and they were 'scared.' When the police arrived, they found both children home alone as well as their parents, who were out of town for the weekend, and took them to Child Protective Services.
The 911 call is brief but it's clear that this anonymous caller didn't understand what free range parenting was: "I am calling about a vehicle without plates parked in front of this house...I just want you guys to be aware, I think there are kids in the car and they sound scared."
The dispatcher points out that this is not an emergency: "It's civil. It sounds like [you] got your information from a neighbor...I don't understand why you think it's an emergency if there aren't any children in danger."
This is when the anonymous caller insists, "There are definitely children in that car. I hear them crying...They sound scared," as she lists their ages and asks for officers to go to the house and check on them. She then continues with her rant about how they should be home schooled and not allowed outside by themselves:
"I don't know if you know what free range parenting is, but apparently this woman has no idea...[She] lets these kids run around in front of the house all day." The dispatcher replies that it sounds like there are adults at home and she can check on the children herself: "If that's a concern to you...I would say don't call 911, walk up and knock on the door."
After a short exchange about what is or isn't an emergency, this caller tells dispatch they should come anyway because they are scared. She ends by saying she doesn't want anything bad to happen to the children: "I don't care if it's just a civil matter...But I would feel better if you guys checked on them."
Listen for yourself here and you decide how the caller is handling this call. If you had been that officer, what would you have done? Would you have left and waited for CPS to handle it? Or would you have knocked on the door like the dispatcher asked? What if the children weren't scared? What if they were playing quietly inside waiting for their parents to come home?
The thing is, there was no way of knowing this at the time. This anonymous caller insisted that she could hear children crying and that she had been watching them since 1:00pm. The caller was adamant about how scared they were and it's clear from her tone that she just didn't want anyone to be hurt, especially those kids.
That was why the officer went into the house without any announcement or knocking on the door. When he entered, he found both children at home with a neighbor who had been babysitting them and their parents were out of town for the weekend. The police took the children to CPS where they remained until 4:00pm when their parents arrived home. They said the kids weren't hurt and that this incident will not be followed up on by Child Protective Services, but it won't be forgotten either.
What do you think about this 911 call? Was the anonymous caller right to make a police report over 'free range' parenting? Were those children in danger or just playing at home with their neighbor? How should that dispatcher have handled this call? Should she have left it alone and not called Child Protective Services at all?
The parents of these two kids were out of town for the weekend, so there was a 13 year old babysitting her brother (who is 8). They both live with their mother who has a boyfriend who lives in another part of the house. The mom had been watching the children while she and her boyfriend went to work. Her boyfriend left at around noon and was due back around 7:00pm on Friday night. She left for work about 8:15am on Saturday and didn't get home until around 2:30 that afternoon.
The anonymous caller insisted that she had been watching the children from her house next door since 1:00pm when they arrived in their car. She claimed to have heard them crying and screaming for an hour before calling 911. The officer who arrived said there was no reason to believe that something happened to either of these kids, but he couldn't help thinking what would have happened if the caller had been right about the children being in danger.
