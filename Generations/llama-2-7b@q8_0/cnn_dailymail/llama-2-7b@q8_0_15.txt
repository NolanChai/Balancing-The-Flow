 she is also the creative director of Nineties nostalgia-driven clothing line, the Pretty Polly Group, who recently teamed up with Glamour to bring you some 80s chic on your feet.
The collaboration between Moss and Pretty Polly has resulted in a pair of limited edition high heels that have been made in honour of the classic nude pantyhose worn by the iconic supermodel throughout her career.
Moss explains how she was inspired to design the shoes: 'I've always wanted to do something for Pretty Polly, especially as it's so close to my heart,' said Moss.
'The nude stockings were a big part of my look and I love wearing them with everything - they make me feel feminine. It was only natural that I would want the same effect on my feet.'
Moss has designed two shoe styles, one high heel and one wedge, in the shape of classic nude stockings, which she says 'have been a big part of her look for years'. They're available to buy online here.
