"Did you hear what she said?" Trump communications director Jason Miller wrote in a retweet. "This is how you know she's totally out of touch."
Miller was referring to comments Clinton made at the Clinton Global Initiative event on Wednesday, where she took questions from an audience that included one student who had traveled all the way from Mexico. The teenager asked Clinton if her father's past as a factory owner in Honduras gave him any influence over her politics.
"I remember that my dad took me on his knee and he explained that the only reason why we were in San Francisco was because he had made some bad investments," she replied. "It's really important to me that we don't let anybody try to divide us by saying, 'Oh, it's your fault, you're the reason.' We need to come together."
As with much of Clinton's recent speaking engagements, her comments were quickly turned into a new attack on her opponent. "If you are in the top 1% and losing money due to Trumpâ€™s economic agenda, who do you blame? The truth is that you can always blame somebody else," Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short wrote in a tweet.
The comments from Miller and Short drew immediate criticism for their sexism. "Oh my God! Did he really say 'her personal baggage'?" one Twitter user wrote, while another suggested the tweets were a reflection of how Trump staffers would treat women if they worked on his campaign: "As a woman in politics... I can tell you it's always your fault."
"@realDonaldTrump has no idea what 'personal baggage' means," one user wrote. "It's not just her personal baggage, it's ours as well."
Even Clinton herself chimed in to comment on the tweets, posting a photo of herself with her father and his secretary at the time of the meeting.
The Clintons have long had complicated relationships with each other, particularly around the details of their lives during their marriage. Last week, Hillary Clinton was reportedly angry about a New York Times article detailing Bill's sexual affairs, and she also publicly called out one of her husband's former lovers in the first presidential debate.
