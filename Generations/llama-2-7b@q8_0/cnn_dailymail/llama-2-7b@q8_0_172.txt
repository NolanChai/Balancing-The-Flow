450 Yahoo employees lost their jobs as a result.
Bartz wasn't going soft when she told Scott Thompson, then head of human resources at Yahoo, that he didn't have the guts to fire some people. That's according to internal emails released on Thursday by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who is representing Bartz in her lawsuit against Yahoo.
The emails, which were not addressed directly to Thompson but sent through a third party, offer more insight into the backroom politics of big tech firms. They also show how Bartz's blunt style rubbed some people the wrong way inside Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.
Thompson resigned from his post last September after just 10 months on the job. Bartz had already left by then and was replaced by Marissa Mayer as CEO.
Bartz's lawsuit alleges that she was fired without cause, "without notice or warning" and "in violation of her contract." The suit also alleges that Yahoo did not follow its own personnel policies in removing Bartz from her post, which carried a base salary of $1.2 million.
But in the emails released Thursday, you'd get the impression that Bartz had been on notice to clean things up at Yahoo -- and she didn't like it one bit. She called Thompson's request "ridiculous" when he told her his team would need more time to conduct an investigation into allegations of gender discrimination at Yahoo.
The emails also indicate that Bartz did not always get along with Tim Morse, CFO at the time. In one email chain in 2010, Morse is asked whether he's "too hard" on Bartz and her team -- to which he replies "no."
Bartz said she was "fed up," adding that a new executive would be hired to replace her. She also wrote of wanting to quit in September 2011, but held off for the sake of her employees. In an email written that month, Bartz told her staff: "I'd rather stay and fight because I've promised you we will make this a better place for all."
"And frankly it pisses me off that someone wants to be CEO who isn't willing to do what it takes," she added.
