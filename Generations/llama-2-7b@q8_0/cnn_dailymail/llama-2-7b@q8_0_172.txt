51-years-old, but is said to look more like he’s in his fifties, according to neighbours who spoke to the Indianapolis Star. The Indiana man allegedly told cops that he had sexually assaulted his ex-girlfriend and ate some of her organs after fatally stabbing her on Monday night (25th) at his home in Jeffersonville, about 10 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, authorities said.
Cops say they found the naked corpse of 36-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton inside Oberhansley’s bedroom. Cops say Oberhansley confessed to killing her after he told cops that she had been acting “crazy.” Oberhansley was charged with murder, rape and cannibalism.
It is unclear if a motive has been established in the case but cops believe that Blanton was killed sometime between 10:30 p.m. on Monday night to 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning. The Jeffersonville Police Department and Indiana State Police are both conducting separate investigations into the incident.
