ots put the Blues on top just before the hour-mark.
Four minutes later it was doubled as Chelsea went three up after a well worked move saw Mason Mount pick out Jake Clarke-Salter with a wonderful pass and the England U20 international slotted home from close range, assisted by Colckett.
And the goals kept on coming in the last 10 minutes of regular time as centre back Bjorn Engels struck with an unstoppable drive into the bottom corner before Clarke-Salter tapped in the fourth after a rebound to seal another emphatic win for Chelsea.
It was the perfect start to the final against AFC Ajax in Nyon on 10 May, and Chelsea's seventh semi-final win in eight years.
The Blues had come up against Roma in last year's competition when they were knocked out of the group stage - the Italians winning all three games - but Viveash insisted from day one that his side would not be bullied into defeat and he got his point across to his youngsters as soon as possible.
"I wanted a really good start," said Viveash, who will lead Chelsea in their first ever Youth League final. "We knew what happened last year - we got outplayed and out-passed, so I wanted them to come at us early on and make it clear that this time was going to be different.
"I think the players started the game really well, they had a fantastic attitude from the first minute. We did concede some good chances - you don't have to give a team like Roma any chances, let alone three or four, but we survived that period and then after half-time we took control."
"We've got some very talented young players at this Club so I wouldn't say it was anything unexpected. They just played fantastically well today - they were on the front foot for 90 minutes."
Chelsea will face Ajax in their first ever Youth League final and Viveash believes that the experience of reaching the last two semi-finals, as well as a win this afternoon, can help his youngsters when the big day arrives.
"It's going to be tough, it always is, but they've got some real quality players," he said. "They have pace, power and skill and I think if we get it right then we should give them a really good game."
