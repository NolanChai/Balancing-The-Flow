The younger Pappas, 35, had pleaded guilty on December 21 to one count of conspiracy to commit espionage, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In court Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garr King said he would accept the government's recommendation for probation and community service -- two years of supervision and 40 hours of community service.
The younger Pappas was also ordered to pay $725 in fines, a sum that includes court costs and an administrative fee, according to U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan's office. A co-defendant who pleaded guilty at the same time as the elder Pappas -- Christopher Metsos, a Greek national and a businessman living in Cyprus -- was sentenced earlier this month to six months of house arrest followed by three years of supervised release, according to Ryan's office.
Pappas' father, Harold Pappas, was arrested on March 9, 2005 and charged with selling information about U.S. nuclear weapons systems to Russia in exchange for cash and gifts. At the time he was director of the CIA's Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Center (WINPAC). He pleaded guilty on November 18, 2005, and agreed to cooperate with government investigators in exchange for a recommendation that his sentence be reduced from up to life in prison to between two and nine years.
On January 16, Pappas testified he'd passed U.S. military secrets to Metsos through e-mails over five years and received cash payments as high as $250,000 for the information. The testimony was part of a plea agreement in which prosecutors said they would recommend a reduced sentence if Pappas cooperated with the investigation.
Pappas, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison on March 31, 2007 after he rejected an earlier plea agreement, is one of several CIA officers charged by federal prosecutors with passing secrets to foreign governments and individuals since the September 11 attacks.
Last month, a jury found ex-CIA officer David Stephan Cheney guilty of taking money from foreign sources in exchange for information about U.S. national defense. Cheney, who was convicted on January 28, faces up to five years in prison and a fine of $1 million when he is sentenced March 4.
In June 2007, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling also pleaded guilty in the case, according to Ryan's office. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for his role in passing secrets about the CIA's Iran operation to an undercover officer for New York Times reporter James Risen.
