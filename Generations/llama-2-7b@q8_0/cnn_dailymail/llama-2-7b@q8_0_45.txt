Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in 1952, along with a number of high-profile British politicians - including Winston Churchill’s son Randolph, who was a Tory MP for 30 years.
Their actions were uncovered during a three-year investigation into Russian agents' activities over the last six decades and included bugging phones in the UK, Europe, America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

In one of their most notorious coups, a female spy infiltrated Mr Churchill’s Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street in 1952 to listen to meetings.
The information was passed on to Stalin, who made a special request for the intelligence about Winston and Randolph Churchill. The two men were among those targeted by KGB bugging operations
Soviet spies used a number of ingenious ways to gain access to private homes and public buildings, including using radio transmitters in cake boxes and lampshades, or planting microphones on light switches and doorbell buttons. They also created devices with the capacity to pick up signals from thousands of feet away.
The files were unveiled by the National Archives after a three-year investigation into Soviet espionage that was launched following the death in 2007 of the man who ran Moscow’s spy ring in London, Vladimir Vassilyevich Kuznetsov – known as ‘Samson’.

KGB chiefs ordered agents in Britain not just to spy but also to sabotage the country’s nuclear programmes
One of the KGB’s biggest coups was the infiltration of the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street in London during Winston Churchill’s premiership, which ended in 1955. A file on Harold Wilson is among those released by the National Archives

KGB chiefs ordered agents in Britain not just to spy but also to sabotage the country’s nuclear programmes.
They also set up a ‘counter-revolutionary’ group called The Red Plough – named after Stalin’s secret police, the GPU (later renamed the NKVD) - which planned to assassinate members of Parliament and prominent people in public life, including Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his wife Mary.
A file on Mr Wilson is among those released by the National Archives. It includes details about how he was a target for KGB bugging operations, which included listening to conversations between him and his family at their home in Putney, south-west London.
The KGB also spied on Princess Margaret and her husband Anthony Armstrong Jones during their honeymoon at the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. A file on the couple is among those released by the National Archives
KGB agents bugged the Palace and used ‘spy cakes’ containing microphones to listen into conversations while Princess Margaret was a bridesmaid for her sister Queen Elizabeth II at her 1960 wedding to Lord Snowdon in Buckingham Palace.
One file released by The National Archives, which includes reports on KGB activities during the 1950s and 1960s, says: ‘There are a number of files relating to the Churchill family who have been under close scrutiny since at least the late 1930s.
‘The Russians appear to have had access to the Cabinet Office (and later to 10 Downing Street) between September 1952 and October 1961, while Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister.’
The information on the spying activities of Soviet agents in Britain will be a blow for KGB defectors and their families. They have claimed that many Russians were killed when they tried to defect from communist countries and feared their former lives might still be under threat.
The files, which also include details about how British double-agents were exposed by the Soviet Union, will come as no surprise to intelligence chiefs in Britain and Russia, who have long believed that most defectors are not genuine agents but just ‘dreamers’.
A spokesman for the Russian embassy said: ‘Russian intelligence agencies always worked according to international standards of law enforcement.’ He added: ‘We were also very glad to learn that there was no information about any illegal activities involving British agents in Russia, who have been exposed as a result of their own actions.
‘The KGB never used methods that went beyond the legal framework and ethical rules.’
