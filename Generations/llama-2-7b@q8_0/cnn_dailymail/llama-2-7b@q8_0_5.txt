The young boxer admitted that she gets nervous before fights, adding: "I get nerves, like 'Oh my God'. But once you step in there, and the bell goes off, it's nothing. It's a whole lot of adrenaline rushing through your body".

Her mother Melissa Brim also revealed that she's always worried when Iyanna is sparring with Floyd. She said: "I get nervous, but he's a lot better at it than she is...it's definitely nerve-wracking".
