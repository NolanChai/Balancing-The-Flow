Hodgson's decision to share Sterling's thoughts with reporters before the Estonia match has been criticised by some.
The Liverpool winger started the game at Wembley on Tuesday evening but was substituted midway through the first half after 40 minutes of action, England winning the game 3-0 as Wayne Rooney struck twice and Marcus Rashford scored his second goal in two games for his country.
But Sterling's admission about his tiredness has been criticised by some in the media. The Guardian's Jonathan Liew wrote: "Roy Hodgson and Raheem Sterling were both wrong to give a running commentary on the Liverpool wingerâ€™s state of mind." And he added that the 20-year-old was an example to his peers in how not to handle publicity.
Liew's colleague at The Guardian, Jonathan Wilson also wrote: "Roy Hodgson was right to take Raheem Sterling off for England but wrong to talk about it beforehand." And he added that the manager had a duty to protect his players and the team from public opinion.
England beat Estonia 3-0 at Wembley on Tuesday evening, with Wayne Rooney scoring twice while Marcus Rashford also found the back of the net.

It has been reported that Sterling has been linked with a move away from Anfield this summer after just three years at the club.
