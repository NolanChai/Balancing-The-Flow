The terrorist watchdog has warned that Islamic State is “encouraging” Westerners to carry out attacks against civilians by providing instructional videos online.
In a briefing paper, MI5 said IS was taking advantage of social media and messaging apps such as WhatsApp to radicalise people in the UK. It has warned that the threat posed by “lone actors” who attack without direct terrorist group involvement is higher than at any point since the 7/7 London bombings 10 years ago.
The Home Office said it was considering what further steps could be taken to make Britain safer, including increasing border checks and improving intelligence sharing between countries in Europe.
Alistair Darling, who was home secretary in 2006-09, said the threat of terrorism had been “grossly exaggerated”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I don’t think it’s likely at all that we will see a 7/7 again.”
The warning from MI5 came as police in Germany concluded their investigation into the crash of Germanwings flight 9525, which was flown by Lubitz, who had been diagnosed with depression. They found no evidence he had been influenced by anyone else or had been a member of any terrorist group, and have ruled out mechanical failure.
MI5 said it believed the number of Islamic State supporters in Britain was between 600 to 800 individuals, with an average age of about 27 years old. This included between 100 and 300 who were “groomed” or radicalised overseas before returning home, with a further 400 believed to be vulnerable to radicalisation online.
The watchdog also warned that UK citizens who had joined IS in Syria and Iraq were likely to return as part of its next wave of terror attacks. “As they integrate back into Europe’s communities, their numbers will grow,” the paper said.

The paper, which was obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws and dated February this year, said Islamic State’s propaganda machine was encouraging attacks in the West. It added that while there had been 10 plots since 2010 that were directed or inspired by terrorism overseas, four of these had been thwarted or failed during preparations.
MI5’s director general, Andrew Parker, warned last year that “the number and nature of attacks is changing” as terrorists target soft targets such as shopping areas and transport networks.
The briefing paper said: “Terrorist groups encourage Westerners to commit attacks in their home countries because they believe they are more likely to be successful than those carried out overseas.” It added that IS was particularly keen on recruiting people who were not known to the authorities and were able to travel freely.
The Home Office said: “ISIL [Islamic State] is encouraging supporters in the UK, and around the world, to carry out attacks here. It is an enduring threat, which means we must continue to work hard to combat it at home.”
It said there was a long-term threat from those who had been radicalised while abroad but were returning to the UK as part of the next wave of terror attacks. The government had spent £20m on tackling the issue with measures including training police forces to identify the warning signs and improve intelligence sharing, it added.
The home secretary, Theresa May, has also said she is considering introducing extra security checks for people travelling in Britain to prevent a repeat of the attack at Brussels airport last week by a suicide bomber who had travelled with a fake ID through a security loophole and was able to board an aircraft.
She will raise concerns about terrorism in Europe when she meets her counterparts from across the 28 member states of the EU on Thursday, followed by discussions at a European council summit later that month.
The Home Office said it would also look at what further steps could be taken to improve intelligence sharing between countries in Europe and to reduce “safe havens” for extremists within EU borders.
Meanwhile, Darling said he did not believe the threat of terrorism had been “grossly exaggerated”, despite recent warnings from MI5 that an attack on the scale of 7/7 could happen again at any time.
He told Today: “The problem is we have seen a number of attacks in recent months, many of them successful and others which were prevented. I’m afraid I do not think it is likely at all that we will see another 7/7 attack on the London underground or anything similar to that.”
Asked about his warning from four years ago – when he said a 9/11-style attack was “probable” in Britain over the next two years – he added: “It’s always been clear we needed to take reasonable precautions against terrorism. The police are doing that and I think it should continue. But I do not think the threat is grossly exaggerated.”
Darling said any measures taken by ministers would have to be proportionate, saying: “It’s very important when we consider what steps should be taken to remember how easy it is for terrorists to make bombs and it has been in recent years. We need to make sure that the security services are properly resourced and properly equipped.”
He added that the threat had not disappeared entirely, saying: “The question is whether we will see another attack on this scale – 52 people dying as a result of an attack by Islamic extremists who were using home-made bombs. I don’t think it’s likely at all but it is important to make sure that we do everything we can to keep ourselves safe.”
