It measures exhaled alcohol concentrations in real-time, based on the amount of alcohol molecules in the air blown out by the user during deep breathing. A picture of the results can then be posted directly to Facebook or Twitter from the app. The product is designed for ‘social and responsible drinkers’ who want an easy way to track their BAC levels, according to Breathometer.
