ugely controversial decisions about how Australia should go about winning back their position as No 1 team but he became so embroiled in the row over who is to blame for England's failings that his detractors managed to destroy him in the public eye.
He was a useful player of the ball, one board member said, and the man who had the courage to stand up to Kevin Pietersen but he lacked the steeliness required for such an important job at the top level. The ECB chief executive, Paul Stevens, is now expected to make his own decision about whether or not Downton should remain in charge of England until after next summer's World Cup and he will be helped by a panel made up of board members David Collier and Giles Clarke as well as Peter Moores.
Downton has also had the full backing of Alastair Cook, the England captain, but his fate is in the hands of others now. He was always going to struggle once it became clear that England had become a national embarrassment and, although he could not have done much about Pietersen's departure from the international set-up, he still appeared unable to make a firm decision on whether he would remain captain.
England's dire form in their most recent Test series against New Zealand – they lost 1-0 after drawing the first match – is another factor that may now contribute to his downfall but, while the ECB has been determined not to panic with England so close to a place at next year's World Cup, this situation will have them thinking long and hard about what exactly they can do.
England are still the best-attended team in all forms of cricket but, after the Ashes humiliation, there is now a huge need for someone who can reinvigorate the England side as well as the ECB. Downton's detractors will point to his decision not to appoint Andy Flower, Pietersen's former coach and mentor, as team director despite the fact that he was keen on the idea but there is no doubt that England's performance in New Zealand has been a cause for concern.
Moores has said it would be wrong of him to publicly comment on Downton's position before his meeting with Stevens later this week and, if he does not remain chief executive of ECB, then it is hard to see why Moores should want the job at such an awkward time. However, another member of the panel has suggested that they would be looking for someone who can improve England's performance in all forms of cricket rather than just Test matches and there are those within the game who have said that the most obvious candidate would be Mark Nicholas, the former Surrey chairman and a friend of Stevens.
He is currently head of Channel 5 and has not been involved with England since resigning as chairman of the International Cricket Council in January 2010 but his standing within the game remains strong and it seems that he could now be lined up to take over from Downton, who is in a similar position to Mike Brearley at MCC.
Brearley was pushed out after England's Ashes whitewash against Australia and Nicholas may also have to leave Channel 5 if he takes on such a high-profile role at ECB. However, the man who was one of Downton's closest allies when they both worked at Cricket Australia is no longer part of the sport in his home country.
He left Cricket Australia after becoming embroiled in the saga over Pietersen but there were always those who said that he would not want to go through a similar situation again. That would now be up to him and it could provide England with a new opportunity to turn things around.
