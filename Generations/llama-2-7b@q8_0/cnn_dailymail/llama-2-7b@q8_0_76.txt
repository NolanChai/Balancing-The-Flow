aking action in two cases involving the same issue, the court voted 5-4 to decide that the nation's highest court must hear all death penalty appeals and that federal courts should not take those appeals away from the Supreme Court. Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing Officer Daniel Faulkner on Dec. 9, 1981, after a traffic stop in Philadelphia. He had been freelancing for the city's Black Panther newspaper and had just shot a white police officer who had questioned him about a stolen gun. Abu-Jamal, now 57, has maintained his innocence and argued that he was framed by corrupt officers in Philadelphia's racist Police Department. He said that the trial judge gave him an unfair death sentence. Abu-Jamal is known around the world as a symbol of racial tensions over policing and criminal justice, and has attracted high-profile supporters such as singer/activist Harry Belafonte and actor Danny Glover. He has been in prison for three decades after appeals that have drawn support from many well-known people.
"Mumia Abu Jamal's case has been an international cause celebre for some time," said Robert Zauzmer, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in criminal procedure and death penalty issues. "The Supreme Court is taking it up now, after denying review several times before." The court's conservative majority has been consistently skeptical about allowing federal courts to intervene on capital appeals cases. Abu-Jamal's case was the second such appeal that the Supreme Court accepted Tuesday; a federal appeals court in New Orleans had ordered a new sentencing hearing for two Louisiana death row inmates convicted of killing a police officer who died in 1987. The Supreme Court's order in Abu-Jamal's case came in the form of a brief order stating that the appeals will be taken up by the court but offering no further explanation, according to CNN's review of its docket. In the New Orleans case, the Supreme Court agreed with Justice Department lawyers who had argued against allowing federal courts to intervene on capital cases, saying such intervention would cause too much disruption in criminal justice proceedings. The New Orleans court, however, ruled that the inmates had been sentenced without a unanimous jury verdict and that they were not given enough time to consider their pleas for leniency before receiving death sentences.
The court's decision Tuesday means Abu-Jamal will be allowed to appeal his sentence again in federal court, where his case would get more scrutiny than it would have in the Pennsylvania courts. The Supreme Court may take up both cases together or separately, and is not required to schedule arguments on them before its summer recess, which begins at the end of June. If the court hears both appeals separately, that could mean multiple days of argument this fall. Abu-Jamal's case has long attracted attention because his supporters say it demonstrates the racism and injustice in Philadelphia's police department. They cite that before Abu-Jamal was convicted, he had written articles about police misconduct, and that after his trial, a group of officers were accused of framing him for the crime. Many prominent black activists have supported Abu-Jamal's case, including Cornel West and Jesse Jackson.
But Abu-Jamal is also widely seen as a convicted cop killer who received due process in his state criminal trial. A federal appeals court panel found that Abu-Jamal was given competent representation during the initial phase of his case, but that a new sentencing hearing was necessary because of flaws in jury instructions by the judge at his original trial.
The Supreme Court has been reluctant to review such cases from death row inmates. The justices have rejected requests for new hearings in 14 out of the 15 times it has been asked to intervene since the court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. A few years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that capital punishment cases had to be handled by state and federal courts, a decision that drew sharp dissents from all four conservative justices on the bench at the time. In Abu-Jamal's case, his appeals in both federal district court and the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas were denied before they reached the Supreme Court. His attorneys then asked for a stay of execution from U.S. District Judge William Yohn last year, saying there was evidence that Abu-Jamal's trial had been tainted by prosecutorial misconduct and racism in the Philadelphia Police Department. The state Supreme Court denied his appeals but agreed to hear arguments about whether Abu-Jamal should be allowed a new hearing on appeal.
Abu-Jamal's attorneys have argued that the Pennsylvania judge had given an instruction at the beginning of his case that could have wrongly influenced the jury, saying it may have led them to believe they were deciding whether he was innocent or guilty in general when they found him guilty. But a federal appeals panel rejected their argument, saying that "no reasonable juror" would interpret the judge's instruction as allowing them to convict Abu-Jamal without being unanimous on his guilt. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia has given Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell until May 24, when it will hear arguments from lawyers for the state and Abu-Jamal's attorneys over whether a new sentence hearing should be allowed.
Abu-Jamal's case has received attention in part because of his writing while behind bars; he wrote his first book in prison, "Live From Death Row," in 1995, and then went on to publish two more works of nonfiction that have been widely distributed, including the 2001 book "Jamal: A Black Journalist's Life Inside America's Prison Empire."
