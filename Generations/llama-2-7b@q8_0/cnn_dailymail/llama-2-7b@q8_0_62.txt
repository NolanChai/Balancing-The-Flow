ame, scientists are now convinced that there is some weird and wonderful stuff out there in the universe.
The latest findings come from an international team of researchers who have scoured the skies for planets without suns. They found three rogue planets - planets floating through space without a solar system around them. The planets, which are thought to be cold and dark, are not expected to host life as they cannot support one due to their lack of light.
The results were published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. According to NASA’s Kepler Mission team, there could potentially be hundreds of these so-called rogue planets with masses similar to Jupiter and larger within 100 light-years. And astronomers say that the best place to look for such an alien world is the star Beta Pictoris, a sun-like star located about 65 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of the Southern Pointer.

The three rogue planets found are called MOA-2011-BLG-379Lb, OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb and Beta Pictoris b. While scientists have never seen a rogue planet, they believe there could be many more wandering the skies without a sun to keep them warm.
