70 and has a taste for younger women.
Delpani allegedly used his power as boss of Revlon to sleep with "a long string of secretaries and assistants" who were then forced out of the office, fired or demoted. One woman, an assistant in her early 20s whom Delpani dated after she graduated college, alleges he was "abusive" during their relationship.
Now that's a pretty ugly story to be sure -- but is there room for a little funny? It turns out Revlon fans think so. Some are even tweeting with #RevlonDating, while others have turned the alleged abuse into comedic gold by making jokes about his age and/or penis size.
Someone who doesn't appear to be laughing is Delpani himself -- or at least he was when the Post spoke with him, saying "I am not going to answer those lies." The Post also reports that Revlon issued a statement calling the accusations "false and without merit," adding: "Mr. DelPaini has been fully vindicated by the facts, and we are confident that this matter will be resolved quickly in Mr. DelPaini's favor."
In the meantime, at least one woman appears to have come forward with her own #RevlonDating story:
