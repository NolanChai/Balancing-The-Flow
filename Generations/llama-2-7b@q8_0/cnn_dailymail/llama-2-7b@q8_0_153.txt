 The 67-year old is alleged to have taken nearly €47million from the Libyan regime as kickbacks on lucrative contracts.
But he was given little time to consider his position last night when France's top prosecutor launched an investigation into claims that Sarkozy received millions of dollars in secret payments from Gaddafi for advice on how to buy French weapons and secure multi-million euro deals with France’s biggest companies.
The enquiry was opened as the former president faced a formal complaint after being accused by a whistleblower, Ziad Takieddine - who worked for him in 2007 - of taking 'blood money' from Gaddafi.
Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing and says he was never paid by the dictator’s regime.
The charges against Sarkozy are based on allegations contained in a letter from Mr Takieddine to magistrates, which claims that 'a very large sum of money' was channelled to Sarkozy from Gaddafi for his campaign.
Mr Takieddine worked with French firm Bygmalion, the advertising company used by Sarkozy’s presidential election campaign in 2007. Mr Takieddine also worked as a go-between for the Libyan dictator and the former French president's office between 2005 and 2010, according to reports.
The investigation is likely to take up to two months and will be headed by prosecutor François Molins.
'It will look into all the aspects of these accusations,' Mr Molins said in a statement today. 'Any suspicion of an offence being committed will have to be examined.'
He added that it was 'important to establish exactly how this money was spent'.
The claims, which first emerged during the 2012 presidential campaign, resurfaced last night when Mr Takieddine went public.
'There were many attempts by people close to Muammar Gaddafi to send large amounts of money from Libya to Nicolas Sarkozy and his entourage,' he wrote in the letter.

Sarkozy’s office said the former president had received €50,000 (£43,000) from Mr Takieddine for his 2007 campaign, as well as money to fund an ad in a French magazine.
They added that Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign paid the full market rate of €1million (£865,000) for an advertising contract with Mr Takieddine’s firm.
However, Mr Takieddine said in his letter to magistrates: 'The Libyan leader was prepared to finance Sarkozy's campaign and provide him with large sums of money... I told the candidate that I was authorised to pay a sum of €47 million (£40.5million).'

The allegations are likely to further undermine Sarkozy's position within the ruling UMP party, where his support has been steadily declining. The former president was beaten by conservative rival Francois Fillon in a first round of internal polls for the UMP leadership last year and is now facing another poll on March 24, when he faces a second challenge from Mr Fillon.
Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, has dismissed claims that his client received money from Gaddafi.
He told French TV station BFM: 'I can deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing by my client. I am quite sure that when the investigators have finished their enquiry, they will come to this conclusion too.'
