ury as title contenders Liverpool and Chelsea both won on Sunday, with the latter taking a big step towards the top of the Premier League table by beating Southampton 3-0.
City slipped out of the Champions League places with defeat at Tottenham last weekend, but Pellegrini’s men are still in control of their own destiny as they look to regain top spot from Arsenal, who have a game in hand over Chelsea and Liverpool. City will return to the summit if they win all three remaining games at Crystal Palace, West Ham and Hull, but Pellegrini knows his side face tough opposition away to the Eagles on Tuesday night.
“It was a very important game for us,” he told Sky Sports 1. “I think it will be difficult for us as I see that Crystal Palace have won four out of their last five games, and also at home they are doing well with one defeat. But we can’t relax about this and we must recover the best way to continue in a good way.
“We must always try to play well in every game because every single point is very important now.” City were beaten 2-1 at Selhurst Park last season, with the visitors leading through Pablo Zabaleta’s early goal before Dwight Gayle and Jason Puncheon put Palace back in front.
City had to wait until January for their next win, a 3-0 triumph in Manchester that ended a three-month run of failure away to Palace, who will be without winger Wilfried Zaha on Tuesday night due to suspension after picking up five yellow cards in his last six games.
