A schoolgirl has written a heartfelt letter pleading with her teacher not to let her get married, saying that she’s been told it will be “the best decision of her life”. The 13-year-old girl from India had been selected by her father for an arranged marriage in February next year.
But the teenager wrote a letter to her teacher at a school in Rajasthan pleading with her not to allow the wedding go ahead, as she was “not ready” and still has “dreams”. The girl, who is in Class 9 and wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from her family, wrote: "You know me, but I am also a student here.
"My dad has decided that I will get married next year on February 14. He says it's the best decision for my life. But I can’t accept that." The girl wrote about how she had been “waiting to see my dream come true”.
She added: "But, sir, I am still not ready. I have dreams and ambitions in my life which I want to fulfil with my husband's support. And it is only after this that we can take the decision of having a family." She said she had “fought with” her father about the arranged marriage for two years but he “didn’t listen to me”.
The girl’s mother, who also wished not to be named, told MailOnline: "I have been against my husband's decision from the very beginning. He has fixed a match for our daughter and I don't know about it. My daughter is only 13 years old." She added: "She doesn’t want this marriage because she is not ready yet, but she can’t stop him as he is the head of the family.”
The girl was referred to an NGO which advised her to write a letter to her teacher.

"I am just 13 years old, but I have dreams and ambitions in my life which I want to fulfil with his support and not without him." The letter was addressed to a teacher named “Mr Ved” at Govt Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalay School, Udaipur.
The school’s principal told MailOnline: "We can't allow such things to happen here as we have strong policies against child marriage. We are taking action on this case."
Police in India say they are investigating the case. A police officer said: “We don't know much about this issue at present and it is still being investigated. The girl has written a letter to her teacher pleading with them not to let her get married.”
An NGO in Delhi, which wrote the letter, told MailOnline that there are more than 23 million child brides across India every year. It added: "The girl is still very young and needs time to decide about her future."
MailOnline has contacted the family for a response.
