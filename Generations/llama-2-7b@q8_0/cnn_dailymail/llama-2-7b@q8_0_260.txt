 staff were deceived by the sophisticated criminals who went through 20 high-end timepieces during two thefts at the Oxford Street store in just one month. A jury was told they targeted expensive Rolexes and Cartier watches, some worth £24,000 each. The gang posed as wealthy Muslim women, wore burkas over their faces and entered Selfridges dressed in smart suits. They would then distract shop assistants while others ran into the changing rooms to try on the timepieces before swapping them for low-priced ones and leaving the store without being stopped. The gang is suspected of making 20 thefts from the department store, with one incident costing £1million in lost stock alone. It took place between August 18 and September 14 this year - just weeks after a similar spate at Harvey Nichols, also on Oxford Street. The defendants were identified by CCTV footage showing them entering the store with women and children who may have been their accomplices. Detectives are investigating whether they were being controlled by others not in the country, Scotland Yard said. The investigation was launched after police received a call from Selfridges on August 18 when two Rolex watches worth £24,000 each had gone missing. A further seven Cartier watches were stolen over the course of six visits to the department store between September 6 and September 20. The gang used 'sophisticated' tactics which included wearing burkas to disguise their faces while pretending to be Muslim women, Scotland Yard said. Two members of the gang wore the traditional Islamic headscarf when they entered Selfridges at Oxford Street and one member of staff was even led to believe that they were female customers. In the first incident, on August 18, three men dressed as women and went into the jewellery department, where they stole two Rolex watches worth £24,000 each before being distracted by a member of staff in the changing room and running out without paying. Another two Cartier watches were stolen on August 31 from the same department during an incident which saw eight suspects enter Selfridges together dressed as Muslim women. In another raid, on September 6, four men went to the jewellery store wearing burkas and headscarves, posing as three sisters and one nephew. Two Rolex watches were then stolen from the department after they distracted a member of staff with 'friendly chat'. They were again able to get away with two Cartier watches on September 14. Detectives investigating the case identified several of the gang members after reviewing CCTV footage from Selfridges. Officers then established that similar offences had been committed at Harvey Nichols just weeks before, Scotland Yard said. Three men were arrested by Met Police in connection with the alleged thefts on Tuesday night - one aged 39 and two aged 45. All three are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. The case continues.
