A multi-millionaire property developer’s son is being questioned over the disappearance of a blonde waitress from a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars.
Privately-educated Nick Mellon, 27, was held for questioning after 21-year-old Rachael Skeats went missing in the early hours on Saturday morning following a boozy night out at the Pacha nightclub in Liverpool.
The daughter of a soldier and a civil servant, Mr Mellon is the son of multi-millionaire property developer Richard Mellon, one of Britain’s biggest landowners who has made a fortune from housing development projects. He was detained for questioning at his luxury home in Woolton, Liverpool, on Saturday afternoon following an appeal by police to trace him.
Mr Mellon is said to have been seen leaving Pacha with Miss Skeats after the club closed at 4am and taking her back to a house he was renting nearby, before he left again at around 5am.
Miss Skeat’s flatmate told police they had spoken on the telephone at around 8am and she sounded “normal”. The flatmate said that she had told them she would be home later but had not arrived by lunchtime when Mr Mellon returned to the house.
A Merseyside Police spokesman confirmed last night: “Nick Mellon, 27, of Woolton Lane in Liverpool, was arrested on suspicion of kidnap and has been released while enquiries continue.”
Miss Skeats, who has had jobs as a waitress at celebrity haunts such as Pacha, Chateau Marmont, the Ivy and Karaokebox, is understood to have become friendly with Mr Mellon and several of his friends during her time working in Liverpool.
Mr Mellon, an accountant by training who worked for Deloitte, was briefly arrested by police on Friday after officers found him asleep behind the wheel of a Bentley at 4am near Miss Skeats’s flat in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The arrest was part of a series of high-profile incidents involving Mr Mellon, who is believed to own a house in Cheshire and to be engaged to businesswoman Amanda Rourke, 32, from Liverpool. He is also understood to have been linked romantically with the daughter of a prominent local judge.
Mr Mellon’s sister Samantha, 29, is said to own a flat in London worth £600,000 and the couple are said to spend much time on social occasions around Knightsbridge. Mr Rourke also has connections with the area after opening her first coffee shop there two years ago.
Mr Mellon was a pupil at King’s School Macclesfield in Cheshire, where fees cost £10,000 per year. The son of Richard and Sarah Mellon, he is said to have been taught by teachers from Eton and Harrow. He has previously been questioned over allegations of assaulting a man while on a night out but was cleared at Liverpool Crown Court in April last year.
Miss Skeats’s disappearance prompted police to reissue an appeal for information about her whereabouts, which included details that she had left her home carrying two suitcases. Merseyside Police said: “She is white and 5ft 6ins tall with a slim build. She has short blonde hair.”
Police inquiries are being made to establish whether Miss Skeats is still alive and it is not known if she had any links with Mr Mellon’s family or friends, although the pair were seen drinking together on Friday night at Pacha.
Mr Mellon has been involved in a series of scrapes that have put him under scrutiny by police. He was arrested for assault last month after an incident at Liverpool Crown Court during the trial of two men accused of attempted murder, and again when he allegedly threatened to punch a doorman in Chester’s Parkgate Street while intoxicated in November.
He has also been involved in other incidents that have placed him in the public eye. He was arrested by police at a party on board the luxury liner Queen Mary II last September and photographed clutching a bottle of champagne. It is believed he was staying aboard with his mother for her 50th birthday celebrations.
Merseyside Police said: “A report has been made about Rachael Skeats’s whereabouts on Friday night and we have concerns over her safety, although she may not be missing.”
Rachel is white, 5ft 6in tall, with shoulder length blonde hair. She was last seen at around 4am yesterday (Sunday) near to Pacha Nightclub in Liverpool city centre, after having been there since Thursday evening.
We are particularly concerned for her safety and anyone who can assist with enquiries is asked to contact Merseyside Police on the non-emergency number 0151 777 4065 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
Police have released a photograph of Rachel, but say it is not clear if she was wearing this top at the time she disappeared.
Update – Nick Mellon has been charged with kidnap and false imprisonment:
A man who went on holiday after his girlfriend vanished has appeared in court over charges linked to her disappearance.
Nick Mellon, 27, of Woolton Lane, Woolton , Merseyside, is alleged to have held Rachael Skeats, also from Liverpool, captive on Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday morning before dumping her in a field.
Miss Skeats was reported missing by police at 8am yesterday after she did not turn up for work or answer her phone. She had been last seen leaving Pacha nightclub on Slater Street with Mellon and two friends at around 4am.
Mellon was arrested at a friend’s house in Cheshire before being released on bail to return to Merseyside Police headquarters today (Tuesday, June 26). He made no plea or declaration as the case was heard at Liverpool magistrates court but was charged with kidnap and false imprisonment.
District Judge Mark Hadfield remanded him in custody for his next appearance at the same court on July 5 where a plea hearing is expected to take place. Mellon, who worked at Deloitte before setting up his own financial services firm, has also been charged with driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs and driving without due care and attention.
The district judge ordered that he remain in custody overnight before appearing again on Tuesday morning. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said they would not comment any further on the case until the next court appearance. Miss Skeats’s friends have launched a Facebook group to appeal for information about her whereabouts and say she had been planning to move in with Mellon before she vanished.
A profile of Nick Mellon, from Liverpool Echo:
Nick Mellon is the son of one of Britain’s biggest landowners, multi-millionaire property developer Richard Mellor, who made his fortune as a partner in DTZ, the property consultants and investors. Nick, who was born in 1985, was educated at private schools – King’s Macclesfield and Eton College – before studying accountancy at Liverpool University.
In May 2010 he pleaded guilty to assaulting a man after an incident in the early hours of Boxing Day at Liverpool Crown Court. The victim required treatment in hospital for his injuries. In October, Mellon was cleared of a charge of criminal damage after an incident involving a doorman at Chester’s Parkgate Street.
The Liverpool Echo has reported that police were called to the club on three separate occasions last year when complaints about Mellon’s behaviour came in. On one occasion, he allegedly tried to punch a bouncer and was arrested for assault after being found passed out by the door of the nightclub. In May 2011, police were called to a house party on board Queen Mary II while she was sailing from Southampton to Liverpool. Mellon was among around 90 revellers who attended the event, which was organised by his mother Sarah, 47. He reportedly threw a bottle of champagne at another guest’s head and smashed a glass in an attempt to get into a fight with him.
Mellon has been questioned about other incidents, including an allegation that he assaulted a man after a night out last September. Police were also called to his home earlier this year when a man was seen kicking a car.
Mellon is believed to have set up his own accountancy firm in the past few years and is thought to be engaged to Amanda Rourke, 32, from Liverpool. He is reportedly friends with members of pop band McFly and was romantically linked to the daughter of a prominent local
