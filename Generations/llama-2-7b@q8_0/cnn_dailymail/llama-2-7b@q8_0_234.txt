oused with fresh paint.
The paint, which cost $150 000 and took two weeks to apply, is a waterproof coating designed to protect the structure of the concrete pool from erosion.
A number of the swimmers were not too keen on having their morning exercise disrupted and voiced their opinion on social media, but the Icebergs management said it had no choice in the matter. The 1200 sqm pool was closed for five weeks as a result.
“We’re sorry that we have to do this, but there is absolutely nothing we can do about it,” general manager at Icebergs Leisure Centre, Andrew Patterson, told Coach. “It is an absolute necessity for the survival of the building.”
The paint was applied as part of a $3 million redevelopment project that has been in the works since 2011 to ensure the Icebergs continues to thrive as one of Sydney’s most iconic institutions.
“It will have no impact on swimming times and lap lanes, but we are sure there will be some disruption for patrons who use the facility,” Mr Patterson said.
The club is still in the midst of applying a new coating to its pool deck that began in October last year. That work is set to continue through until March this year, while the redevelopment project is expected to finish in July.
When it’s all over, the Icebergs will have gained a brand-new sauna and steam room with seating, as well as new change rooms, showers and bathrooms for both men and women. The reception area will be expanded, while there will also be more room to store equipment.
