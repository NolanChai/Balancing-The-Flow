ffolk Coast and Heaths Waterway, have urged visitors to stop taking pictures with the animals following a spate of attacks by the dogs in recent months that has left one child severely injured.
A dingo's jaws clamped down on six-year-old Rory Fegan's leg during the family holiday last week and he now needs surgery to his right calf muscle, reports The Courier Mail. Another attack was reported earlier this month when a two-year old child was bitten in the thigh.
A third incident occurred on Easter Sunday when a couple walking their dog were attacked by up to six dingoes and were left with lacerations to their legs. It has since been revealed that the couple, from Sydney, were not on leash despite signs warning them of the danger of coming into contact with the animals.
One resident told The Courier Mail: "Dingo selfies are killing children - please stop taking these stupid photos." But another, whose 13-year-old daughter was attacked by dingoes at nearby Kingfisher Bay resort in March last year, defended visitors to the island and said it is people's own responsibility not to get close to wild animals.
The attacks have led authorities to take action against tourists taking selfies with the dogs. A spokesman for Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service told The Courier Mail that a number of tourists had been reprimanded by rangers following an incident in 2014 when a couple were injured by dingoes.
A Queensland police spokesperson said it was important people followed the warning signs as the area is not fenced and dogs can be dangerous. Fraser Island, which is located around 30 minutes from Hervey Bay, is Australia's only place where dingoes are found in a wild state.
They were introduced to Australia by humans more than 4500 years ago when they walked over land bridges that linked the island to the mainland and Tasmania. It is thought that no more than 100 of them live on the island, where they feed off wallabies, fruit bats and birds as well as scavenging food from campers.
There has been a concerted effort in recent years by authorities to prevent dingoes being fed by tourists due to fears it could lead to attacks.
Earlier this week a Queensland government report warned that the dingo population on Fraser Island was at risk of becoming extinct as they have lost their natural predators, such as tigers and wombats.
