Detectives probing the suspected murder of a landlady who disappeared 17 years ago have dug up the patio of her pub. Deborah Steel, 37, who ran the Royal Standard pub in Ely, Cambridgeshire, was last ­seen alive on June 28, 1994.
She has not been seen since. Detectives from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team (MAIT) launched a re-examination of the case earlier this year. Officers were given permission to dig up the patio area at the back of the pub, on Magdalene Street, yesterday.
It is believed Deborah was last seen leaving her flat in Ely and going into the pub with a man who is known locally as "Jimmy". She is thought to have had an argument with him before he left the pub. He is not being treated as a suspect in the case but police want to trace him for further questioning.
DNA evidence found on a cigarette stub in Deborah's bedroom has been analysed and linked to someone else, according to her family. Last night detectives were examining what appeared to be blood stains discovered during their digging of the patio at the back of the pub.
Detective Superintendent Paul Mills from Norfolk Police said: "We believe it is highly likely that Deborah was murdered and that her body may have been buried on the premises."
Deborah's daughter, Rebecca, 36, added: "It has been a long time but we are hopeful of getting answers about what happened to my mum. We miss her every day."
