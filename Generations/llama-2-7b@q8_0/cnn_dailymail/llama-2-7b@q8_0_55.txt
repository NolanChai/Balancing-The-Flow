thampstead area near Wokingham where the road passes - has been hailed as one of the most important archaeological finds in Britain for decades. Her story is an intriguing and poignant one, showing how we have changed through history and yet remained so similar at our core.
The skeleton was found by accident on a building site in the 1930s but not officially excavated until 1986 when archaeologists uncovered the remains of a Roman villa. She is believed to be in her early twenties and was buried around 2,000 years ago as part of a ritual process that took place when she died at home from natural causes. The team discovered the body while excavating an area where there had been a Roman bathhouse.
The skeleton has long been recognised by archaeologists as an important find but only now, with the help of forensic technology, can we see exactly what this woman would have looked like in life. A team at the University of Brighton created a 3D model using detailed photographs taken before and after the skeleton was restored to its original state following conservation work. This enabled them to reconstruct her face as she would have appeared when alive, including all the small details that make each person unique - such as individual features like ears or eyebrows!
The team found out many interesting things about what life might have been like back then by studying these pictures closely – for instance they discovered some evidence suggesting that she may not have had any teeth left when death finally came around. This could indicate a period of ill health which led her to die prematurely at such an early age!
The reconstruction process also revealed other details about this fascinating woman's life - including clues about what clothes she wore before death; what types of food were available in ancient Roman Britain; whether or not she suffered from any diseases such as malnutrition and what type of burial practices were used at that time.
The final result has been described by experts as "one of the most significant archaeological finds ever made." It's an incredibly moving tribute to an everyday person living in Roman times who still remains an important part of our history today – despite being buried many centuries ago!
