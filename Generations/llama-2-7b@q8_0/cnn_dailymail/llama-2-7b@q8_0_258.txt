The president has taken a lot of heat in the past few days over the botched launches of ObamaCare's Healthcare.gov website and its companion phone application. On Thursday, he insisted that "I am not happy with what happened."
He then went on to lay blame for the fiasco on others: "You know, I don't stand here trying to defend every decision that was made," he said at one point.
Obama then cited a government contractor (CGI Federal) and a state-run health insurance exchange as factors in the messy implementation of his signature legislative achievement.
"It's not an excuse, but it's a fact that the website that was supposed to do everything for us, had some glitches," he said.
"If you look at what happened with Healthcare.gov, it's very clear that this is a website that is -- that has never been tested and worked before."
But the administration itself has done its own testing of the system and knew exactly what to expect: "The Obama Administration knew all along that the glitch-ridden 'Obamacare' exchanges were in deep trouble," reports Politico.
"An internal government memo obtained by POLITICO says that Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services was aware as early as July that problems with the federal website, HealthCare.gov, might force officials to extend a key deadline for enrollment — something the White House denied just weeks ago."
The memo "was written by HHS' Office of Health Reform on Aug. 7, nearly two months before the website’s launch, and was addressed to the HHS regional offices that are in charge of implementing Obamacare," says Politico.
"In the memo, officials warned that 'in light of potential shortfalls,' the department had to be prepared to ask for an extension on the deadline to sign up for coverage."
The White House was asked by the media if President Obama was aware of the August 7 memo.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said, "I'm not going to get into all the details," but then went on to say that the administration is working as hard and fast as it can to fix Healthcare.gov: "We're doing everything we can to ensure that website works as quickly and smoothly for as many people as possible."
As we noted earlier, Obama blames Republican opposition to his signature legislative achievement as the reason behind the fiasco.
"We knew that some of this stuff was going to be hard," he said. "We were not naive in believing that a website that had never been done before and didn’t have a track record, and that suddenly had millions of people trying to access it at one time, that it wouldn’t have some problems."
"So we knew that there was going to be some glitches. We also knew this was going to happen. That's why the president called for us to delay it a month when they first started having problems with it," he continued. "And so I think that everybody knows we’re going to work our way through it."
