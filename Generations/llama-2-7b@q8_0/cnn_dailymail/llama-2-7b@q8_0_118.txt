 his ears. It was not long ago that he was king of the F1 world: in 2016 he was crowned World Champion with Mercedes and it looked as if nothing would stop him from winning another title this year. But after two disappointing races in Australia and China, things were beginning to look ominous for Rosberg; then he collided with Max Verstappen at the last corner of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. It was a reckless move which damaged both cars, but the stewards decided it wasn’t enough to award any points on penalties and Hamilton went on to win while Rosberg finished an ignominious 17th. After being awarded the Drivers’ Championship in 2014 and 2015, he was now second-best again, his dreams shattered. He could only look ahead to the next race at Bahrain with fear and foreboding.

For Hamilton though, it had been a case of third time lucky: he’d managed to out-perform his teammate and win despite being hit by Verstappen in the race, while Rosberg finished second. It was his first win of the season but more importantly, it meant that he had cut Rosberg’s lead in the Drivers Championship standings down from 43 points to just ten.
