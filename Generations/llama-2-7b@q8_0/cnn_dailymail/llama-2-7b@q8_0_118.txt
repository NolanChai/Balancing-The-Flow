rs a day in the gym and watched what he ate.
A teenager’s obsession for self-improvement went too far when he took an overdose after his girlfriend dumped him because of his perfectionism.
Danny Bowman, 19, became so obsessed with seeking perfection that he could not accept her rejection and decided to take the ultimate step to end his life.
His family believe Danny had been working out up to ten hours a day when they found him unconscious in his Newcastle home. He was rushed to hospital where doctors saved his life but now fear he may never be able to return to his former self, reports the Daily Mail.
The 19-year-old from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear had started hitting the gym when he was just 13 years old after being bullied at school. His father David Bowman said: ‘Danny’s always wanted to look good for girls – that’s what motivated him to go to the gym in the first place.’
And his mother Christine Bowman added: ‘It was an obsession and I think he thought if he was perfect then he could attract a girlfriend. He would even cut himself when he got frustrated with not being able to be perfect, but we just told him to put some plasters on.’
Danny’s mother said her son had been working out in the gym up to ten hours every day when he became ‘obsessed’ with bodybuilding and weightlifting.
She said: ‘Danny was very active and always playing football, but one day he decided to go to the gym. He was just 13 years old at the time. He would spend a lot of money on supplements. At first I thought it was OK because I thought he was getting fit, but then I noticed he started to get obsessed with what he ate and working out too much.’
She said: ‘It got so bad that I even had to stop him going to the gym. It went on for years. I didn’t think anything of it because he was always happy when he came home from the gym – he would be running around the house, but I think it did take its toll on his health.’
The mother-of-two said she started to notice that Danny began taking an overdose after he had been dumped by his girlfriend.
She added: ‘I got a phone call from Danny’s dad saying he was in the hospital and it turned out he had taken a big amount of pills. He told me it was because his girlfriend had left him for another guy and that just broke his heart.’
She said that she has been able to help her son recover, but believes he is still traumatised by the incident, which she fears could have damaged parts of his brain. ‘I think Danny will be fine now – he’s getting better,’ Mrs Bowman added.
‘He just needs some more time. He is not like he was before. I don’t know whether it has been something that has affected his head, but I would be surprised if this had not changed him and I think he could have mental health problems in the future.’
Danny’s father David said: ‘I think Danny will always have a bit of anxiety over what happened. He is more down to earth now, but it has made him more introverted.’
Danny’s older brother Christopher added: ‘He’s doing a lot better since the incident and he seems a lot happier when he does come out these days.’
