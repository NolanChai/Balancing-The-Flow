mic battle for global food security heats up between man and nature.
Insects are nutrient-rich; they have lots of protein and iron and their omega-3 fats are good for us too. A single grasshopper, for example, contains roughly the same amount of calcium as a glass of milk – plus half as much iron and a third more vitamin B12 than you’ll get in a daily cupful of the white stuff.
Besides that they are also cheap to rear, easy to catch, contain fewer calories per gram than most meat, don’t require much land and can be fed on agricultural waste products like maize husks or animal faeces (they’re great composters). In short, eating insects is a lot better for the environment too.
The only problem is that we in the West tend to think of bugs as something best left to flies and spiders. But they have been consumed for centuries by cultures like the Chinese. There they can be found in dishes such as the ‘fried grasshoppers’ served up in Guangzhou, or the worm-filled cakes from the Hainan Province.
In Europe, however, the insect eating habits of the French, Italians and Spaniards are less well known. In 19th century Spain, for example, it was common practice to eat a dish called ‘cocido montañés’ made with earthworms, pork and beans which were then topped off with a rich tomato sauce.
It is only since the mid-20th century that our Western food culture has come to eschew the consumption of insects as something repugnant – although they are still a staple for many third world societies, especially in Africa and Asia. But as global population numbers continue to rise, and resources become ever scarcer, it is likely to be a very different story in the decades ahead.
So if you’re one of those people who has a thing about eating insects (as well as other creepy crawlies), then prepare yourselves for some major changes. They are coming our way and there’ll be no escape.
