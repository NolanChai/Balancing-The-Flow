ling eels, tadpoles and a variety of insects are also included in this unique clip.
"Leopard frogs have always been attracted to my phone camera. I've just found it is better to film them when they can see the screen," Nigella explains on YouTube. "The frogs don't know there isn't a live feed going, so they are fascinated by the light."
The video is actually the second part of her latest episode, which was filmed in a pond at her home. The first part shows more tadpoles and eels swimming around underwater while Nigella discusses food-related topics such as cooking chicken liver mousse and baking apple pies.
