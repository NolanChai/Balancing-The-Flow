Police, coroners and FBI agents dug up the remains of Gail Shrewsbury from her cemetery plot near Bloomington, Illinois. She was buried there last month, a few weeks after a judge allowed investigators to exhume her body and test bones for DNA.
Prosecutors want that evidence to help them prove their case against Larry Siegfried, 70, who was indicted in May on first-degree murder charges related to Shrewsbury's death. He is scheduled to appear Wednesday before a McLean County judge for an arraignment.
Shrewsbury was abducted by two men as she walked home from school in April 1957, then taken to a cornfield and strangled with her own nylon stockings, according to prosecutors.
Her body was found the next day, but investigators never caught any leads in the case until more than a decade ago, when authorities used DNA technology to help identify her. She had been buried under a roadway near the cornfield where she was slain.
Siegfried lived nearby at the time of Shrewsbury's murder and later confessed to an acquaintance that he had killed the girl, according to court records. He has denied involvement in Shrewsbury's death, but prosecutors say they have other evidence linking him to it.
Siegfried was convicted in 2004 of sexual assaulting a child in Illinois, and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison. That case dates back to the mid-1960s -- 10 to 15 years after Shrewsbury's murder, depending on the court record.
But prosecutors say they have additional evidence linking him to her murder, and they cite a 2003 interview with Siegfried as he was serving time for sexually assaulting another child. In that interview, Siegfried said he "stole" Shrewsbury from the side of the road where she was found dead and drove her body away, according to prosecutors.
The case against Siegfried is complicated because he has since died. But investigators say they want DNA evidence linking him to the murder to be used as proof in the case against his estate -- which was left by Siegfried to a niece who is serving time for financial crimes.
Court records show that Siegfried, who died in 2011 at age 68, spent much of his adult life in and out of prisons on charges related to sexual assaults on children.
