ources said the annual event, held outside St Mark Lutheran Church in Madison for 40 years, would not go ahead this year due to concerns that the pigs may have suffered.
The church's website said: 'We've had a great time with the pig wrestling and we are saddened that it won't continue. The reason is that animal rights groups have pressured our insurance company.' St Mark Lutheran Church in Madison, Wisconsin, held its first annual Pig Wrestling on July 17th 1978 to raise money for the church's daycare program.
It raised $4,500 and became so popular it was repeated annually until this year. Each summer up to two dozen men or women would compete against a pig weighing around 250 pounds. They wore protective helmets with mesh face guards but were not required to wear gloves.
The church said that in its 40 years it had 'never heard of an injury'. It is believed that the annual event will be replaced by a fish fry fundraiser.
