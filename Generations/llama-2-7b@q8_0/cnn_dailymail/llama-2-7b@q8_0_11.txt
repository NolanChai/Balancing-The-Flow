 becoming addicted to drugs as a child.
A teenage girl who became hooked on drugs at the age of 11 has been found dead in her bedroom, an inquest heard today (Thursday).
Denise Shepherd, 19, had become dependent on heroin after she first tried marijuana and cocaine.
She was discovered by her parents after becoming so ill from taking drugs that her mother took out a loan to pay for private care at a drug rehab centre in Leeds.
But Denise’s addiction spiralled out of control when she began using more and more heroin, which had been laced with the deadly painkiller fentanyl.
After being admitted to hospital twice during one weekend, an autopsy found that Denise died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills on June 20 last year.
Denise’s parents Andrew and Tracey Shepherd told how their daughter had become hooked on drugs after taking cannabis and cocaine at parties.
Her mother said: “She didn’t know the dangers. It was too late by the time she found out what it did to her.”
A police officer who attended Denise’s inquest confirmed that drug use has been increasing among young people and the use of heroin laced with fentanyl had become an “epidemic” among users.
