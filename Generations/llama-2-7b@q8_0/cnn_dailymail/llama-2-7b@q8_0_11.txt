ant has been the focus of numerous investigations by federal and state officials, which found that it had engaged in fraudulent recruiting and job placement practices, among other misconduct.
Sunday's announcement is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable.
While Corinthian has closed campuses in the past, this time it appears that the company is actually going out of business -- and not simply selling its campuses and leaving students behind, as happened with other big companies in this sector. This development gives hope to Corinthians' 16,000 current students, who will be eligible for debt relief under a federal program. It also gives hope to tens of thousands of former students who are struggling to repay their loans and have not had access to the debt relief they deserve.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that this development marks the end of the struggle over Corinthian -- or any other for-profit college. There's always a chance that someone else will try to take on the company's campuses and keep them open, putting students at risk once again. And there is also the possibility that some former Corinthian students who are eligible for debt relief under the federal program might not know about it because of the complicated process.
So it's critical that regulators follow up to ensure that all affected students get what they deserve, and that no one tries to keep a business running while putting consumers at risk. Regulators need to act with the urgency and focus this crisis deserves.
