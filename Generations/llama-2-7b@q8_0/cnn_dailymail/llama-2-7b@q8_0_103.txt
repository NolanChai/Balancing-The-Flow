­after Diana's death, a new biography reveals how she transformed herself into an unstoppable global icon with more power than any man in Britain
Forget that she was the wife of a future king: this is not about Diana, Princess of Wales - it's about Diana, Princess of Hearts. A decade after her death, the public mood is one of reconciliation and respect. But as new research reveals, behind the scenes, the battle lines remain starkly drawn between those who despise the "queen of hearts" and those who love her to bits.
Much of Diana's success in winning our hearts came from her own relentless campaigning for a better world through a series of charitable initiatives. But she also won over hearts and minds by adopting what one observer has described as a "subversive strategy" - playing the cards that others didn't want to play.
The Princess of Wales was a woman who knew exactly how to use her assets for maximum effect: her beauty, her talent for putting people at ease and her skill in choosing friends and advisers who understood her strengths. Diana's greatest achievement was in turning the traditional role of the royal consort into that of the 1980s "superwoman" - the self-made woman.
By playing on what was to many a surprisingly modern image, she defied tradition and broke down barriers while reinventing herself as the ultimate feminist icon. She did this by embracing the values of modern Britain: freedom, independence, equality, individuality, the need for privacy in public life.
But, more than any other woman of her generation, she was also defined by the public's reaction to her. In 1980, when she met Prince Charles at a friend's house party and he asked for her telephone number, Diana had no intention of becoming his future wife and Queen of England. The Princess of Wales was not a girl who dreamed of being a princess as a youngster, says Paul Burrell, her former butler. "The thing with Diana is that she never wanted to be royal. She just saw it as a means to an end."

She was born Diana Frances Spencer on July 1, 1961. Her parents were John Althorp and Frances Shand Kydd, whose marriage lasted a total of six years.
Diana's mother left her with her grandmother, Ruth Fermoy (her mother's mother), and a nanny in Park House on the Sandringham estate at age seven. At 17 she was sent to finishing school in Switzerland where her mother encouraged her to lose weight and improve her posture.
Diana was introduced by mutual friends to Prince Charles when they were both staying with different families on the Cornish coast, according to Paul Burrell: "It was at this point that she made it clear that if he asked for her number, then she would give it to him." When Charles did so in September 1980, Diana gave him the number of the Royal Boxing Club and instructed her secretary not to put through any calls from him.
On February 24, 1981, Charles invited Diana to see a play called Cuckoo Waltz at London's Albery Theatre. At the time, they were both dating other people but it was obvious that they had fallen in love with each other. The following day they had their first full-blown date, which included lunch and shopping at Harrods before a picnic at St James's Park.
On March 24, Charles asked Diana to marry him on bended knee at Kensington Palace - with no ring in sight - and she accepted. In August, they were secretly married by the Bishop of Gloucester at Buckingham Palace. The wedding ceremony was private, with only 19 people in attendance (including a representative from each of their families).
The following day, the couple held a more elaborate ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral with an estimated two billion people watching around the world via television broadcasts or newspapers containing pictures and details about what was then called "the wedding of all weddings". It remains one of Britain's most iconic moments: Princess Diana walking down the aisle wearing her famous $2.6 million (£1.5 million) tiara, which she had been given by Charles as an engagement gift. The couple were married for 23 years before they separated in 1992 and divorced four years later.
On February 6, 1983, Diana gave birth to a son named Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor - who is now second-in-line to the British throne after his father Charles (the current heir apparent). In July that same year she welcomed her daughter Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Wales into this world; followed by two more sons, Prince Henry and Prince George Alexander Louis in 1984 and 2003 respectively.
The birth of their fourth son was a momentous occasion for both parents as it marked the first time they had shared a bed since their separation in 1992 (they stayed apart until then because they were too busy being married). It also meant that all four children would share their mother's last name; something which hadn't happened before - only daughters were given that privilege previously.
On August 30, 1986, while on a tour of Australia with Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family as part of Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee Celebrations, Diana was involved in an accident during which she sustained serious injuries (including a broken collarbone). She later told journalists that she had fallen from her horse after being "lifted off" by someone else's saddle girth; however other witnesses claimed that it was actually another person who caused the fall and not just some poor rider trying to catch his/her foot in a stirrup while dismounting at speed!
As a result of this accident, Diana sustained head injuries which led to long-term memory loss - something which she later used as an excuse for why she could no longer remember anything about her husband's affairs with other women. Nevertheless these memories have been retrieved over time thanks to advances in technology such as MRI scans (which allow doctors/specialists access into deep parts of our brains).
In addition, there was speculation that Diana suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing first hand how devastating war could be during World War II when she watched her father get killed by an enemy shell while serving with British forces in North Africa. This theory was supported further when reports emerged that following his death she became emotionally unstable; however these claims were never substantiated through independent research conducted independently of those who might have a vested interest (such as her family members).
Diana's relationship with the Royal Family had already begun to deteriorate prior to this incident. It was clear that there was no love lost between them when they refused to attend her wedding reception at Buckingham Palace in 1985 despite being invited by Prince Charles himself who wanted his new bride present for what would be considered an important event within the British monarchy! This incident only served as another nail into what many viewed as an already broken relationship; however it did not seem likely that anything could break their bond completely because they had spent so much time together beforehand - especially during Diana's engagement period which was marked by numerous public events where she would meet up with Charles (and often other members).
On 9th April 1992, just after midnight on Tuesday morning and only days after attending Easter Sunday mass at Windsor Castle, Prince Philip woke up to find that his wife had disappeared from their bedroom. The couple had been married for over twenty years but had separated since March 31st when Charles decided not to return home following an argument about how he should live with Diana's affair with James Hewitt (a former cavalry officer who served under her father).
He was said by friends and family members alike that they had been arguing over this issue for months but now it seemed as though everything had come to a head: "She just disappeared," Prince Philip told reporters when questioned about what happened next; adding later on during an interview with BBC's Panorama program "I didn’t know where she was going or why".
The following day news broke that Diana had been found dead inside the Ritz hotel in Paris, France - after being admitted to hospital just days before due to a suspected heart attack. An autopsy carried out shortly afterwards revealed no signs of foul play but did show evidence of previous injuries sustained during previous incidents involving her husband (who was reportedly furious at how he'd been treated by his wife).
The investigation into Diana's death continues and is expected to last several more months before it can be concluded; however some people believe that we may never know exactly what happened that night - or why she died at all!
