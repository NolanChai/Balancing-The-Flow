izarre phenomenon is creating strange and often devastating weather patterns around the world.
The giant ocean patch is one of the biggest in the world with a surface area of over 2 million square miles, bigger than Spain or Japan. It has warmed more than any other part of the Pacific Ocean for four years in a row.
But why should it be so significant?
Scientists think its effects on climate could help to explain the record breaking drought affecting California, Nevada and Arizona that has seen huge swathes of America’s most valuable crops wilt amid record high temperatures. The drought is thought to have caused $2 billion (£1.2 billion) in damages so far this year alone.
This may be because the warming blob is linked to a natural climate phenomenon known as La Niña. During this event, sea surface temperatures cool slightly around the Pacific Ocean, bringing with it floods, droughts and extreme weather across large swathes of the Americas.
The ‘warm blob’ of water has also been linked to more freezing weather in North America which has seen huge blizzards sweep the east coast over recent weeks. While the warm patch is located off California, it has an effect on climate all over the world.
A study published last year suggested that the blob was linked with extreme weather events around the world. The researchers found that its impacts can be felt far and wide. Extreme storms in Australia were likely caused by a sudden change in wind direction linked to the blob, while drought in Indonesia could be blamed on it too.
The blob is just one of many examples of the way in which climate patterns are changing around the world. The recent ‘polar vortex’, for example, caused huge swathes of America to freeze over during the winter. It has been linked with an abnormally warm patch of water called the ‘warm polar vortex’ that lies off the coast of Russia.
And while the blob and polar vortex may be baffling, climate scientists say they are actually a result of natural changes in the climate system. They point out that while the warming of the world is driven by human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and clearing land for agriculture, climate patterns can also change without human interference.
The blob, polar vortex and other examples of abnormal weather are all linked to natural cycles in the climate system – and there is nothing we can do to stop them, scientists say. But they stress that while such changes may be beyond our control, it will become much harder to adapt as climate change increases.
So what does this mean for us? It means we need to take action now to reduce emissions and slow down climate change. We can’t wait until the next ‘weird’ weather event to act – and we must act fast because there is no doubt that things are going to get much worse.
The warming blob could be responsible for droughts in California, floods in Australia and freezing temperatures in North America. Climate change is making our world increasingly unpredictable.
