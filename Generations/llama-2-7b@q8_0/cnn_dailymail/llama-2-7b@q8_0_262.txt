Police officers in Azerbaijan are attempting to prevent demonstrations against the government from going ahead in several cities.
Protesters say the government of President Ilham Aliyev is corrupt, authoritarian and has not delivered on reforms it promised.
Mr Aliyev has called the protests an attempt to destabilise his country and its economy.
He was re-elected for a third term last month after the opposition said the vote had been rigged in his favour.
