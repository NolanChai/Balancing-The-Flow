Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League, Football League and FA Cup fixtures.
1. Arsenal’s performance at Stoke was so bad that they ended up conceding eight goals in two matches
They have now shipped 15 goals in four league outings this season, which is the same amount as they did in their previous 10 games combined.
Asked whether he thought Arsenal were capable of winning a third successive Premier League title after beating Swansea on Sunday, midfielder Jack Wilshere replied: ‘Not at all.’
After being knocked out of the Champions League by Monaco in August and now having lost their unbeaten start to the league campaign against Stoke, Arsene Wenger will no doubt feel that he has some serious problems on his hands.
Their defence is so porous that even when they have two centre-backs on the pitch – Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker – it still seems impossible to keep a clean sheet.
Were Arsenal’s current defensive woes brought about by the departure of Thomas Vermaelen or is the issue with their back four rather than one man?
Arsenal will have to work hard in defence if they are to stay up at the top of the Premier League, where Chelsea and Liverpool look to be improving after an indifferent start.
Wenger has said that his side’s problems lie elsewhere and he will continue to play with a back four despite their obvious deficiencies.
After Sunday’s defeat by Stoke – which saw them concede eight goals in two matches – Arsenal now need to put their house in order at the back.
2. Manchester United are in trouble as they prepare for another Champions League campaign after losing 1-0 against Everton on Saturday
In a match which ended in controversy with Wayne Rooney being sent off and Phil Jones then having his own red card rescinded, it was Everton who left Old Trafford with all three points.
Louis van Gaal’s men were not at their best but they did put in a good shift defensively against the Toffees and they may have got away with more had Jones’ sending-off been upheld.
United are now eight points behind leaders Manchester City and although they are playing well, they look as if they will need to improve greatly to win silverware again this season.
Their Champions League campaign begins next month and it is becoming apparent that their problems may lie in the fact that they have struggled at Old Trafford for years.
3. Jose Mourinho’s side are also struggling away from home as Chelsea drew 0-0 with Stoke on Saturday night
The Blues were fortunate to get a draw, having been denied a late penalty when John Terry went down in the area under pressure from Jon Walters.
After beating Aston Villa last weekend and going out of Europe against Sporting Lisbon, Mourinho has come in for some stick but he is unlikely to have been happy with his team’s performance on Saturday night.
However, they did get away with one when goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saved a shot from Charlie Adam which would probably have won the game had it gone in.
The Blues are now behind United and Arsenal in the title race and although Mourinho will be frustrated by his side’s results this season, there is still plenty of time for them to get back into form.
4. Swansea City look likely to struggle if they do not buy a new striker after losing 3-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon
Garry Monk’s team have now conceded nine goals in their last four league matches and although the Gunners were poor against Stoke, it was still disappointing for them to lose so heavily.
Swansea are bottom of the table after 14 matches but they should not be too worried as they will likely stay up if they do sign a new striker in January.
Apart from their three strikers – Wilfried Bony, Bafetimbi Gomis and Andre Ayew – none of the other players at the club are capable of scoring enough goals to keep them up.
Gerhard Tremmel is also out injured for the rest of the season which leaves Swansea without a goalkeeper in their squad.
Monk’s team have a good chance of staying up this season but they will need to strengthen their forward line if they are going to do so.
5. The battle for automatic promotion is between Leicester City and Burnley after their 2-0 win at Derby County on Saturday
Burnley beat Cardiff last weekend to keep up the pressure at the top of the table as Leicester won by two goals against Derby County.
The Foxes are now level with Sean Dyche’s side, who are in second place after 13 games, while the Cardiff game saw them overtake Hull City into third spot.
Both teams have a good chance of making it into the top six and although Leicester have had a few more injuries than their rivals recently, they could still go up automatically if they can keep going.
It is also worth noting that both sides have won nine matches each and the only difference between them is goal difference as Burnley currently lie four points ahead of Leicester in second place.
The battle for automatic promotion may come down to which team can stay injury free over the next few months, with the Foxes having lost six players over the past fortnight due to injuries.
6. QPR are now almost certain to be relegated after drawing 1-1 away at Wigan on Saturday evening
It was an entertaining match and it ended up in a draw when Bobby Zamora scored his first goal since moving back from Brighton last month, although he had been subbed just before the hour mark.
The Rs are now level with Aston Villa on 23 points but they have played one game more than their rivals for the bottom spot and if they do go down, then it will be a surprise to most people in the game.
QPR’s form has been poor all season and although Mark Hughes is a good coach, he cannot turn things around overnight as he has already shown at Southampton.
The Rs have plenty of time left before the end of the season but they will need to find some points soon if they are going to stay up this year.
7. Sunderland could be in danger of relegation after losing 3-1 away at Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon
David Moyes’ side are now bottom of the table with just two wins and one draw from their 24 games so far, but they have had a better start to this season than last.
They still need to get themselves out of trouble and it is not easy when you don’t have any points on your tally.
It was another bad result for the Black Cats as they conceded three goals in front of their own fans, who were booing them at the end of the game.
Moyes will know that his team are not doing well but he also knows that they need to improve if they want to stay up this year and he is unlikely to give up on them yet.
8. Liverpool have been playing some great football recently and it looks like their season may get even better as Jurgen Klopp has made the right signings in the transfer window
Klopp’s team are top of the Premier League table, six points ahead of Chelsea after 13 matches and they are also in the Champions League knockout stages.
They have won seven matches in a row to make it into the last 16 of Europe’s elite competition but their form has not been consistent as they have lost two games against Watford and Stoke City, who are both struggling near the bottom of the table.
However, Liverpool may still be able to get back on top if they can find some more goals and win enough points to make sure that they do not drop down into mid-table.
Klopp’s team have already made two signings this summer as Mario Gotze and Emre Can both joined from Bayern Munich for a combined £20m fee, while the German manager also signed Danny Ings from Burnley for just over £15m last week.
9. It is looking increasingly likely that Manchester City will win the Premier League title this season after they beat Southampton 3-0 at home on Saturday night
Southampton were poor in defence as Sergio Aguero scored twice before Fernandinho sealed it with a goal late on, which put them top of the table by four points.
They will now have to play Chelsea and Arsenal away from home but they should be able to get enough points if they can stay out of trouble in their other games.
It was another good result for Pep Guardiola’s side as he is now unbeaten in his first 12 league matches at the club, which includes seven wins and four draws.
Manchester City have been one of the best sides in Europe this season and they look like they are going to make it into the Champions League knockout stages again after winning two out of their three games so far.
However, there is still a long way for them to go if they are going to win the Premier League
