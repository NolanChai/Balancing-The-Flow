lette Tindall, 35, said she had been desperate to be on the same flight as her boyfriend, Richard Palmer, 28, but his plans were thrown into disarray when he found out his travel insurance did not cover him for his trip to Nepal and India.
The student had hoped to see some of the world’s most spectacular scenery on his round-the-world tour - with Ms Tindall telling how they discussed their itinerary at the weekend, with her suggesting he take a detour via the Alps.
But he told her he was planning to go back home after a month in Nepal and India as he did not think his insurance would cover him for the remainder of the trip.

His travel agent in Bath told him he was not covered for a later flight and that they would have to find another airline - so Mr Palmer decided to change his flights last night.
Ms Tindall, who is also from Bath, said: 'He made the decision at about 10pm last night to take an earlier flight back home.' She added that her boyfriend had booked his ticket through a travel agent and was told it would cover him for one of two flights between Bath and Geneva on Monday - but that he only learned this weekend that neither flight would be covered.
'Richard made the decision at about 10pm last night to take an earlier flight back home,' she said. 'I do not blame Richard for his death because he was trying to get home.' Mr Palmer and seven others died after their Air Transat jet crashed in southern France yesterday morning.
The former Royal Marines soldier had been travelling with friends from London to India when the aircraft came down at an airport near Barcelona, Spain on Monday. The flight had taken off from Gatwick at 12:46pm.
Writing on Facebook, Mr Palmer’s best friend, Ben Sutherland, said he was devastated by the news of his death. He wrote: ‘A tragic end to what was meant to be an epic trip of a lifetime. RIP my brother.’ The other seven victims were named as Gareth Rhys-Brown, 28, of London; Andrew Stephens, 36, from Glasgow and his fiancee, Ruth Mosalski, 28, also from Glasgow; Robert Delaney, 45, from Hertfordshire and his wife, Carol, 44, and their son, Jackie, 14.
Ms Tindall added that Mr Palmer had planned to go travelling with his best friend Mr Sutherland but they had both been working for several months, so he decided to visit Nepal on his own.
The plane was carrying a total of 280 passengers and crew when it came down in the French Alps yesterday morning - 178 were rescued from the wreckage, with the first survivors arriving at hospital in Barcelona just after midnight.
Investigators are focussing on the pilot, whose last-known communications indicated he was having technical problems shortly before the crash. It has now been revealed that a message left by the pilot moments before the crash said: 'Mayday, mayday, mayday - engine problem.' The message had been sent at 10:30am local time (9:30 GMT), just two minutes after he first reported trouble to air traffic control.
The plane came down in the French Alps yesterday morning at about 10:50am. The pilot, who was named by authorities as David Robertson, had sent a message to air traffic controllers shortly before reporting that there were problems with his Airbus A321-200 jet’s engines and asked for help to land in Barcelona.
It is believed the plane was just minutes away from landing at Barcelona when it crashed near Digne, southeast France, killing all 150 passengers and crew on board.
The flight had taken off from Gatwick at 12:46pm.

Authorities say that Mr Robertson, 49, may have been suffering from 'hypoxia' - low oxygen in the blood - before his aircraft crashed near Digne, southeastern France. The French accident investigation agency has said that it appears the plane hit a mountain while flying too slow and at too high an altitude.
The pilot of British Airways Flight 38 died from 'hypoxia', according to police sources - with reports suggesting he could have suffered low oxygen in his blood before the jet crashed into a mountain yesterday morning, killing all on board.
Mr Robertson, who was born and raised in Scotland, had been flying for British Airways since 1989. He was named as one of the nine victims by local authorities last night.
According to the accident investigation agency, it appears the aircraft hit a mountain while flying at too low an altitude. It said that investigators were examining the possibility that 'hypoxia' - a lack of oxygen in the blood - caused Mr Robertson to lose control before the crash.
The French Alpine town of Digne where the plane came down is around 105 miles south-east of Marseille and about 65 miles north-west of Nice, France's third most populous city.
It said the jet came down in an isolated area surrounded by mountains. The nearest towns are Digne, which is located some distance away to the south, and Sisteron, a town of around 8,000 people to the west that is around four miles from the crash site. It was not immediately clear how many of those who died were British.
The plane had been flying at an altitude of 38,000 feet when it disappeared from radar screens shortly after passing through cloud - and may have suffered 'hypoxia' before crashing into a mountain near Digne-les-Bains in the French Alps.
The Air Transat plane was travelling from London to Toronto via Paris at the time, with 280 people on board - 157 passengers, four flight attendants and 113 crew. There are reports that some of those killed were children, and a British couple who had been looking forward to their honeymoon after getting married earlier this month.
'It is my understanding that there are British citizens involved in the accident,' said Foreign Secretary William Hague during his regular media briefing at the Foreign Office. 'I can confirm that the British Embassy in France has made contact with French authorities and I understand the British consulate general in Marseille will also be visiting the affected airport today.'
The plane was travelling from London to Toronto via Paris when it crashed at a height of 10,527 metres (34,549 feet) - well above the cruising altitude for commercial jets. Investigators are focusing on whether there could have been problems with the aircraft's engines before it plunged into a mountain shortly after leaving French airspace at around 10:46 GMT.
The Airbus A321-200 had flown from London to Paris, where passengers changed planes for their onward journey to Toronto. The pilot of the flight was David Robertson, 49, who was born and raised in Scotland. It is understood that he may have suffered low oxygen levels before the crash - known as 'hypoxia'.
A spokesman from British Airways said: ‘Our thoughts are with all those involved in this accident. We will continue to provide support for our employees throughout today.’
French police sources suggested that Mr Robertson may have been suffering from a lack of oxygen in his blood before the jet crashed into a mountain yesterday morning, killing all on board. The pilot died when his aircraft came down near Digne-les-Bains - close to the Italian border - at around 10:50am local time, about an hour after it departed from Paris Orly airport in southern France for Toronto.
The plane was carrying a total of 280 passengers and crew when it came down at an altitude of 37,679 feet (11,488 metres) - well above the cruising height for commercial jets. It is understood that Mr Robertson may have suffered hypoxia before the crash.
Mr Robertson had been flying for British Airways since 1989 and was named as one of the nine victims by local authorities last night. He was born in Scotland but had lived in France for many years, with his wife and two sons. A French police spokesman said that the plane came down around 30 minutes after its departure from Paris, indicating it may have suffered a technical failure before plunging into the side of the mountain at speed.
Investigators are focussing on whether there could have been problems with the aircraft's engines before it plummeted to earth, killing all 150 people on board. The Airbus A321-2
