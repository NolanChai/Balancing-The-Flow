95% made up and 5% real, features an eclectic bunch of names from the worlds of business, entertainment and politics – with a healthy dose of irony thrown in for good measure.
From Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year to Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year, a tongue-in-cheek list of GQ Awards’ winners has been unveiled. The mocked-up winners’ list, which was 95% made up and 5% real, features an eclectic bunch of names from the worlds of business, entertainment and politics – with a healthy dose of irony thrown in for good measure. “A few months ago we decided it would be a laugh to put out a spoof ‘awards’ issue and get some famous people to pretend they’d won,” says editor Dylan Jones. “It turned out that the names we got back were so ridiculously funny we decided to go with them – though there was just enough truth in some of the ‘winners’ that it made for an interesting read.”
Following a vote by readers, Kim Jong-Un has been named Humanitarian of the Year. A spokesperson from the Korean government said: “The people of North Korea are grateful to Mr Kim for his hard work in providing them with so much free food, electricity and water. They also appreciate how he managed to persuade China to allow millions more North Koreans to move over there.”
Snoop Dogg has been named Sexiest Man Alive (“for a second time”), while Donald Trump is the winner of Best Dressed (“for a third time”). The GQ Awards ceremony, which will be held at the Royal Albert Hall in October, will be hosted by comedian Ed Byrne.
