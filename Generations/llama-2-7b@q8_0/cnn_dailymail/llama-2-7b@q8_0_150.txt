Pro, which offers an average salary of $249,736.
The list was created by Salary.com using data from more than 5 million employee profiles to determine the median wage of every job at the companies on its Best Places To Work in America list for 2018. It then cross-referenced those figures against other sources to come up with the list of highest-paying companies, which includes Netflix and GoPro but not Apple or Amazon.
It also features Google parent company Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft, whose median employee wages are $120,853 ($247,796 including stock options), $105,051 ($191,516) and $90,929 ($172,051).

“While these are the top-paying companies overall, it is important to remember that compensation varies from one job position to another,” said Salary.com chief economist Dr. Matt Ferguson. “If you’re looking to make more money in your current role or change jobs entirely, it can be useful to research the top paying companies in your industry.”
The highest-paying industries include financial services (median salary: $169,474), technology ($135,268) and consumer goods ($124,064). But with a median pay of $19,697 for each job, the public sector is significantly lower than other industries.
“The average public-sector employee makes $19,700 annually, which puts them at the 33rd percentile for all income earners,” Ferguson said. “While a higher paying job will bring financial rewards, it’s important to consider all aspects of your career before applying.”
