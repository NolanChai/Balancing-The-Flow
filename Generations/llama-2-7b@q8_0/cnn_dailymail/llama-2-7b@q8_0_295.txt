ville Janner on Friday morning, seizing computer equipment and other documents before removing them in plastic bags.
The move came after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to take any action against Lord Janner over a series of allegations relating to sex offences against children going back almost 40 years. A CPS spokesman said: ‘On April 12 this year, the CPS received allegations made by nine complainants that they were victims of historical abuse by Greville Janner when he was a Member of Parliament from 1970 to 1997 and Labour MP for Leicester West.
‘As with all such cases, we took great care in our consideration of the allegations made, reviewing detailed evidence submitted as part of the investigating files. ‘The CPS has meticulously analysed this complex case which has involved a significant amount of material from the police and other agencies, together with more than 100 witnesses who were interviewed under caution by detectives over many months.’
Following analysis of the evidence gathered, a number of complainants have been identified but there are insufficient grounds to proceed with charges against Lord Janner. ‘These decisions are not taken lightly and we understand that these allegations have understandably caused great concern for all those involved,’ said the spokesman.
The CPS statement comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was concerned over Lord Janner’s continued membership of his party. Speaking in a TV interview last month, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think it is right that the police and the law authorities are dealing with these matters. But I am also aware that there has been concern about what has happened in relation to this individual.’
In June 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no charges would be brought against Lord Janner over allegations he sexually abused young people while a Leicester MP between 1969 and 1985.
Leicestershire Police said today: ‘Following an ongoing investigation into the alleged offences of children’s homes, two men were arrested yesterday on suspicion of indecent assault and indecency with a child under 16. One man has since been released without charge.’ The force said it was assisting the National Crime Agency (NCA) in its probe into allegations made against Lord Janner by seven men.
It added: ‘An officer from the NCA is liaising with Leicestershire Police regarding information received to assist our investigation and will make contact with those involved. We cannot comment further at this stage.’
