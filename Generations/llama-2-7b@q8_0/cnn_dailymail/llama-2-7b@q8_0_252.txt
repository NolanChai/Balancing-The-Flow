ng to scare the bejesus out of audiences. But now that every film is likely to contain at least one shocking moment it can sometimes seem like a challenge just to find a movie that doesn't have something hideous in store for us.
But even horror movies need their time, and perhaps we are reaching a saturation point on bloodshed and bogeymen - after all, there's only so many ways you can be gutted before it begins to look like fun rather than frightening.
But the scary films have never been more popular in Britain, as a host of new releases make their way to cinemas this weekend. There are vampires (Brimstone), demons (The Devil's Carnival) and a killer clown (Clown). We also get to meet the worst thing to happen on Earth since mankind itself - an alien invasion in Oblivion.
To mark these scary movies, Radio Times has put together a guide of where you can catch each film for free over the weekend. It's your chance to see whether there are any really worth seeing - or just to stay up late and scare yourself silly on the TV. Here they are:
1. The Devil's Carnival (2013) 8.45pm, ITV3
The sequel to the Devil's Rejects, which was a bit too gory even for Rob Zombie, this film sees the director back in his horror groove as he tells of the sinners sent to hell and their struggle for survival. If you want your scares with added music, then here it is.
2. Clown (2014) 9pm, ITV2
Pennywise could be jealous - but this is a horror movie about clowns that stars Christopher Lloyd as a father who turns into one after being bitten by an evil spirit during a children's party. If you like your scary movies with added comedy then this might just make the grade - and if you don't, it might still be worth watching for Lloyd's performance alone.
3. Oblivion (2013) 7pm, BBC One
The latest from director Joseph Kosinski - who also made Tron: Legacy - this sci-fi thriller is set in the future where Jack Harper is one of a few people charged with protecting Earth as it's been invaded by aliens. The plot thickens when he discovers that he has a connection to the enemy and soon becomes part of the battle for planetary survival. If you liked Moon or Alien, then this might be up your street.
4. Brimstone (2016) 8pm, Channel 5
Dakota Fanning takes on the role of Liz, a young woman accused of witchcraft who is sentenced to hang after she becomes pregnant by the devil's son. She is then saved from death at the last minute and offered an impossible choice - kill her baby or live happily ever after with the man she loves. But that isn't all, as Liz will also have a fight on her hands to protect her newborn child against an army of demons sent by Satan himself to take him away from her forever. If you like your horror movies with a heavy dose of religion then this could be for you.
