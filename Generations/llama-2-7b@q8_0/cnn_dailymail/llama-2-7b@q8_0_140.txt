1-1 at Anfield with an unstoppable shot on Wednesday.
Coutinho had earlier given Liverpool the lead in first half stoppage time, and a late equaliser from Leon Best saved Rovers’ season from certain defeat. Henderson made it 2-1 in extra time, as Liverpool reached the last four for the first time since 2008, when they won the trophy under Rafael Benitez.
“We were very disappointed after conceding a goal with five minutes to go,” Coutinho told BT Sport. “Jordan Henderson had just come on and we knew he was going to make something happen. The goal gave us confidence, because I think in extra time the game will always be open.
“It’s a great feeling to score at Anfield,” said Henderson, who had been playing alongside Coutinho after coming off the bench. “It shows what this club is about.” Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish said of his team: “I think they’re still very young in terms of their footballing knowledge and experience.
“But they have a fantastic attitude and that is so important because they give everything they possibly can to the game. The more they learn, the better they will become as footballers.” After Blackburn’s Best had given them hope with his goal, Liverpool held on in extra time to make it four FA Cup semi-final appearances under Dalglish and 10 overall since he returned for a second spell in charge last January.
Coutinho became the first Brazilian player to score at Anfield after Pele in 1965 but admitted: “I was very nervous, because I’d never scored at Anfield before.” Liverpool were playing Blackburn for the sixth time this season and for the third year running they went on to win promotion.
After a goalless first half, Liverpool’s Andy Carroll had a header cleared off the line by David Dunn early in the second period before Coutinho put them ahead with his 20th-minute strike from inside the area after he had been set up by Henderson.
Best equalised five minutes from time when his shot from outside the area took a wicked deflection off Martin Skrtel to wrongfoot Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina. “It was a good team performance, but we have to do better in games like this,” said Blackburn manager Steve Kean.
“The first-half was not as good as we would have wanted, but I think the reaction from the lads after the break was great.” Liverpool will be away for their semi against Aston Villa on April 15 at Wembley Stadium, where they won the final in 2006 under Benitez.
Blackburn had reached this stage for the first time since winning the trophy in 1928 with a 2-1 victory over Huddersfield Town. The Lancashire side were also in the last four of the FA Cup for the ninth season in 10 years under Kean, who replaced Sam Allardyce as manager in December.
