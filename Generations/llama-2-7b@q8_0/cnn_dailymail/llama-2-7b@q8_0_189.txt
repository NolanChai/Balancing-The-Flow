c life of slavery as sex workers.
The New York Times reports that Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty on multiple counts of human trafficking and racketeering. He faces up to life in prison.
Vass is accused of forcing men into the sex trade by offering them work visas under false pretenses. Once they were in New York City, he threatened the young men with violence if they tried to escape.
The NYT reports that Vass was convicted after a three-month trial in federal court in Brooklyn. He is expected to be sentenced next month.
In 2016 alone, police arrested Vass for allegedly pimping out seven men; he had been accused of running two brothels. His victims were young and poor gay men from Eastern Europe who thought they would find better paying jobs in the U.S. but instead found themselves working as slaves with little or no money to send home, forced to work long hours in squalid conditions for a pimp named “Big Mike.”

Those who did try and escape were beaten. If they didn’t make enough money, their wages would be docked to pay off debts from the flights that brought them here or for their room and board.
According to court testimony Vass also “repeatedly” beat a man with an iron bar in 2016, leaving him covered in bruises, according to The Guardian. In addition, he threatened several men by saying, “If I catch you trying to escape, I will kill you.”
The Times reports that when prosecutors called Vass’s former clients to the stand, one said: “When I came over here, I was a free person, but now I feel like a slave in America.” Another said: “It is like being on another planet.”
Both men were so afraid of their pimp that they had to use aliases. Their real identities were revealed only during trial testimony. They told the court they could not afford to return home. The Times reports that one man testified he was threatened with death by his pimp if he tried to escape.
“They are beaten, starved and sexually abused in brothels across Manhattan,” said a New York police detective who investigated the case. “Their dream of coming to America is quickly replaced by living as an indentured servant.”
The Times reports that the case against Vass was unusual because he recruited his victims on the street, luring them in with offers of legitimate work or visas if they paid a fee and agreed to engage in sexual acts for money. He charged up to $180 per visit for sex with men who were already working as escorts but wanted more customers.
Vass faces up to life behind bars when he is sentenced next month.
