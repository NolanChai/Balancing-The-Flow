I think we're going to be busy this weekend , so it would be better if we do not meet up in person. 

 Sorry, but I can't come with you. 

 What about meeting on Saturday ? 

 How about having a party at my place on Friday? 

 Thanks for asking me to the concert! That sounds really fun ! 

 The concert is tomorrow , right? 

 Do you want to hang out on Wednesday night?
