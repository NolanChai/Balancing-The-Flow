Well , he was born after you left for America . 

 He is a big fan of yours , you know ? 

 Really ? 

 Yeah , he has been following your career from the beginning and has even tried to write his own poetry. 

 Really ? 

 Oh, yes ! I don't think it's that good but still .

 That is nice of him . 

 Yes, isn't it? He lives in France now. Do you know Paris ? 

Yes , I do . 

 Nice place , right ? 

 Of course ,it's wonderful ! Have you ever visited the Louvre ? 

I have . 

 Wow! So, you have seen the Mona Lisa . 

Yeah .

 I wish I had time to see it again. 

 Me too. Do you know the story behind it? 

 No , not really. 

 It's a very interesting one . 

 Really ? Can you tell me about it ? 

 Sure ! In short , she was a famous courtesan at that time, and Leonardo painted her portrait as part of a deal . 

 A deal? 

 Yes! She promised to sleep with him so he painted her . 

Oh wow! 

 I know right ? But that's not all . When she died , someone stole the painting from her grave and sold it to King Francois ! 

Woah ! 

Yeah, pretty amazing huh? 

It is . 

 It's strange though because I always thought of her as being very sad. 

I think she was . 

 But the story says she was a happy woman ? 

Yes . 

 You know , it's quite possible that they were lying about her and painting the truth on her face . Maybe she wasn't so happy after all ? 

 I don't know . I've never thought of it like that before. 

 Well, I guess you can visit the Louvre anytime. You won't have to wait for your family now ! 

 Oh yeah , I forgot about that . 

 Yeah, they're coming back soon right ? 

 I guess so . 

 So how long will you be in Paris ? 

 Only a couple of weeks this time. Then we're heading to Belgium . 

 Oh , well then I won't see you there ! 

 Ah , I'm sorry for that . But I have another friend who lives in Amsterdam so maybe we can get together while you're there ? 

 Great idea ! 

 Cool ! 

 By the way, my brother's coming back too . He hasn't seen you since he was little , do you still remember him? 

 No , but I bet it will be good to see him again. 

 Oh , and if you have time during your stay in Belgium maybe we could get together for a coffee or something ? 

I think that's a great idea ! 

Okay then . 

 Okay, I guess that's all for now . Thanks for talking to me. 

Sure , it was my pleasure . 

Take care and have a good day! 

 Bye!

With the family of course ! 

 What will you do when everyone arrives ? 

 We'll probably spend our time at home and visit some friends as well . I hope we get to see a lot of you too . 

 How long are they staying for ? 

 I think about three weeks , but it might be longer if they like it here . They will stay in the hotel though - not with us. 

 What will you do when they leave ? 

 I don't know yet . I have to decide that later ! But maybe we can go on a trip somewhere together as well .

No, he has two sons and I guess that's why he wants to move to New Zealand , it's cheaper there ! 

 Cheap or expensive doesn't really matter if the country is full of people. 

 Oh yes, that's true . But , anyway , I have a brother too, but he is older than me and lives in Canada with his wife . He has two sons and three daughters . One of his daughters is coming over to visit us next year . 

 Does your sister live nearby ? 

 No she doesn't. She lives far away so it will be very expensive for her to travel here . But she is planning a trip anyway in the future , I think she wants to see my new house and my children . 

 What about your parents ? Do you have any plans to visit them next year ? 

 Yes , we are planning to go to Italy this summer . My wife's family lives there so it will be nice for us to meet them again . 

 Is she Italian? 

 No, she is from here in England. Her father moved to London when he was a young man and her mother followed him later on . 

 Wow , how long ago did they move here ? 

 They arrived twenty years ago . My wife has a sister who lives near Paris too . I think we will visit her next summer as well . 

 How often do you get to see your in-laws? 

 Well, not very often really , I only see them once or twice a year. But I guess they are quite busy because they have a lot of work and they live far away. They have a farm where they grow vegetables . 

 Is she from the countryside ? 

 Yes , her parents still live there . And that's why it is so expensive for my sister to visit us here in London. She has to take the train or bus all the way to Paris first, and then a flight to London and she always stays with me because I live quite close to where they work on their farm. 

 Do you ever go there ? 

 Yes , sometimes we do , but not often because it takes so much time . But it's good for the children , they can see how food is grown and they have some fun too !

Oh yes , they are . They say that the whole family is coming on the plane with us but I don't think that will happen. 

 Why not ? 

 Because my sister and her two children live in the States so we won't be able to take them both at once . We have decided to visit them after a few years , when their youngest child starts school here .

Probably next week . My brother will come with them but his son will arrive a few days later . He wants to be sure he gets a place in the university of his choice . 

 Is there any place you would rather that your brother or sister visit while they are here ? 

 I think my mother would really like to see London , especially Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace , so she might go there with my daughter and I will show my parents around other parts of the country . 

 Good idea ! Will you be able to do that ? 

 I hope so but we will have to wait until they are here before we can decide when to go where . 

 When is your brother's son arriving in England? 

 He should arrive around 26th July. 

 And your parents and sister-in-law ? 

 They should be here by the end of June . 

 Did you say your daughter will visit London too? 

 Yes, she wants to see her cousins in London as well . 

 Are they still young children or are they teenagers? 

 The older one is at high school and the younger one is only nine . 

 I know , so it's a good time for them to visit each other. 

 Oh yes, and it will be great fun for all of us too !
