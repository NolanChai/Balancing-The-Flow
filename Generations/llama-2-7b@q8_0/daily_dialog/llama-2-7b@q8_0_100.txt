" With his wife and their daughter. They are already there . "

" No , there are three sons and two daughters . There must be 10 grandchildren altogether . "

" Wow , that's quite an age gap between you ! "

" Yes , I think the eldest son is about 23 years older than me . I am the second last child. My youngest sister was born when my father had already gone back to work after being on leave for several months . "

" Yes . He was born in New Zealand so they haven't seen him yet . They are going to visit us first and then we will all go together . "

" Will you be staying in England for a long time ? "

" No , I don't think so . We will stay about six months and then we will be going back to New Zealand . But we may come here again some other time . "

" In about 3 weeks time . The flight is leaving on a Sunday afternoon so we will pick them up at the airport . I think my parents are staying for two weeks , maybe three . And then I'll take my brother to a few universities in England and Scotland as well before he goes home again . "

" That sounds like fun . "

" Yes , it is nice to be able to spend time together with all your family . "
