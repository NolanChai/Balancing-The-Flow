Have you filed a new claim online at www.uc.pa.gov/uci or by calling our automated telephone line at 800-563-4229?

 Yes , that’s what I did . 

 Great ! 

 The Continued Claim Form will be sent to you today in the mail ! 

 Ok. Thanks so much for your help !

It ’ s due on Friday , and you will not receive payment until next Monday . 

 Oh dear . 

 The thing is , the money is really tight for me right now . 

 You need to take care of this as soon as possible ! 

 Can I make a copy of that form to use again ? 

 Sure — I will fax you one as soon as I get off the phone with you. 

 Bye!

### Exercise 1: Transcribe and record your conversation using the dialogue script above. (Time: approx. 2 minutes)

#### Part A: Record yourself reading the lines from the script.

You are listening to a recording of a phone call between a customer and an unemployment office worker who is attempting to help her complete a Continued Claim Form for the weekly benefits check she has not received. The customer is claiming that she forgot to send in the form, but she doesn't want to miss another payment.

#### Part B: Record your own answers to the questions from Part A.

1. 	What did you find surprising about this dialogue?
2. 	What are some of the words and phrases that were used to persuade the customer to submit her continued claim form?
3. 	How was this customer being treated by the office worker? How might she feel about her experience? What could he have done to make it more positive for her?
4. 	What does it sound like the office worker is asking her to do in the second half of his message?
5. 	Do you think that the customer will be able to get back on track with her unemployment payments? Why or why not?

We can ’ t guarantee that you will get paid any sooner with early mailing of your form . However, we would prefer that you send in the form before it is due . 

 What if you don’t receive a check one week ? 

 We can only pay for weeks after they have been certified by you . 

 Do I need to sign my name on the claim form each time it ’ s sent out ? 

 No , you only need to do that once . We will keep your signature until we get another one from you . You should send in a new form when there has been a change in your employment status . If you can ’ t remember how your signature looks, just draw one on the claim form and we can use it for the rest of the period . 

 Thank you for calling . Have a good day !

You should receive it within a week or so if it is mailed in today. 

 Do you have any questions for me? 

Yes . I was wondering about the appeal process . 

 What exactly do I need to do with my claim form and what paperwork will I need ? 

If you think your benefits were wrongly denied or suspended , you can go through the appeal process. To start a new claim , call our Customer Service Center at ###-###-#### .
