" It won ’ t make any difference . "

" Will it cost me anything to have the unemployment checks sent to my home address instead of to my work place ? "

" No. We will reimburse you for the postage and handling if you send us an address change form. "

" Can I use that same form for another reason, such as a new mailing address or phone number ? "

" Yes . You can use it for any changes you need to make with your unemployment account. "

" What if I don ’ t know what kind of car I drive ? "

" All that you have to do is tell me the year, make and model . "

" But there are a lot of cars with those same characteristics ! "

" We can help you find out from our computer database. "

" What if my car is not listed in your computer system ? "

" I don ’ t understand what that has to do with anything ! "

" If we know what kind of car you have, then we will be able to tell you the right price for a replacement battery . "

" Oh . OK . Fine . "

" Is there anything else I can do for you today ? "

" No. That is all I needed to know ! Thank you! Goodbye."

" You can send it to us early every week ! "

" Well, where do I send it ? "

" The address is on the form itself . "

" How long does it take for you to get my claim form when I mail it in ? "

" It depends on how quickly we are getting your payments in and how quickly we can get them out of our system ; but, typically , we process that within 30 days . "

" I had another question about the Continued Claim Form. "

" You can mail it back to us any time you want to ! "

" Well, when should I send in my form ? "

" We don ’ t like to see people wait until they are right on top of a deadline . It is always better to get it done ahead of the deadline . "

" But how do I know if there was anything wrong with the previous check ? "

" You can call us and we will let you know what happened with your last claim . "

" Well, did my payment go out this week ? "

" We have not issued any payments for last week ’ s period yet ! "

" But I was at the unemployment office last Monday . "

" You can only come into our office when you are supposed to get your payment and we aren ’ t making those payments until this coming Monday . "

" I don ’ t think it will be very smart to come in on Monday . Will it ? "

" Well, if you want to come by then, that is certainly okay. But remember — our office will only be open during business hours ! "

" This is all very confusing to me ! "

" We do our best to help people understand the process of collecting unemployment . "

" Not necessarily , because we need to process that claim form before any unemployment benefits can be issued . We may not know if you qualify for this payment until next week. "

" Is there anything I can do? "

" You can always call back on Friday evening after 5:30 p.m. or Saturday between noon and 1:00 p.m. to see about the status of your claim . "

" Can I come in and file my form with you ? "

" No , but we are able to give you a list of drop boxes where you can take your unemployment forms if they need to be submitted more quickly than by mail or fax. Just call 1-800-582-4169 for the location closest to you . "

" Why is it taking so long? I never had any problems before! "

" That ’ s unfortunate , but this situation has put us in a very difficult position and we are doing our best under extremely trying circumstances. We appreciate your patience during these challenging times. "
