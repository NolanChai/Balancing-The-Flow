" Wake up! It's Monday and it's time to go work ! "

" Why do we need to spend half of our lives working ? "

" Because people need money . "

" But why do they need money in the first place ? They can get enough food for living. And what else do you think is important ? "

" I don't know . You can ask someone who knows more about it . "

" Why do we need to study so hard and work so long? "

" To make money and have a better life than others . "

" But what if some people just want a simpler life ? Like having a job they like or doing what they are good at. They don't care about making more money."

" It is not right to live that way, though you can choose what you want to do . "

" Why? "

" You should work for the people and help others when you have the chance . Otherwise, you would just be selfish. "

" I agree with you . But there are still some people who don't care about helping others."

" How could they not? They should think that life is a precious gift given by God , so it is necessary for them to do something for other people."

" Don't worry , there are a lot of websites with helpful information . Just look them up on the internet . "

" I understand what you mean . "

" See ya then ! Bye . "

" Oh ! I don't want to go back home anymore . It's so boring there . "

" You just came back from your holiday . Don't you love being at home with our family ? "

" My mother-in-law is very annoying . She always gives me a hard time for no reason . "

" Maybe you should discuss this problem with her and tell her how you feel about her . "

" I don't want to talk to her any more . Everytime I do , it becomes worse and she makes my life miserable . "

" If you don't, she might misunderstand your intentions . "

" Anyway , let's go out for dinner . Let's make it fun ! "

" I can't stand this job anymore ! It's not fun and it has no future at all . "

" Are you tired of doing your same old routine work everyday ? "

" Yes . But my boss is always watching over me to make sure that I do things right . He never leaves me alone . "

" Just tell him that you'd like some time off for a while . Maybe he will agree with this idea and give you some vacation . "

" What if he doesn't ? "

" In that case, just look for another job or start your own business . "

" I am thinking about it . Thanks . "

" Don't worry , my company will pay for the whole course fee and the accommodation expenses . So you just need to go to that place in China. It's just ten thousand kilometers away from here ."

" Ten thousand kilometers ? I don't think it is a good idea to travel so far away . "

" Maybe we should stay there for three months and try our best to learn something new . "

" You know , my wife doesn't want me to go to China again . "

" That's no problem , I'll take care of it for you. Just relax yourself in a hotel that is very luxurious . "

" I think you are making fun of me . "

" No, I'm not . What about it ? "

" Well , let me talk to my wife about this first . Then I will contact you if she agrees . "

" I hope you can take my advice . "

### ACTIVITY 3.
#### TASK 1

**Question 1 :** What do you think about the young people nowadays? Do they lack in skills or are they more independent than we were when we were their age? Why/why not?

**Answer:** In my opinion, nowadays young people have higher education level. They are much smarter than us when we were their age. Therefore I think that the young people today do not lack in skills or independent.

**Question 2 :** What advice would you give to young people who want to learn a foreign language? Where should they study, and what could they do outside of class to improve their language proficiency?

**Answer:** The first thing that I will suggest is choosing the best course from the wide range of courses. This means that we can learn basic knowledge or even advanced knowledge on the same subject according to our desire. Secondly, if young people want to practice what they have learned in class outside of class, then they should go online and practise grammar, vocabulary and listening skill. It will be much easier for them to improve their language proficiency.

#### TASK 2:

**Question 3 :** In what ways could people who want a change in their career benefit from taking a training course? What are the advantages of taking part in such a course?

**Answer:** I think that people can gain more knowledge and skills from attending the training courses. Moreover, it will help us to learn new things related to our desired career which we might not know about before. Moreover, these training courses will provide an opportunity for people to meet other participants who have the same goal in life as them.

**Question 4 :** What types of person should go on a training course? Who would benefit most from doing so? Why/why not?

**Answer:** I believe that everyone should attend such courses because it will help you learn new things about your desired career. However, I do think that the people who want to change their careers or those who are thinking of taking a different job path would benefit most from doing so . For example , if they want to be an accountant but don’t know much about how this type of work is done , then attending one will give them insight into what it really means and whether or not this profession suits their needs .

#### TASK 3:

**Question 1 :** Do you think that we should learn as many new skills as possible? Why/why not?

**Answer:** I am an advocate of learning new skills. We have to keep up with the technological advances in the world so that we can be more successful and efficient . In addition , if there are any changes in our jobs or career paths then we should always take advantage of this opportunity by learning new things from online courses or training sessions organized by our company .

**Question 2 :** What is one thing you've learned recently? Why do you think it was useful to learn that particular skill/fact/piece of information?

**Answer:** I have been trying to improve my Spanish language skills and I can say with confidence that learning a foreign language has opened up new opportunities for me . This is because now people are more likely to hire someone who speaks an additional language than someone whose only skillset consists of being fluent in their native tongue.
