I've been working for this company for a year now, and all the time , I'm always dealing with numbers. It's tiring me out, because it doesn't use my creativity at all . 

 What do you want to do ? 

 I would like to work in a field that I can be more free with . I really want to learn something new and change the environment around me . 

 I don't know what exactly , but it's not counting numbers any more. I just can't take it anymore . 

 What do you think ? Is this a good idea for changing your life? Or you should stay at work and be patient to learn everything that they taught you in college? 

 I don't know , maybe I am just tired of doing the same thing every day. And I think I can change my career by studying something else . What do you think ? Do you have an idea for me ?

Yes , but you are very good at doing your job and people respect your working attitude . 

 I know that but I have to do more than just a repetitive counting for money only . What's wrong with me , I am too greedy , right ? 

 No , it is not like that. You should be happy of what you are doing . 

 But I can't . I want something different . Something more fun . Something more exciting . 

 OK , so let's find out something else to do for a change . Let us talk about this again later . 

 Sure .

We can try something else if we can not do it any more . 

 I don't know why you keep saying ' if ' instead of ' when ' . Anyway , I have been working there for a long time and I don't think this is the right job for me . I will try my best to find another one which suits with me better . 

 Maybe we should take it easy now . You should not feel worried about it any more . We can go out together later ? 

 Sure , I will come soon . Bye, bye !

Don't you like our company ? 

 Yes , it's a nice place to work in . But there're only a few people that I can communicate with . 

 Is your boss unfriendly to you or something ? 

 No , he is very kind of me . He always gives me a lot of responsibilities for my development as an employee . I am just tired of it . 

 Do you want to change the company ? 

 I don't know , maybe . But if that doesn't help me feel better then I can try anything in life . 

 So how do you think we should get through this problem ? 

 Let's talk more about it and see what will happen.

How about joining a club , reading novels or traveling ? 

 Oh no ! It doesn't work for me . 

 What should I do ? I feel so exhausted in my daily life . 

 We need to take care of ourselves , and we also need to find time for relaxation . 

 Okay . I will try to take a rest . And then maybe you can teach me something about my career .

I think there are free courses online . And they have certificates too . So you can upgrade your skills . 

 You are right . The most important thing is we can gain some new knowledge and make our life interesting .
