" Exactly . Anyway , since I have been here, I've learned that no matter where you go in China , there is always something special about it . For example, there are lots of things we don't have at home . "

" Like what ? "

" Well, for one thing, Chinese food is different from Indian or western food . There is a lot of seafood . It's not all chicken and meat . "

" But that's nothing special, isn't it ? "

" Well, yes . But then there's the tea. In China they use the leaves for making green , red and white teas. The best ones are expensive . I like to drink Chinese tea . It tastes different from other kinds of tea. It's also better for you, and you feel more energetic after a cup. "

" What about Chinese medicines ? "

" Oh , yeah . That is something else we don't have at home. I go to my gym every day, but that doesn't seem to keep me fit enough. There are many people here who take medication as part of their daily dietary regime . I think it would do me good if I started taking some Chinese herbs and pills as well . "

" And what about the Chinese New Year ? Isn't that special ? "

" Of course ! It's the most important festival in China . There are lots of different rituals and ceremonies. People dress up, go to temple, have family meals ... "

" Do you like it when people give you presents on New Year's Day ? "

" Oh yeah , that is something I really enjoy. This year my parents got us a car ! That was the best present we could ever receive . "

" Cool ! You must have been excited . "

" Oh, yes ! I've always wanted to have a car . We used to take the bus everywhere before. It took a long time and it was expensive. Now everything is so close by ! "

" So you really like living in Guangzhou ? "

" Yes , definitely ! "

" Why do you think that ? "

" I'm enjoying myself here. The people are friendly, the food is good, and it's a lot cheaper than London . "

" Do you ever miss home ? "

" No , not really . It was difficult at first, but now everything seems natural to me. I think my Chinese friends understand me better than anyone else in the world."

"I know what you mean. They are so friendly and hospitable . "

" Yes . People always ask if I'm doing ok. If I want any help with anything , they are willing to do it for me. My Chinese teachers are nice too. They try hard to explain things in English, but I think sometimes it's difficult for them because they don't know the language well enough."

"Yes . I suppose that must be very frustrating for both of us."

"Well , it is a bit challenging . "

"Are you getting more confident ? "

" Oh yeah ! Definitely. Now when I go to the supermarket, I know what foods are cheap and which ones are expensive. Sometimes people in front of me can't speak Chinese , so they start speaking English to each other. But I don't understand a word! So if someone asks me something or needs help with anything, I'm happy to help . "
"That must feel great ! Do you ever think about coming back home ? "

" Not really . Why would I want to leave this wonderful place ? Besides , my friends and family miss me here in Guangzhou too. They can't wait for me to come home again . "

" Well , maybe you are right . But I can tell you , I couldn ’ t understand a word of what they were saying . It was all overwhelming Chinese noise to me . And then my girlfriend started talking in English , and after that I understood everything . "

" You mean , when she switched to English, you could follow the conversation ? "

" Yeah , exactly . Well, actually she spoke some broken English first. But then, she got it all sorted out with this other sales clerk . She even managed to get the price of that mobile phone down by a third ! "

" Wow ! I didn ’ t know that was possible . "

" Yeah , and my girlfriend can still talk to anybody about anything in Chinese now. It wasn ’ t always so easy for her when we started going out together, you know ? She used to stutter and stumble around, even on the most basic things like how much she wanted something. Now she talks like a native . "

" So , what do you think is the reason that your girlfriend learned Chinese faster than you did ? "

" Well, I ’ m no expert on the subject. But one thing ’ s for sure : when you love someone, you will learn to understand them . My girlfriend loved me . She wanted me to understand her . So , she took time and effort to teach me about herself in Chinese . It was very important to her that we had a good understanding of each other . "

" I see what you mean . So you think the main reason that your girlfriend learned Chinese faster than you did is because she loved you ? "

" Well , it must have helped . But then again, it wasn ’ t just my girlfriend who wanted me to understand her better. It was everybody around me. My parents too . They wanted me to fit into their society as much as possible . "

" I see . You mean you didn ’ t know Chinese before ? "

" Yeah , pretty much . The first time I went to China with my girlfriend, everything that we ate and drank was in English. Our waiters all spoke English . Even the people in the marketplace could understand us when we asked directions or what they were selling. It wasn ’ t until later on, after our trip together , that I started learning Chinese . "

" How did your parents react to you taking time away from school to learn Chinese ? "

" Well , they didn ’ t like it at first . I mean, my parents really wanted me to get a good education and finish college. They even said so when I was going off to university . But now that I have finished university and can speak Chinese very well, they don ’ t mind so much . "

" So , you think that the main reason you learned Chinese is because your parents want you to be able to fit into their society ? "

" Well , maybe it was part of it. But there are a lot more reasons why I started learning Chinese in the first place . Besides, my girlfriend still wants me to learn and she says that I ’ m doing good . I guess I must be doing pretty good if she doesn ’ t want to teach me anymore . "

" So , what do you think is your main reason for wanting to learn Chinese ? "

" Well , like I said before, my girlfriend loves me and wants me to understand her better. That ’ s one of the reasons . Another thing is that it ’ s easier to make friends here when you can speak their language . My English isn ’ t very good and sometimes it takes me a long time to explain things in Chinese that I could say in just a few words in English. The other day, for example , I was trying to ask a taxi driver about the price of our ride , but he didn ’ t understand what I wanted . We couldn ’ t even agree on a price and when I finally got back home my girlfriend told me she had a fight with the taxi driver all because he couldn ’ t speak English and I couldn ’ t speak Chinese ! "

" So, you think that the main reason you are learning Chinese is so you can make more friends here in China ? "

" Well , actually I don ’ t care so much about making friends with people who only speak one language . I mean, they might be very friendly but it won ’ t last if you can ’ t really communicate. It’s not like we are going to be living here forever and I can ’ t wait for the day when my girlfriend and I can actually talk in Chinese together ! "

" So , what do you think is your main reason for learning Chinese ? "

" Well, there ’ s a lot more . But basically, I guess it’s so that I don ’ t have to worry about how to communicate with people who speak only English all the time. It doesn’t matter where we go or what we do, my girlfriend will always understand me now and I will be able to understand her too ! "

" So , you think your main reason for learning Chinese is so that you can have a good relationship with your girlfriend ? "

" Yeah . That ’ s it. "

" How can that be ? The sales clerk was screaming and shouting , while my girlfriend was standing there calmly . I couldn ’ t believe what I was seeing . "

" Well, don ’ t worry about it. You ’ ll get used to it when you live here for a few years. After all, you are in China now ! "

" But why is that ? Why do the Chinese do these things ? I don ’ t understand it . "

" Well, let me think. I suppose , Chinese like shouting and screaming ; it shows how angry they feel . "

" No , no , no . That is not what happened at all ! They didn ’ t want to be angry . There was a lot of tension in the room, but that was just because they wanted to finish the negotiation as quickly as possible . The sales clerk was shouting and screaming out loud because he needed to get his point across . "

" I don ’ t understand what you mean ! What were you saying about it being a violent fight ? That is not true at all. And you said that Chinese people like to bargain ! If they didn ’ t want to be angry , then why did the sales clerk shout and scream? "

" He was trying to get his point across as quickly as possible . What he wanted to say was this : ’ You can only have this mobile phone for this price ’ . That is what he said. But you know, my English isn ’ t that great so I don ’ t understand everything right away . "

" Oh , yes ; but how did it end up ? Didn ’ t they agree with one another in the end ? "

" Yes! The sales clerk agreed to sell me the phone for this price ! He gave my girlfriend a look as if he were telling her that she had done really well . Then, the two of them left together. That was when I realized that it hadn ’ t been a fight at all. It just looked like one from where I was standing . "

" But then, what on earth were you so angry about ? Why were you shouting and screaming ? "

" Ah ! You have got me there ! Now the joke is on me ! As I said before , my English isn ’ t that great. I just didn ’ t understand them . That ’ s why it seemed as if they were fighting . "

I don ’ t know. Maybe I should have got a little more information beforehand, but I think I was being impatient and jumping into things too quickly.
