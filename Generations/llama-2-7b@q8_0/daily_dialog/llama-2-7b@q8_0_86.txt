Better than when i arrived yes . I think my chinese is pretty good now actually . 

 Why do u ask ? 

 I want to make sure. I am going to give the two of you a test to see if your language level is sufficient for our next project . 

 Great . I've been looking forward to it ! 

 Let me explain what will happen in more detail later this afternoon . I have another meeting at ten . 

 See you then. Bye.

Well , I've been learning for four months now and it has been interesting . But there are still things which I don't understand.  

 For example, sometimes when you meet people they just say hello, then turn around and walk off ? 

 Yeah , that is weird isn't it ?  

 In my country people greet each other first and then talk . It always makes me feel a bit uncomfortable when someone does otherwise. I know what it means but I still find it a bit strange . 

 Well, most Chinese do the same as you do in your country - they say hello first before speaking to one another. But there are some Chinese people who don't do this . They just say "hello" and walk away immediately after greeting. It happens very often. I think it's because they find it rude if someone doesn't reply when they talk to them. 

 Oh , that makes sense . It is a little bit rude , isn't it ?  

 Yeah, I suppose so . But I just want to ask you something else . Do Chinese people ever say "goodbye" like we do ? 

 Yeah , some of them do say goodbye. They may also use this phrase when they are leaving a restaurant or café after eating lunch or dinner together. It's the same as what you say in your country, I think .  

 Oh , that's interesting . In my opinion , Chinese people are very polite. 

 Yeah , definitely !

You don ’ t have to . I heard this kind of thing in China many times before . It was very common at the start of my stay here , because it is still a relatively new experience for me . But now , after four months , I am starting to understand their tone . The bargaining can be a lot of fun . 

 Yes , but I bet you would not want to be caught in that situation without knowing Chinese well enough to understand what they were saying . 

 Yeah . That ’ s true . But you know , the thing about China is that many Chinese people don ’ t speak English at all and it can seem like a challenge sometimes , because of their tone . I mean , they are just using normal conversation to express their intentions or opinions but it seems very violent to me because I can ’ t understand what they are saying . 

 Yeah . It is very difficult to understand people from other countries when you don ’ t speak the same language . That is why we should learn foreign languages better at school . 

 Okay , that is true too . But one thing for sure is that Chinese people like to express themselves in a variety of ways and they aren ’ t afraid to show it either . For example , the other day, I was walking down the street and I saw two men arguing with each other . They were just saying whatever they wanted without any regard for who might be around them . 

 Yeah . I think Chinese people are more direct than us . 

 That ’ s right ! Chinese people can be very aggressive when they want to get something done but the best thing is that once you understand their tone , then it doesn ’ t seem so bad at all . The next time you visit China, try to learn some phrases in advance and then you will see what I mean ! 

 Okay , thank you for your advice . Now let ’ s go find our friends for lunch .

Well , if you don ’ t believe me , then maybe I can give you another example . One day, when we were visiting some relatives in Hangzhou , my friend and I went out for a walk with two of his cousins. We decided to take a boat ride on the river . While waiting for our turn , 

 The conversation was so fast that they didn ’ t notice what we were saying . They seemed to be arguing about something very urgent, but they were laughing and talking at the same time . We didn ’ t understand them either . So my friend and I just stood there looking at them as if we were aliens from another planet .
