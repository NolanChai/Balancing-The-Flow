Well , yeah ! It's not only the biggest city but also one of the most densely populated cities in the world . As for the traffic problem , it is mainly caused by the large amount of automobiles rather than people . If you take a look at the city map , you can find that the road system in this city is quite well designed and arranged so that car drivers don't need to go around. The average speed on the highways in Shanghai is 60 kilometers per hour (40 mph) . And it would cost about a hundred dollars for renting a small car for three days , which is not cheap but quite affordable . But if you want to see this city on foot, that's another story !
