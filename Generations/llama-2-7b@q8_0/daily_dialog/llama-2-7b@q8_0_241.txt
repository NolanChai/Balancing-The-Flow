stayed home to look after her . 

 Are your parents aware of the situation ? 

 Yes . They know everything about me . 

 Do they approve or disapprove of your behavior ? 

 They are always by our side and we respect their decision . 

 Do you think that you'll be punished for being late ? 

 I don't know , I hope not but the truth is I am really worried . 

 What if they send me to a military school ? 

 Well , as far as I can remember in such schools you have no freedom . You are supposed to follow all rules and regulations of the establishment, otherwise there will be some severe punishment. 

 Well, that's my dilemma , sir. What should I do? 

 If I were you , I would apologize to your parents. Maybe they can understand why you had to stay at home with your sister. But don't overdo it because the more you lie and make excuses the worse things will get for you . Just tell them that you really need help, that you want to change your behavior and become a better person. 

 Thank you sir , I think I'll try this way. Thank you so much! Bye!

No way ! You should be at work right now !

Yes, I know. I’ll never do this again.

I’m sorry sir , but I have no choice.

I can understand why you did it .

Yes . Well , then we're even. 

OK . 

OK. But don't do it ever again please .

Thank you, sir !

You say we have to be punctual , yet you're not even able to follow your own rules.  

 What do you think about me now ? 

 I don't care what people think of me . If I want to take time off from my job once in a while, I will. It doesn't matter what other people say or think about it .

Ok . And don't talk to me like that again . 

 Thank you for the compliment 。 

 You are welcome . 

 Excuse me sir . May I come in ? 

 Mike , you're late again . 

 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I 

 Do you think I believe the story like that ? 

 But it's true . 

 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 

 That's coincident 。 

 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 

 I promise I will . 

 Ok . And don't talk to me like that again . 

 Thank you for the compliment 。
