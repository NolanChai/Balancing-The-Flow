" But isn't it remarkable that he should not be invited more often, since he is so fond of our society? "

" I suppose so, but I do not see what that has to do with the fact. "

" I meant only this, that if he liked coming to our parties he must also have been very much pleased by your kindness in inviting him ; and yet when you had such a chance of making him really glad, you did not even speak to him, although you saw that he was looking at the ground with an uneasy expression on his face ? "

" That is true, I did not speak to him . "

" You were very ungracious . "

" I did not want to be disagreeable . "

" But why do you think that he was so uneasy in looking at the ground? What had made him uneasy? Was it that he did not know me, or what? "

" I am not sure ; but if he had been happy and light-hearted, he would not have looked like that. And besides, his face is always sad . "

" I thought so too ; and that's why I wanted to talk with him. But now you see how it was â€”you were right in being angry with me for not speaking to him. But will you tell me one thing more? Where is he ? "

" He has just gone into the room . "

" Then we shall soon be able to judge of his mood by his behavior. I have long wished to speak to him, and now it is too late . "

" Is it not better that you should have a good opportunity? "

" Yes ; but he has been so often invited here that one would think he had some other reason for being glad of an invitation than pleasure at meeting his friends. I can hardly imagine what that might be, and it is all the more important to find out now . "

" Shall I go in first? "

" Yes, do ; but say nothing about me. "

She entered the room, where he was standing by a table with his back turned toward her, while his eyes were fixed on some little objects lying there.

He heard her voice and turned round quickly; she had seen that he was so surprised to see her alone in the room, as it was not usual for any one but herself or her brother to come in unannounced. He was going up to her with outstretched hand when she stepped back a little behind the door-post, and looked at him without speaking.

She saw his eyes grow tender as he gazed at her, and then he bowed silently, with a very grave expression.

"You are here alone?" she began suddenly, in a tone that startled him. "Where is Robert? He has often been invited to these parties, but I do not know why he never comes."

She had intended to speak calmly and pleasantly; but when her words came out in such an unexpectedly sharp tone, it was too much for his weakness and he could not reply.

"I am alone," she repeated, as if asking a question. "Have you nothing to say? You know that we want you here; Robert is very fond of you."

He still did not answer ; the words seemed to choke him, for there was so much in them that he could not bear at once . But his eyes had grown still brighter and more tender.

"Why do you look at me like that?" she said again, taking a few steps nearer. "You must know why I have asked Robert to come here." She stopped again with her hand resting on the table, as if waiting for an answer. He did not move nor speak.

"I cannot understand," she went on, looking at him in astonishment.
"What is there to make you look so ? "

But he only gazed at her more steadily than before .

"I don't know why I am here alone with you; it seems strange to me myself; but Robert never comes. He has been invited to every party here, but has always found some excuse for not coming."

"Perhaps he does not like them ? " said the stranger quietly.

She turned her eyes quickly away as if something had wounded her. But she soon raised them again and looked at him inquiringly ; then a cloud seemed to pass over her face, as she grew very pale. She cast an angry glance round the room, and stepped back still farther behind the door-post.

"I don't know why I am here alone with you; but Robert never comes!" she repeated in a low voice. "No, he never comes ; that is certain." Then her eyes gleamed again brightly as they grew moist, and she added hurriedly : "He has often been invited to these parties, and this time I was glad to see that my brother had not forgotten him; but now you have told me what it means. Why did he look so uneasy when he saw us walking in the garden? Was he really unhappy about it, or only shy ? "

"I am afraid he is very much in earnest," said the stranger with a sigh.

She looked at him angrily and asked : "How can you say that he is very much in earnest, if he has often been invited to these parties without coming? "

"You must not be so angry," she heard him murmur softly ; but she would not listen to what he said. She did not even look at him as she went over quickly to the window and looked out. He was standing by her side a few minutes later, when he began speaking again in a very low tone:
"I am afraid he is very much in earnest." But then his voice became fainter still ; only once, when she turned round impatiently, did he speak quite distinctly. "It is easy to understand why Robert never comes," he said; and as he spoke the words seemed to come from her own heart.

She did not answer him for some time, and then she took no notice of his last sentence at all ; but she began to walk up and down the room in an agitated manner, while her eyes kept turning anxiously toward the door-post behind which he was standing. Suddenly she stopped in front of him with a quick movement.
"Why did you look so when we were walking together? "

He replied by a silent gesture that it was true ; but his eyes said more than any words could have done, and they filled her heart with such bitter anguish that she forgot all else for the moment. Then he came up to her and put his hand on her arm. She did not look at him or reply; but the hot tears began to roll down her cheeks.
"Why are you weeping?" he asked softly, as if speaking to a child. "Let me lead you into another room ; there is no one here." And he gently raised her hand and led her into an adjoining room, which had been arranged for guests in the evening. But she did not look at him now or give him any answer; only once she turned round suddenly with a bitter smile when they reached the door of this new room ; then she hurried away from him as if he were no longer her friend, and ran out into the passage.

CHAPTER VI.

They had been talking together for more than an hour before they heard any one coming, so that both felt very tired at last, but there was still something in their hearts which neither could speak of yet; only now and then a word slipped from one or other's lips as if by chance. "When shall we be able to talk about it?" he asked once, almost inaudibly ; but she did not answer him; so he said no more for the moment.

"I am sorry," she began at last, "that you are angry with me, because I did not speak to Robert as I ought." She paused a little and then went on: "Do you know, when we were walking in the garden, that was just what I had been thinking of doing? But I wanted first to see whether you would give me any help ; so when I saw you looking at us with such surprise, I thought it must be because Robert did not wish to go."

She said this quite gaily; but her face grew grave again as she asked suddenly: "Do you know why he does not come here? It seems strange that one should always find some excuse for not coming. But you do not know him, and so how can you understand?" She turned away from him quickly as if she did not want to hear what he would say ; but then she added, in a low tone : "You are right; I must have been very thoughtless to speak like that before Robert came into the room. But I do not know why I should be so angry with you ."

He went up and put his hand on her arm, as if he wished to say something more ; but she drew herself away quickly and said : "I think we had better go out now."

She was sitting in the carriage that took them home, but did not seem at all inclined for conversation. He tried to talk with her, but after a few words he saw that it would be useless. She looked so sad and weary; there seemed to be something wrong which he could do nothing about. At last she said suddenly : "You are
