I just want to sit outside and read a book. 

 How about we go to the zoo ? You love animals and it has been months since we went there . 

 I'd rather just read my book . 

 Okay , maybe another time then . We could see a movie or play a sport . 

 Why are you so picky ? Just do whatever you want ! 

 But that's what I am doing ! I want to read my book and you're making me go outdoors for something else . 

 Sorry . but it gets boring just sitting there all day . 

 Okay , then we could play chess or checkers ? 

 What do you think about going to the park? It might be fun. I miss our long walks!

 I'm sorry . But that's not what I want to do today .

 Why not ? 

 I'm just feeling a little bored and tired lately . Maybe we should go home for some rest now .

 Fine ! Let's go home. It'll be good to see each other again!
