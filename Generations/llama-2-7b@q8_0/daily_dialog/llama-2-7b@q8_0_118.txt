You’re a copycat! 

 That is so true. I have always wanted to wear Khakis, but I just couldn't find any that were cute enough for me .

 This pair has a different cut than the ones you are wearing and they are really comfortable , too. 

 That’s what makes them such great pants. I also got this shirt to go with it. I think we should hit the mall together. 

 Let's do !
