 It comes from Egypt. 

 How do you know that ? 

 It says so on its label. 

 And who made the fossil ? 

 It was an ancient mammal. 

 What kind of mammal was it? 

 I'm not sure but it must have been a dinosaur because all the other animals at the museum were in their cages and this one wasn't. 

 Sarah, did you go to any interesting places today ? 

Yeah , I went for a walk with my friends and we had fun on the way there.

 Yes, but I need to teach her more . 

 What does she have to learn ? 

 She needs to learn how to handle customers and use the computer better. 

 How much time does it take to become a good worker in your company? 

 At least six months of training , because most employees are young and they need to learn everything from scratch .

 Did you train her to handle calls properly ? 

 Yes , we practiced it a lot in my office . 

 What do you think about your employee's English skills? 

 Well, I'm not really sure if she'll be good at English because sometimes she makes mistakes when speaking. 

 Did you make any mistakes yourself today ? 

 No , not really . I just had to learn some new words from my boss . 

 Are there any difficulties in your work? What did happen recently, for example ? 

 Yes , there are always problems with customers and employees. Sometimes people don't like how we do things here at the company so they try to complain about us or even sue us! But I think it's important that we learn from these mistakes because it will help us improve our business in the future .
