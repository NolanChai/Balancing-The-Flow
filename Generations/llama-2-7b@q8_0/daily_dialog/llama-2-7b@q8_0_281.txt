" I thought we decided to watch TV together instead of going out tonight. Remember ? "

" Oh ! OK , then let's just hang out here at your place . "

" Sure thing , Joe . Let me get some popcorn first for us and we can start watching our movie now."

" How about a comedy , Joe ? "

" Sure ! Let's go see that movie in your neighborhood. I am sure it will be funny . "

" Have you seen this movie before ? It is one of my favorites . "

" No I haven't , Mary ! I can't wait to see it ! "

" That sounds good . Let's see if it's still playing at the movie theatre in the mall. Do you want to car pool with me and save money on gas ? "

" I don’t know yet , but let’s go check the movie times online and decide later."

" OK . I need to call my parents anyway . Bye ! "
