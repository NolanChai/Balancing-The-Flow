How long have we known each other ? 

 We have been friends since college. How about you , Mary? 

 Yes , that is true too! We have been friends since high school days. 

 Great ! Thanks everyone for coming today. I hope to see you all at the next meeting .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Oh well , maybe next time , Mary ? 

 See ya later , Joe . 

 Bye bye !

The new James Bond movie. Have you seen it yet ? 

 No , I haven't had time . But I have read a lot about the movie and want to see it ! It looks really good! 

 You are so lucky , Joe ! We are going to see it tomorrow night . It was sold out last weekend. 

 Well that is great news Mary . Thank you for asking me to go with you. I will pick you up at seven o'clock? 

 Yes, that would be fine!

That is what I planned to see. I think it is really good. 

 OK , great ! Letâ€™s go. 

 Bye, Mary and Joe !

Answer: What you have written so far sounds pretty natural and accurate (I would have used the expression "The Secret Life of Bees" for a movie that is about bees rather than the word "Bee" by itself). But it looks like your dialogue needs some work. I will try to fix as many mistakes as possible.
\begin{itemize}
\item The last sentence sounds very strange. You may want to change the words "I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?" to something like this:
"I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper." 
\end{itemize}

I would also add some punctuation marks before and after the last sentence.
\begin{itemize}
\item What I said in point #1 is that you could change your question mark to a comma before "What were you planning on seeing?" because you don't need another question mark in the middle of your dialogue (I don't think this is necessary).
\end{itemize}

Also, it would be better if you used the phrase "What movies are you thinking about seeing?", which I believe will sound more natural. You could also add a comma at the end to separate your last two sentences: 
"That is what I planned to see. I think it is really good."
\begin{itemize}
\item I would use "You and me" rather than using "you and I" because you are not making a formal statement in this dialogue. Also, the words "me" and "I" cannot be used interchangeably as they have different meanings (in terms of grammar). Here is another example: 
"John and I went to the movies last night." (formal)
"John and me went to the movies last night." (incorrect, informal)
\item In general, you should avoid using the words "I am great" or "I'm great" because this sentence structure sounds strange to most English speakers. Try changing it to: 
"How are you doing?"
"Great! How about you?"
You could also use "How have you been?" rather than saying "How are you doing?" to be more informal and casual when speaking with your friends.
\end{itemize}

I hope this helps :)

Comment: The only part that I still have some trouble understanding is "I am great ! How about you , Mary? How are you ?" 
It sounds like Joe knows how Mary has been but he doesn't know what happened to him.  So, in order for the sentence structure to sound natural and accurate it would need to be rephrased to something like this: "I am great ! How about you , Mary? Are you alright?"
