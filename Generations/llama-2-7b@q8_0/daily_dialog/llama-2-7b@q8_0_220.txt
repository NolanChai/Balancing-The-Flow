Yes, yes , but then why don’t we go to the movies instead ? I have heard there is an excellent movie at the cinema.

But Steven, I haven’t got any money on me ! How can I pay for it then ? 

 You should have enough money with you when going to the movies . You are always so poor , and you never seem to have enough money ! 

 Hum ... But you see, it costs too much money in a movie theatre. I don't like expensive things at all. Besides , I will be getting paid soon. So let’s go shopping tomorrow after work . 

 But that ’ s the day before Sunday ! Shall we make Monday our new date ? 

That is what you think! No way, Steven ! Do not mess around with me ! We are going to the movies and nothing else ! 

Hum ... Well, if you insist ...

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Let me know when and where you are going shopping in order for me to get ready earlier than usual.

Is there any fish market near here? If so, can we get some fresh fish there? 

 Surely. There is one a few blocks away from us . But you know that I don ’ t like eating fish . So it’s no use buying the fish . 

 All right then. We will go to the butcher's shop , buy chicken and go back home . 

 I am looking forward to going shopping with you. See you tomorrow!
