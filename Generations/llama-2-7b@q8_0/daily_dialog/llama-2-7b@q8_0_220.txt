" OK ! Let me take notes. "

The two people got up from the table, walked out of the room together with a smile.

"Ms. Yang, I will never forget you. "

The middle-aged woman sitting across the desk from him smiled and shook hands with her.

He then sat down in front of her and took off his coat.

The middle-aged woman did not continue to speak. She just looked at him silently waiting for what he would say next.

"Ms. Yang, I know that this is the first time I have come here. You must think it 's a very strange thing for me to do , but I am really here to ask for your hand in marriage . "

The middle-aged woman smiled and looked at him. She had already expected what he would say. She nodded her head with a smile, "I see that you are indeed very brave to come here."

He stood up with a smile on his face. The middle-aged woman also stood up. He handed the envelope in his hand to her and said with a smile: "This is my proposal letter. I hope you can accept it."
The middle-aged woman took it out of his hand, opened it and read it carefully for a long time. She looked at him and smiled. Finally she nodded. She reached out her hands to hold the envelope and said to him: "Mr. Cheng , I have already accepted your proposal letter."
"Really ?" He was surprised when he heard this, because he did not expect that she would accept it so quickly.
He had thought that it might take a few days to talk her into accepting his hand in marriage, but instead she had already said yes after reading just one page of the proposal letter!
"Yes." She smiled and nodded. "Mr. Cheng , I have already accepted your proposal . What kind of things do you want me to give you ?"
"I ..." He did not know what he should say, because he had never thought that this would happen so quickly.
He thought: 'Why is she so easygoing? If I were the person in her position , I wouldn't have said yes so easily.'
Then he took out his wallet and handed it over to her. "Ms. Yang, these are all my money . You can take as many as you want."
"I don ' t need any of that. I accept your proposal letter because I like you. That's all." She smiled at him and said.
"Really ?" He asked in surprise.
"Yes , Really." She nodded her head with a smile . "Do not worry about me. Just take care of yourself well . "
He was silent for a moment, and then he said to her: "Well ... I accept your proposal letter as well."
The middle-aged woman smiled and nodded. "I see that you really like me. You are very kind, Mr. Cheng , so thank you . "
"Please call me Steven from now on . " He bowed down slightly to show his respect to her.
She took out a card from the desk in front of her and handed it over to him. She then said: "Here is my address and telephone number. Please write down your name , address and phone number for me . "
"Thank you very much." He accepted the business card from her.
The two people looked at each other and smiled.
He then said to her: "Ms. Yang, I will take my leave now. I hope that we can see each other again soon."
She smiled and nodded with a smile on his face. He then left the office .

"Hey ! You two are so close. What's your relationship ? "
A man in sunglasses with short hair walked up to them while they were sitting together at one corner of the cafe. He pointed a finger at Steven and said: "You are Steven, right ? I am Wang from the same office building . You know that she is Ms. Yang , don 't you?"
"Yes, I do know her." Steven stood up and shook hands with him.
Then he asked : "So what's your relationship with her ? Are you two dating each other now? "
The woman next to him was laughing. She said: "Hey ! You 're too nosy . Just don't ask me for a date if I don't want one . "
"Alright." Wang laughed and nodded with a smile on his face. He looked at Steven and asked : "Do you know Ms. Yang ? "
Steven smiled, shook his head and said to him: "No , we just met yesterday for the first time in our lives."
Wang was surprised when he heard this. He stared at Steven with a questioning look on his face .
Then he looked at Ms. Yang and asked her: "Is that really true ? You two have never seen each other before ? "
"Really." She nodded with a smile .
Wang was silent for a moment, then smiled to Steven and said: "Hey ! I believe you , but do not try to make me feel suspicious. We are all good friends. If there is any misunderstanding between us two, it will ruin our friendship."
"OK!" Steven nodded his head with a smile on his face. He knew that he could not afford to lose this friend .
"Ms. Yang , you have to help me solve one problem for him . " Wang laughed and said: "He just called Ms. Yang yesterday and asked her out today. What should I do?"
"I will tell you." She smiled at Steven and then turned back to look at Wang, who was standing behind them . She looked up into his eyes with a smile on his face. Then she said : "Wang , don't worry about this problem. It is not that difficult for me to handle it . I just need your help."
"OK ! " He nodded with a smile on his face, and then he sat down in the chair again.
Steven was stunned when he heard this.
He had never expected her to have such an amazing ability . It really made him feel very shocked.
He looked at her with a puzzled look on his face , but she just smiled and said nothing.
She turned around, walked towards him and sat next to him. She then put her arms round his neck, kissed him lightly on the lips and said to him: "Steven , we should go now . We have an appointment with the manager of the store later."
"OK ! I know that you will take me shopping tomorrow." He smiled and nodded.
Then he put his arms around her waist, pulled her towards himself and kissed her on the lips again .
