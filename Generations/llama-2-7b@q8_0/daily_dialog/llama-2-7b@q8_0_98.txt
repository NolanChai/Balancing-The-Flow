I don't know . I think 9:30 am but it's hard to tell with all the sirens and honking. 

 Are you coming out tonight for some drinks? 

Uh-uh, I have a midnight shift at work. 

How do you like living in Liberty City ?  

I love it ! I've lived here since I was 5 years old . 

Where are your parents from ? 

They're both originally from Chicago, but they moved to the U.S when they were young and settled here. 

Are you thinking about going back there some day ? 

Oh yeah ! My sister is getting married in 2 weeks so I'll probably go then. 

What will she marry? 

An American guy, who is from Chicago, but now living here too. 

Cool ! Does your family get along with his ?  

Yeah we do , but we're not very close . 

Why not ? 

Because my sister is kind of a rebel and always does things her way. 

So what is she doing now? 

She works in a clothing boutique on the main street here, called "Shoppers World".  

Does that bother your parents or do they like to see their daughter working? 

I don't think it bothers them too much. They just worry about me , because I'm always hanging out with bad people. 

Are you a bad person ? 

Oh no ! I wouldn't say that . But everyone thinks I am, since I live in this city. 

Do they think you are a criminal or something else? 

Well , since Liberty City is kind of like New York and Los Angeles combined , there are lots of gangs and hoodlums here too . So people always think that everyone who lives here is in some way connected to them. But I'm not ! 

Do you have a lot of friends ?  

Sure ! 

Who do you hang out with? 

The guys from my work, since we are the only two employees at night. We like going to clubs and pubs too . And sometimes we go out for drinks in some nice places around town. 

What is your favorite bar ?  

I don't have a favorite , but I really like to go to this one called "The Wrong Side". It's on the beach side of town and has lots of beautiful women. 

Are you a ladies man? 

Not as much as most of my friends ! But yes , I enjoy going out with girls . 

What kind of girls do you like ? 

I don't think there is just one type that I like better than the others.  

Do you have a girlfriend right now? 

No, but I was in love once and she broke up with me when I moved away from my hometown. 

That must have been tough . Do you get along with your family ? 

Sometimes , because we are all so different from each other, that it's hard for us to understand each other and talk things out. But I do love them very much ! 

What do they think about you living in this city? 

They know I need some time alone and freedom . But if I could afford it , then I would go back to school so I could get a better job with more money.  

Have you ever been in any serious trouble or had any close calls ?  

Yes , but nothing bad happened because of that . 

Are you saying you've never done anything wrong?  

Oh yeah ! We all have our faults and sometimes we do things that aren't right. 

When was the last time you did something wrong ? 

Probably about a year ago when I stole some stuff from my mom's purse. She got mad at me because she didn't want to hear about it so instead of telling her , I just pretended like nothing had happened . 

What do your parents think now?  

I don't know . We hardly talk anymore and when we do, it's only a few words here or there. Sometimes they say stuff like "We hope you have a nice day" but usually that's all I hear from them. 

Why don't they call more often?  

I think they are just busy with their own lives and work . 

Do your friends hang around in gangs too ?  

Yes , some do, but not really my best ones ! We're all good kids who like to have fun sometimes. But we never get into any serious trouble or anything bad happens when we go out together. 

What kind of fun do you guys usually have?  

Oh man . We usually just hang around and play video games at a friend's house, then go for pizza with his mom afterward if she will let us in the kitchen ! That's how it is most days!   

Do you like to travel or do anything special on holidays?  

Yeah , I like to go out of town sometimes and explore new places. Like last year when me and my friends went camping near this lake where there were lots of animals living nearby . 

Have you ever been fishing before ?   

Yes , once when I was younger with my dad, but we didn't catch anything worth keeping ! So now I just stay home on weekends if nothing else is planned by my parents or friends.   

What do they usually like to do on these days?  

They often go out of town for a few hours and then come back later in the evening after work . They say it helps them relax from all their stress at work ! 

Do you get stressed too easily ?    

No , never! I've gotten so used to dealing with everything that comes my way now without getting upset .   

How did you learn how to do this?  

Whenever something happens and makes me angry or frustrated, instead of letting it get me down or make me sad , then I just take a deep breath and let go ! It's helped me through lots of tough situations in life. 

Does your mom like going out by herself too ?    

Yes , but only when she has time off from work . She says that if she doesn't get away sometimes, then everything starts to seem boring or mundane ! So I try not to bug her about it when she needs some space. 

Do you have any hobbies that make your days more interesting ?  

Oh yeah ! Lots ! Some are sports related , but I also like playing video games with my friends too .   

What's the best game of them all?  

Well, it depends on who you ask me because there are so many great ones out there these days . But if I had to pick one , then probably either Call Of Duty or Battlefield 4 !    

What else do you like doing when not at work ?   

I'm kind of a bookworm too , so whenever I find the time, then I go read some good books from my shelves. It helps me escape into another world where things aren't always bad and people are more understanding than in real life sometimes !    

Do you know how to cook?   

Yes , but not very well . My mom taught me when I was little so that she wouldn't have to deal with everything by herself at home. But now that we both live alone, then it seems like we eat out or order delivery more often than before ! 

Have you ever been on a date?  

I don't think so , but it would be nice if I did sometime in the future ! Maybe with someone from my work ?    

Do you know any good places to take them out?     

Um... No , not really . But maybe once we get closer then that might happen somehow !   

What do your friends think about all of this? 

They are fine with it because they understand how things work here in Liberty City. Plus, if I need any help or advice from them then they're always willing to give me whatever information they can . 

Do you like living in a big city like this one ?    

It can get lonely sometimes when everyone is busy doing their own thing all of the time , but overall it's actually pretty fun too ! I wouldn't want to live anywhere else anymore .     

Have you ever considered moving out of town?  

No , because there are so many things going on here every day that make life more interesting than anywhere else in America right now. Plus, this city is also a lot safer than most others too !   

How do you stay safe ?     

By avoiding trouble whenever I can and keeping my head down when other people start getting involved with it somehow . 

Do your friends get into any kind of trouble ?  

Not really , except maybe a few times when they're drunk or high from whatever substance they happen to be using at the moment !    

What happens then?     

They

What was that you said about chores ? 

 The dishes and cleaning up. 

 Okay , I'll take care of it later . 

 It's been an eventful day ! You should call Mom for me when we get to the hotel. 

 Call Mom , you mean . 

 Yes, she's not answering her phone. 

 And what if she doesn't answer ? 

 Oh , I know. She just had lunch with Martha and they were talking about the new movie , "Dune ". I think she said something about "Sister Act". 

 Dad , that was in the eighties ! You were born in the sixties ! How could you know ? 

 I can't remember . I guess it just slipped my mind.

Oh , no , that was a good set of dishes . 

 They're all we had left after the last cleaning spree ! 

 Sorry, love. It was the only set that fitted the window and it's been such a long time since I had any fun at all ... 

 Sorry , but you did say fun . And I can still get you something for your birthday ! 

 We could just throw some old clothes out of the window and pretend they were our own . That would be a lot cheaper than buying new ones, don't you think ? 

 No ! It was an emergency measure , not a cheapskate trick ! You really gotta get that job done ! 

 I can't find my wallet ! Where do you think it is anyway ? 

 I'll find it for you. I have to go now . See ya soon, love ... 

 Bye , bye. 

 It was an accident ! 

 Oh, man, he's got the most amazing hair on this planet . 

 A total hottie ! 

 Yeah . You should see his pecs . They go way down to his knees ! 

 And his dad has such a nice car ! 

 It's an old one , but it still runs great. I wish we had one like that ! 

 Maybe you can take it for a ride someday ? 

 Let's go out to the barn and get my bike . We can take a spin around the neighborhood ! 

 Yeah ! Great idea ! 

 Wow ! Is he checking us out ? 

 You think so ? 

 I wonder where he lives ... 

 Who cares ? It's not like we'll ever see him again. Let's get going, man . We have to be at the bus stop by eight. 

 Right , but you do realize that we will never get away with this on a regular basis ... 

 Heh ! That's all we need ! 

 You know I'm right, man ! If our parents ever found out what we did last night they'd kill us both ! 

 Yeah , but who cares ? We were awesome ! 

 And if that guy sees me with you , he'll never believe it . He'll think we're a couple of crazy hick jocks or something ... 

 I guess you are right . But at least we have had fun once in our lives . Let's go ! 

 OK ... but let's get some sleep tonight , man. I really feel like I'm gonna faint as soon as we hit the street ! 

 Yo, hey ! Wake up, man! We gotta be at the bus stop by eight . The driver won't wait for us ... 

 Damn it ! Who woke me up ? I was dreaming that I was living in a mansion with you as my slave and all these babes were lining up to do your laundry ! It was so awesome ! 

 Awesome ? You call that awesome? Well , let's hope we get some sleep tonight then . 

 Oh, God ! I'm totally exhausted ! My mom is gonna kill me if I don't wake up in time for the bus ... 

 OK . Let's go !
