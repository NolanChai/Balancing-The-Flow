" Why don't you just do it in the morning before work ? "

" It would be more convenient if it could wait until after the weekend when I can sleep in ! "

" Do you know what I mean, Mike ? The way our schedule is going , we will never get a chance to play this game ! "

" Sure . It's just that we have to take the opportunity now before we lose it forever . "

" Well , why don't we start with some simple exercises and build up to more advanced techniques ? "

" Okay . Here we go ... "

" Oh , no ! I can't do this . It's too hard ! "

" Just relax . Keep it down there. That's it ! You're doing great, Mike . Let me see your hand . How is that ? "

" That's fantastic ! Now try to get into a comfortable position ... "

" Okay , I can do this ... but my leg hurts ... "

" Keep going . Don't let it bother you. Just concentrate on the exercise and don't think about anything else. I want you to visualize yourself relaxing . That's it ! You're doing great, Mike ! "

" Oh , no ! It hurts too much ! I can't take any more ! "

" Try not to move your foot ... "

" It's still hurting me a lot ! I think I need something for the pain. "

" Okay . How about a cup of tea ? "

" Okay , thanks . But what if I don't get better ? What if it gets worse and I can't walk anymore ? "

" Don't worry, Mike. You will be fine in no time ! "

" When did you start to feel something was wrong with your foot? "

" I think it started a few months ago. Maybe even a year or so . "

" Why didn't you say anything earlier ? "

" Well, I don't know why not. It just seemed like nothing much ... "

" When did the pain start getting worse ? "

" A couple of weeks ago . That was when it really started hurting me. "

" Oh , God ! How long has this been going on for ? "

" I don't know . "

" Maybe you should have gotten some help sooner. "

" I don't know why ... It just didn't seem like anything serious enough to go and see a doctor about. You know what I mean ? "

" Yeah , but how long did the pain keep getting worse until it really started bothering you? "

" Well, maybe two or three months . "

" And after that ... what happened ? "

" I tried some of those over-the-counter things you can get from the drugstore. But they didn't do much good. Then I bought one of these electric foot massagers. It didn't seem to help very much, either. That's when I decided to see a doctor about it . "

" Well, when did you last see someone? "

" A few weeks ago now . Maybe even three or four weeks . "

" And what happened then ? "

" They took an X-ray of my foot. But there wasn't anything wrong with the bones in it . I guess that was good news , wasn't it? "

" Yeah, it is a good thing ... but why do you think they didn't find any problems ? Was your foot hurting pretty bad when you went to see them? "

" Oh, yeah ! It was killing me ! I can't even describe how much it hurt. My leg felt like it was on fire or something! "

" Well, maybe that's why they couldn't find anything wrong with your foot . It could have been from the pain itself. "

" But isn't there any kind of test to check for these kinds of things? They should be able to tell what causes it. "

" Sometimes doctors don't know everything about all of their patients. They can only try to find out as much as they can from what you have told them . If they couldn't get that information , then they may not have been able to help you very well with your problem . I think it sounds like something might be causing the pain in your foot . "

" Couldn't we just try some more of those things you got from the drugstore? The ones with acetaminophen ? "

" You mean Tylenol ? Yeah, that will help take away some of the pain ... but it doesn't do anything to cure or treat whatever is making your foot hurt. If there really are problems inside your foot then you need to get them taken care of by a doctor. "

" But I don't know why . All these doctors have done was just prescribe some kind of medicine for the pain, that's all ! I think it's time to find someone else who can help me with this problem! "

" Okay ... but where will you start looking ? Maybe we should try another doctor first. "

" Yeah , maybe a different one would work better than last time . You know what I mean? "

" How do you want us to find someone for your foot problems, Mike? "

" Well, my boss's brother used to be a doctor until he retired from the hospital. He might help me with this. I guess I could go there and see if he would be willing to take care of my problem ... "

" What do you think? Would that work for you? "

" Yeah, it seems like it would ! It can't hurt any more than what we have already been doing , right ? "

" Okay ... I hope that this turns out to be helpful for you . Let me know how things go with the doctor. "

" OK, you go upstairs and shut off all the lights ! I'll get the guns . "

" Why don't we just let them in ? They can't hurt us. We're family . "

" Yeah , they're my sister's kids ... but the point is , they still have to kill you, or they won't advance ! You gotta be tough about this . I can't wait up there alone with those lights off. It scares me sometimes even in broad daylight ! "

" They're only children. They'll never hurt anyone . "

" Well , let's see what they do when they get in here ! "

" I don't know why we have to kill them all . "

" To beat the game, you gotta be totally ruthless . "

" It's just a game . We can turn it off any time we want. "

" You think so ? Have you ever tried ? I mean , really tried ? "

" Why don't they come in ? "

" I dunno . Maybe the kids are scared of me ... "

" Just shoot them ! It's all right . It's just a game. We're not real people. They can't kill us . "

" Yeah , but if they don't kill us, it doesn't count . And you know how pissed off I get when the game gets stuck like that ! "

" Hey, why do we have to kill them ? "

" To beat the game. It's a game, remember ? "

" Yeah , but ... "

" What ? What is it now ? You wanna help me clean up the mess in the bathroom ? "

" No ! I don't want to help you kill my family either ! "

" The children are screaming . Shouldn't we save them ? "

" Yeah , sure. And then they'll just keep coming back and killing us all over again ! "

" Well, that is pretty weird ... "

" What ? You gotta watch out for things like that . They might start a fire in the kitchen or something while we're sleeping . I mean , these people are supposed to be asleep upstairs too. "

" No one seems to be answering me . "

" Shit ! I guess they all got killed by the kids, then ! I have to get them out of here ! They'll never finish the game with us still around ! "

" Whew ! That was a close call ! "

" Yeah ... now we can finally beat this stupid game. "

" Shit ! Just our luck to be stuck with these kids and that fat, ugly bitch ! If they kill all of us , it's not like we could play the game again with someone else. "

" Hey, don't talk about Momma like that ! It isn't nice . I know she's kinda old-fashioned and everything , but you have to admit, she knows how to make a pot of coffee good enough for anybody . "

" Well, she did used to be a bit slender. It's all this fat food from the game that makes her look so bloated . And besides, what are we supposed to do with Momma ? Leave her in there alone while you and me go off to kill people ? We gotta take care of our family ! "

" All right , I'll let you have it. But only because you promised me I could drive when we get out of here. You know, for a girl, you do all right with that shotgun ... "

" Yeah ! Well, it sure beats waiting around for some little kid to come downstairs and take it away from you ! "

" Hey , no fair ! I'm trying to shoot the fat one! "

" Well , too bad. She's mine now . And if you wanna get her before she goes upstairs, you gotta start running after me and shooting at my feet ! "

" What're you gonna do when she's upstairs ? "

" I don't know. Maybe I'll just hide in the closet until they go home . "

" Yeah , like that would help us beat the game any faster ... "

" Well, we gotta kill them all eventually. So why not now when there are a lot of 'em around ? "

" Hey ! What about the fat one ? I'm trying to get her upstairs ! "

" No . If you wanna get her, you have to shoot me first, then you have to chase me all over the house with that shotgun. And then , and only then , can you kill her ... "

" Why ? What's so special about this one ? She's just a fat old lady . "

" No ! She is not ! You know what I think she is ? "

" Yeah. I don't really want to hear it either, but yeah , I guess you're right . She does have kinda pretty eyes, doesn't she ? "

" Hey ! What about the other one? Where's he going ? "

" Oh no ... now we gotta chase after him too! "

" Well, that makes five for us. But I guess they still got three . At least, if you count the kids. "

" Yeah, well , we only got seven. And two of those are asleep in their beds upstairs. So we're a little behind now. "

" Shit ! We really do have to kill them all before they leave our house and go home. "

" Oh shit ... what if one of the kids wakes up? This could get real sticky for us. "

" Well, then we gotta move pretty damn fast after they wake up. If we don't, they might make it all the way down to the front door before we can catch them . "

" I guess so ... I mean , they are kids. They run really fast. But if one of us gets killed by a kid ... that would really suck ! "

" Yeah . And if both of us get killed, it'll be the end for all of us . We gotta make sure we take care of this right now , while there are still plenty of adults left to kill. "

" Well, what about upstairs ? I don't really like killing people in front of other people ... "

" That's why we have to make them wake up ! If they stay sleeping, everything is cool. But if one of 'em gets outta bed and starts walking around down here, then you better be ready for a fight . And the only way I know how to kill someone is with my shotgun ... "

" Hey , no fair ! You're gonna take away my fat old lady ? "

" Yeah! This one is mine now. We gotta get rid of her and the kids before we can go on. And besides, what are you gonna do? Let me have that gun when I want it ? That's just dumb ! "

" Oh well ... guess I didn't really need to use it anyway . "

" All right , let's get back to work upstairs! We gotta kill the kids before they wake their momma and we'll all be screwed ! "

" Hey, no fair ! You shot me again! "

" I didn't mean for you to wake up this early ! "

" Well , now that you think about it ... "

" Look ! We can't take any chances with these kids. Let me shoot them and then we can go back upstairs . "

" Yeah, but if we wait for the kids to wake their momma , we might not even get a chance to kill the fat one anymore! "

" Well , she's probably still sleeping . We just gotta take care of the kids. Then we can deal with Momma later ... "

" Oh shit ! I almost forgot about her down in there ! She might wake up and see us right now if she heard that one of you two started to cry or something! "

" Don't worry . We gotta kill the kids. So we have to start being loud enough for Momma to hear us. That way, even if she wakes up, we can still make it back upstairs before she finds us. And then when we do, we just tell her we were playing hide and seek or something ... "

" OK , you two go on upstairs . I'll stay down here with Momma and watch these kids for you."

" Oh, no ! You have to come up too! "

" Well , it doesn't really matter. We can still kill them all later even if we leave one of the kids alone in here . "

" Look ! We can just start shooting at each other now so that Momma knows something is going
