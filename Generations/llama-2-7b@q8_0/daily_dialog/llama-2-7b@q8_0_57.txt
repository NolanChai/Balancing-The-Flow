" Sure ! I will do it now ! "

I was given some towels , a hair cap and a comb . Then my head was wrapped in an elastic bandage . My eyes were covered with black cloth so that I couldnâ€™t see anything clearly. My ears were blocked up by cotton wads so that I could not hear what was going on around me.

Then I felt myself falling asleep . When I regained consciousness , my hair was wet and dripping down my face . It was a cold perm . The temperature was 38 degrees Celsius for fifteen minutes . Then I had to wait a while before getting another cold perm . After the second one , it was time to get warm curls . That felt like burning .

After the whole process of hair styling , my head hurt so badly . It took me two days to recover from that painful experience .

" So how did you feel after having your first perm ? " asked the doctor in his office . I told him what kind of perms I had and how I felt about them .

" Did they make you look older than you are now , or younger ? " he asked me.
