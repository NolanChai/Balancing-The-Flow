I can't wait ! Do you have any plans for tomorrow night? We should get together for a dinner soon. 

 Okay, let me see...I think that we have a date with a group of friends from work for some karaoke . Weâ€™ll probably be pretty exhausted though, so I don't know if we'll be able to do anything afterward ... 

 Okay , then maybe another time. Just remember you said dinner first and then karaoke!

 I understand. But you can still try cooking once in your life time just for fun !
