I think that it isn't so cold in May . You must have been out of the sun a little . 

 It’s strange he hasn’t come yet . The train was late today , wasn't it ? 

 It is getting dark. I wonder how we will get home from here . 

It’s getting cooler now . I must have my coat on .

I had better put on more clothes, the weather seems to be turning colder .

It will not do for you to walk about in your thin dress , you'll catch cold. 

 It would never do for us to go out in our night-clothes . We must get dressed first . 

 You may depend on it that we shall see more of each other now . 

 You can count upon me . I am sure that I should like to see you again. 

 She was so kind as to write the letter for us , and she did not charge us a penny . 

 We have nothing to fear from them . They will never hurt us . 

I was glad of his help. He has been very useful to me . I am much obliged to him .

 You may rely upon me that you shall be in time if we leave at once . 

 She is going to London with her friends next week . So we have decided to go too . 

 She will not come back. It was a great mistake of hers to say she would come back .

 I wish he had told me where he lived . Otherwise , it would be impossible for me to find him . 

I am afraid that you don't like me . But you can depend on it that if you knew me better , you'd like me better . 

He is coming at the end of May , and we shall have a holiday together . You can count upon my visiting her often in London. 

We shall never go back to England again unless they give us more money . 

You may be sure that he will take care of you if I am not able to do it myself . 

It would be impossible for me to write the letter without help , but I'll manage somehow . 

I had better put on more clothes, the weather seems to be turning colder. 

He has never been so late before . It is sure that he will not keep us waiting long now . 

It would never do for us to go out in our night-clothes. We must get dressed first . 

It was a great mistake of hers to say she would come back. She won't return. 

She will not come back. It is sure that she won’t return. 

You can depend on my visiting her often in London if we are there together . 

I wish I had never agreed to go with them . You know they always make us do as they like. 

It would be impossible for me to write the letter without help but I'll manage somehow . 

 He will come on Tuesday . It is sure that he won’t keep us waiting long now .

 You may be sure that if I am not able to do it myself, he will take care of you.
