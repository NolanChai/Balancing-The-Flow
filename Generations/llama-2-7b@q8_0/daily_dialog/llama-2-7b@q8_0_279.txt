The two of them were talking with each other. They did not know if their tone was right, but they knew it was not right to listen to it, so the man said to the woman beside him:
" I heard you say that there is a famous scenic spot nearby, let ’ s get off and take a look . "
The woman who was talking about the driver’s skills said angrily:
"What? You don ’ t know how to drive either! You also think that this is a beautiful place. Let me tell you that I will never go to any scenic spot again in my life, no matter what kind of beauty it has . "
The man looked at her for a moment, and then said:
" Then let ’ s go together , the driver can ’ t see us , there is a road leading to the foot of the mountain, it ’ s not too far away, let ’ s walk over . "
The woman hesitated, but finally agreed. At this time, the car came to a stop and the two of them got off. They walked along the way to the foot of the mountain, where there were not many people. It was quite quiet here. The man took out his mobile phone and dialed a number:
"Hello, is that you? "
The other party answered:
" Who else can it be! You come out first . "
The man said to the woman beside him:
" A friend of mine . Let ’ s go up the mountain together , what do you think about going with us?"
The woman hesitated for a moment and then agreed. The three walked in the direction that the mobile phone was calling. They came to a hillside, and there were several people sitting on some rocks around the rocky cliff. The man took out his mobile phone again and said:
"Hello, are you still not here yet? Come quickly . "
The woman beside him heard it and looked over. There were four young men standing at the foot of a cliff about ten meters high. At first glance, they could not see who they were looking for. The man’s mobile phone rang again:
"Let me tell you that I will never come to this kind of place in my life . "
The woman next to him said angrily:
"Shut up! Let ’ s go and have a look, maybe there is something to see here!"
The man looked at the young men below and then walked down with the two. He went straight towards them and saw that they were all wearing casual clothes and their hair was messy. One of them said:
"Brother Fang, this is your girlfriend . "
As soon as she heard this sentence, the woman beside her became furious! She shouted angrily:
"You are wrong! You must be blind to recognize me , I am not Brother Fang ’ s girlfriend at all !"
The man said angrily:
"What? Didn ’ t we come here together?"
The woman beside him said angrily: "You can tell your brother who I am ?!"
The man was a little embarrassed. He hurriedly asked the other party for forgiveness, but before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by the young man below again:
"I told you it ’ s okay . You guys are still going to be together in the future , right? "
