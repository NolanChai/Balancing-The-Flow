Yes , that's right . Mom's cooking roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy . 

It sounds delicious . 

 I'm sure it is. You know my mom can make anything taste good. 

Well , maybe you should come to church sometime yourself . It might make you feel more a part of the family.  

Yes, well...maybe someday soon I will try that ...

I guess everyone is out on the town in their Easter finery. 

 I never went to church as a kid , but my mom was always making a big fuss about it . 

 I still don't go myself , and you know that Mom's dead . 

 Not dead ! She was murdered last year in her own home . 

 No , no , no ! 

 You're kidding ? That's terrible . What happened ? 

 Mom was stabbed by a burglar . It was so brutal it took the police two days to identify her body. 

 I guess you never got over this. You still come here every year for Easter. 

 Yeah , but this is where we always came as kids , and Mom loved the holiday . 

 Oh well , I guess everyone has their little things . 

 And now that I think about it , I bet that's what Mom wanted , a big reunion with us all here at Easter.
