You should have waited for me to tell you not to . It was silly of you . 

 I'll clean it up when I get home later on and then we can put it back on its peg where it belongs .

 The paint is still wet but don’t touch it. You’ve made a mess already so go ahead and try again. Don’t do it. I’m going to tell you again not to do it. It was silly of you not to listen the first time, wasn’t it?
