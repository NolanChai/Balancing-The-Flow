"Hi , what happened ? "

" I had an accident today . "

" What kind of accident ? "

" The motorbike skidded on the wet road and hit a tree . "

" Oh my God, are you all right ? "

" Yeah, it hurt but nothing serious . "

" Let me drive to your place , I'll call an ambulance."

" Okay. Thanks . "

" Nothing much, just hanging out with friends . "

" Can we hang out later? It's a party after all. "

" Later ? Maybe next week. "

" Next week?! Why so far in the future? Don't you want to have fun?"

"Sure I do , but my schedule is full this week."

"So, you don't want to spend time with me because of your busy schedule?"

"No no . I'd love to hang out, just not tonight. "

"If it wasn't for your stupid scheduling habits , we could hang out every night ! "

"I didn't realize that was a problem."

" I'm so sorry . Can you forgive me?"

"Why should I forgive you? You have to be more considerate of my time if you want us to spend it together. "

"I guess this means we won't hang out tonight ? "

"Well, maybe next week."

"Next week? I don't know when I can go. "

"Well, why not tomorrow night?"

"I'm sorry , but I have plans with someone else."

"Who are you hanging out with ? "

"I guess you'll never find out ."

" It's fine . See ya later. Bye. "

" You will be missed ! Bye ! "
