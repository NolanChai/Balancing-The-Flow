" Good morning, Ms. Shen . I'm Xiao Wang , from Class 7 in Junior High School No.2 here. We have been studying how to ride bicycles for half month . May I ask you if it's okay that we come over to your office ? "

" Yes, of course ! Just go on ! "

" Thank you very much ! "

" You are most welcome! Please make sure you know the traffic rules when riding bicycles and play a joke with no one . Then it will be safe for us to have fun in Beijing ! "
