The man sighed . He didn't sound very happy about it .

The boy wandered off towards the entrance to the cave. He was getting more and more irritated by his situation as he thought of what a fool he had been not to try to get away. Now he would probably never make it out alive. He stumbled on an uneven patch of rock, fell, and began to roll down into a dark crevice that seemed to have opened underneath him.

He screamed in terror as he was sucked into the blackness, but then all at once his body shot upward out of the pit and he tumbled onto soft ground. He sat there for a moment gasping for breath. The air felt cooler here, too, and it seemed to be coming from the direction that the cave had pointed before they left.

"I'm in another cave," the boy realized. "It must go underneath this one."

He looked around him curiously. He was sitting on soft grass under a spreading tree whose roots extended out into the ground like the tentacles of an octopus. There were other trees here, too. But there weren't any bushes or flowers, just tall stalks of green that he guessed must be some kind of grass.

A few feet away was another cave opening. This one had a doorway with a wooden frame and glass panels that allowed in light from outside. There were no steps leading down to the entrance so it looked like people came here from the level above this one, not by entering from below. The boy guessed they probably used a staircase or an elevator of some kind.

He stood up and walked over to the doorway. He pushed on it gingerly with his hand but it was locked. "They must have left me here so I could die," he thought.
"I should go back into the cave, though . Maybe that way they can't find my body."

He started towards the entrance to the cave and then stopped. He had been right about there being a staircase somewhere down in this part of the underground cavern. There was one now, just below him at the end of the cave where he had fallen into it. It looked as if the steps had been made from boulders that had been cut in half and then put back together so they could be used like regular stairs. The boy knew this because there were marks on each rock where a hammer or axe had hit them, shaping them to make them fit neatly next to each other.

He decided he would go down into the cave again. He wondered what it was that the man had said before they left. _I have no time for games now ._ If he could understand the language the man and woman had spoken, perhaps there were other words in this strange place that he might be able to figure out as well.

He walked over to the entrance to the cave and then stopped again. There was something else underneath him that the man with the gun had said before they left. The boy sat down on a rock by the cave opening and thought about it for a long time.

"It can't be true," he finally told himself as tears ran down his face. "I can't believe something like this could happen to me!"

The man had said, _"You will not live through what is coming."_ And now the boy realized that this was exactly what the man must have meant . He knew it would be easy for him to fall asleep and just lie there on the rock until he died.

But that wasn't how things worked in his world, where people awoke with each new day. Here, in this strange place, it seemed like death was waiting around every corner.

The boy closed his eyes. He thought of the strange room at the end of the corridor he had first seen after leaving his own world behind. He remembered how dark and cold it felt when he had walked through that doorway and stepped into its gloom . And now, as if to complete the circle of his life, he was once again alone in a room with no light, no warmth, no one to help him.

He heard a strange sound outside the cave opening. He looked up just in time to see what seemed like an entire flock of birds swooping downward out of the sky and heading straight for him! Their sharp beaks were open wide, ready to peck at his face or grab him with their powerful talons and carry him away somewhere he never wanted to go.

"No!" he screamed as he threw himself backwards onto the rock behind him where he had been sitting a few moments before. The birds roared past overhead and disappeared into the darkness above the cave entrance, but now it was too late. He could no longer get up from the ground. His legs were numb. They refused to respond.

The boy realized with horror that the same thing had happened when he'd fallen down the crevice in the first place. This time there was something holding him in place, something heavy and strong and evil.

He looked around in fear as he saw a group of people approaching from behind. They were all dressed in strange clothing with long robes that flowed over their heads like capes or mantles. He could see the outline of weapons on their hips but they didn't seem to have any guns or knives with them, at least not that he could tell from where he was sitting.

They were moving slowly towards him, all staring downwards toward the ground as if they hadn't realized he had been there until now . He struggled against his invisible bonds but it did no good . They held him tightly and he couldn't break free.

The leader of the group was an old man with a long white beard that looked like it was made out of cotton . The man walked slowly over to where the boy sat on the rock, looking down at him in amazement as if seeing something he had never expected to see before.

"He is sleeping," the old man said to his companions who were following behind him with their eyes wide open and staring intently into space. They didn't seem able to focus on anything else, even though they had been walking around all day without stopping once since leaving the house where they lived in another part of this strange place called Earth.

The boy heard one of them gasp as if he had just seen something so frightening that he couldn't believe it was real . But then another voice spoke up from behind him saying, "Let me have a look at him." A young man with black hair and dark eyes moved forward until he stood directly in front of the boy.

He reached out to touch his face, but before he did so the boy screamed as loudly as he could . The sudden noise seemed to wake him from a deep sleep. He opened his eyes wide and looked around fearfully at all these strange faces staring down upon him with such hatred in their eyes!

It was then that he saw it--a long black snake, curled up on the ground right next to where he had been sitting only moments before. The boy screamed again as loudly as possible but no one seemed to hear him over all the shouting and crying going on around him now that everyone knew they were in trouble!

The old man who was leading this group of people walked up behind him with an angry look upon his face . He took out a knife from inside his robe and held it high above where the boy's head had been resting just seconds before, preparing to strike downward towards him!

"No!" The cry came from somewhere deep within himself--a voice so desperate that even those who were closest heard him. "Don't kill me! I don't understand what has happened here but please believe me when I tell you that this is not my fault!"

The old man stared down at the boy with eyes full of rage and hatred before turning away towards where another group of people was standing . The boy watched as they all turned their backs to him, leaving only one person still looking directly into his face with a strange look on her face that seemed almost sad.

"You're not alone," she said quietly, "and neither am I." Then she disappeared into the darkness behind her without saying another word .

The boy stared at where she had been standing for what felt like hours before he finally closed his eyes again. It wasn't long after this that he heard footsteps approaching from somewhere else in the cave . They sounded like they belonged to someone who knew exactly where he was hiding and how best to get there.

The boy looked up just as a young man walked into view carrying what appeared to be an odd sort of sword on his back . It seemed much too small for any purpose other than stabbing people with its sharp point, but there were two long blades on either side that made it look more like some kind of dagger than anything else.

The boy tried to move away from where the young man was walking towards him, but he found himself unable to do so . The invisible force holding him in place grew stronger and tighter around his waist, making any attempt at movement futile as well.

"You're not alone," whispered a voice right next to his ear, "and neither am I."

The boy looked up at the sound of this voice . It seemed to be coming from
