Yes. I love them very much. 

 Why don't you watch comedy or romance movies instead? 

 I prefer action movies because they are very interesting and dynamic. But if there is no any interesting film released in the cinema , then I won`t go to see it . It is just a waste of time for me . 

 Tom, where do you live ?

 In New York City . 

 Do you like living there ? 

 Of course ! There are lots of interesting places and beautiful parks in the city , so I have nothing against it . 

 Have you ever lived somewhere else? 

 Yes. I`ve been to France several times. It was really great there . But now I am going back to NYC .
