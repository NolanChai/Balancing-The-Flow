Can I see the way to the human resource department please ? 

Yes but have you made an appointment ahead? 

Yes, of course. My name is Monica, and I’ve made an appointment with your HR manager. 

Okay just a minute please; I'm going to make a call to the HR office. Yes, they confirm your appointment. Please come in; it’s on the third floor, room number three-thousand one-hundred and six. You can take either of the two elevators, but today the right elevator is out of order. 

Thank you very much!
