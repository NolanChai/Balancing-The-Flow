Who are you ? 

I am from the accounting department . I called to let Mr. Smith know that he will not be receiving his commission check this month because it has been sent overseas where he is currently working and there is no way for us to send it to him here in Chicago . 

 Oh , I see . How much did he earn ? 

I think around $3,500.00 last month . It will be the same this month . 

 And how much do you normally send to your clients for commission checks? 

 It is usually about $160.00 per day but sometimes we have sent them up to $285.00 a day when they really did exceptionally well and earned it . But this time I am sorry the check will not be here on Friday , like usual , because he has been working overseas for over 3 months now . 

 Oh ! I see . So you can’t send him any of his commission checks? 

 Not at all . 

 Oh , well maybe next month then ? 

 I don’t think so either , because he will be returning to the States soon and we don’t want to have the check overseas in our office. We just send it directly to him via Fed Ex express every Friday morning . 

 Ok ….

 Bye . 

 Thank you for calling the accounting department at Smith, Inc . Have a good day !

Yes , but only if I may tell him who it’s from . 

 The name is Smith . Mr. Dwayne Smith . 

 Is that right ? 

 Yeah . Just write ’ Dwayne ’ and leave out the last part of the name . 

 Okay . Thanks ! 

 Bye ! 

 Goodbye .
