" Bye bye !"

She had called at 2:00 o'clock .

She was not only pretty and tall but also slim and well-built .

Her hair, which was dyed a soft brown , flowed down to her shoulders in waves that were neatly tied up into a pony tail with the help of two hairpins .

The top part of the hair was cut straight across while the lower section was cut in layers to look like curved strands .

She wore no makeup and had beautiful eyes . They were small , dark and round without being too wide apart or close together . The pupils were slightly slanted with black irises which stood out against a white sclera.

A very delicate, well-defined nose was adorned by the presence of two small nostrils .

Her thin , soft lips were painted a pinkish red to match her skin color and they made a perfect frame for her beautiful teeth .

She had an oval face with a well defined chin . Her ears were perfectly shaped with no protrusion or other physical defect .

She was wearing a simple white dress with short sleeves . It had a long, straight skirt that came down to the middle of her calf and reached all the way up to the middle of her thighs . The top portion of this dress consisted of a close-fitting bodice which stopped right above the navel in order to show off her flat stomach .

She wore a thin gold chain around her neck on which hung an irregularly shaped pearl .

Her shoes were high-heeled black leather pumps .

She was very polite and courteous . She had been extremely warm in her invitation to attend the banquet at 7:00 o'clock .

" Oh ! Miss Rose ? " said Shirley .

" Yes ? " she replied with a smile .

Shirley did not know what to say but, after some hesitation, she spoke out of turn :

" I'm sorry if my words sounded rude at the time . I was surprised by your offer . "

" It's quite all right . I understand how you feel. But don't worry too much . "

" Oh ! No . It's not that . It's just that it seems so unusual for a girl like me to be invited to such a banquet . "

" Don't underestimate yourself, Miss Shirley . I can assure you that your presence will be an honor to the guest of honor. And if you accept my invitation, we would also be happy if you could stay for supper . "

" Well, then , I won't go to the banquet this evening after all . "

" It's a shame , isn't it ? " said Miss Rose with an apologetic look on her face.

Shirley shook her head in the negative :

" No . It's not that at all ! I just want to be clear about this so there are no misunderstandings later on . If I accept your invitation, it is only because I feel very flattered and honored by Mr. Carter's thoughtfulness towards me. However , the real reason why I am going to attend this banquet is in order to thank him for all his good deeds throughout the years and for all the benefits that he has brought me . "

" I see ! That sounds perfectly reasonable then . "

Miss Rose smiled warmly at Shirley :

" You're right . It would be an honor for us if you attended our banquet . "

Shirley nodded her head and asked :

" Are you going to take me to the hotel in your car ? "

Miss Rose shook her head with a smile :

" No . I'm afraid not . That would be rather difficult for us because Mr. Carter wants to go home first so that he can change into his dinner clothes . He would then drive over to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the banquet hall in the Shangri-La Hotel . "

Shirley nodded again as she replied :

" I see ! Well , then , let me come with you now because Mr. Carter's going to be waiting for a long time before you arrive at his house . "

She was about to get up from her seat but Miss Rose stopped her and said :

" No , no . Sit down please . I know what Mr. Carter wants . He wants to see that you are ready in plenty of time . But let's wait for a few more minutes because it looks like he has something else to do right now . "

" Is that so ? What about ? " asked Shirley curiously.

" Let me guess ! Mr. Carter has gotten another phone call from someone and is waiting for him at the door of his office . It might be a business associate, a client or just an old friend . I can't tell you any more than that because it isn't my place to know . But what's important is that he won't be able to leave before he finishes talking on the phone . "

Shirley smiled as she replied :

" Well , then , let me just sit here and wait for him with you until he comes back home again ? "

Miss Rose shook her head with a smile :

" That won't be necessary, Miss Shirley . If you don't mind waiting for another few minutes, I can go ahead to Mr. Carter's house first so that I will know when exactly we have to leave in order not to keep him waiting too long outside his office . "

Shirley nodded her head as she replied :

" That sounds like a good idea ! But let me help you out by walking over there with you instead of calling a taxi ? It's no big deal and I can get some fresh air while we wait for him . "

Miss Rose smiled warmly at Shirley and said :

" Oh, please don't worry about it ! I'm sure he will be pleased to see you waiting here for me with such a pretty smile on your face instead of riding around town in some taxi like an old woman . "

Shirley smiled back at her as she replied :

" It won't take long for Mr. Carter and I to walk there, so don't worry about that either ! Now let's go ! "

They got up from their seats, walked out of the coffee shop and headed towards the doorway where Miss Rose had parked her car .
