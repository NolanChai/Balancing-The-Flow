" Yes , you can , and it' s going to make all the difference in the world to your health . It's what they call stress relief . "

" Stress relief ? What on earth do you mean by that ? "

The doctor is silent for a few seconds before replying.

" Well , I know this sounds pretty strange and probably even difficult, but it can work wonders if you'll only try it . It's all to do with releasing the tension in your body-and the best way that I ' ve ever found is through exercising . "

" Exercising ? That sounds pretty easy , but what exactly are you referring to ? "

The doctor pulls a small pamphlet out of his briefcase and hands it over.

" Well , I've written down some of the things that we talked about last night . Now, this is the most important one-it concerns your breathing . You've probably never been taught how to breathe properly . "

The doctor then explains that by taking long, slow, deep breaths, you can begin to reduce the amount of tension in your body. It helps with relaxation , and once you get into the habit of doing it, it will become easier as time goes on-especially if you do it regularly . You'll find that after only a few days, you'll notice a marked improvement in yourself , and all because of some simple breathing exercises .

" What other exercises ? "

The doctor explains that you don't necessarily need to go to the gym-you can get the same results just by doing things around your house. He then gives a few examples: cleaning the house; washing the car; mowing the lawn etc . By taking on these tasks, and by making sure that they are done in a relaxed manner , you'll be able to build up the strength in your muscles as well as reducing some of your stress.

" How does this help my blood pressure ? "

The doctor explains that when we do things at high speed, our bodies often respond with tension . We get into a kind of rhythm where everything is done quickly and without thinking , which increases the chances of mistakes happening -and of course it's no good for our health either. So by taking on these tasks slowly, and gradually increasing the amount of time that you take to complete them-you'll find that your body will respond differently . It'll be able to relax more easily , which means less chance of getting overtired or having a heart attack .

" Heart attack ? Are there any other side effects ? "

The doctor replies: "Well , I don't think so-but you might notice that it can take longer for things to get done. It may sound like a silly question, but why is this? Because your body is now relaxed and can focus on what needs doing rather than worrying about how long it takes .

" So basically , what I'm saying is that we have all these stresses in our lives -from work to family commitments-and sometimes they get so overwhelming that we just want them to go away . But the only way to do this is by taking on some of our daily tasks slowly and calmly -as if it was a hobby or something ."

" That sounds good , but how do I start ? "

The doctor says: "Well , I think that's up to you. All I can say is that it might take you a few weeks before you notice any difference, but after that -who knows ! Maybe even some of those other things you ' ve been worrying about will start to disappear too ."
