Your sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise is probably the main culprit here, but there are other things to consider . 

 You might find yourself feeling even more tired if you eat a poor diet , especially one with lots of processed foods and too little fruit and vegetables . 

 What can I do about all this ? 

 You need to make some changes in your life . Try to get as much exercise as possible, and make sure that the food you eat is good for you. 

 It'll be hard at first , but if you stick with it, your blood pressure should start coming down eventually .

Well , you must . 

 What about my heart condition? 

 Oh, that is far better now . You had the best doctor in America and he fixed it up for you . 

 Are you satisfied with him ? 

 No. I want a second opinion . 

 Yes , of course . But this time don't go to Germany or anywhere else . Go right across the street , to Doctor Brown , that's what I would do . He ' s a good man and a friend of mine . You won't find any better in all America . And he'll give you the best second opinion ever .

Of course you have . You won't live very long if you don ' T .

 But I can't . I ' M far too busy to diet .

 You're not too busy to work half as hard. 

 All right then, what about going fishing ? 

 Fine , fine , that's better-fish are good for you . They have a high protein content and they contain plenty of vitamins and minerals . 

 And I don ' T have to be in the office by ten o ' clock tomorrow morning , do I ? 

 You can go fishing at any time . It doesn't matter how late you get back. 

 But it matters what time I get up ! 

 All right then, you won't need to get up early if you don't want to . Go to bed whenever you like and sleep as long as you feel like . You can take naps at any time of the day or night-provided they are short ones , of course. 

 Short ? 

 Of course, not too long ! Your body needs a lot more sleep than it used to and it's not good for you to keep going on and off . It interferes with your metabolism and makes you feel tired all the time. 

 You mean I should sleep until noon every day ? 

 As much as you like , as long as you don ' T miss any of your meals. 

 Well, what about my work ? How do I manage that while I ' m fishing and napping all the time ? 

 You don't have to do anything . It will take care of itself. 

 What ? ! 

 Of course, if you can find someone who can do your job better than you , you should let him do it . 

 But there isn't anyone else as good as me ! 

 That doesn ' T matter . You won ' T be here anyway. 

 And what about my boss ? He will miss me if I don' t go to the office . 

 Of course he will , but you won ' T be going there for much longer, and you can tell him that . Tell him you ' re going fishing because it's good for your blood pressure-and for all the other reasons. You won't have any trouble explaining why to him ! 

 And what about my family ? Won't they miss me too ? 

 Yes , they will at first . But if you explain things well enough to them, they ' ll be glad of it . They'll see that it will improve their lives as much as yours. 

 And how can I possibly tell them all this ? 

 Don't worry about telling them anything. You won ' T have any trouble with them-they're just going to love you more than ever !
