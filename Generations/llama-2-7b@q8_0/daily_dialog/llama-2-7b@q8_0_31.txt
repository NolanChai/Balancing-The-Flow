Do you mean that the course has given him more insights into his future career path? 

 Yes . 

 If so , I would sign up for it too . What do you think about it ? 

 I guess there must be lots of useful information on how to choose oneâ€™s career in life . 

 He said he learned a lot from the course and he will continue working hard now . How long is he planning to take the course? 

 It took him three weeks.

Well , sometimes the courses are more about the planning part and not so much about work relationships . And of course it is up to each individual whether he or she would like to try a different career pathway . But I am sure that if you put some extra effort in it , your hardworking will be appreciated by your supervisor and colleagues . 

 You know , I have been thinking about going back to school to get more knowledge for my career . What do you think ? 

 Oh, a good idea ! It is not too late to study if one is willing enough . To me , the most important thing is that we need to learn how to adapt in a workplace . We should not be afraid of trying something new as long as it would bring us some advantages . The other day I watched a motivational video on YouTube and I think you can watch it too because you are also looking for a change . 

 Okay , tell me where and when . And yes, maybe I will . By the way, what is the name of the channel ?
