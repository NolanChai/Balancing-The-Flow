" That sounds good ! There is a lot of information on the website you want us to subscribe to and it seems we can get a free trial for seven days . It also includes some materials like e-books , videos, articles etc. . Do not know if they are useful or not but I think it is worth giving a try . "

" Oh , OK . By the way , have you tried that career test online ? "

" Yeah ! Not long ago . It is from a website called careerplanner.com . They also give you a free career evaluation report which can show your best careers to choose . I like it very much and took some advice about my future career from the result . What do you think of it ? "

" Well , there are quite a few websites that provide such career test for us to take . They claim they can give you a list of suitable job choices according to your interests, skills, strengths etc. . I am not sure about their reliability but sometimes I feel tired about my current work and want to have something new at the same time . "
