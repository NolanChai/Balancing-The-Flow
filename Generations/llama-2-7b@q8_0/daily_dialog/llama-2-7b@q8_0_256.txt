" Maybe not , maybe just taking some time away will help him to realize how much he loves you . "

" You think so ? "

" If it were me , that ’ s what I would do . But , it ’ s none of my business . Just tell me when you decide to break up with him . "

" I don ’ t know if I can do it , but I will try my best . He just needs a little more time. "

" Okay . "

" Hey ! Have you called him yet ? "

" No . "

" Maybe you should call him back now that your parents have gone to sleep . "

" Why should I ? "

" You ’ re just wasting your time if you don ’ t even give it a shot . "

" Fine , whatever , I will . But, don ’ t expect me to be happy about it . "

" Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t. "

" He still hasn ’ t called ? "

" No . "

" What is he doing right now? "

" Probably sleeping . "

" Yeah, that would make sense . Why the hell wouldn ’ t he just call me if he wants to talk ? It’s so frustrating ! I can’t even think about anything else at this point. "

" What do you want him to say ? "

" He should tell me exactly how much he loves me and how he wants to be with me . But, if he doesn ’ t then I guess we are over . "

" You can ’ t be sure about that , it is only been a few days after all . "

" Yes ! It’s been too long already! We need to talk this out . "

" Are you planning on talking it out with him ? Or your parents ? Because you shouldn ’ t. I think the best thing for you would be to go over there and stay with them , in a different house of course . "

" What if they want me to go back home tomorrow morning ? "

" You can try and convince them that this is something serious so don ’ t expect anything less than an argument . "

" Okay, thanks for your advice . I will think about what you said. "

" You know , if he ever wants to get back together with you after all of this it ’ s gonna be up to you ! "

" You mean we are going to break up ? "

" Yeah. "

" He probably doesn ’ t want to lose you . Just tell him that if he does decide to call then it ’ ll have to be a clean break and you ’ ll both move on with your lives. That will put an end to this stupidity ! "

" You think so ? "

" I know so , now just make the call . "

" Okay, okay ... I gotta go. Bye! "

" Bye . "

" Look , I know you two had a rough start , but it ’ s all going to work out fine . He really does love you ! If he didn ’ t , do you think he would have stayed on your side of town ? You need to relax and let him make the first move . I mean ... this is his last chance . "

" And what if he doesn ’ t make that move ? What then ? What am I supposed to do ? Walk away from him forever ? No ! I can ’ t do it ! I love him , and I know he still loves me ! I just have to give it some more time . "

" Okay , okay , calm down ! Just sit here and breathe. You are going to be fine . "

" How can I possibly face him ? What am I supposed to say ? That I cheated on my own boyfriend ? No way ! He 'll never take me back ... "

" Veronica , you have to tell him what happened . If he wants to break up with you , it ’ s his loss . You two were meant to be together , and if he doesn ’ t see that then ... I mean, I can ’ t believe we are talking about breaking up ! How ridiculous is this ? "

" He is so perfect for me ! We have so much in common . It ’ s not fair ... "

" Veronica , I think you should talk to him . If he wants to end things then you have nothing else to lose . "

" Yeah, but what if he finds out about the other guy ? Or worse, what if he sees how much weight I ’ ve gained ? Oh my God ! "

" You look gorgeous ... you always do . "

" But...what if I don ’ t know how to tell him ? What am I supposed to say ? That it was all a mistake and that I miss him terribly ? Will he be angry ? Will he break up with me for good this time? I just can't deal with this ... "

" Veronica, you have to confront your problems . If you don ’ t take any action, they will always be there . Trust me, I know. "

" He is the most perfect guy on earth ! You love him so much , and he loves you back . Do you think I would make this up ? There is nothing wrong with you - you look beautiful just the way you are ... And no, if he breaks up with you it ’ s not because of your weight , or anything else for that matter. He has his own reasons . You will learn to live without him one day . "

" I know , but right now I can ’ t do it ! It just feels like the end of the world ... "

" The only thing you have to lose is your ego ..."

" Ego ? I don’t think so...I ’ ve lost everything already ... my dignity, my self-esteem and my dreams ..."

" You don ’ t have to do it now . Why don ’ t we leave all this for tomorrow ? It might help you clear your head a bit more . "

" But I don ’ t wanna wait any longer ! What if he already moved on ? Maybe he doesn ’ t even care about me anymore ..."

" Veronica, you have to trust yourself , and what you know is right . You are strong enough to do this . And if he cares for you like you think he does, then he will wait for you forever if that ’ s what it takes . "

" But I can ’ t just walk away from him ! What would people say ? That I am such a loser ..."

" If you want to be with him , nothing should stand in your way . Nothing . You have to do this . "

" Do you honestly think that he is worth all the trouble, and all the pain? All those nights we ’ ve spent together ? He has ruined everything ... I mean, I cheated on him ! That was such a mistake . What am I supposed to tell him? How do I explain myself ? And then what? Do I still stay with him? Or do I walk away? Oh my God , it hurts so much just thinking about this ... "

" Veronica, you have to be brave and stand up for yourself . You need to talk to him . It ’ s the only way to move on. "

" But what if he doesn’t want me ? What if he hates me now ? I mean, how could he ever forgive me? How will it even work out with us together? Everything is ruined ..."

" Veronica , you have to be strong . And you have to believe in yourself ! You are worth everything! "

" But what if he breaks up with me again ? It ’ ll hurt so much...I can ’ t take it anymore. I don ’ t think I could ever recover from this ..."

" Veronica, listen to me . You will be fine without him , I promise you that . You have a good life ahead of you and you are strong enough to make it through this . "

" But what if he doesn ’ t come back ? What if I never see him again? Oh my God ! I can ’ t deal with this ... I can ’ t breathe anymore...I don ’ t wanna live without him ..."

" Veronica , you have to face your problems . You need to find the strength within yourself to move on from all of this. "

" But how ? How could I ever do that? There is no way! I mean, why did this happen in the first place? Was it meant to be? Did God send me this guy just so I could suffer and break up with him again?"

" Veronica , you need to have faith . It will all work out somehow ... "

" But what if it doesn ’ t? What if he moves on without me? Or worse, what if he never wants anything else from me ever again ? Then what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for him to call? Forever? I can ’ t breathe...I can ’ t go through this ..."

" Veronica , you have to face your fears . You need to take action ! "

" But why ? What good will it do me? I mean, how am I supposed to move on from him if he doesn ’ t want anything else with me ever again? And what about my other problems? There is no way out of here ... I can ’ t go through this anymore ..."

" Veronica , you have to be strong . "

" But I just don ’ t know how to do that ! I mean, I feel so broken inside right now ... How am I supposed to even get up in the morning when my entire world is crumbling around me? And then what ? What happens after tomorrow? Will he forgive me for being so stupid and cheating on him? Or will he just move on without me forever? No , I can ’ t deal with this ... it hurts too much ! "

" Veronica , you have to do something about your problems . You have to make the first step in order to find out what happens next . "

" But why would he want anything else from me after all that? What if I never hear from him again ? That ’ s just too painful ..."

" Veronica, you will be okay . And one day , you might even fall in love with someone new and have a beautiful family of your own . "

" But...I can ’ t see past him. It ’ s like everything else doesn ’ t exist anymore ! I mean, what is the point? How am I supposed to find happiness again if he breaks my heart so badly that it hurts just thinking about him ?"

" Veronica , you will be okay . "

" But how can you be sure of that? I mean...what do you know? I 've been through this before and nothing ever works out for me ..."

" You have to take the risk ! I believe in you . If anyone can make it through this , then it ’ s definitely you . "

" But why me ? Why does everything happen to me? Do I deserve all of these problems? Is it just my luck that he would cheat on me and break up with me again? Am I the only one who goes through life without ever being happy? What if this is how things will always be for me ..."

" Veronica , you have to fight ! Don ’ t give up yet . "

" But why not? Nothing makes sense anymore! This isn’t how my life was supposed to turn out. I thought it would be so much better than this...I mean, if there is a God then where is he right now when I need him most ? What good will come of all of this? I can ’ t do this any longer ..."

" Veronica , you have to believe in yourself . You are strong enough ! "

" But how am I supposed to feel better about myself if everyone else hates me so much? Why would he want anything from me again after everything that happened? How could he ever forgive me for what I did to him ... or even love me the way I do ? He has ruined my life forever now...I can ’ t deal with this ..."

" Veronica, you have to stop feeling sorry for yourself ! You need to take action if you want things in your life to change . "

" But how? It ’ s like everyone is against me or something! I mean, what am I supposed to do about my problems now ? If he doesn ’ t even care enough about me then why should I bother trying anymore ? What good will come of this for either one of us? There is no point in me even getting out of bed tomorrow...it hurts too much ..."

" Veronica , you have to find the strength within yourself . You need to take action ! "

" But what if it ’ s
