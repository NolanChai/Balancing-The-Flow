Don ’ t be ridiculous ! What makes you think that ? I ’ ve known him for years and I know how much he loves you . 

 Yes , but now I ’ M starting to doubt everything . You don ’ t think we could still end up together ?

 You can if you let me help you out of this rut ! Take my advice : just go home and take a break from thinking about him . That way you’ll have time to get over the hurt , and then when he calls it won ’ t be so hard . 

 So what do I tell him ? 

 Well, if you don ’ t want me to answer that for you then I guess there ’ s nothing left to say !

Just relax ! Take a deep breath and don ’ t worry about it . If you start to panic , everything is gonna be even worse . 

 Okay , thanks.I should go . 

 Yeah,but if there’s anything I can do , let me know ? 

 Oh , of course ! You ’ re my best friend . Thanks for being here when I needed you the most . 

 Sure thing . I love you ! See ya .

 Bye. 

 The next dialogue is between a couple that has broken up and is trying to work things out.

I'm so sorry for not replying earlier. I was busy with my exams, but now it’s all over! And here we are again talking about the same thing as always: what went wrong in our relationship. Well, if you want to be honest with me, then I have some news for you - we're just not compatible anymore. I know it hurts, but that doesn't change the fact that I think this is the best thing for us both and that it's time to move on with our lives.

Well, I guess there’s no point in arguing about who was at fault because I already decided what I wanted to do: leave you behind once and for all. I hope we can still be friends though?

I will always love you!

Stop crying ! I know you love him , but if he doesn ’ t come back to you then maybe you shouldn ’ t be together anyway . 

 ... You sound angry . How could you ever say something like that ? It hurts so much more when someone says those things about us than when they leave ! We were supposed to spend our lives with each other ! I can’t believe he ’ s doing this ! He never even told me we were on a break ! 

 You did tell him you wanted to take a break , remember ? And after the fight you had ... 

 I don ’ t care what happened between us . The point is that I love him and he knows it! 

 Well then why didn ’ t you say something about it if you loved him so much? You know how hard he was trying to make things work , right ? And he wanted a break as well ... 

 No ! This isn’t happening ! This can ’ t be real . He can ’ t just do this to me ! What kind of person does that ? I don ’ t want to live like this anymore!

Honey , it ’ S ok . Let ’ s just start again from zero. Let him explain what’s going on and then we can figure out how to move forward. 

 It ’ S too late for that ! You don ’ t understand ! This is the last time I get to talk with you ... ever !
