Yes, a sitcom is short for 'situation comedy.' 

 So what does that mean? 

 A situation comedy is a type of television show where funny things happen. 

 Like The Simpsons , or Seinfeld . 

 You know, I like those shows too, but my favorite TV comedies are the ones about doctors and hospitals. 

 Why don't you watch them? 

 I'm afraid of needles and blood .

The audience doesn't like the sitcoms ? 

 Not really . They prefer more dramatic stories . But the TV industry has been trying to introduce some American style sitcoms , hoping they will get popular in Taiwan too. 

 What do you think of that? Do you think Americans are better at making comedy shows than we are? 

 Well, I've watched a lot of American TV and I don't think Americans have any advantage when it comes to sitcoms . 

 Really ? Why not ? 

 Because the content is pretty similar to our local shows in Taiwan. If you look at all the famous US comedy series , they are all based on stories about family and daily life problems . They all make fun of human weaknesses . So I don't think the American style is that different from ours . 

 Oh, so there aren't any differences ? Then why does America produce a lot more sitcoms than we do? 

 It's probably because they have better technology and equipment . They are able to make better quality shows which attract more people.
