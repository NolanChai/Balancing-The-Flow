" Maybe you like sitcoms better . "

" I don't think so ! "

" Then what do you watch ? "

" Mainly news programs or documentaries . "

" What about comedy shows , there are plenty of them on TV here as well . "

" Not really . Most of the ones that are on nowadays aren't very funny . And when I want to see a good movie , I just rent one at Blockbuster Video . "
