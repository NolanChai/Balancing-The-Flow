We have a lot in common and we respect each other .

I can't stand being treated unfairly, so I don't get along with him.

I'm glad we are on the same side . 

 You don't need to give me any further advice.

 I am sorry for what happened . 

 We won't be able to talk today . 

 She doesn't like being treated unfairly, so she doesn't get along with him.

I think that we have a lot in common and we respect each other.

He asked her out , but she said no thanks .

 It's too expensive for us to go there. 

 We'll talk about it later .

I don't feel comfortable with you talking to me like that .

 He'll be home tomorrow morning and I will take him to the airport.

 You are my best friend, but we have a lot in common and we respect each other.
