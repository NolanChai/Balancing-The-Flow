My baby is fine and healthy . 

Thanks for taking care of her ! You are a nice and caring woman . 

Please tell me when will I be able to meet your son again? 

I hope that you enjoy the book . 

Good morning , thanks for meeting me today. 

Wow ! This is my first time here . 

May I ask why are you looking for this ? 

The car has been repaired and will be ready to go on Friday. 

What's up ? What happened? 

I have never seen anything like it. 

I am so sorry, I did not mean to make you angry . 

Please forgive me for my bad behavior ! 

I think the movie was interesting , but the acting was terrible . 

That is so good of you . You are a nice person . 

Oh ! Please help me with this . It's driving me crazy. 

Is there anything I can do to repay your kindness? 

This is my first time here , but I know where to go now . Thank you for your guidance . 

What a great deal, thanks ! 

Wow! This is the most beautiful dress that I have ever seen. 

I am sorry that I got lost in the park today . 

There are so many people here, it's hard to find one person at this time of day. 

It's no problem for me , please do not worry about this . 

Don't get worried . Please don't be too sad over my accident. 

Oh! I am sorry ! This is the first time that I have been here and didn't know what to expect . 

Thank you so much for being such a great friend to me . 

What kind of work do you like most? 

How did you manage to learn this language in such a short period of time? 

That is the best gift I ever got from my parents. 

I wish that you could go with me today , but it's too far away . 

Are you coming back to China next year ? 

Do you really think this is better than what we have now ? 

This is my first time in China and I don't know how to get there. 

I think I would like a big house someday with lots of land, but right now I am content living here . 

How many people does your family have? 

Is this the best way to go from the airport to downtown? 

You are welcome to stay with my family anytime , just let me know in advance. 

This is the first time I've ever seen someone break into a car like that . It was crazy ! 

I can't believe how quickly this week went by! Time flies when you're having fun, doesn't it? 

My favorite part of your speech was when you talked about our future together as one family. I love being with you and am excited to see where we go from here! 

That sounds like a great idea ! I think that we should start planning for the wedding . Let me know if there is anything else that we need to do or buy beforehand, because it will be hard once everything gets busy again. 

How was your day? How was work ? 

Do you want to go out tonight? What's on your mind? I hope that everything is all right . 

It's time for me to leave now , but I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. when we start training again. 

I love this city and the people here are really nice . 

How long have you lived in China? 

There is so much that needs to be done, please help me with these things as soon as possible ! 

It's been a while since I last saw my family , but I am planning on going home next week.
