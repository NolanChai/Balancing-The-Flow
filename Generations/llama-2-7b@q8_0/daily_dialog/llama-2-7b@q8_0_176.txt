Ah ! There is one more thing … I think I ’ ve seen him before somewhere . 

 At the airport , you say ? 

 Yes . Maybe at the store or in the street … But I don ’ t know . 

 OK . So he could be tall and dark-haired too ? 

 No … definitely not ! He has blond hair ! 

 Is his name on the door ? 

 It is … but there ’ s no photograph there . 

 So I should go by looks , then? 

 Yes , you can do that if necessary . 

 Well . That will be fine . 

 OK . And what about his wife ? 

 I don’t know . But the last time I saw him he was alone at the airport … 

 Oh ! A man who travels a lot is often alone , I ’ ve noticed that myself . 

 Is she dark or fair-haired ? 

 Fair-haired , for sure . She must be from another country … She has an accent . 

 Do you know what her name is ? 

 Yes , I think it’s Sarah … but I ’ m not sure … It was on a business card she gave me one time … 

 So how will we recognize each other at the airport ? 

 I don ’ t know . You can go by looks , as you said before . But if I see someone like that , I ’ ll be able to tell you …

He will be here tomorrow. 

 What time of the day ? 

 He ’ ll probably arrive at ten o’clock tomorrow morning . 

 Is there anything else we need to know ? 

 We have a meeting with him in my office on Monday afternoon .
