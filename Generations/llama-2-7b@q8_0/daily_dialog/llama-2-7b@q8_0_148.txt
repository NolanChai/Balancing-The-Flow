The second Tuesday of November . 

 Where do you normally vote? At home ? Or at a polling place in your neighborhood ? 

 In my home. 

 But on Election Day, you will have to go to a polling location for your own county. Have you ever done that before? 

 No . I've always voted by mail . 

 Well , you will be going to the polls to vote on November second , so make sure you don’t forget to get your ballot and bring it back by post !

No, please look it up online yourself . 

 Okay, okay. 

 Is the weather going to be good for our party ? 

 I'm not sure about this week , but next week will definitely be nice . 

 But what if the rain starts on Thursday ? 

 Well then it might get a little wet , but that wouldn't matter, would it? 

 That is true. 

 What time are we going to have dinner tomorrow ? 

 I plan to arrive at 7:00 pm . 

 Okay ! So when should I expect you ? 

 Well , it will take me around an hour and a half to get there , so I would guess somewhere between 5:30-6:00 . 

 Great. That works for us too! I'll be home by then .

Yes. 

 It's hard for me to vote because I have a busy schedule, but I'm going to do it ! 

 Do you think it makes any difference if people don't vote in the elections? 

 I think it does . 

 Why ? 

 Because I want my voice heard . 

 Even though I don't like many of the candidates ? 

 Yeah, even then . 

 Do you plan to go out and protest about political issues ? 

 Not really , because they are all corrupt ! 

 Really? Why is that? 

 Because politicians just lie for votes . They don't represent me at all!

What do you think ? 

 I don ’ t know yet, but it sounds like fun ! 

 Are you planning to vote on election day? Of course! Are you?

I plan to; what day is the election? You should know that. Can you just tell me? The election is this Tuesday. Are you serious? I'm not kidding. It's a good thing I asked you. What do you think? I don't know yet, but it sounds like fun!

Well , if you don ’ t know it , there is no sense in asking me ! 

 I guess ! 

 Don ’ t make that face . 

 What ? 

 Just because we are friends doesn ’ t mean I won ’ t tell the truth to your face. 

 Oh . 

 You will probably be voting for Trump , right ? 

 No way ! Why would you say such a thing ? 

 Because he is a better president than Hillary Clinton. 

 Well , I am not convinced that Trump is the best candidate in this race. 

 He has had more experience than any other Republican in politics. 

 But what about his bad reputation for women ? 

 That ’ s not true at all ! 

 Of course, it is true! Look on the internet and you will find many stories of how he mistreated women. 

 I guess you are right , but if we look at that from a different perspective, Trump has been very successful in business. 

 He is probably more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton because she has never worked outside the political system. 

 Okay . We are both entitled to our opinions . Now what about you? Will you vote for Trump or Clinton ?
