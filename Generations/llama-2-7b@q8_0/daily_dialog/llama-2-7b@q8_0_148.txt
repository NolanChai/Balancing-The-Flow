" I can't recall, but it must be today. The polling place for the 7th and 12th wards is at 6206 S. Halsted. It's open from eight 'til ten. You should get there before nine or you might not find a parking space. "

" And what about the 5th ward ? "

" Same thing as with the 7th and 12th . "

" How about the 3rd and the 4th wards ? "

" I'm sorry, but I don't know. You'll just have to figure it out for yourself. "

" But that's ridiculous ! We can't possibly remember all of those places ! What if we don't vote because we just don't know where our polling place is ? That would be a crime ! "

" Oh, but it won't hurt you . You just have to get used to voting. I'll bet in the next election or two you'll remember all of them. "

" That doesn't help us now though . We still don't know where our polling place is ! "

" You should check with your local newspaper, I suppose . They probably list it there somewhere. "

" Do they have the voting locations in the phone book ? "

" Oh no , you can't expect them to have that much information listed. You'll just have to do some hunting on your own. There must be a way for you to find out, though . I wish I could help you, but I just don't know where you vote. Sorry ! "

" And the phone book doesn't list it ? "

" Not that I'm aware of , no . "

" Well, how do I find out my ward anyway ? "

" Oh, well if you really want to get down to those details ... it must be on your tax bill. They have a lot of information listed there. Your house number, street name and ward number should all be right at the top somewhere . There ! That's what I was trying to remember for you. Now do some checking around in that phone book and you should find everything you need to know about where you vote. Good luck with that. "

" You mean they don't list it on a map ? "

" No, I wouldn't think so. That might be a good idea though ... the voting place locations . "

" Yes, and what about absentee ballots ? "

" Well, you could always ask for one of those if you can't make it to your polling place on Election Day. I suppose they have that information listed in their phone book too , but you might want to check with the County Clerk's office or City Hall before you call and see if they need something from you like a letter or something for them to write you back with an absentee ballot request form. It would save you some time, I think ... "

" Are you kidding ? They make me fill out a form to get one of those things ! "

" Really ? That's kinda ridiculous . You'd think that if they sent out absentee ballots for people to vote in the election, it would be as easy as calling and asking them for one. It seems like everyone has a hard time just finding their own polling place these days anyway ! "

" And what about early voting ? I heard you can go down to City Hall or something and get your ballot there already filled out so you don't have to wait on Election Day . Is that true, or was that another rumor ? "

" It's true. You can do it at the County Clerk's office in City Hall if I remember right ... but they do make you fill out a form first so they can send you an early ballot when it gets close to Election Day. I think that's pretty convenient, personally . "

" That is ? "

" Sure . Why not ? You can just take it with you and vote at your convenience. Or if something comes up in the middle of voting , they might even let you just fill out some changes on a separate form and send them back to be updated in the computer. They don't make that easy for people, do they ? "

" Well I guess not . Is there anything else we should know about voting before Election Day ? "

" I think you pretty much have it covered . If you still can't remember where your polling place is located , I suppose you could just ask someone at the County Clerk's office. That would probably be a lot easier than trying to find the answer in that phone book. Good luck ! "

" Yes, why do you ask ? "

" Because I thought it was next week. "

" Well , let's go to the polls then ! "

" Sure thing . "

" Do you think we can vote on a Tuesday ? "

" Why not ? It's a public holiday . "

" OK . I need to get my son ready for school, but I'll be there in the afternoon . "

" And me too. See you there ! "

" What are you talking about ? "

" You said it was in November . "

" Oh , yes , I remember that . "

" That was just last week ! "

" Is that why you forgot ? "

" How could I forget the election ? "

" I don ’ t know how much time we have left to talk . "

" Let me check my watch . "

" You can read it yourself . "

" So, what day is it again ? "

" I already told you. The election is Tuesday ! "

" Are you sure ? "

" Yes , I ’ m positive . "

" Because I thought that it was on Wednesday this week . "

" But you said it was today ! "

" No ! "

" You did say that the election is today ! "

" Oh yes. Well, if I say something like that , you should write down what I tell you. "

" Are you sure that the election is in November ? "

" Yes . "

" That ’ s why I asked . "

" But you still have to vote ! "

" Do you know where my ballot is ? "

" You must be kidding ! "

" How do you like that for a reply ? "

" What are you going to do ? "

" I ’ m just going to the election office to see if I can get another ballot . "

" Do you think they ’ ll let you vote again ? "

" Of course ! "

" If you say so. I hope you find your ballot. "

" Well , at least we still have a week and a half to talk before the election . "

" Don ’ t rush things . Take it slow . "

" Do you have a license for your car ? "

" Well, no one ever stopped me before . "

" You can get fined if you don ’ t carry one . "

" You ’ re just trying to scare me , aren ’ t you ? "

" No ! I ’ m telling you the law is going to change this week and that means you have to pay more for your car insurance . "

" But why ? I don ’ t understand. "

" Do you know how much the car insurance will cost next year ? "

" Not really, but it doesn ’ t seem like too much money . "

" Well, if you had known what to expect , maybe you would have bought a new car . "

" What do you mean ? "

" Didn ’ t your friend tell you that the government is going to put up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel soon ? "

" I guess so, but why are they doing that ? "

" So you don ’ t know what’s happening in your country . "

" Well , it seems like we just can ’ t help it ! We have to pay more for everything because the government is raising our taxes . "

" Is there anything we can do ? "

" No . The only thing you and I can do now is complain . "

" Are you telling me that I don ’ t have any choice in this matter ? "

" You just said so yourself ! It seems like nothing has changed for a long time . "

" So what else am I supposed to do but complain ? "

" It ’ s the only thing left to do . "

" Well, I can at least try to avoid the taxes and the insurance as much as possible . "

" The government is already planning on that . They want everyone to be prepared . "

" So they expect me to change my life ? "

" No . Not exactly . But it would be wise to begin saving money because you might lose your job in the near future . "

" How can I do that ? "

" It ’ s easy . Just buy less food and clothes . You could also stay home on vacation next summer . "

" Are you crazy ? There are no more jobs ! Everyone is getting laid off nowadays. And there won ’ t be any place to go next year either because the government is going to close all those resorts. So it doesn ’ t matter where I spend my vacation ; it will just cost too much money . "

" But what about your car ? You don ’ t need to drive every day ! "

" And why not ? It seems like everyone else does the same thing . If anything, it would be more expensive for me if I stopped driving all of a sudden. At least that way my insurance wouldn ’ t increase anymore. "

" That doesn ’ t make much sense . The government is putting up the price of gas and diesel fuel to encourage people like you not to drive as often . "

" It won ’ t work ! There are more cars than ever on the road today . "

" You think that there will be a lot fewer cars next year ? "

" No one can tell yet how many people will keep their jobs . "

" But I thought they were going to put up taxes in order not to lose too much money when everything gets worse . "

" You know what , it doesn ’ t matter anymore ! At this point, no one knows anything for sure . "

" There ’ s something you could do if the price of gas and diesel fuel continues to go up ; that is, start walking more often instead of driving . "

" I have already started doing that . But it won ’ t be enough to make a difference. And it takes longer than just getting on my bicycle because I can only ride so far in one day and if I walk too much , then it gets really hot outside . "

" You know what ? Maybe you should just give up your car altogether ! "

" What are you saying ? "

" The government is putting up taxes on cars like yours because they want people to buy smaller and less expensive models. If everyone starts buying cheaper cars, then maybe the price of gas won ’ t increase anymore . "

" But there aren ’ t any other cars available ! Everything costs a lot more these days too . And I already told you that it doesn ’ t matter what kind of car we buy because all prices are going up anyway . "

" How can that be ? You said the government was putting up taxes . If anything, they should lower them instead . "

" They did ! But now they have to collect more money from us because there isn ’ t enough revenue coming in anymore. So I guess we are all going to pay even more taxes this year than last year . "

" Well , it looks like I won ’ t be buying anything new until things improve again . "

" They probably never will . If you ask me, they already tried everything ! "

" That can ’ t be true ! There must still be some hope left for us . "

" No ! It doesn ’ t make any sense anymore. I mean , we have been paying more taxes every year for as long as I can remember but nothing seems to change . "

" Why don ’ t you just try and do what the government wants ? "

" They can tell us all they want, it doesn ’ t matter because we are still going to do whatever we want no matter how much money they take away from us. That ’ s why there won ’ t be any difference in this country anymore . It will just keep getting worse and worse until everyone is broke ! "

" You don ’ t really believe that , do you ? "

" I know what I ’ m saying . If things continue like they have been for a long time, then we will soon live in poverty here. And then it doesn ’ t matter anymore whether or not people keep their jobs because no one has any money left to spend . So if everyone continues working at home and not going anywhere , that means there won ’ t be enough revenue coming in from the taxes anyway . "

" Well , I don ’ t know about you but I am already getting tired of all this negative thinking ! It doesn ’ t help anybody when we just keep talking like this . We need to find a way out of this situation before everything gets worse and there are no jobs left anymore ! "

" Yeah . Maybe someone will come up with an idea that actually works ? I don ’ t think so though , because it seems like everyone is just giving up on trying anything new right now . It seems as if people are too afraid to try something different these days . They would rather sit around waiting for things to get better instead of taking action themselves ! "

" You know what ? Maybe we should just forget about everything for a while and take it easy until next year when everything has been sorted out again . I guess that way we won ’ t have any problems anymore . "

" And if that happens , then the government will come up with another plan in order to make us pay more taxes again ! So it doesn ’ t matter what anyone says or does nowadays because there is nothing we can do about this situation anyway ! "

" Well, at least you don ’ t have any reason not to stop complaining anymore . It won ’ t make a difference if people continue to complain like that because they still won ’ t be able to change anything even if they wanted to . "

" Yeah , I know what you mean ! "

" So why are we talking about all this stuff ? You already told me that no one is going to stop complaining in the future either. And there isn ’ t anything else we can do about our situation anyway so why don ’ t we just go home now and relax until everything has been sorted out again next year ? "

" I guess you are right . We should just forget all this for a while because it doesn ’ t really matter anymore ! "

" Yeah , but we still need to get something to eat before going home. At least then we won ’ t have anything to worry about until tomorrow morning . "

" That sounds good ! "

" Well, I guess you are right . It is time for us to go and spend the rest of today together at my place so we can forget about everything else again . "

" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have a lot of homework left over from school tomorrow afternoon though ! So if you want me to do it with you, then we should get started right away ! "

" OK , just give me a little bit more time before starting our homework because my family wants us to spend some time together tonight after dinner . "

" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have some other stuff left over from work too. So if you want me to do it with you, then we should start working on that as soon as possible ! "

" OK , just give me a little bit more time before starting our homework because my family wants us to spend some time together tonight after dinner . "

" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have some other stuff left over from work too. So if you want me to do it with you
