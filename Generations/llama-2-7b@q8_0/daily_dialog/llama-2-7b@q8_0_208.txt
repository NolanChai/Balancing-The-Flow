The boy went out with his skates in a taxi.

He asked for five minutes to think it over, and then he returned .

" I've changed my mind ! " he said to the man .

" I want only two pairs of 21 . The other one will have to do without . "

" I will try and watch them . Now , what about the skates themselves ? "

" Well, I suggest you take the kids around in circles for an hour or so. That should be long enough to see whether the skate is comfortable on their feet. If they want it later, then put it aside for another two hours. Otherwise, just put them back into the rack and get one of the other three pairs . "

" Can't you rent them by the half hour ? "

" Yes , I could , but you see if people don't know how to skate well enough by the end of an hour then they will have wasted a lot of time . So, we have this policy that people must pay for an hour in advance. This is so that the kids can make up their minds without being rushed , and also so that no one is kept on their feet for too long . "

" I understand . Is there anything else you'll need to rent ? "

" Well, two pairs of gloves are important. The first time the kids go out, they may get quite cold. So we recommend that they wear thick leather ones underneath their regular clothes. If you see someone wearing these on a hot day , I suggest you ask them for one . "

" All right . What else ? "

" Well, if the kids are going to fall over quite often then there's no need for any helmets at all. But if they will be skating near to each other, or in some way at risk of hurting themselves , then you should get them a helmet and elbow pads. You can see that the kids who are really good usually wear those too . "

" I'll remember that next time . "

" And make sure they wear their helmets ? "

" Sure ! But don't worry too much. They are beginners. It's not easy for kids of that age to get injured on a skating rink, just because the rules aren't followed very well . "

" I hope you're right . "

" So , what do you want to do ? Just walk around slowly at first ? "

" Yeah. Maybe I could show them how to do that first . "

" Okay then. Let me know if there is any problem. And have a nice day ! "

" Yeah, I know that. What else ? "

" Well , just don't get too excited . It's a good idea to stop for a cup of coffee every now and then . "

" Hey , I haven't had a single cup of coffee in my life ! "

" Then you must go on the first day , so that you can learn how to skate . "

" Oh yeah, and don't forget about the sun cream . It can be really hot here in winter . "

" I'll remember all your advices . "

" Good luck ! Have a nice day ! "
