Sorry we only have adults . 

I'm not an adult , sir. 

 I want to use them with my children . 

 We are out of kids , too . 

I'm a grown woman myself . 

Do you need the same size for all three ? 

Yes . 

How about number fourteen ? 

That will do nicely . 

What do you want to use them for? 

To learn how to skate . 

You can't learn without a partner . 

I have some friends coming with me . 

Well, then , they won't be able to rent any here either . 

My children are at home waiting on me for their breakfasts . 

I want you to give them each a pair and a box of crackers too. 

Don't worry about it . 

That will cost fifty dollars more . 

Just go ahead and charge it to my account . 

Fine , I suppose .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 No problem . Have fun !

 I will . Thanks !

OK. And then ? 

 If something happens and they fall on ice or get hit by another skater , they must be careful of what they land on . 

 I see. And if it's an emergency ? 

 Well, the first thing is to stop immediately, and not go on as long as the accident isn't solved . If a beginner falls and hurts himself in the head , he shouldn't get up before we make sure he isn't concussed . 

 Thank you for your help !

Alright . But what else can go wrong ? 

 You know , those beginners always get overexcited and fall on their behinds . Then they scream like crazy for help and people around start laughing . That's just because they don't understand that falling is normal thing for a beginner to happen . 

 So what should I do if someone falls down ? 

 Well , you can stop him right in the middle of the ice-ring and tell him to wait there until the instructor comes and help him up again . But make sure he doesn't fall into the railings or he will be hurt bad ! 

 Yeah , but I know some kids who just keep on rolling after they fall down . 

 That's a different problem . If you see that happening , stop them immediately and tell to get off the ice-ring as fast as possible . 

 But what if nobody is around ? 

 Then it depends on where are those kids . For example , if there is a railing beside them , they can just roll away from it , and you don't have to do anything . If not , then stop the ice-ring and wait for an instructor . 

 What if some people start laughing at me ? 

 Don't worry about that . The kids won't get hurt by falling , they will just scream a bit and laugh a lot when you help them up again . Just remember to smile and wave good-bye after the lesson is over and everything will be fine !

Got it . And if they get tired and want to stop for a rest, should we head back or just keep going? 

 Let's say you were with them. Stop at the first caf√© , have some coffee, and take a break. Then continue skating till the end of the day .
