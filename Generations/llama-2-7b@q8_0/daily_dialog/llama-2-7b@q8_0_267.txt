I was born in Vancouver , British Columbia.

 Where did you go to high school?

  I went to a private school called Westridge Academy for High School.

 Wow ! How long have you lived here in the states, Paula? 

   It's been about two years .

 What was your major?

    I got my Bachelor of Arts Degree in English Literature and Sociology.

  Where did you get that degree ? 

 I got it from McGill University.

 How long were you there?

   Five years to complete the four year program .

 You must have been very busy ! 

   Yes , I was .

 And then what did you do after graduation, Paula?

    I worked as an intern at a magazine for three months.

 Didn't they offer you a position ?

    No , not yet .

 How long have you been working as a translator now?

   I have been working as a freelance translator for about two years now.

 Are there many jobs out there at this time of year ? 

 Yes , but the competition is tough.

 Have you ever considered opening your own translation company ?

  No .

 What do you think of that?

   I'd rather work for someone else for a few years and then go on my own.

 How did you become interested in this field , Paula?

    When I was growing up in Canada , I had a very supportive family who encouraged me to pursue what I really loved doing - reading, writing and speaking English . 

 So that's when I decided to study English Literature. 

 Where did you attend school ?

   At McGill University .

 What do you like best about your work now?

    I love the fact that I am working with words , using them and helping others to use them more effectively as well.

 How long have you lived in this city, Paula? 

 Since last August , I've been living in Seattle.

 What is the best thing about living here ? 

   The people are very friendly and the climate is wonderful .

 Have you ever thought of going back to your home country and working there? 

    Oh no ! I couldn't imagine leaving this place, even for a visit!

 Well , Paula , thank you so much for your time . 

   Thank YOU. This has been fun .

 What are the differences between the two conversations above ? 

 In Conversation One , each speaker took turns answering the other's questions . In Conversation Two , however, both speakers asked and answered questions simultaneously. 

 In Conversation One , Paula was an employee of a company and did not mention her name . In Conversation Two , she called herself by her first name instead of by her surname - this is because it was more natural and informal for her to talk about herself with a friend rather than a business acquaintance.

 In Conversation One , Paula and the other speaker both took turns answering questions . In Conversation Two , however, she answered most of the questions herself without waiting for any response from the other person.

Six years ago . 

 And what brought you here? 

 I had a job offer at a studio. 

 Did you know anyone in town ? 

 No , but my father's friend lives in L.A., too, and he was helpful to me when I got here. 

 So, is your dad an actor ? 

 Yeah . 

 That must be nice - a lot of perks , right? 

 It's not all perks , believe me ! 

 And how old are you now ? 

 Twenty-four. 

 Do you like acting here in L.A. ? 

 Yes, it's a great town and there are many opportunities for actors . 

 Have you been on T.V. yet? 

 No , but I've had parts in some movies. 

 Is that exciting for you? 

 It can be , yes ! 

 Do you ever get tired of it? 

 No, acting is my life!

No , I went to high school in Vancouver, but I came back for college. 

 When were you a child ? 

 From about eight to sixteen . 

 And how long have you been here now ? 

 Since 1978 . 

 Do you like living in Los Angeles? 

 I think it's great! It has everything ! 

 What do you do for a living? 

 I'm a salesperson . 

 Is there anything else we should know about yourself ? 

 Well, I guess the main thing is that my family and I are big animal lovers. We have a dog , two cats and two parrots. 

 Thank you very much! That was great! Bye-bye !

Yes , as an executive secretary at the local law firm . 

 Have you worked there all these years? 

 No , I left them eight months ago and now I work for a big bank in downtown Los Angeles. 

 Do you like your job better than your previous one? 

 Yes, much more , because my pay is double what it was before and my benefits are better too . 

 How often do you use the library? 

 Not very often . I only go to the library when I need something for a book report. 

 What do you think of this library? 

 It's ok , but they have some problems with the temperature control, sometimes it's too cold and other times it's uncomfortably hot. 

 Have you been to any museums in Los Angeles lately ? 

 Yes , I went to the Museum of Modern Art last week . It was an interesting show . 

 Do you like modern art? 

 I do , but I prefer impressionists better . 

 Are there a lot of good restaurants around here? 

 Oh, yes , there's a great French restaurant near my office that I go to every week . 

 Have you ever gone to the beach ? 

 Of course ! Every Sunday we go and have lunch at the beach cafe . 

 Have you done any travelling ? 

 No , not since college days . Whenever I want to travel somewhere, I just take a bus. 

 Do you like living in Los Angeles ? 

 Yes , I do ! There's always something interesting going on here.

About twenty years ago . 

 Are your parents still living here ? 

 Yes , they are . 

 You don't live with them ? 

 No , I bought a house about three years ago . 

 How long have you been in this office ? 

 Six months . 

 Do you like the work ? 

 It's all right , but it isn't very exciting . 

 Have you had any other jobs besides this one ? 

 I worked as a waitress for two years when I first came here . 

 And what about your husband? 

 He's in the hotel business.  

 Has he always been in that kind of work ? 

 No , he was an engineer before we were married . 

 What does he do now ? 

 Well , he doesn't have a job at the moment because he has been very ill for a long time . 

 Does your husband speak English?  

 Oh, yes , quite well ! He lived in New York for seven years . 

 Where did you meet him ? 

 We met here. He was a guest in my parents' house when we were visiting there together . 

 How long have you been married ? 

 Sixteen months . 

 Do you live with your husband now? 

 No , we are living with his mother right now . 

 Isn't that rather awkward ? 

 It is a little unusual , but it makes me feel very close to my new father-in-law.  

 How long have you been married? 

 Seven months, as of last Tuesday. 

 And how do you like life in the country ? 

 Well . I think that country living is a lot better than city living , but I don't know if it's any healthier . 

 Where did you spend your honeymoon? 

 We went to Europe, first to France and then to Italy. 

 How long were you there for ? 

 About ten days.  

 What did you do after that? 

 I stayed at home with my mother-in-law. 

 Are your husband's parents still living in the old house on Washington Avenue? 

 Yes , they are . 

 How long have his parents been there ? 

 My father-in-law has lived there for twenty years and my mother-in-law has lived there almost all her life.  

 How long were you in school after graduation from high school? 

 I went to college for about three years , but I didn't graduate . 

 Didn't your parents think that you should have graduated ? 

 They had wanted me to go on and get a doctorate degree. But I did not feel like getting a job after my third year in college, so I came home and went into the beauty shop business with a friend of mine .  

 Did you work by yourself? 

 No , we worked together. We rented rooms in an old house that was owned by one of our relatives . 

 When did your husband tell you he wanted to get married ? 

 I think that my parents suggested it at about the same time, but I didn't give any real thought to the matter until last October when his parents invited us both to spend a weekend with them in the country. 

 What do you like best about your husband?  

 Well , he is very considerate . He always thinks of other people before himself . 

 And what's one thing that annoys you most ? 

 His forgetfulness, I think. For example , I have had to remind him three times this week already to give me my allowance for groceries!  

 Would you rather live in the country or in a town? 

 I'd like to stay here, but if it were possible we would probably move back to Chicago next year. I've been thinking of getting out of retail business and going into office work.  

 Do you think your husband wants children? 

 Oh , yes, he would love to have children . He is such a good father! When he was teaching in the high school he used to bring home all sorts of things that the children had made at school for us to see and admire. And now that he's an engineer with an airline company his work takes him away from home quite often, but we still manage to spend most evenings together as a family.  

 Do you think your husband's job is very important ? 

 Oh , yes , I do ! He has always wanted to be an engineer and he works very hard at it .

I worked on an archaeological dig at the base of Mount Vesuvius for a few months , and then I lived with my grandmother in Rome for about two months . 

 Do your parents live here? 

 No , they're still living in Canada. 

 How do you keep in touch ? 

 We e-mail each other a lot, and they come down to visit once or twice a year . 

 Do you plan to stay here for the rest of your life? 

 Well, I don't know ... I think that it would be nice if I could travel around again , but maybe I will move back up north someday.
