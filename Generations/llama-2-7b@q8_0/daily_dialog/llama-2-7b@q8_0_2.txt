Tim left with Karen, and then went to bed, but he could not sleep.He was worried that Karen would never call him again, but she did on Monday afternoon,and they made a date for Wednesday night . They had a good time at the movies ,but as soon as it was over Tim asked her to drive out to a little beach about twenty miles from town where he said there were some great cliffs and secluded coves. She agreed to do so without questioning why.

When they got to the beach,they found that it had a nice sandy beach and lots of shells in the tide pools , but they did not find anything else to occupy their time there except each other. Karen was glad she had worn her bathing suit underneath her clothes , so she put it on with Tim's help,and after he helped her down from the sand dune where they were sitting,they went into the water .
It was a warm summer day and the water felt good when you got into it.The tide was out pretty low and there was not much surf to speak of.They had some difficulty getting their clothes off because they were stuck on each other,but Tim eventually helped her get free and then they went swimming together.Karen did not know how to dive in the water yet ,so she just floated around at first,then when she got tired she tried diving underwater,and she discovered that it was much easier than she had thought it would be .
After a while Tim asked her if she wanted to go swimming with him out past the breakers where there were some good cliffs and deep water.She said yes ,so he put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her towards the edge of the water,and then they both began swimming toward deeper water .
They did not talk at all while they were swimming out in the ocean;they just swam side by side and occasionally they would look over at each other.Karen was glad that Tim had worn his bathing trunks because she did not want to be seen in her suit,and since he was older than she was ,he might think it was a little strange if she were wearing one .
The deeper they went the better they both liked the water;it was so clear and clean.There was nothing like swimming underwater with no one around you at all except your partner to make you feel real good about yourself.After about fifteen minutes of swimming ,Karen started feeling a little tired,so she asked Tim if he would go back in towards shore with her .He told her it was OK and then they both turned around and swam back toward the beach where Karen had left her suit on the sandy part of the shore.
When they got there ,Tim put his arm around her shoulders again,and walked her up to the top of the dune where they could get a good view of everything from above;the beach,the water,and even some houses nearby with people in them .It was so peaceful and quiet there ,it made you want to stay forever.
"You know what I wish , Karren?" Tim said, looking out into the distance. "I wish we were here all day long just like this.""That would be nice , wouldn't it?" She answered,looking up at him.He smiled and then held her in his arms tightly as he kissed her on the neck;her cheeks blushed red with embarrassment.She could feel how much she liked being with him again,and she had to fight back her own feelings of desire for him because they were both still too young to be doing this kind of thing together .
Karen's mother was at home when Tim dropped Karren off after their date on Wednesday night, and she asked him if he wanted to come in for something to drink.He told her no thanks ,that he had better go before anyone else came out looking for him;his father would probably be up soon because it was getting late already .She said OK then ,and told Karen good-bye as she walked away from the doorstep with Tim,and she waved good-bye back at them both.
The next morning when Tim got to school he was very tired from being awake all night long thinking about Karren;he fell asleep during his first period class and had to be woken up by his teacher.His mother asked him how the date went last night,and he told her it had been a really good time . She smiled at him with pride knowing that her son was becoming more likeable every day ,but then she remembered something else."Oh my God,Tim!You're not going to tell me that you and Karren got together again? I thought we agreed last week when we talked about this that it would be better if you just stayed away from her ."
"Mom,don't worry . I am not doing anything with Karren;I don't even know where she lives ,and anyway she's too young for me."He said ,staring at his shoes.She looked up at him in surprise."What do you mean?"She asked ,handing him a cup of coffee that she had just made. "Well,she told me last night on our way home from the movie theatre about how old she is;it's only three years younger than I am so it doesn't make any difference at all."
"You're kidding!Why would you do something like that? She's not even seventeen yet!"She shouted angrily. "I don't care what age she is;I just wanted to get her off my back because she was always calling me and asking me out for another date ."
"Well,OK then."He said ,looking down at his shoes again. She stared at him in disbelief,then went upstairs to talk to Karren on the phone about what Tim had done ,but when she got there Karen had already hung up without even saying good-bye .She tried calling back several times but there was no answer each time;finally after half an hour of trying she gave up and decided to go out for dinner instead with her parents like they had planned beforehand.
The next day Tim didn't go to school because he felt sick again ,and his mother told him that if he wanted her to let him see Karren again then he should talk to her about it himself ."You know what ? I think she's too young for you anyway;I don't want anything bad happening between the two of us."She said firmly before walking away from their conversation in the living room.Tim sat alone in his bedroom listening to music on headphones until evening came when he decided that since nothing was going right today,he might as well try talking to Karren one more time;maybe she would have changed her mind by then .
When Tim got home after work on Friday night ,Karren was already there waiting for him at the doorstep with flowers in her hands and a big smile on her face.He took them from her without saying anything before leading her into his house where they sat down together to talk about what had happened between them while he was gone all day today .It seemed like forever since last week when things went wrong between them ,and now that she knew how old he was she didn't mind spending more time with him;it would only make their relationship easier for everyone involved.
They talked until late at night before going out to eat dinner together again like they had done the other day,then came back home where Tim helped Karren take off her clothes and get into bed .As soon as they were both in bed ,she reached over and turned on some music on his laptop computer so that he could watch some videos online while she fell asleep beside him ;it wasn't until later when they woke up early next morning before anyone else came home from work,that Tim realized how close they had actually become during these last few days .
At lunchtime on Saturday ,Tim brought Karren out to a small park near their house where there were some benches and swings for them to sit down upon ;he told her that he was thinking about going away somewhere far away from everything so as not to hurt anyone else around him again like what happened last year with his family after his father's death .She said nothing until they got back home ,but then she sat there quietly waiting while Tim explained how he felt about the whole thing,and then finally asked her if she wanted them both to leave together or just stay at their own house without telling anyone else where they had gone .
Karren looked up at him with sad eyes for a moment before answering :"Well ,Tim ,I think we should go somewhere far away from here . Maybe someplace like Las Vegas ?"He smiled as he nodded his head in agreement ;it seemed like she was finally starting to understand how important it was that they spent more time together without worrying about anything else besides their own happiness.
The next day ,they took a plane ride out West towards California where Tim had visited before with some friends during college .It wasn't until after he got home however,that he realized what Karren meant by saying she wanted him to take her away from everything because once they arrived at their destination ,she told him that this was going to be our new home !
As time went on and things became easier between them both,he began feeling more comfortable with the idea of living together forever without ever having to worry about what might happen if he left again .They both agreed that one day soon they would like children too ,so they decided to start trying as
