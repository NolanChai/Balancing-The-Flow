### 6. Conversation between a student and a teacher

" What is your English name? "

" My English name is Tom. "

" Your first name is Thomas ? "

" Yes , that's right . "

" Very well ! I see you are from Britain . How long have you been in our country ? "

" About six months . "

" Six months! It seems like only yesterday when you came to school. You know, we have some British students here , do you think they can speak Chinese? "

" Of course they can . There are many good teachers in our school. They will teach us their mother tongue . I am sure it would be a big benefit for my study later on . "

" Yes , and that is true . What about your English class today ? "

" My teacher is a very kind person. She always encourages me to practice English more often after the lesson every day . So far, I can speak with her in English now . I am going to learn some Chinese from her too . "

### 7. Conversation between two friends

" Hey , what's new ? "

" Nothing much . Let me tell you what happened yesterday . When I got on the subway, I met a man who looked familiar to me . He said he was from Japan , so he didn't understand Chinese . That is why we couldn't talk to each other . But that guy gave me his business card and said it might be useful for us in the future . "

" Wow ! How come? "

" Because there are more Japanese people here now , I think he can help me communicate with them if necessary . "

" Oh, great ! Anyway , you know what I did last week ? I went to a concert . That was so cool ! The performance really impressed me . "

" Did you have a good seat ? "

" Actually, it wasn't that good because the concert hall was almost full. But the stage effect was incredible . I could even feel the energy of music from my seat . "

" That must have been amazing ! Have you ever been to any other kind of performance? "

" Sure , there is a big musical festival coming soon in our city . You know, this will be held at the football stadium . I hope to go and see it . "

### 8. Conversation between two parents

" Have you heard that your son's school has organized a foreign exchange program ? "

" No , I have not seen his school file yet today . But what is this about? "

" You will get one if there are any activities for your son at school . So, here it is. It says there will be students from Britain coming over next month to our country . Your child's class will send him to the airport to welcome them when they arrive on Monday night . That must be a very exciting and interesting experience ! "

" I am sure you are right , but my son is only eight years old and he doesn't know how to speak English yet . He may be too shy to talk to foreigners . "

" Well, don't worry about that. He will have a chance to learn more about other countries during this program . Maybe he can also get some help from his English teacher at school in the future . It's not difficult for kids nowadays , is it ? "

" You might be right . Let me call your son and tell him what you are talking about here . "

### 9. Conversation between a parent and their child

" Good morning, son ! Did you have fun with your friends yesterday? "

" Oh , yeah. I am really tired after playing all day long with my classmates . I was so happy to spend the whole day in the playground . "

" I know how you feel . But what about today? You will go to school as usual , right ? "

" Yeah . It's been a good holiday. Now, it is time for me to study again . "

" OK . By the way, do you remember what we talked about yesterday? "

" Of course I do ! "

" You will go out and meet some foreign students coming over from Britain on Monday night next week , won't you ? "

" Wow! That is so cool ! Do they speak Chinese? "

" Yes . And that's why we asked them to come here to teach our kids how to communicate with foreigners later . So, I think your English class should be a big benefit for you , don't you think ? "

" Of course it is ! If those students can speak Chinese and teach us in the future , I am sure my English will improve quickly then . "
