But you can't stand the way he treats me. 

 Yes but it's not about that. He just doesn't give me enough credit ! I want him to recognize my work and all my good ideas ! I think it's time to move on . 

 Oh I see , well you should talk with him first ! Maybe he can't see your hard work. 

 But no Sandra ! You don't get what is going on here ! He only sees himself, I don't exist . If Tim wants me to leave then it will be the best thing that could ever happen for me !

Well , Tim has been making inappropriate comments. 

 To me ? 

 No ! To everyone else . He makes offensive remarks about everybody - except for you and your friends . 

 You're being paranoid . I mean ... it doesn't always mean something bad when someone is nice to you , does it ? 

 Maybe not . But he really is a jerk . And it seems like every day there's some new rumor about him doing something stupid . 

 You can't just quit ! If everybody quits then what are we going to do ? We have no choice - Tim will be gone by Monday anyway. 

 You think so ? What makes you think that ? 

 I heard that they're all planning a surprise party for him and it's going to be a huge embarrassment ! And I hear the boss is going to fire him . 

 Seriously ? How did you find out about this ? 

 Word travels fast in an office like this . It's going to happen . Trust me. 

 I think you might be right ... but I don't know if I can handle another week of his annoying behavior.

He tells people that I'm unreliable and uncooperative when we work on projects together. He's spreading lies about me ! 

 I can't believe Tim is doing this to you . You've always been a great team player here at the office ! 

 Yeah , but now that he knows I'm capable of taking his position , he doesn't want it anymore. 

 Maybe we should talk to him and find out what he thinks ? 

 Yeah ... maybe that will help us resolve this problem .

You should have let her go ... If someone can't work without stepping on others, then they don't belong there . 

I guess you're right ... Maybe I will quit ! 

No Sandra , you won't quit ! Tim may be a jerk but he's not the problem here. You are!
