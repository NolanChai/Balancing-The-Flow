" Well , I feel like everybody is against me. They want to pull me down so they can get ahead themselves."

" Sounds like your coworkers have a lot of jealousy issues . Have you ever thought that it may be something in the way you behave at work ? "

" No ... never ! I'm just doing my job ! I try to keep my head down and do what I'm told. And look , I have 4 years experience working for this company . I know what I'm doing ! "

" It might help if you tried to take on more responsibility . Tim has a lot of confidence in you and he will be happy to give you the chance. "

" Not this time ! No way ! I just had it with that guy ! He thinks he can walk all over me because he's my boss ! "

" Well , I don't think your relationship is healthy enough for you to leave your job."

" Oh ... and what would be a healthier relationship ? "

" No , he just tries to keep the workload off me and make my life miserable ! "

" Hmm ... that's not very nice . I guess if it's too much for you then you should quit . But I think Tim is doing his job just as well as you are and he doesn't really want to lose you either."

" Yeah ... I think Tim does the same thing. I even heard him bragging about how good his ideas are and how all his bosses love him ! "

" Well , if he's trying to sabotage your career you have to be very careful what you say around him . "

" Yeah ... but it's not just Tim. It seems like the whole department is against me! Every time I get an idea, everyone starts giving me all these reasons why it won't work ! "

" But Sandra , that's your job ! To come up with ideas and make them happen . If they don't listen to you, then you should go over their heads."
