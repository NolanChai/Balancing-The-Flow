### Reentry Permit

Someone who has lived in the United States as a student, visitor or another temporary nonimmigrant may be eligible for a reentry permit if they need to leave the country and return before their I-94 expires. There is no application for this permit; the immigration officer will grant it when the person returns at the port of entry. The reentry permit allows that person to stay out of the United States for up to two years without losing his or her nonimmigrant status, but not longer than one year beyond what was allowed on their original I-94.

### Advance parole

A person who is a refugee or an asylee and needs to travel outside of the United States for humanitarian reasons may apply for advance parole (a written statement granting reentry to the U.S.) before leaving the country. In this case, the applicant must obtain a new immigrant visa from their home country's embassy in order to return to the United States as an immigrant after living abroad.

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Temporary protected status is granted when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that the temporary conditions that have caused a foreign country to be designated for TPS no longer exist, or if the country is unable to handle returning its nationals adequately.  This is only given to those who entered legally in order to escape persecution, and are not eligible for adjustment of status because they cannot demonstrate that they would otherwise have a "bona fide" relationship with family or a job in the United States.

### Refugee Adjustment of Status (AOS)

Refugees who wish to become permanent residents after living in the U.S. as refugees may apply for adjustment of status through USCIS. They must be physically present in the U.S. and have maintained legal status during their stay. The application process can take several months, but there is no fee if filed on or before April 30, 2017; after that date a $680 fee will apply.

### Asylee Adjustment of Status (AOS)

Asylees who wish to become permanent residents after living in the U.S. as refugees may apply for adjustment of status through USCIS. They must be physically present in the United States and have maintained legal status during their stay. The application process can take several months, but there is no fee if filed on or before April 30, 2017; after that date a $680 fee will apply.
