Well, actually , my brother has offered me his place to stay while I’m there . He owns a house in Minneapolis and it sounds like he won’t be needing it until at least the summer so that works out great ! 

 That ’ s fantastic ! And , you say your brother is a US citizen ? 

 Yes, my brother is a United States citizen . He was born in Minneapolis and has been living there for about twenty years now . 

 Excellent ! Well then , that would mean you have no need to obtain any additional documentation before I can approve your visa . 

 Great ! I ’ ll go ahead and take care of everything else here today and give it back to you when i ’ m finished . 

 Okay, great! Thank you very much. Have a good day. 

 You too . Thanks again for your help !

Well , I ’ ll be leaving my wife and two-year-old son behind at home . My brother and sister-in-law are looking forward to meeting them , of course , but I know they miss their mother every day . 

 But why will it take you so long to return ? 

 I have a great opportunity that could change my life forever . It ’ s an offer for me to work at one of the best companies in my country . 

 What kind of company is this ? 

 It ’ s called , uh … 

 No , wait ! You can not tell us about any details . We need to be sure that your intentions are purely tourism. Now , if you will not mind , could we take a look at your travel plans please ? 

 Of course . Here is my itinerary for my first week in the United States : I ’ ll fly into Chicago on March twenty-second and then head to Minneapolis where my brother lives . Then I plan to visit Niagara Falls , New York City, Philadelphia … 

 Well , that sounds like an interesting trip . 

 Yes it does . And next week , while I am in the United States , I ’ ll visit Los Angeles and Las Vegas . Then I ’ ll be traveling back home to my family on the twenty-sixth of March . 

 Alright ! Thank you so much for your time. We look forward to seeing you here at our embassy tomorrow morning . Good luck with everything !

Well , here ’ s my last two pay slips from the Tornal and a letter from the company confirming that I am an employee . It also says that they will be happy to help me if any problems arise with the visa . 

 Okay , let ’ s take a look at your passport photo. 

 There seems to be something missing ? Oh yes ! I ’ m missing my birth certificate , which I was hoping would have come through the mail today but it hasn’t arrived yet . 

 You said that you were born in San Francisco California . Is that correct ? 

 Yes ! That ’ s right . It ’ s a city by the sea. It has good restaurants and nice people . 

 So , how did your parents meet ? 

 I suppose at a party of some sort or other. 

 And when were they married ? 

 That was on August seventh, nineteen-eighty-four . 

 When was the first time you traveled to United States ? 

 Actually , the second time I ever left my home country was for a vacation in Canada. I went with my mother and father when I was ten years old. It ’ s a beautiful country, but it ’ s freezing cold in the winter ! 

 How many times have you visited America since that first trip ? 

 Oh , at least fifteen times . My family has been here so often that we know our way around just fine . We even have our own favorite restaurants and shops. 

 Well, it seems that you like the United States ! Is there anything else you ’ d like to add ? 

 Yes . I want to thank you for your time , and for your help in preparing my B2 visa application . I ’ ll be sure to bring a letter from the company when I pick up the passport at Tornal ’ s office.
