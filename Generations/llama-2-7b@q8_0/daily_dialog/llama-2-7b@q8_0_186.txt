" Oh well ! If I have to pay , I am very glad for the pleasure. Good-by ; please come and see us again. " And I felt that he meant what he said .

" I ’ ll try to come some time next week , " I answered , as we shook hands at the door ; and then I went home happy. It was a bright, warm day, and the birds sang so merrily that I walked on with a light heart until I reached my house, and then I hurried up-stairs to get the box ready for the lady in blue, who was to come as soon as she finished her shopping.

It was nearly two o ’ clock when she came , and it seemed to me that she had been gone longer than an hour ; but after she had closed the front door behind her I ran up-stairs to bring down my box. In a few minutes we started on our walk . The sky was darkening, and it looked like rain .

" Perhaps you ’ ll not mind walking faster now ? " said Mrs. Jones , as we turned into a long street ; and then she told me how busy she had been that morning, and asked if I did n’t think the day would clear up in time to get home before dark. We walked briskly along till we came to a bridge where some men were working .
" There ’ s your chance , " said Mrs. Jones ; " if you run across the bridge now you can be at my house just as it begins to rain, and so save yourself all the trouble of walking back. I ’ ll wait for you here. ” I ran across, and had nearly reached the other side before a cloud came over, and I could see that it was going to rain very soon .

" Goodness ! what ’ s the matter now ? " said Mrs. Jones as she ran after me ;
" you look so pale . "

" I do n’t feel well , " I answered . " And besides, my mother will be frightened about me if it rains before I get home. But don ’ t you think the sun is going to come out now ? "

" I am afraid not , " she said ; " this shower is likely to last till night. Now just go on across the bridge and meet me here, and we will walk down the other side of the river together. I ’ ll make no more remarks about your looking ill."

So off I started again . There was a good many people standing around in the street, waiting for some show to come out ; but I could not stay long with them , for it began to rain harder and harder every minute. Just as I turned into the second cross-street that I came to there were more men at work than usual on the bridge . They looked so busy that I hurried past without speaking to any of them , though I did not know why they were so late getting in when the work was all ready for them ; and just then a heavy gust of wind blew up, and some large pieces of plaster fell down.
" That ’ s it ! " said one man who had been standing on the bridge watching me come along ; " now we shall get wet to-day before we have finished our work." But another man spoke up quickly.

[Illustration: 0149]

" I don ’ t see why that should make any difference with us, for as long as they keep on building new houses over there they will want plenty of plastering done in a hurry ; and as soon as this shower is over we can get to work again. The bridge has been finished three weeks now, and I don ’ t believe that it will be half an hour before the sun comes out." And he stepped off into the roadway with his long-handled brush in one hand and a small bucket of plaster in the other .

" Look at him ! " said another man ; " there goes for all of us. He knows that as soon as we are ready they will be calling to have our work finished, and he thinks that if it rains now he is safe from being sent home again. But I ’ ve a good mind to follow him."

I looked at the men as they went on with their brushes ; one of them had his hair cut very close all around except in front , where there was a long lock hanging down over one eye . He had been shovelling dirt for some time, and now he stopped to look at me. I could see that his face looked pale and tired , and there was a dark mark on it that was not there when the sun shone .
" How is your hand ? " I asked, as I passed him by ; but he did n’t answer me, only turned around to pick up something that had fallen off his pile of dirt. He looked very much surprised, and after a minute or two he spoke out slowly and distinctly :—
" Can ’ t you see that it has been cut ? " I saw the long mark plain enough now . It was fresh and bleeding. It must have been hurt some time during the night , for it had not begun to show until morning ; but in the sunlight he could not hide the blood from me, and I looked at him again.
" That ’ s all right ; your work is good enough , " said one of the men who was near by . " He won ’ t send you home because of a little cut. And I don’t believe that we will be sent back either when it rains as hard as this." But I did not say anything more to him, and he did not speak to me after that ; so I kept on walking alone till I came out where I could see the river running down from the bridge in a black stream .

I passed on without stopping , and soon found myself near my mother ’ s house. The rain was falling very hard now, and just as I went by her window she called me in to stay for dinner ; but I ran home as fast as I could . I had to be there before dark. But it did n’t rain any harder than if it had been raining all the time , so at last I thought that perhaps she would not mind waiting until evening. When I reached my house she was just taking off her things and hanging them up in the closet ; and when I went into the room where we were to have our dinner she came in with me. It was a nice, warm room, and there was a large fireplace on one side , but no fire . My mother had brought some wood into the house from the cellar, for it was so cold that morning ; and when I saw her take off her hat and put it on the pile of sticks in front of me, I did n’t say any thing at first. Then she looked around at me very kindly.

" Don ’ t you like to see a fire ? " said she .

[Illustration: 0153]

I had never seen so much wood before , and when I saw that my mother was trying to keep me from being cold, I felt ashamed of myself for not speaking out. So I began to tell her about the bridge , and how many men were on it ; and then I told her about the man whose hand was hurt , and why he had been sent back home in such a hurry . But she did n’t seem interested in that ; instead, she looked at me very sharply, as if there were something wrong.
" Why don ’ t you tell me what is troubling your mind ? " she asked. I was too much surprised to say anything just then , but I felt that I ought to have spoken before she came into the room .

" Now I shall have a chance to see whether this little boy knows how to keep a secret or not," said my mother ; and I did n’t know what to do. " Did you tell your story all by yourself ? ” I shook my head slowly, then I looked at her again as if there were nothing wrong , when she had turned away from me for a minute .
" You have been listening to the people in the street while we walked along together ! " She was now looking down into the fireplace ; and then she lifted one of the sticks that was lying on the hearth. There were three pieces sticking out , where my mother had cut off the ends for kindling.
" What ’ s this ? " I could see her smile as she looked at me . " You have been listening to what we say to each other without telling us about it ! It seems that you are very quick in your business, and if you are not more careful there will be no secrets for you to keep. Now, tell me why you did n ’ t speak before , when I asked you about this bridge."

I told her the whole story ; how the men on the bridge had spoken to me in a whisper ; how it was almost dark when we started out ; and then how one man stopped by my side and talked with me as long as he could .
" But why did they speak so low ? " I asked , when I told her all about that.

" Because they were afraid that people passing by would hear them talk, or else they thought you might be a policeman and wanted to keep out of trouble for speaking with strangers on the street."

But I did n ’ t believe my mother . If the men had been afraid that
