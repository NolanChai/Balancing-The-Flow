Yeah, but when it gets too quiet , I want to know there are civilized folks close by.

What do you mean ? The wild animals will attack us ?

Maybe not just the animals, but there may be other people around here .

 People in these forests ? Do they walk around without clothes ?

Well, I've heard that some tribes still wear bark cloth , and they like to paint their bodies with leaves and berries. 

They do it because it helps them keep cool under the heat of a forest fire . It's kinda romantic.

 You mean like in "Fantasy Island" ? Where they'd put on a different costume every week ? 

Maybe not quite that different , but the native people I saw were pretty interesting, and it was fun to see how they used the natural resources around them. 

 What happened when you went camping in the woods as a child ? You screamed . 

No, I mean , I enjoyed it. We had some picnics at places like Yosemite or Big Sur and saw some of the natural wonders that are there. 

 And then we would go to Disneyland to get away from all that nature stuff?

Sure. 

Well, you're not going to find any giant teepees in these woods. 

Maybe they just don't know about them yet . 

What do you mean ? You think the Native Americans haven't been on TV ? 

Well, I saw a show once where this tribe of Indians was so proud of their heritage that they built teepees out of polystyrene foam. 

That's not very natural, is it?

No, but they were really big . The people looked like little dolls in those things , and I thought that maybe they should all be in a museum somewhere instead of camping out.

 I think you're right . 

Hey! We need to get moving if we want to find the place by nightfall ! 

You know what I do when it gets too dark ? I put on my portable TV set and turn up the volume until it hurts my ears. 

 I think I'll just go to sleep .

Good ! We can go now . My parents have already left for the camp site . 

 And what about your friends ? Don't they want to come with us ? 

 Yeah , sure. But you know ... I don't think anyone from my group is interested in coming along . 

 That's a shame ! I was really looking forward to going with them . 

 Well, no matter . We're still gonna have lots of fun . My dad says it's the best place to go camping there is. 

 Yeah , that's right . I can't wait . Let's get moving ! 

 OK . Let me just grab my coat and hat ... And we are ready to go ! 

 OK, I got my jacket on now , let's go !

Oh . You have to read something ... I guess that book on the shelf will do. 

 It's a thriller , I think . 

 A thrill killer more like it . 

 OK ! My bag is packed ... 

 You can go ahead and leave ... I'll be there in five minutes. 

 The car isn't going to start . 

 Really ? 

 Yeah , but I know how to fix it if you just give me a few minutes . 

 Give me an hour ! 

 Fine ! Anything for my wife ... 

 You're funny ..... I like you already . 

 Oh well , you know what they say : opposites attract. 

 I hate you ! I just don't understand you . 

 And if you ever dare to complain about this trip again I will kick your ass so hard it won't be funny ... 

 No , I think we should go camping more often . 

 You know what ? It isn't too late. Let's cancel the whole thing ! 

 We are already here , and there's no way to back out now, so let's just enjoy it for what it is ! 

 OK . I guess that's better than being at home listening to you bitch about it all summer long ... 

 I think we should take a few minutes and talk about the weather . 

 We can't do that because we don't have any cell phones. 

 Are you serious ? You mean you actually brought that thing out here with you !? 

 I'm not talking to you ... just let me make this call in peace ! 

 Just a minute . 

 I can't hear you . I don't have any reception. 

 The weather sucks , but the view is great ... 

 Really ? Do you think we should go for a hike? 

 Yeah , that would be fun ! 

 OK . 

 Bye ... 

 All right now let's talk about something more interesting ... 

 You know what ? We aren't going to do anything if we don't get out of the tent first. 

 How was your day ? 

 I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful it was ! 

 Oh my God , I'm freezing ! Didn't you say that the weather would be nice today? 

 You're right . It's going to rain in about an hour ... so let's make a run for it. 

 I hate you ! 

 Now I have to put up this tent and build a fire at the same time . 

 Why don't we just go back home ? 

 No way ! You just sit there and relax . That's what I pay you for . 

 I think your idea is stupid ... let me do it. 

 It's not my fault that everything has to be done perfectly the first time, OK? 

 What do you mean it's raining ? The weather report said nothing about rain today! 

 Sorry , but this tent leaks like a sieve ! I didn't know that was going to happen. 

 No . Let me just get my sleeping bag and we can move over here where the sun is shining. 

 Are you kidding ? It's pouring out there . 

 If it rains any harder, we might as well be home ! 

 I don't think that's a very good idea ... 

 Why not? It's getting pretty dark out here ... and the wind is picking up. 

 You are really stupid if you think we can survive the night out in this weather . 

 What ? Just sit there and look at me as I try to get this tent fixed so that we can actually sleep tonight !? 

 Why don't you just go home ... I'll manage fine without you! 

 Don't be ridiculous ! That's not going to happen ... but I really wish it would. 

 You know what ? I'm going to take a nap , and when I wake up everything is going to be fine again . 

 It's just too much work trying to get you out of here every time something doesn't go the way you want ... 

 This tent isn't leaking at all ! 

 Oh really ? Well why don't we just test it then? 

 I think there's enough space for both of us . Let's make a deal: If I can sleep out here with you , you won't complain any more . OK? 

 I can do that ! It sounds like fun to me ... 

 Oh no it doesn't ! You know how much I hate camping! 

 Fine ! We will go back to the city then ... 

 Do you think we should just forget about this whole trip and take a vacation at home ? 

 Yeah . I'm not going out in this rain anyway , so why bother ? 

 But we're supposed to be spending quality time together, remember? That is why we are doing this! 

 What do you mean ? Is there something wrong with me again? 

 Nothing is wrong with you . It just seems like I can never please you. 

 Just hold my hand ... it'll make everything better ... 

 No ! I don't want to touch you right now! 

 Are you serious ? That's your solution for everything? Touch me and suddenly everything will be OK again . 

 But isn't that what we've always done before when things get out of hand ? 

 Maybe it was time to try something different. 

 What do you mean by that ? You think I should have just left you there alone in the tent ? 

 If you had, then at least it would have been peaceful for me ! 

 Do you realize what an asshole you are being right now? 

 What's wrong with you? 

 Nothing ! You know me better than anyone else in this world , so why do I still have to explain myself every time we fight ? 

 You don't need to tell me anything more because it won't make any difference anyway . 

 You are right ... 

 We'll see about that ! It just drives me crazy when you insult my intelligence like this! 

 I have been doing everything possible since we got here so that this trip would turn out well , and what do you say to me ? 

 That I am stupid ! 

 You are not the only one who is stupid around here . 

 Oh really ? Then why don't we just call it a day, pack up our stuff and get back home ? 

 Because then my parents would never let us leave again! 

 Well , I guess we can stay in the tent for another night if you like ... 

 Yeah . It doesn't matter to me how many times they want me out of here! 

 There are plenty of other places where we could go camping , so don't worry about it. 

 But I won't come with you ! 

 You do realize that if I have anything to say about it , I will never see you again after this trip ? 

 So what? It doesn't matter anyway . 

 It does matter ! Do you think I want to get divorced just because my wife doesn't want to go camping anymore ?! 

 You really are crazy aren't you? 

 No ! I am not insane - just ask anyone who knows me well enough ! 

 There isn't a single person in this world who will ever take your side over mine, so don't even bother trying to convince them otherwise . 

 If that is true , then why did you even try telling those lies about yourself before ? 

 Because I was scared ! Scared of what ? That my wife would find out how much I hate camping ?! 

 Oh come on . You can't fool me anymore ... I know exactly what kind of person you are , and nothing is going to change that fact. 

 How do you expect us to stay married if there isn't any love left in our relationship? 

 We will be together forever because we made a promise before God himself when we got married . 

 I'm sorry but I can't help it if you don't feel the same way about me as I do about you ... 

 You should have known better than to think that any man could love someone else more than he does his wife ! 

 We are meant for each other , and nothing will ever change that ! 

 Are you kidding ? Who told you this ridiculous story anyway?! 

 It's true ... I don't care how much time passes by or what happens in between us - no matter where we go from here on out; we belong together forever , so stop fighting me because of it ! 

 I don't think that you understand just how important our marriage is
