" I hope we won't have any bears to worry about . "

" Don't be ridiculous , you can sleep on the ground if there are no mosquitoes or frogs. And besides ..."

" Oh , yeah ? What do you suggest that we use for a bed ? "

" Well ... maybe an air mattress ... "

" Oh , sure ! An inflatable something to lie on . Surely the campground will have those things around somewhere . "

" Don't be silly ! You know how campgrounds are. The only place you can sleep is in your own tent. Besides, if there are mosquitoes or frogs , we can just stay inside and watch TV."

" So ... where exactly are we going ? "

" Someplace called Forked Lake . It's about three hours out of town . "

" That's pretty far out in the sticks. What if there isn't any electricity , or cable TV, or a grocery store nearby ? "

" Don't worry ... there are campgrounds all over this country with electricity and TV. I just want to get away from it all for a few days . "

" Yeah ! The last thing you need is to be in the middle of nowhere and suddenly realize you're out of Cds, or that your hair looks like crap, or your makeup isn't waterproof anymore."

" It's not really going to be in the middle of nowhere ... just a few miles from town . "

" Yeah ! But you never know who lives near campgrounds . Maybe some yokel will come walking down the road and see us in our tents. The last thing we want is for him to start talking to us about what he thinks about Obama, or Hillary, or whatever."

" Hey , there's no way anyone around here would talk like that. There are too many smart people who live out here to talk like that . "

" Sure ! You can find some nice people in any town . But if you really want a camping trip without having to deal with stupid people, you need to go out where there aren't any towns."

" Well , I just hope that it's not too far from the highway ... "

" Yeah ! If we're three hours from the nearest town , we better be able to get to a hospital or something if we have an emergency . "

" Don't worry ! I read in one of those magazines that you can call 911 on your cell phone if it's really an emergency . "

" You know what ? I just hope this trip is worthwhile. If all we do is sit around and watch TV , then the whole point was a waste. Besides ... don't you think that camping is supposed to be, well , fun ?"

" I'm sure it will be . "

" I'm going to take some CDs . And maybe one of those little radios where you can play your own music and don't have to worry about being able to pick up a station . Just in case we get stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way out. "

" Yeah ! We might even see some bears or deer . Or wild turkeys ... I never saw any wild turkeys until one year when my grandfather took us camping and there were like thousands of them all over the place."

" We'll probably run into a lot of tourists , too. It will be great to see what kinds of things other people do on vacation . "

" You know , I hope we have cell phone service out here . Because if not, and I can't get one of my hair-care magazines from the library, then this trip might not turn out to be that much fun."

" Don't worry ! You'll get a chance to read your magazine. The campgrounds are usually near restaurants and stuff like that . "

" Yeah ! And there will probably be stores nearby where we can buy junk food if we get really bored ... "

" We should bring some games or something for the kids , too."

" I hope they don't whine about being bored all day. If that happens, it would ruin my whole vacation."

" Hey ! This is supposed to be a camping trip for everyone ... not just you . "

" Well , if the kids are bored and can't find anything fun to do , they can always play video games on their handheld gadgets or something. "

" Yeah ! We could even bring our own DVD player if we want."

" Hey ! Maybe there will be a pool somewhere nearby, or a beach . If there is, maybe my husband and I can go swimming without having to worry about getting sunburned , like last year when we went on that cruise with those people from church. "

" I just hope this campground has real showers ... because if it doesn't, then I'll probably spend all day trying to get clean. And besides ... if there aren't any stores around, then how are we supposed to buy groceries ?"

" Don't worry ! We can bring our own food and just cook on the camping stove."

" That won't be too much fun , I don't think . "

" Well , at least we won't have to worry about bugs or mosquitoes or frogs while we're eating dinner ... "

" Yeah ! And if there isn't any electricity, then I guess you'll get to learn how to use your flashlight. "

" You know , maybe this whole camping trip is a bad idea ."

" It won't be that bad."

" All right ! If it makes you happy , then we can go ... but if we end up spending the entire weekend sitting around and watching TV or reading magazines, then I'm going to be disappointed. "

" There will definitely be more stuff to do than that."

" You never know . Maybe it won't work out. Maybe the campground is all booked up , like last year when we tried to go somewhere on Labor Day weekend and had to stay at a hotel instead of a tent because there weren't any openings anywhere."

" I just hope they have some kind of phone service or internet so that if something happens, then someone can call 911 or contact our insurance company. "

" You don't need cell phones or the internet to do that . You could always use a pay phone if there isn't any other way."

" Yeah ! And besides ... I bet there will be restaurants and stuff within driving distance , so we won't have to worry about starving. "

" If you really want this camping trip to happen , then why don't you just make the reservations right now ? "

" Because I need a little time to figure out what I'm going to pack . "

" Just bring whatever clothes and shoes that fit ... we can always buy more if something gets lost or ruined."

" But what about my hair ? It's already starting to frizz from the humidity ... and besides , my hair products are not waterproof."

" Don't worry ! You'll figure it out . "

" Yeah ! I can put my makeup in a plastic bag so that it doesn't melt while we're driving down the road."

" Okay ... let me call our insurance company and see if they have any good advice about camping or something. "

" Okay . Bye ! We'll talk again soon ... I hope ! "

" Don't worry ! Everything will be fine."

" Aaaaahhhh ... good enough . We can still buy more things at the store when we get to camp, right ? "
