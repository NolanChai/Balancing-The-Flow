oh , I know ! Let me help you with this . 

 thank you very much. 

 I don't mind waiting, but can you tell me how far is the bubble wrap?

 oh , not too far now . You ’ ll be able to get it before you get in line for the post office .

 that’s good news! Do you know what time the post office closes?

 I ’ m not sure about that . But don ’ t worry, your package will go out tomorrow morning , just as soon as they open !

no , you ’ ll have to go over there for that . 

 where do the packages go after they are posted ? 

 once they are posted and sent off , they usually go through a number of sorting offices around the city before they finally reach their destination . 

 i really don ’ t need to buy any bubble wrap , because I already have some. 

 ok then you can stand over here in this line and get your packages posted .

okay . That ’ ll come to £2.50 in postage and packaging , please . 

 here you are . Thanks ! 

 bye . 

 how do you usually send your packages ? 

 I normally just go down the post office and hand them over myself , but I didn’t have any change with me today so I ’ m standing in this line instead . 

 did you see there are two people serving here today ? 

 yes , that ’ s new . The other person must be sick or something because normally it ’ s just one person at each counter . 

 do they often get staff shortages here ? 

 no , I don’t think so . This is the busiest post office in town and there are always plenty of people on duty . 

 I guess that must be why they got another person to help today . 

 you can get a lot more done if you have two people instead of one . 

 sure , but it takes twice as long for the queues to move through too . 

 yeah , I know what you mean . 

 there ’ s that line again ! 

 it’s been here all morning and it still doesn’t look like moving any further forward . 

 I think we should be able to jump this queue by now , don’t you ? 

 maybe if we went up to the counter and spoke to someone they might let us in the line ahead of everyone else ! 

 let ’ s do it ! 

 okay , here goes . Excuse me . Can I skip this line and come through your queue instead please ? 

 you can ’ t do that ! 

 but why not ? 

 because we already got in the main line when there weren’t any other people waiting . We should be able to jump straight past these people too now we ’ ve joined the front of the queue ! 

 sorry , it doesn’t work like that . You can only join a queue if no one is standing at the counter yet ! 

 okay . How do you know that nobody was waiting to post something when I arrived ? 

 because there were people waiting for the service then so they couldn’t have gotten in line already . 

 yes , but we didn ’ t see them or hear anyone come into the queue behind us and we ’ ve been standing here for over an hour anyway ! 

 i don ’ t know what to tell you . You can ’ t get in this queue just because it looks like there’s nobody else waiting ! 

 but that seems unfair doesn ’ t it ? 

 no , not at all . There is a line of people waiting for the post and if you want our services then you have to wait your turn too . 

 okay , I guess we just have to stand in this queue like everyone else then ! 

 maybe but if you were patient enough to get in line first without jumping over anybody it shouldn ’ t be a problem waiting for the rest of us either !

is it any cheaper than buying stamps in another place ? 

 no , it isn ’ t . 

 do you want the package insured ? 

 yes please . Is there anything else I need to know before posting my package? 

 not really . But if your package is very valuable you might like to consider special delivery . It will cost more but your package will be delivered tomorrow morning between 9 a. m. and 11 a. m. 

 okay , thank you very much for all of your help .

OK . How about stamps for Canada ? 

 yes . We ’ ve got plenty of those too ! 

 is there any other post office near here ? 

 there ’ s another one a bit further along the road . It has longer opening hours but it doesn ’ t have a bureau de change. 

 I don ’ t need that , thanks . 

 no problem . Have a great day !

it ’ ll cost you five pounds for ten items of bubble wrap . 

 how many do you want ? 

 I think that’s all. I ‘ d like my change in twenty-pound notes if you can manage , please . 

 ok . That ’ s a hundred and seventy eight pounds and thirty pence . I have two twenty -pound notes for you here and two tens . You can keep the ones with the picture of Winston Churchill on them for a souvenir . 

 thank you very much . See you later . Bye.
