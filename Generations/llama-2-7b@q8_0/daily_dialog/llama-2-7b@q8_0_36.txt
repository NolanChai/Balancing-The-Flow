" there ’ s a stamp machine over there by the cash desk . "

" how much does it cost to post a package ? "

" that depends on what size your parcel is , so please check the prices in this booklet first before you put anything in the post . "

" can I weigh my parcel here ? "

" there ’ s a weighing machine over there at the end of those blue counters . "

" how much is it to post a package from here to Singapore ? "

" it costs 75p to post an item in the UK , and £1.30 for items going abroad . "

" I have a question about posting something overseas . Can you help me? "

" yes , of course — please come this way . "

" how much is it to post a letter from here ? "

" the price depends on the size and weight of your letter, but for a standard envelope weighing up to 100 grams, it will be 65p to send within the UK , and £1.30 to send abroad . "

" can you put this in an international envelope ? "

" yes , of course — please come this way . "

" what do I need to post something overseas ? "

" you ’ ll just need the envelope or package , your items and a stamp for sending it abroad . "

" thank you very much . "

" is there anywhere where I can sit and rest while waiting ? "

" there ’ s some seating over by those benches , but we don’t have any chairs here at the post office . "

" and what kind of paper do you want to send them on ? "

" regular white letter paper will be fine . "

" OK . How about the envelopes ? Do you want these with windows or plain ? "

" I think I ’ ll take these with windows , but if they sell out then give me the plain ones . "

" all right . And do you need any tape or labels for your envelope ? "

" no , I have some at home . "

" OK . Would you like a padded mailer instead of an ordinary box to mail it in ? "

" no thank you . My package isn ’ t very heavy . It won ’ t need the extra padding . "

" is this for you or someone else ? "

" it’s for me . I ordered some shoes online and they ’ re coming today . "

" OK , but can I see your identification ? "

" sure . Here it is . "

" thank you . Your package will be ready by the end of the day . "

" then you ’ ll need a bit more than the standard stamps . You should ask at the desk over there if they can give you an extra sheet or two . "

" that’s fine , thank you very much . "

" no problem at all . "

" could I have 20 standard stamps for these cards please ? "

" yes , of course , sir. How do you want them ? "

" on the backside, please . "

" is that your first time posting here in this post office ? "

" no . I ’ ve posted a letter before and got it back because they said it was too heavy to go by ordinary post . "

" what did you put in the envelope ? "

" just my Christmas cards. They must have been 30 in number , but they only took ten . Is that because of the weight or the amount ? "

" well, yes and no. It ’ s more about the amount than it is the weight. You can fit quite a lot into an envelope if you don ’ t put anything heavy inside , so when we weigh your letter after you ’ ve posted it , what we really do is weigh the postage . So as long as the postage is less than half of the overall weight of the letters and parcels in your envelope, then your post will go. "

" I see . That ’ s good to know . "

" now here are your 20 standard stamps . "

" thank you very much , sir . Have a nice Christmas . "

" and you too . "

" right then . What denomination would you like : 1st or 2nd class ? "

" I don ’ t know . Can I see a stamp catalogue to look at them first ? "

" yes , of course . "

" that will be £3.50 , please . "

" ok . Thanks . "

" it ’ ll be one more pound for that . "

" total is 20 pounds even . "

" I only have £17 on me . Can you give me a cheque ? "

" sure , what name do you want ? "

" Smith , Charles . "

" and the address ? "

" it ’ s 43, West street , Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 2EG . "

" here is your bubble wrap . Thank you for shopping at the Post office . "

" no problem. Have a good day . Bye bye ! "
