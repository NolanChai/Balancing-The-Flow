" Don't worry about her. It's not your fault ."

" You gotta help me out here,Kenny . "

" What do you need ? I thought the two of us were tight ."

" Yeah , but I really want to bang this chick ."

" Well , I guess we can get her a drink. "

" Don't worry, man. It's not like I haven't done this before."

" You have ? I thought you were with Lisa for the long haul ."

" She dumped me. I think she cheated on me."

" Really ? "

" Yeah , but who cares ? It was just sex."

" I bet it hurts like a bitch ."

" Hey ! Lighten up, man . It's not that big of a deal . You gotta get over it sometime."

" Well , when she dumped me,I got pretty pissed. "

" You did what ? "

" I grabbed her and shoved my tongue down her throat . She almost choked to death on it !!"

" Wow ! That's pretty hard core."

" Yeah , but it was a helluva thrill for me. And now,I feel like getting back at Lisa some more. "

" I bet she'd love that ."

" Well , maybe later."

" Hey . Where are we going to meet this chick ? "

" At the bar in the next town over . It's called The Dive Bar . That place is full of sluts. "

" You like them dirty, huh?"

" Yeah , but they sure as hell love getting fucked by guys."

" Well , let's get going then . I gotta see some tits tonight !"

" You're getting carried away . We don't know her at all . "

" Look at those curves and legs . I want to hold on to them forever . "

" Just slow down , pal . She looks nice but we need a little more information before we start chasing her around the bar.We don't know how she feels about us or if she even likes us for that matter.Let me do the talking and get some information first. "

" Oh,all right . But it ' s just not fair to treat her like that.She doesn't know we ' re just messing with her.She's totally into this guy at the other end of the bar.I hate to spoil his fun."

" What did I tell you ? You don't want to get involved in a love triangle . It'll be our turn soon enough . Let me do the talking.You can just sit here and watch my brilliant moves. "

" Fine . Whatever,but keep her from running into him again.She's a little shy of strangers."

" Easy.I'm a great flirt.Now quit messing with that hair of yours or you ' re going to have one hell of a time getting it back under control.It ' s already starting to go out of control and your hat is screaming for help. "

Kenny walked over to the table where Linda was sitting.He said, " Hey,how about we grab that guy's place at the bar ?"

She looked around and realized she didn't know who he was talking about.She didn't even see any men except him standing next to her . She smiled as if she knew what he was talking about and said , " I can ' t wait.Let's go over there."

Kenny led the way over to where the other two guys were sitting at the bar.Linda sat down on a stool that faced the men,but didn't quite know how to position herself so she would be facing both of them at once.She ended up kind of perched on the edge of her seat and turned to look back over her shoulder towards Kenny.Kenny had already moved into the middle of their table and was in charge of the conversation from that point on.Their names were George and Jerry,and they both worked together in a factory.George was the more outgoing one and he did all the talking . He ordered another round of drinks for himself and Linda when Kenny suggested they might want something to eat instead.He also asked Kenny if he had any plans for them for the rest of the evening or for tonight.Kenny said that was up in the air at this point,and then he went on to ask George what his plans were since he had been there first and probably planned on being there until closing time.

"Well , I'm just gonna hang around here and see who shows up . I figure they ' ll be plenty of girls here tonight because it ' s a Friday night and the bars will be packed full by about eleven o ' clock.That gives me about five hours to get to know this girl before she gets picked over like the meat at the supermarket on Sunday.I've seen how things work in this bar on weekends,and I can pretty much guarantee that you're gonna find someone here soon and take her home with you . I'm just waiting for the right girl to show up."

" What ? You mean we ' re not going back there now ? " Linda asked.

" Not yet , honey . There are other girls in this bar who will be more than happy to spend time with us,and maybe even come home and stay the night with us.You're gonna have fun here tonight."

Linda didn't seem convinced that it would be a fun evening at all.She was almost ready to leave when Kenny got up from his seat at the bar and returned to her table.He looked into Linda ' s eyes as he sat down next to her on her stool . " I guess we might as well hang around here for now,since George said it was bound to get busy before too long anyway."

" But why ? We've already been out with you for a few hours.Don't you have something else in mind?" Linda asked nervously.

Kenny put his arm around her shoulders and leaned over close to whisper in her ear , " Well,I thought about going back there for a while after we left the bar , but George said he might bring some friends with him,and that's not really what I had in mind right now.Besides,George is kind of creepy and I don't think you ' d enjoy hanging out with those two guys over there."

" Creepy ? " she asked.

" Sure . They both got laid off from work a few days ago , so they came down here looking for something to do.They got into some trouble before,but I guess they finally figured out that it was better not to talk about the things they've done or who they know.I think they're up to no good,and I don't want them anywhere near you."

" So what ' s your plan ? " she asked nervously.

" Well , if we just hang around here with George for a while it might look like we are having fun and we may even be able to meet some girls who will go home with us,but I don't want to waste any more of the night hanging around with these two . So , do you have a better idea ?"

Linda looked around at all the people in the bar,and she felt very uncomfortable.It was like being on display and everybody could see her talking with Kenny . She didn't feel safe at all , but she still couldn ' t think of any other place to go either.She finally said to him, " We can stay here for a while , I guess . I mean , this is a nice bar and there are lots of people."

" Okay,good.It might take some time before you get to know anyone here though.I've known George for a few months now,but I still don't feel that comfortable around him."

Linda leaned back in her seat and watched the people in the bar.She knew she was out of place there since nobody seemed very interested in talking with her or sitting next to her on a stool . She didn ' t think much of all those guys who were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes,but at least Kenny had tried to make her feel welcome by buying her one.She looked over to see if he was watching her again , but he seemed to be looking around at other things instead.That didn't really help much though because she still felt very uncomfortable there and wished that they would just leave .

After a while,George and Jerry got up from the bar and left together without saying goodbye to anyone . They went out of the back door,but Kenny could tell that George was watching them carefully as he walked past.He said , " Well,now we have some privacy again."

Linda looked at him like he had lost his mind or something.She didn't understand what he meant by that statement . She still felt very uncomfortable being there in the bar alone with Kenny and she was trying to decide how soon they would be leaving so she could get back home safely before anyone else showed up.Kenny tried to start a conversation , but Linda didn't really have much of an idea what he wanted her to say or do next .

" Well,it's been nice talking with you , Linda.I know I haven ' t done anything wrong so far tonight , and George said we might find some girls here that will be fun for us to hang out with later on."

Linda didn't really want to answer him or talk anymore about any of this,but she felt like there was nothing else to say at the moment either.She tried to look around the bar again,but it seemed like everyone had already left after George and Jerry had gone outside . Kenny wasn't helping her feel very comfortable there either because he kept looking at her with such an intense expression on his face that she didn't know what else to do except sit there with him for a while longer.He was just staring into her eyes as if he wanted something from her or could see right through her,but Linda had no idea what he wanted or why he wouldn't leave and go find some girls instead of sitting in the bar all by himself talking about how much fun they would have together later on .

Kenny leaned over close to whisper in her ear again as he reached out his hand and grabbed a fistful of hair on top of Linda's head , " Do you like it here ? Or should we go somewhere else for a while instead?" He let go of some more strands from her long brown hair that was falling down over her face now.She felt kind of scared and uncomfortable sitting with him in the bar,but she didn't know how to tell him that she wanted to leave because he seemed like he had already decided that they were going to spend some time together after George and Jerry left .

Kenny looked at her for a while before finally saying , " Okay.Maybe

" Okay.How about a round for my new friend, here ? "

" You got it . "

" Hey , Lisa ! This is Kenny . "

" Nice to meet you . "

" How ' s life treating ya ? "

" Fine . "

" Good . Well , I gotta go.See ya around. "

" Later . "

" What was that all about , Kyle ? "

" Lisa is the new girl at school . She's a real sweetheart and she's looking for someone to hang out with.That's why I introduced you two . I thought maybe,you could be friends . You see how it works? "

" Yeah,I guess so . But what about your plans ? "

" My plans? "

" To pick up a chick . "

" Oh , yeah.Well,what about this one? She's cute and she ' s looking for a guy to hang out with . "

" That's different . You know me better than that.I wouldn't take advantage of her like that! "

" Okay,then I won't either . "

" What are ya talkin ' about ? We just got here ! "

" Yeah, but I know this girl from before.She knows me and I don't like being recognized at a party."

" Well, if she knows you , maybe we can make it . "

" Sure . That would be cool . Let's go over there . "

" Okay . "

(Sung)

"Hi Kenny, I 've been looking for you everywhere.I hear you 're in town and that you 've got the most wonderful thing."

" Oh, yeah ? What's that ? "

" Your hair is just a-shagging !"

" Who's your ex-girlfriend ? "

" Lisa . "

" Hey ! That's cool . I think I know her.I dated her a couple of times too . "

" I'm glad to hear that . "

" You know, we were actually engaged for about 2 months before we broke up.But that was more than a year ago.Don't worry, she won't remember you."

" Great ! Let's get out of here and find another place where I can pick up chicks . "
