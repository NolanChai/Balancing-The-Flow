You never know when you might meet your next girlfriend !  

 Maybe. 

 I bet you were wondering why you didn't get any phone calls last night , right ? 

 Well, you're going to get a call now .

What do you mean ? 

I don't know if she's coming tonight or tomorrow night . But we will be calling you.

What if I'm busy ? 

We will leave her number with you , and tell you when she is calling back.  

Well, that sounds a lot better than nothing . See you there !

Okay , see ya later.

It's a hot babe in the corner . Look at her ass! 

 Not bad . 

 Hey, buddy, you wanna buy some smokes ? 

 I do. 

 Good.You look like someone who could use one after all those beers.Here you go, man. 

 Thanks , bud. 

 Let's go over to the bar and pick up another round of drinks . 

 Yeah . See ya in a sec. 

 Bye. 

 Hey , bartender ! 

 Beer please! 

 You got it, pal . 

 Here you go. 

 I'll have the same. 

 That's two beers then.Keep 'em coming. 

 Thanks. 

 Did you see that hot babe over there?She looks so cool and sexy in her black dress ! 

 Yeah , man, but don't you think she'd look even sexier with a little less makeup ? 

 Oh yeah, right!She needs to be more natural. 

 What about her? 

 She's cute. 

 I don't know . But let's go talk to her and find out. 

 No way . You can't pick up chicks like that ! 

 Oh, come on!I'm game.Let's give it a try anyway. 

 Okay , but let me do all the talking this time. 

 No way, pal!You can do the first few rounds then I'll take over from there . 

 Yeah, right ! You're wasted already ! 

 You think ? 

 Nah, I still got it ! Come on , bartender, give me another one. 

 Here you go, pal. 

 Hey ! What are we waiting for ? Let's go over there and see if she wants to dance . 

 Yeah!Let's do it! 

 I can't believe how lucky we are!She wants to dance with us! 

 Awesome! 

 We're going to party like rock stars tonight ! 

 Are you ready ? 

 No way, man.I need another drink first. 

 That's it . I can't believe what a loser you are!You blow so many chances because you always wait for the perfect moment instead of taking advantage of every opportunity that comes your way ! 

 Okay, okay , I get it now!Let's do this before I lose my nerve again. 

 Here we go . 

 She seems to be into it!What do you think? 

 I think she likes us. 

 What about you ? Are you going to make a move soon or what ? 

 What are you waiting for, man ? 

 We're having so much fun , it's hard to believe this is really happening . 

 It's amazing ! 

 I don't know . Is this too good to be true? 

 No way!Let's get out of here and go find some more girls.We gotta keep the party going all night long ! 

 Okay , okay . Let's do it! 

 Here we are, ladies!You look amazing!Where are you guys from ? 

 Hey, I like her hair better this way . 

 She looks so much cooler with a ponytail. 

 Yeah , but that new hairdo makes her face look really small ! 

 You're right though . Let me do it! 

 Okay , thanks for the compliment . 

 It feels nice . 

 We gotta go, guys!Let's go dance some more ! 

 Oh no!I almost forgot.This is my friend's birthday today and I promised him that I'll take him to the club tonight so he can celebrate with his friends. 

 You mean we don't get to stay? 

 Not this time, pal . Sorry about it.We can always come back another night though ! 

 Yeah , right!Like when ? Next month ? Next year ? Never ? 

 Oh , well ... 

 Anyway, here are the tickets for tonight's show.Let me know how much you liked it later . 

 Thanks so much!We really had fun . 

 See ya ! 

 Yeah!Take care ! 

 I don't believe this . How did we get separated?I can't find my friends anywhere!Where are they ? 

 Hey , look over there . That guy looks like he needs a drink, don't you think ? Let's go over and say hello to him. 

 Sure ! I just want one more before we leave anyway . 

 Okay . Come on then ...

She's just my sister , you know. 

 Really?That's her ? Wow.You 're lucky . I can't even take you home to meet my parents,they ' re so conservative ! 

 Ha!You sound like a broken record.My family is pretty cool with me. 

 Oh,so they'll let me bring girls back for the night? 

 Let's talk about something else . 

 Fine by me ! 

 #### . 

 #### . 

 #### . 

 #### .

Okay . 

 Excuse me , but are you two together ? 

 Yes,we are. 

 Wow , Kenny ! You have an exquisite girlfriend! 

 We ' re not together yet . She just broke up with her boyfriend. 

 That's why she's looking so depressed! 

 I guess . 

 We should be getting a drink now . Where are you ? 

 Not far away from here ! 

 Good , 'cause I don't want to stand up for the next hour or two. 

 I didn't say that ! You can sit down whenever you want . But what do you think of my girlfriend? 

 She seems really nice . But her boyfriend just dumped her, so she probably doesn't feel very good right now . 

 What a loser!He ' s not even worth looking at. 

 Well , that's because he's too busy looking at you ! 

 Maybe he'll take us back to my place and play his guitar for us ? 

 Yeah ! I like your style , dude ! You're a great guy! 

 Yeah , I can see how much fun it would be . But the way that babe is looking,she really needs a good man. 

 She doesn't need anything but you to make her feel better! 

 I think so too . I'm glad we came here together ! 

 Yeah , me too ! We should do it again soon!

Ha,ha . Why ? What's wrong with me ? 

 I dunno. You ' re just weird looking . 

 Ahem! Not funny ! 

 But it is ! 

 Yeah , it really is . 

 Okay , okay , I give in . Let's go , man ! 

 We ' ll be there shortly . 

 Bye, Kenny ! See ya later ! 

 Good luck with Lisa ! 

 Yowzers! There she goes .

Ah, so now you're trying to get yourself into trouble? 

 That's right . It's called rebound . 

 Hey, guys ! What are we drinking ? 

 The usual . Whatever you want.It's on me. 

 I like this place . You got great taste , man ! 

 Thank you.Hey there, sweetheart! What will you have? 

 I'll take a martini please. 

 Great choice ! It'll be right up ! 

 Thanks. 

 Hey, you know what ? She looks just like Lisa . 

 Yeah , but it can't be her . That's impossible . 

 What if they are sisters? 

 Now that would be something else! 

 Hey guys . Wanna see a good movie this weekend ? 

 I know the place ! A friend of mine owns it.It has been quite a success so far, but is still in its infancy . 

 Great , now we'll have two tickets for free . 

 Yeah! 

 It sounds good to me too.Anyway,we can always see a movie some other time if you don't like it . 

 I'm sure that will be no problem . 

 Well, if you want to go , let's call it quits now . Otherwise we might miss the opening of the show . 

 We might as well.See you later guys ! 

 Bye ! 

 Later Kenny! See ya .
