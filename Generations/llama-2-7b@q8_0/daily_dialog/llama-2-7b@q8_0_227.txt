" Fine, thank you . I am making great progress in the last few years. "

" That's fine ! Have you found any friends here who could speak English ? "

" Yes , I have made a lot of new friends here . You know, if it hadn't been for them, my life would be so lonely . They are very kind to me and they give me all the help that I need. "

" Are you going out with anyone at present ? "

" Oh , no ! Not yet . "

" Well, don't worry too much about it . You will soon find someone . Have you thought of any places where there are a lot of American people ? "

" Yes , I have been to the Restaurant at the Plaza Hotel and to the Chinese restaurant . They are all full of Americans. "

" Why don't we go out tonight then ? "

" All right, what shall we do ? "

" Let me think for a moment . I have an idea . How about going to see a play at the theatre ? "

" Oh , yes ! That would be fun ! Are there any good plays on now ? "

" Yes . There is one called "The Laughing Prince". It is very entertaining. "

" Good ! I'll look forward to it then ! Let me know when you want to go . "

" OK . Bye , Mr Black."
