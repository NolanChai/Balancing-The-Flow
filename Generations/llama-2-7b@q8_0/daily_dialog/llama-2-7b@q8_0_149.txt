They have the hottest DJ in the city there . I've heard that it was packed when I went last time , but you don't need an invitation from me ! 

 Cool , thanks ! 

 You want to go for dinner first ? 

 Oh sure , that would be great . Let's get a table in the private dining room . We can order whatever we like and not worry about anyone else being around . I've got my eyes on some of those crab cakes . 

 All right then ! Let's go grab dinner and then head over to West Street . It is going to be a busy night tonight , so it won't hurt to get there early and stake out the best table in the place .
