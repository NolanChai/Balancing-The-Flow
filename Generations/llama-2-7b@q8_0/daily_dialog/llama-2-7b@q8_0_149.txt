# **Ella's Story** #
It was Friday night and Ella was ready to go out with her best friend, Linda, when she got an idea: instead of going to a bar or club, they could go to a fancy restaurant for dinner. After all, there were some things that only a fancy restaurant could give you; like a live pianist playing soft background music and candles on the table.
After they arrived at the restaurant, Linda said "You look gorgeous tonight in your dress."
"Thanks," Ella replied with her head held high. She had been working out at the gym for two months so she could be in shape before her date.
The waiter came to take their order and Linda ordered a steak and lobster while Ella ordered fish fillet. They each got a glass of white wine. The food arrived, but when it was time for dessert Linda had to go to the bathroom. When she returned they both went outside to smoke.
"Ella," Linda said between puffs of cigarette smoke, "I have something to tell you."
"Yes? What is it?" Ella asked, wiping her mouth with a napkin.
"You know how I've always talked about finding someone special in my life? Well, I think I finally found him," Linda said as she leaned over to whisper the next sentence into Ella's ear so no one would hear them.
Ella was shocked! "What do you mean?" she asked, trying to act casual even though her heart skipped a beat. She wasn't expecting this news at all - in fact it came as a complete surprise.
"I think he'll make me very happy," Linda continued, "and I hope we can be together for a long time."
Ella was silent for a moment before finally asking: "How do you know?" She wanted to ask more questions but wasn't sure where to start or what would sound too personal. After all she didn't even know his name yet! But Linda had already opened up her heart so Ella figured now was as good a time as any for her own revelations - even if they were unexpected and came completely out of left field.
"Well," began Ella slowly, "I met this man in the club last night." She paused briefly before continuing: "It was around midnight or so when I saw him coming toward me from across the room. He was tall with dark brown hair that hung down over his face and he had a beautiful smile on his lips . I knew right away that he would make an excellent husband for me someday."
"Really?" Linda asked, looking surprised by this turn of events. "Did you talk to him at all? Is there any chance of us meeting again sometime soon?"
Ella shook her head no and then said: "No one knows my name either - not even his!" This time she was the one who paused for a moment before continuing: "But I'm sure we will run into each other again soon. In fact, I hope so because it seems like there is something special between us already."
Ella felt her heart start to beat faster as she imagined how happy they would be together - if only they knew each others true identities! She knew that was probably a long way off though, but she hoped someday the two of them could at least get close enough so that Ella could tell Linda all about him and introduce her to his family . And who knows? Maybe one day even more - like meeting his parents and going on vacation together. It sounded like a dream come true!
