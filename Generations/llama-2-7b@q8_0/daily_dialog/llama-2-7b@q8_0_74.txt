[Warning: Short generation] 

 well, time flies , but it hasn't changed me one bit . I still like hiking and I still love singing . And I'm still mad about you !

yeah , things are pretty good . I started a company with her last year . We're doing pretty well for ourselves . 

 how'd you get into the business world ? 

 it was just kind of happenstance really . I was working at my old firm as an accountant when Jenn and I started talking about starting our own thing together . We pooled all our resources to start up a bookkeeping company . The rest , as they say, is history. 

 wow ! That's impressive ! Do you ever see yourself going back to accountancy ? 

 hahahaha . Not in this lifetime . It was hard work . I'm just happy to be doing something I actually enjoy for once . 

 I can relate . My job as a programmer is also pretty interesting. 

 oh cool ! I didn't know you were working at the same company with Jenn , I always thought she went to school for accountancy . 

 yeah , I was working in their finance department when we started dating . We got married two years ago . She just can't stay away from numbers . 

 hehe. Is she still at your firm ? 

 nope ! She moved on to another company as an accountant a year ago . So I'm left to do all the bookkeeping for our company myself . 

 how is that possible? 

 well , there are about three other people who work with me but none of them have much experience in this kind of stuff . I guess you could say it was more or less out of necessity. 

 hahaha! I'm sure you can handle anything . So what's the name of your company ? 

 we call ourselves Gone With The Accountant . 

 oh ! I see , so that's how the name came about? 

 exactly . Jenn always says I should have gone with my heart and pursued a career in accountancy but hey , no one can tell me what to do ! 

 that's true , it's better to be your own boss than someone else's employee. 

 yeah . I still remember when you were trying to get into business yourself . It seemed like such a struggle at the time but looking back now it seems like the hardest part was just getting started ! 

 how are things going with your new venture ? 

 they're okay . I'm not making as much money as I would have liked to but at least my company is still in business . 

 you know what , maybe we can start up a business together someday . It will be easier for us that way instead of starting from scratch again . What do you think ? 

 wow ! That's such an exciting idea ! When would you want to start this venture ? 

 I don't know , maybe next year or the year after . We can make it our New Year's resolution . 

 hahaha! Yeah, that sounds like a great plan. Maybe we should talk about it more at another time though . What else is new ? How about you? You still playing your guitar as much as ever , I hope ! 

 yeah , but not really to the extent that I used to . I don't think there are many people who'd want to hear me play anyway so there's no point in trying to keep it up . 

 hehehahaha. So what do you like doing nowadays ? 

 nothing really , I guess. I mean, if there's nothing interesting going on then I just sit around at home and watch television . It's a little boring but at least I have time to think about things in my life so I guess that's something ! 

 yeah , I totally understand . I always found it relaxing to have some downtime myself. 

 oh , by the way . I just got engaged with this guy I met last year . His name is James , we actually work together in a small company called James and Bob . 

 oh ! How did that happen ? 

 well , he's been trying to ask me out for the past six months but I kept putting him off until one day he just told me how much he likes me without any preamble or anything. It was a total surprise ! 

 wow . That must have been very exciting. How do you like being engaged ? 

 it's nice , but it also feels like there are so many things to prepare for . I haven't even finished planning our honeymoon yet . What about you ? You still seeing that girl who was in your class before ? 

 nope . We broke up a few months ago actually. It wasn't an amicable parting though , she was really angry with me when we split up so I think it will be better for both of us if we don't talk about her anymore . 

 oh ! That's too bad . You two seemed like you were great together . What happened ? Did she just get bored or something ? 

 nope , not at all . It was my fault actually . I was always complaining about how much time I spent with her and how it affected my personal life so she decided to break up with me . We had a big fight before that and then I never saw her again after that . 

 oh ! That's horrible! 

 yeah , I guess we both made mistakes. It's not too late for us though . Maybe if we can just clear things up between the two of us then everything will be okay ! 

 hey ! Let me get you a drink . 

 sure ! 

 hehe . That's good stuff . 

 yeah , I bought it from this new wine store down the road that sells some pretty rare wines. It's quite expensive but they have really great service and the staff is so friendly . You should go check them out sometime . 

 I'll do just that ! Thanks for the recommendation ! What are you up to these days anyway ? You still working on your novel as much as ever ? 

 yeah , it seems like I haven't done anything else since I started writing this book but maybe it's time for a change . I mean, if there's nothing interesting going in my life then why should I bother trying to write about things that aren't even true anymore ? It would be better if I just gave up on the idea altogether . 

 hahaha. So what do you think you want to do with yourself these days , then ? 

 I don't know . Maybe it would be good for me to take some time off from work and spend more time with my family instead of just working all day everyday . It seems like there are so many things that we could do together but we never seem to have the chance anymore since our kids keep getting older ! 

 oh , that's true . It would be nice if you had some free time again to spend with them . Maybe you should take a vacation soon ? 

 yeah , I think it might be best for everyone involved if we just stopped working together and focused on being more of a family instead of trying to keep things running like always ! 

 hehehahaha. That's true , that would be really great . Maybe someday when you finally have some free time again , I can come over here for dinner or something . What do you think ? 

 yeah , definitely . It sounds like it could be fun if we did things together more often ! Let's talk about this soon . Oh ! One other thing : Are there any changes in your life that might interest me as well? 

 nope . Not really . Everything is just the same as always . 

 hey , I didn't mean to ask you about your personal life . It was just curiosity. Is everything going okay at work these days ? How have things been since Jenn left ? 

 yeah , I miss her a lot but there's nothing that we can do about it right now . We still talk on the phone every night though so maybe someday we could get back together again ! 

 that sounds really great ! Is she going to move back with you or anything ? 

 nope , not at all . I think it's better if she stays where she is because it would be easier for us both if we were in separate places instead of being forced into staying together . We still love each other though so maybe someday we could get back together again ! 

 hehehahaha. That sounds like a great plan , Bob! I think you guys have really grown as individuals over the past few years since we last saw each other so it might be better for us both to stay apart in order to work on ourselves rather than being forced into a relationship just because that's what people expect from us ! 

 hehe . You know , there was this one time when I used to dream about living together with my boyfriend but then he moved away and now he never comes back anymore so maybe it would be best if we didn't talk about anything related to relationships or anything like that ! It just makes me sad whenever I think about it . 

 yeah , that sounds really horrible . How did it happen ? 

 well , there was this one time when he wanted me to marry him but then he moved away and now he never comes

yeah, of course . I think it is about time we do something together , anyway ! How are the kids ? Do they miss you at all ? 

 I have missed them so much since I started working . But I know that they are happy with their nanny . My parents live nearby so it is easy for me to see them every day . But I can't wait to be able to pick up my little girl and carry her around the house again , like when she was a baby ! 

 I think I understand you . At first, it must have been difficult to start a family without your parents nearby . But now that you are working so hard and your wife can take care of the children , I guess you don't mind living in the suburbs ? 

 yeah . I really like it here . The neighbourhood is quite pleasant and the kids' schools are good too . Of course I miss the city sometimes. But for a man my age, I think this is exactly what I need to be happy ! 

 I know , you have been through so much since graduation . You must be tired of all your responsibilities . It makes me realize that maybe it's time I too thought about settling down and finding the right woman for me . Maybe then, I can forget my past and start a new life with someone who really loves me 

 you are so cute ! But how could anyone ever love someone like me ? No , no . Let's not talk about this any further. What we have to discuss is the reunion party on Saturday night . 

 oh, I think it will be great . I can't wait to see everyone again ! 

 yes , me too . I hope there are not too many people . I want to sit and catch up with my old friends. Not just stand around like a wallflower all the time ! But I am glad you came early so that we could have our own little conversation ! It's been ages since we talked like this , hasn't it ? 

 yeah, of course . It feels great to talk and share our thoughts with each other again . I can't believe how much has changed in ten years . And you haven't changed one bit ! You are still the same old Bob who used to annoy me so much at school ! 

 okay , okay . But don't you think it's about time we talked more seriously ? You must have something on your mind . I remember what you were like ten years ago and how difficult it was for you to get out of bed every morning . Now that things are going well, I hope you will be able to tell me what's going on in your life ! 

 yeah , I know . I wish we had a chance to talk more privately but it's always crowded at these reunions . We should get together sometime soon and have dinner or something . 

 okay, I will call you as soon as possible. You must be leaving already because I am sure there are so many people waiting to greet you ! Bye for now , Bob . Thanks for coming ! See you soon .
