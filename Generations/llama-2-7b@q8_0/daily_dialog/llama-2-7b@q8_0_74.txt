" not any more . She left me for some guy at work . "

" oh ! That sucks . "

" yeah , I'm still getting over it . But don't feel sorry for me Bob, because there's always something good that comes from bad things . After she left me , I finally decided to go back to college and study business administration . And now I am doing well . "

" great ! And what about you ? "

" me? Well, I'm still in the same field as ten years ago . It was pretty hard at first but things are starting to pick up . "

" so, how about marriage ? Is that something you are thinking of nowadays ? "

" no , not really . In fact , I've been working too much and I haven't had the time . I don't even have a girlfriend . I just hope to meet someone someday when things get better at work . But right now, all I can think about is my career . "

" that's good for you , Bob ! You know me well enough. I will never stop being a bachelor . It doesn't matter to me whether people say it's normal or not . Besides , we should focus on our future right now . We don't want to be too busy thinking about these trivial things and let us waste our time . "

" yeah, I'm sure we won't . We still see the others around , but not too often . "

" I was talking about other graduates that we haven't seen since then . "

" well, there are so many of them out there . "

" let me tell you about my classmates . There is Lily . She works as a secretary for the mayor of this city . She is married to Jack , and has two sons with him . I see her every now and then . Then there's Tom who runs his own business in this city . He's single, but looking forward to settle down one day . "

" that's too bad he's still unmarried . It seems like all my friends are getting married already , while I am the only bachelor left . "

" well, I guess it's because we were all so close in school . We shared everything with one another and grew up together . That's probably why everyone wants to get married now . "

" yeah , maybe . But hey Bob , there is an old friend of ours who has been looking for you . She used to work for the same company as us , but now she lives in the United States . You two were very good friends then, and I'm sure she wants to see you again "

" really ? "

" yeah ! She will be coming tomorrow afternoon. She has been trying to get back here for quite some time now , so when she finally got her passport she decided not to wait any longer . I hope the two of us can catch up on things again . We've been apart for too long . "

" well, that sounds great ! You know how it is in this country. Once you leave , you never come back . "

" yeah, but at least she finally managed to return home . That's what matters right ? "

" yep . Well I better get going now . We have a lot of things to catch up on ! "

" sure thing Bob . See ya 'round ! "
