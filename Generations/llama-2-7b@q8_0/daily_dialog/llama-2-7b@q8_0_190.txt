" What kind of paintings does she like to do ? "

" She likes doing flower and animal paintings . "

" Then you don't need to buy any oil paints , because it is not easy for kids to use them . They might even get hurt if they are careless . And there's no need to buy a large set of water color sets either . "

" Really ? I heard that these are the best ones for kids . "

" Yes , but kids can do beautiful paintings using just one or two colors in small containers and brushes. You don't have to buy expensive paints and a whole set of brushes . You know what ? If you give your niece an empty glass bottle, she could use it as an oil painting container instead . And if she wants to paint with water colors , a small plastic cup will be enough for her to practice. "

" Professor Li ! Can I ask you something else about art supplies ? "

" Of course , what is it ? "

" I'm buying a set of drawing materials as a gift for my friend . It doesn't have to be very expensive, right ? "

" That depends on what your friend likes doing . If she prefers painting pictures and landscapes using oil paints , you can buy her some oil paint sets . And if she is into pencil drawing , then a set of colored pencils will do the job. You don't need to buy anything more . "

" But what about the sketchbooks ? "

" Sketchbooks are not as important for beginners . They should focus on practice first and develop their own style. Once they get good at drawing , then it is time for them to start buying sketchbooks . "

" I see ! Professor Li, do you know where to buy art supplies ? "

" There are a lot of stores selling different kinds of painting materials in my city . Just take a bus and go to the art center on your own. You will be surprised by all the things they have there . "
