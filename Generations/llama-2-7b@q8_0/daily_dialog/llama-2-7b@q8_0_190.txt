Ok . Can you tell me the name of your nephew ? I am sure we have a good artist . 

 Yes . She likes to paint with oil . Her grandfather was also an artist . 

 I think I know him . Where does he live ? 

 In Shanghai . He just came back from Berlin and now he's living in Suzhou .

What do you mean by a "good" set ?  

 Well , she needs crayons , pencils and colored paper . But that's not all . She also wants oil paints, watercolors and chalk . It must be very good quality too . 

 I don't know exactly where to get this from . The closest art supply store is not very convenient for me as it's in the city center . It would take me a lot of time and effort to go there . That's why I was wondering if you have any suggestions on how I should go about buying all these supplies . 

 I suppose you can always order them online . There are several sites that sell art supplies . 

 Okay , thank you very much for your help . It will be a lot easier with your advice .
