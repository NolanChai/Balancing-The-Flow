I guess it will take many more years, because they are still building . 

 They are working hard , but there aren't enough manpower.

 I have never been to an Olympic stadium before . It’s so cool that we can watch the games here !

 I am sure we are gonna see many exciting things !

There are 80,000 people can sit in . 

 And how much do these Olympic games cost? 

 A lot of money is spent on building a good sport venue , and there are so many sports to play . So I guess it must be very expensive .

It isn’t just a park , but also a place for sports events . 

 Then we will have another sports event in this stadium next year ? 

 No , it is not possible . We need to renovate the whole stadium first . 

 So how much money do you expect they spend on it ? 

 The price of everything is very high nowadays . 

 Yes , but the government has already decided the budget . 

 Then what will be the final cost ? 

 It must be over ten million dollars . 

 Wow ! I wonder how much they have paid for it so far ? 

 They have spent two million already .

Is this where they do horse racing ? 

 Yes , but the racecourse is further ahead . 

 Oh ! I know that too . It’s for the Olympic games . 

 Yes , we can watch them live ! And those are the hockey rink , and tennis courts ...
