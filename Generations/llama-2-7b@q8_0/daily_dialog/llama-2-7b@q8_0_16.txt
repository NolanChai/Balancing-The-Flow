You know I don't like football . 

 But this is the best time of day for watching TV . I can't watch it when my father is home. He hates all football programs on the TV. So, I only get to watch them during the weekend. 

 Well , you have a good point. 

 I will change the channel then. 

 Oh , good! Thank you.

 It's your pleasure !

What about sports and movies ? I don't like to watch them too much . 

 They are my favourite . Can we see some of those tonight ? 

 Sure ! You can choose from 27 channels . And you can record your favorite programmes on the set-top box if you like . 

 Oh , thanks . But what about you ? Do you have any favourites ? 

 I do too . The programme on Channel 9 is very interesting . I think it will be better to watch this one tonight . 

 OK . So what are we watching then ? 

 I don't know yet , I need to decide which programme I like most .

Not another stupid quiz show ! 

 Yes , that is today's programme . Do you want me to change it ? 

 No . Just let it go on for five minutes more and then turn off the television . 

 What do you mean ? You don't like quiz shows ? 

 Of course I do ! 

 But not when there is only one contestant . I always watch those ones with two contestants . 

 Oh , that will be different today . There are two people taking part in the game . 

 I know. That's why I don't want to watch it any more ! 

 Well , you have just missed it now anyway . We can turn on again next week and see if there is anyone else in the studio . 

 Really ? There must be other people wanting to take part then . 

 Not so many . They seem to think that they are clever enough to win a lot of money by answering simple questions , but not very many of them manage it . 

 How do you know , then ? You've never seen anyone else in the studio before . Have you ? 

 No. But I have been watching for over ten years now , and I think that I could answer more than half the questions myself . 

 Could you ? Really ? Then why don't you go on the programme yourself ? 

 Perhaps next week . Who knows ? 

 We shall see . Good night !

Do we have to watch it ? 

 Yes , I think so . Why are you against it , then ? 

 Because they don't understand English . Besides, the commentators are always shouting at us . 

 Shouting ? They can't help that ! 

 OK , just change to channel 5 now !
