" What makes you laugh ? "

" My sister . "

" I can tell you what doesn ’ t make me laugh — — "

" Oh, that ’ s too bad. "

" What does your father look like? "

" He has a black face and whiskers , just like yours . "

" And your mother ? "

" She looks as though she had a dress on her back . "

" But I suppose you don ’ t know her. "

" No; I wish I did. Then when we go to see her I can say, ‘ That ’ s my mother! ’ "

" Who is your father? "

" Well , if he was here I could tell you ; but you see I haven ’ t seen him yet."

" Where have you come from ? "

" From a far away place ——"

" How long did it take you to get here ? "

" We went in an aeroplane. "

" That was quick work ! "

" Yes ; but when we had been flying for two days, the propeller fell off. "

" And how did you make a landing after that? "

" We landed on a hill , and didn ’ t get hurt at all . "

" I should think not ! But tell me what made you come to America ? "

" Our captain told us there was money in it ——"

" Your father was in business? "

" Yes ; he had an office . "

" And where is your home ? "

" I don ’ t know. We came here from a place where the water was red . "

" How do you like America? "

" It ’ s too cold for me."

" Are you not going to school ? "

" No; because I can read already , and I like it better than lessons. Whenever we play , my sister has to be the teacher ."

" What is your name? "

" Lilly. "

" How old are you? "

" Twelve . "

" Are you as big as that ? " (indicating a small child)

" Oh, yes ; I was bigger when we started out of Egypt . "

" And how long ago was that?"

" About forty years."

" Do you like being here? "

" Yes; but it ’ s too hot , and my mother doesn ’ t know any English."

" And what do they say in your country ? "

" The same as they do in America , only we have more words. For instance, I had an aunt who lived far away . We called her ‘ Cousin Lilly ’ , but when she came to see us she said , ‘ How are you ? ’ — and that ’ s what made me cry."

" But why didn ’ t you answer her? "

" Because my mother told me not to speak, I didn ’ t know what she meant ."

" And how did you come back to your aunt after you had been over here ? "

" My mother took us in a boat."

" What sort of boat was it? "

" A very big one ——"

" Didn ’ t the captain tell you when he came up there? "

" No ; but I saw him jump into the water. "

" Where did they come from ? "

" From my aunt ’ s house."

" What do people say in your country, and how do they spell it? "

" They say ‘ How are you ? ’ But when we speak to them , we just laugh ; for the way that we say it is funny to us . "

" Do you know what they say about Americans ? "

" Oh, yes; but I don ’ t believe everything. It makes me cry sometimes . "

" What do they say? "

" They say that American children are more naughty than any others in the world , and that their mothers have to lock them up at night."

" Is this true ? "

" I don ’ t know. Sometimes we have to be locked up ; but my mother doesn ’ t do it on purpose . She has a good reason for it sometimes."

" What is the name of your home town? "

" That ’ s what I forgot to tell you; and if I had known you were coming over here , I would have told you. We live in Chicago . "

" Then how do you come to be out in this country ? "

" We came down on a ship, but the captain got lost."

" And what did your mother say about that? "

" She said it wasn ’ t his fault. "

" But don ’ t you know where Chicago is? "

" Yes; and I know my way from here to there . "

" What else do they say in your country ? "

" They say that when a girl grows up, she has to marry the man who pays her most. And then I want to tell you something. When we were coming over here , two men came along with us and one of them paid more than the other; so that ’ s why my sister married him."

" How long have they been married ? "

" About three weeks . "

" What is your father like? "

" He is fat ——"

" Fat ? Why, you ’ re as thin as a stick ! "

" Oh, but I get so much to eat at home . "

" Then tell me what they say in your country. How do the people speak there? What kind of houses do you have, and what is the name of your town ? You see, my little boy hasn ’ t told me a word about where he comes from, except that he wants to know how to spell Chicago . "

" He can tell you better than I can. But I ’ ll show him how to say it :
‘ Chica-go ! ’ That ’ s what they call it. And when my father gets up in the morning , he says, ‘ Good morning!’ — and when we come home from school, my mother says, ‘ Good evening ! ’ Then she calls us to supper . "

" Do you know how old your father is? "

" I don ’ t know exactly. I think he must be as old as the devil."

" Is that all you know about it ? "

" Yes; and now my sister wants me to ask you where Chicago is . "

" Have you been there yourself ? "

" No ; but a man came out of it one day , and he told me how to get there ——"

" And what did you say? "

" I said, ‘ How do you spell that place? ’ He said, ‘ C-h-i-c-a-g-o . ’ But when we were coming over here , one man said it was spelled a different way ; but then my sister married the one who paid her most."

" And what else did he say?"

" I asked him if there weren ’ t any other places like that where they had to pay more than others ? "

" Why did you ask him? "

" Because we were coming from a place where the people didn ’ t give me any candy , and I wanted to know what would make them do it. He said he knew nothing about it, but if I came back again in five years I might know."

" But haven’t you been there since ? "

" Oh yes ; we went last summer . We were down on the lake for three weeks . It was a very nice time; and when my sister said she had to get married, I said that it wasn ’ t necessary. So my mother told me to shut up."

" Where is your father? "

" He died about six years ago . But don’t you see ? If he had been living , we never would have come here . "

" And how old are you?"

" I don ’ t know exactly; but my sister says I am twelve."

" How much do they say in your country? "

" They say, ‘ How do you do ? ’ and when a man wants to see another man, he calls him up , and then the other comes. And when he gets there, one of them shakes hands with the other . And then I want to tell you something: Last night when we went to bed , my sister said that she wished some of us would get married. "

" Who was there ? "

" My mother and father ; and my grandfather came too. We all sat down in the big room, where it ’ s dark. And then somebody read out of a book . It was about the Bible , and it made me cry when I heard what they said."

" Did you know that your parents were married before ? "

" Oh yes ! That was just after the war ; but I don ’ t remember it. "

" And how old are you, little boy? "

" I think I am six or seven years old , because my mother has been pregnant with me so long."
