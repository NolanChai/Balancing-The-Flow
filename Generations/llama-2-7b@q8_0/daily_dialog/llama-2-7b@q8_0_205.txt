How do you like my new suit ? 

 Oh , it suits you well ! I don't know what the old one looked like. 

 Is this your hat ? 

 It belongs to my father . Do you want it? 

 You can have it if you wish . 

 Do you mean that? 

 Of course . 

 Yes , I do ! 

 What did he say? 

 He said, “ Yes, I do ” . 

 When is your mother coming ? 

 I don’t know when she ’ s coming. She always says she ’ ll come . 

 But you were here when she came the last time , weren't you ? 

 I suppose so . I was very young then. 

 Who do you like better, your father or your mother? 

 Oh ! My father is much nicer to me than my mother . 

 Do you think he loves you more than she does? 

 I don’t know , but I believe it . 

 Then why doesn't your father let you do as you please ? 

 He lets me do whatever I wish. But that isn't the way my mother has ever taught me to act. 

 Do you have much trouble with your father? 

 Oh! No . He never scolds me when he’s home , but I know it makes him very angry when we are naughty, and he has to punish us. 

 How many brothers or sisters do you have ? 

 Just one brother . His name is Johnny. We have the same father and mother , but not quite the same mother. They have a new mother now. 

 Then your new mother isn’t like your old one, eh? 

 No , she isn't ! But you see, we only have one real mother, and I don't know just how many fathers. You can have two, if they are the right kind. I have a brother, but he has no father . He belongs to me . 

 Then what do you call your other brothers ? 

 Just brothers , like myself . 

 Do you love them ? 

 I think so . I don't know how much. They are just boys. But it seems as if they were always doing something naughty . It makes me mad to see them play with dolls and things that little girls have. And yet , they wouldn’t like me to play with their things, would they? 

 Why should they not ? You mustn't mind what they do. Boys are boys, and we must let them be boys . If you can’t stand it , get along without them. I like my brothers very much ; but sometimes they tease me so that I just want to run away from home. 

 Would you rather stay at school ? 

 Yes ! I wish I had never come back. They are all mean boys here, and I don't know a single girl . All the girls at my old school were very nice to me. I never knew that there were such bad boys as these until I came away from them , and now I hate them worse than ever. 

 Do you want to see your father ? 

 No ! I don't care anything about him . He’s a big, fat man. And he says he doesn’t want us any more. I wish he would go away somewhere where we couldn’t find him , and then my mother wouldn’t need to marry again. She has never been married before, you know ; and when she does get married it ’ ll be the first time . 

 Oh ! No ! My father is the second one , isn't he ? 

 Yes ! He was the only real husband my mother ever had . But I don’t want him now . He makes me mad. I hate him . 

 You would like to be at your old school again ? 

 Oh ! yes ! There is a big building there, and it isn't far from our house , so that we can go any time we please ; but my mother won’t let us do it. She says I must study with the boys here at home . But all they do is to play ball or tell stories , or take walks in the woods and pick berries. 

 Are you very naughty ? 

 I don't know how bad I am . Mother thinks so, but Father doesn’t see much wrong in my way of doing things , but he tells me to do as mother wishes . And yet I can’t understand why she is angry with me. I never mean any harm when I play with the boys , and if they tease me I just have to laugh at them because it makes them mad ; and then they say it serves me right for not knowing better than to play with them . 

 What will you do now ? 

 Do? Why, I suppose I must stay here until my father comes back. That’s all there is to do , isn't it? He has been away a long time , hasn’t he? 

 Yes ; he was called out of town by some business that kept him so busy for two whole months . 

 Two months ! I wish he would stay gone then. We have had such fun in his absence! 

 What do you mean? Did your mother stay away too ? 

 Oh no , she went to live with my aunt ’ s family while Father was away. They are rich and they make much more money than Mother can at home, so we had a splendid time there. We were treated like little queens . But now I want Father to come back again ! 

 Is that all ? Then I must go . Good-by ! 

 Good-bye.
