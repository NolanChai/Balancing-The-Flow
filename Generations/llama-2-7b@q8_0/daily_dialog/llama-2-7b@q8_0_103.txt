 We played this game for two years now . It ’ s always been like that ! 

 Everyone knows it is supposed to work like this ! 

 If you want to be a cheater , fine . Just don ’ t come here next week and tell me you were robbed ! 

 I have a hard time believing anything you say !

I don ’ t want a loan !

 Oh ! Really !? That's great news . 

 I guess we are both winners now ! 

 Bye , Banker ! 

 Goodbye !
