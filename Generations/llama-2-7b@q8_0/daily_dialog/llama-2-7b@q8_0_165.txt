I see . Thank you . Please sit down and make yourself comfortable . Can I get you something to drink ? 

 No thank you . That ’ s not necessary . 

 Now , where do we stand with your application ? 

 Well , my name is Wang Sian and I was born in Liaoning Province . I ’ ve been working for a shoe factory there since I graduated from high school four years ago . The Director of Personnel offered me this job after interviewing me last week . 

 You applied for a position with our company last week ? That was very fast ! 

 Yes , it was . In fact , we had been planning to open an office in Beijing and were looking for good workers at that time . I think my superior knows what qualities are needed in our new office . 

 How long will you be with us ? 

 Well , two years . After this period , I plan to move to the United States where my father is already working . So if it ’ s okay for your company, may I begin as soon as possible ? 

 Certainly . That ’ s fine with us . As long as you ’ re qualified. We ’ ll give you a letter of appointment and send it to you when you leave the office today . 

 Thank you very much , Mr . Peter ! I hope our cooperation will be successful !

 ______________________

Now , would you tell me more about yourself ? What are your aims in life ? What do you expect to be in the future ? 

 Well , I ’ M not too sure at the moment … I think I want to be a doctor or maybe a teacher . 

 Really ? A good career for you . 

 Oh yes ! Teaching is one of the most important professions in our country ; so doctors are needed everywhere all over the world. So if you decide on one , you ’ D better stick to it and work hard … And don’t expect any promotion until you ’ ve earned it by yourself . 

 Thank you very much , Mr . Peter . I really appreciate your advice . 

 You’re welcome , Miss Wang . Do have a cup of coffee . 

 No thanks. I ’ M in a hurry.

Excellent ! We are looking for a person who has good communication skills . 

 Oh , yes . Well, let ’ s continue . How do you feel about working here ? 

 It would be an honor to work for such a prestigious company . 

 I see . Now , can you tell me something more about your work experiences ? 

 Yes . I have worked as a salesman in several different companies before . I ’ ve also held various administrative posts in the same line of business . In my last job, I was in charge of public relations and media affairs for six months . 

 Well , how do you feel about taking on this position ? 

 As a matter of fact, I think I have a good chance to prove myself because I ’ m very experienced in salesmanship and administrative work . 

 I see . 

 You ’ ll be paid a competitive salary . Is that sufficient ? 

 Oh , yes . 

 I see . I believe you are qualified for the job. Now, I need to get your resume to examine it in depth . May I take a copy of it ? 

 Sure . Here is my resume . Please give me a copy as well . 

 Okay . 

 Thank you for coming , Miss Wang . I ’ ll keep in touch with you by telephone . You can call anytime between seven and eight o’clock tomorrow night if you are interested. If not, please inform us . That will be all for today . Goodbye !

And then I went to Taiwan to take some courses on Personnel Management at Tunghai University . 

 That ’ s good . What were your grades like during school ? 

 My grades were pretty good . 

 Your English is quite good , too . Do you have any other foreign languages ? 

 Well , I took a course in German for two years at Beijing University and also a course in Japanese here in Taiwan. 

 Good . What about your Chinese language skills ? 

 As you see I can speak it fluently . 

 I understand that you are now working as an accountant here at the office . Have you been satisfied with your job ? 

 Well , yes . But I ’ m looking for a change . 

 What do you think of our Personnel Department ? 

 Well … it’s too large and complicated to be organized properly . 

 So why not work here in the department instead of having to go to an office to perform your duties ? 

 I don ’ t know…. I really like my present job very much because I can use my accounting skills there . 

 Oh , I see . Well then , you won ’ t be interested in working for Personnel then ? 

 No , not really . 

 But if you were to work here, what would your duties be ? 

 I ’ m afraid that they might be too routine for me because I am more of a creative person . 

 Do you think it will be monotonous to do the same thing all day long ? 

 Yes , I guess so …. But if I were here , maybe I could make some changes ….. 

 Well , we don ’ t have any vacancies right now . What about other companies ? 

 Oh , well…. there are lots of them in the area where I live , but they all seem to be too small for me . 

 Why not join one of your old friends and work for him or her ? 

 No , thanks . I prefer a larger company . 

 What do you like most about working for Personnel ? 

 Well…. the people are friendly here . I feel at home with them …. 

 Do you have any experience in training new personnel ? 

 Yes, actually I ’ ve had some courses in Personnel Administration and I was promoted as an assistant to one of our accountants last month . 

 Are you good at giving instructions ? 

 Well , yes…. I think so . 

 Have you ever given a speech or made a presentation before a group ? 

 Yes, once at my high school graduation ceremony …. 

 Can you tell me about it ? 

 It ’ s kind of a long story . Let me see , where should I start…..? 

 That ’ s okay …. Please continue . 

 As the representative from my class, I had to give an introduction speech about the graduates in my class before all of them walked out on the stage to receive their diplomas . 

 What did you say in your speech ? 

 I talked about what each person contributed to our class , how they got along together as a group and so forth …. 

 Well , that ’ s very nice …. 

 You are obviously good at public speaking ! 

 Thank you . Do you know any other language besides English ? 

 I don ’ t think so . But my father used to be a French teacher for a number of years and he still speaks French pretty well . 

 Let me see ….. How would you describe your work experience at that trade company in Macao ? 

 Well , it was OK…. It gave me some valuable working experience . 

 What kind of things did you do there ? 

 I did everything from accounting and bookkeeping to typing and answering the phone for my supervisor ….. 

 Are your skills very good at each of those tasks? 

 Yes , they are pretty good now …. 

 How long have you worked in Personnel ? 

 It has been more than two years …. 

 Do you think it is a big challenge for you to work here as a junior officer ? 

 Well , I ’ m sure it will be quite interesting . 

 What about your salary ? 

 Well , it’s good enough for me and it meets my family needs at the moment …. 

 Do you know much about Personnel Management? 

 I am not an expert, but I do keep up with the current changes in this field . 

 What are your hobbies ? 

 I like to read novels , especially those by Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo . 

 Any other special interests besides literature ? 

 Yes, I like to play tennis too ….. 

 Can you tell me more about yourself? 

 Well , my father was a college professor at the University in Shanghai until he retired. He is now a visiting professor at our local university and lectures there on Chinese History . My mother is a housewife, but she likes to help her husband with his research projects ….. 

 Do you have any brothers or sisters ? 

 Yes , I do . There are four of us in all …. Three sisters and one brother…. 

 Are your parents still living ? 

 They died five years ago when they were both ninety-one . My two sisters live here with me , but my younger brother is a lawyer living in Hong Kong at the moment .. 

 Oh, I see ….. So you are really alone here on campus now ? 

 Yes , I guess so…. 

 Do you like to work? 

 Well , not really . It ’ s more of an obligation for me than anything else . 

 Is there any other job you would prefer doing instead of working at Personnel ? 

 Yes , I ’ m sure that if it weren ’ t for the financial need, I would rather be a travel agent or an executive assistant in some company ….. 

 Which do you like better, working in a large company or a small one? 

 Actually , I think I am more suited to work in a smaller setting where I can get to know my co-workers well . 

 Is there any other place you prefer to live than Taiwan ? 

 Well, not really …. It ’ s not as comfortable and convenient as Hong Kong is , but it ’ s a nice place for me to work here in the Personnel Department . 

 Why didn ’ t you apply for an assistant job at your old friend’s office instead of Personnel ? 

 Well, I guess his boss may have preferred someone with more experience ….. 

 What are your goals? 

 Well , I hope to be promoted to a higher position within three years …. 

 Can you tell me how you would feel working at the same company for a long time without any promotion or salary increase ? 

 Actually, I don ’ t think it will bother me much because I don’t want to work very hard anyway . My main interest is in literature and learning new things about culture . 

 Can you tell me why? 

 Well , because I believe that the best education is what life itself can provide us with ….. 

 Are there any other reasons ? 

 Yes, I think it ’ s more important to know yourself better instead of working at some job which just earns money for your living expenses only . 

 Thank you very much for coming today , Miss Wang . It was a pleasure talking with you ….. 

 You’re welcome , Mr . Peter . 

 Good-bye !

Did you find your job difficult ? 

 Well … not so much ! I found it easier than expected. 

 Why is that ? 

 Well , because I had good preparation . 

 Which classes have you been to ? 

 To the English class of our college . 

 Do you have any other experience in this area ? 

 Yes , last year my friend and I organized an entertainment show for the students . We sold tickets and set up the scene for it. 

 Didn ’ t that take a lot of work ? 

 It was hard but we learned to do it well . 

 How long did you organize this show ? 

 Three months .
