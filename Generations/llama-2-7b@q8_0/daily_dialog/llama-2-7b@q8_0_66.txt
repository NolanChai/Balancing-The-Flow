I don't care how much it costs - what matters to me is that this is an original - not some cheap imitation. 

 I want the genuine article - a genuine, original , handmade Chinese silk tapestry from ancient times. 

 And that means no modern copy ! 

 Okay okay ! Just be sure you're satisfied when it comes back to you. 

 The quality will be as good if not better than the originals . 

 You can buy it with your eyes closed and I guarantee you won't be disappointed - as long as I make a profit. 

 You know my reputation ! My customers are always delighted with what they get from me .

 Well then - just to put an end to this - when can we start ? 

 I don't want it to take too long because of the customs delay, but at the same time it has to be right. 

 And I would like it in time for my trip next month to China where I'll present it to the president. 

 The president will be amazed - he thinks it was a gift from me personally to him . 

 He's going to love this . You won't be sorry ! 

 What are you doing now ? Doing anything special ? 

 Just looking for something to do before dinner. 

 I just found out that the Chinese restaurant in town is closed and that I can't get a decent meal anywhere else on short notice . 

 You could come with me - we'll have an early supper . 

 That would be nice but I have something to do first . 

 I won't keep you waiting long. 

 All right - if that's what you say . 

 It was good meeting you and I hope your shopping goes well.

 Goodbye !

Not at all , but first ... I have some questions . 

 What kind of ? 

 Are we friends or not? 

 Well yes and no . 

 We are just starting to know each other , so it's like we're both new , right ? 

 Uh-huh . 

 And I really want your opinion on something. 

 Tell me . 

 The question is how long you should stay in China and how much time you think it will take to get into the groove of things here? 

 Well , it depends on what you mean by "getting into the groove" . 

 You know , I'm not sure about what I want . I was just thinking ... Maybe I should stay a little longer and go abroad again later ? What do you think about that ? 

 Too late to say no ? But if it's too late then maybe we should both go to the flea market in the morning and start our adventures over there.
