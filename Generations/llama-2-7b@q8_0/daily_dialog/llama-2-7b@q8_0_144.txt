" People rushing for their lunch ? "

" Yes , they're in hurry . "

" So you have to wait a long time, don't you ? "

" Not really. You can get what you want even if you stand behind the people who are already ahead of you. You just have to look at their trays and pretend that everything is OK . "

" And when you go to dinner , do they give you a knife , a fork and a spoon ? "

" No, because we eat in silence so we don't need them . "

" Why not? "

" Well , the first reason is that it's difficult for us to speak with a mouth full of food . And also eating by yourself gives you more time to think and talk about serious things. For instance , if there are two men at table, one will say :

\strong{" It seems our company is going to have some problems in the future ." }

\em{and the other man says} :

\strong{" I'm sorry to hear that . "}

\em{and they continue talking like this without thinking about the knife and fork.}

" But what if you want to eat something else ? "

" No problem at all , because we can put the tray down on the floor and help ourselves from it again . "

" And if a man who is sitting by himself wants to speak with another man who is also alone? "

\em{The old lady stares hard at her student.}

" They can just stand up and walk to the other table . "

\em{The class laughs.}

" That's very interesting , but you said before that you were in a hurry when people rushed for their lunch . So how long do they have to stay at the buffet ? "

" It depends on what kind of food you like . "

\em{The old lady stares at her student.}

" If you want to eat fast, then you have to choose a simple thing , for instance , an apple or a banana."

\em{The class laughs again.}

" But if you're hungry , and you like more complicated food, it will take longer. For example , when I went to the buffet with my friend, she took some rice, soup, salad, cheese , vegetables, beans, an egg , a sausage, tomato sauce and a meat dish . "

" And how long did she stand in line ? "

" She waited more than thirty minutes because the food was so delicious. But for me it was enough to eat a piece of cake."

" Okay . "

" Then walk through the line until you reach a table and sit down to eat . "

" All right , I'll try it tomorrow . "

" Why are there so many people in this room ? "

" Because we're all hungry ! "

" Great , now can I have some chicken ? "

" Sure , take a plate and fill it with what you want . "

" What do I do next ? "

" Go stand at any table , eat your food , then leave . "

" All done, I guess that's the way to do it ! "

" If not , try again ! "
