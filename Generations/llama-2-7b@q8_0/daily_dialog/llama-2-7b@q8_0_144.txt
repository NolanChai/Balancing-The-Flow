Wait your turn , take what you want and eat it with no one around . 

 You can choose from hamburgers , salad , fruit juice, pie or cake .

 The prices are very low . 

 You pay only for what you get. 

 There's a shortage of food in many countries . 

 We should have more factories and farms to provide better living standards . 

 Many people don't like cooking .

 They would rather eat out at restaurants and cafeterias , so prices are high. 

 I think we should grow our own foods . 

 We'll need less oil from abroad.

 Everyone can do it, if they want to . 

 All you have to do is plant seeds in your backyard garden and wait until they sprout . 

 You don't need any special equipment , just some time and effort .

 We should put our efforts into producing more foods at home . 

 Instead of spending money on gasoline, we should plant flowers .

 This way , we can have beautiful gardens.

You may get a big piece of meat , if you arrive early enough. 

 However , I must warn you against eating too much , because your stomach will hurt afterwards . 

 Don't worry about the cost . The meals are cheap and tasty . 

 Don’t forget to bring some money with yourself , so that you can pay for the food. 

 Now it is time for us to go to lunch . 

 I shall pick up a tray , too. 

 How many slices of bread do you need ? 

 Just two ! I don't want too much .

 You eat too much food . You will get sick later on.

I’ll have a bowl of tomato soup , a sandwich and an apple pie. 

 Have you been here before ? 

 No sir, but it is very nice .

 What are they serving today? 

 Chicken wings , pork chops , rice pudding and apple crisp . 

 I’ll have a bowl of chili , some potatoes and apple pie. 

 The food looks good , doesn’t it ? 

 Sure does ! 

 I think I’ll just sit down here for a minute. 

 Why not? 

 I like the way they serve the meals in this cafeteria .

Oh , there is a name on each tray , isn't it ? 

 Sure , they have English names. 

 Do you want to take this with a cup of coffee ? 

 I prefer just a bottle of water . 

 Just put any number of the foods that you want in your tray , then take it and go to another line for paying . 

 Then stand at the table and start eating when there is no one standing at the table . 

 This way we get rid of a lot of people who like to stand around and chat with friends and eat slowly .

 What's wrong with that ? 

 That's why I said we have too many tables and not enough workers.
