### Explanations of the Dialogue

#### First Part
Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?

This sentence is a greeting and it is used when we talk to someone for the first time or after an interval. This way we let others know that we wish them well. This phrase could also be followed by "It's nice seeing you". 

Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?

We ask how someone has been doing in order to get information about their life or current situation. It can be used after a conversation. We can also use the phrase "How have you been?" without adding anything else, in this case it is implied that we wish to know about the person's well-being and are showing our concern.

#### Second Part

Things are going well for me , Joe .

In this sentence, 'me' is a pronoun used to refer to someone or something that is not being mentioned or does not exist in reality. Here it refers to the speaker (Joe). The speaker wishes to tell us that things are going well for him in general. 

Want to go see a movie tonight ?

We ask someone if they would like to do some activity with us, either at the moment or later on in time. This phrase is used as an invitation and we expect our friend to accept the invitation. The sentence can be shortened when we are sure that our friend will agree : "Wanna go see a movie tonight?" 

My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .

In this sentence, 'my' is also used as an adjective. This means it refers to the owner of something or someone. In this case, we can replace the word with 'my'. This shows possession and ownership in English. The speaker wishes to tell us that his parents are going to take him to dinner at a certain time on a particular night. 

What time does that movie start ?

The phrase "what time does" is used as a question mark when we want to find out the time of an activity or event. This question can be used in both informal and formal situations. We use this to make sure if the person who has invited us to do something knows what he/she is talking about and wishes to make sure that everything goes on properly. In the sentence "What time does that movie start?", we expect the speaker to answer with a specific time. 

That movie starts at six o'clock and ends at eight thirty .

In this sentence, 'that' is an adjective used to describe something in particular. This means it refers to something previously mentioned or described, without giving any information about it. This sentence can be shortened when we know that our friend knows which movie the speaker is talking about : "That movie starts at six o'clock and ends at eight thirty." 

Great ! I will meet you at the theatre . See ya there then .

In this sentence, 'great' is used as an adjective to describe how satisfied we are about something. The phrase "I will meet you" means that we plan on meeting someone who has invited us for some activity or event later on in time. We use this as a response when our friend asks if we can do something together, and it shows our willingness to participate. In this sentence, 'there' is used as an adverb to show the place where we will meet someone : "See ya there then." 

Bye, Mary. Talk to you later.

In this sentence, 'bye', 'Mary' and 'later' are all interjections which are used when we want to end a conversation with our friend or family member.
