Great ! Thank you very much . Do I just fill in and sign this form ? 

 I think so - yes , but we'll go through it together . Have your bank account number ready and the amount of money that you want to pay us every month . If you can give me those two figures here, then we can get on with it . 

 What about these terms and conditions ? They are a bit complicated . 

 That's okay , I'll go through them with you - but not now , because it's your turn to tell me how much you want to pay us every month. 

 All right ! 20 pounds will be the minimum amount, and 35 pounds will be the maximum . If my bill is higher than this one day I'll have to come down and pay the difference . 

 That's fine - we can do that - but if you're sure about your figures , then fill in the form and I'll take it away for processing.

I see . How does it work ? 

 Well , when you give us an order form with the amount and dates you want your money taken from your bank , we will transfer that amount to your local authority on those specific days each month . And there you go : trouble-free bills .

That sounds great ! I'll sign up immediately . I hope it will be simple ? I don't want any fuss or hassle either . Is there anything else I need to do ? 

 You can simply sign up for Direct Debit by calling us on this number ( ) , sending an email ( ) or going down to the branch and filling in a form . 

 Great . That's settled then. Thanks for your help, Madam . Goodbye.
