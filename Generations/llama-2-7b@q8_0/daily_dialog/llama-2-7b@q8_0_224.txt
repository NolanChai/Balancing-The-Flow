" Sounds like a good idea. I think I need some more information . Can you tell me how much it costs and what's involved ? "

" Of course ! It really doesn't cost very much at all . There is an up-front fee of 10 Euro which covers the costs of setting up your Direct Debit , but there are no ongoing charges as such . If you don't want to go for this service we can still accept a monthly payment by cheque or money order , but that would mean coming in here every time to pay . "

" All right then , I think I will sign up for Direct Debit and see how it goes ! "

" Thank you Madam . The Direct Debit form is attached. You can fill it in , send it back to us, and we'll arrange everything from there ."

The Direct Debit form is a simple one-page document requesting your bank account number (which we already know) , the amount you want to pay every month for each of your utility bills , the date on which you would like these payments to start and the name under which you want us to send the receipts.

We can set this up either at the branch where you opened your account (or even at any one of our other branches), or we can come out to visit you at home , but this is more expensive than the other methods. If it's convenient for you , please fill in and sign the Direct Debit form, and then return it by post .

Comment: Thank you for your help, I understand that now. I don't have a problem with the direct debit. What I don't get is why they are saying 'We can set this up at our branch where you opened your account (or even at any one of our other branches)', but then later say 'Please fill in and sign the Direct Debit form, and return it by post.' They contradict themselves - is there a way around that?

Comment: The contradiction is between the two sentences in italics. What you have to do (direct debits are set up at your bank not your utility company) does not contradict what they say about setting them up "at any of our other branches", which is just a marketing statement. They're telling you that the direct debit can be arranged either where you opened your account or elsewhere, but that if it's convenient for you they would arrange it at home (if it's not, then do it at the bank).

Comment: I see what you mean now - thanks so much!

" Well , that sounds wonderful . I don't know why everyone isn't signing up for this service . You said it would be easy ? "

" Yes. It will make things easier for you . We send you a form . All we need is your bank account number and the names of all of the utility companies to whom you want payments made . I hope that helps . "

" Well , thank you very much . You have no idea how much this means to me . Thank you . Goodbye. "
