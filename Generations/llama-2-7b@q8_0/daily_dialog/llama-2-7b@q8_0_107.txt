The little boy went to the door and opened it . It was indeed a letter ! He picked up the letter and came back with it .

" It says here , your father is coming home today . You must be very happy! " said his mother.

" Yes I am Mummy . I'm very excited  "

" That's good . Now get ready to welcome him when he comes . "

The boy got ready for his father and waited eagerly at the door . After some time , a car came slowly and parked outside their house. The front door opened and out walked a man in a blue suit and red tie ! It was his Dad ! He hugged everyone tightly but especially his son who jumped on him and gave him lots of kisses .

" I missed you so much , " the father said to the boy . His eyes were filled with tears. The boy hugged back . He was very excited that he could play together again after a long time !

" What shall we do today ? Can we go to the park and have fun on the swing or slide? " asked the little boy happily .

" Yes of course , it will be great fun  " said his father happily . The two went outside and started playing . They had a wonderful time together.
