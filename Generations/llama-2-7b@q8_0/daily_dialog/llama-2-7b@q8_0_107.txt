Good morning . 

 It is nice to meet you. 

 I am fine . What brings you here this early in the morning ? 

 Well, I came for delivering these books and magazines you ordered some time ago . 

 You have a wide collection of literature , haven't you ?

Yes , I do.

 Do you read all those books?

No . but I keep them because they are nice to look at.

 Well,I guess that you will find something interesting for yourself from my deliveries too . 

 I like reading the books written by English authors and writers and watching English films , but my wife does not like that so much . 

 You can take this book for free . 

 Thanks.You have a nice collection of books here . 

 Yes,I do.It's been a great pleasure to meet you.Bye. 

 Bye-bye!
