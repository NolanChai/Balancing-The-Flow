But if you don't like it, then maybe this watch is too expensive for you . 

 Oh no, you just got me all excited . 

 Don't say that. This is an amazing watch ! 

 Is that right ? Well, I have to admit , It looks good on you . 

 What do you mean ? 

 That watch looks really good on you! You are lucky girl . 

 Oh yes. You look so great with it! I can't wait to buy the same one for my wife .

You don't understand how much money I have spent on clothes and shoes. 

 The strap is very comfortable - just what I wanted ! 

 It has a stopwatch and calculator ! 

 Do you want to see ? 

 It has 108 diamonds in it !  

 This watch cost me more than my car did . 

 You don't understand how much money I make. 

 What do you think of the strap? 

 I hate the way these watches always have diamond and gold straps - they are so tacky. 

 What? A plastic strap ? Why would you ever want to wear that? 

 Do you need me to stop talking now?  

 Is this the end of our discussion about my new watch? 

 I think it's a shame you don't like watches with diamonds and gold. 

 I hope we can still be friends, even though you are so shallow. 

 I have to go now. Have a nice day !  

 Oh - do you want me to show your my new watch ? It cost more than any watch ever made.  

 Can you take the strap off? 

 I'm going to wear it tonight, and see if you can get through dinner without making comments about how much it costs . 

 What do you think of my new watch now - does it look better on ?
