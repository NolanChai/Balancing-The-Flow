I need help on how this is done for our company . 

Can you please guide me through the process ? I will also appreciate a schedule so that I can have a grip on the steps involved and what has been accomplished.

Thank you and have a nice day .

For instance, they can have some amount in this service and allocate it to the subsidiary at will , without affecting the level 1 account . 

 So that they'll be able to smoothly deal with each other even though they use a common currency for inter-company trading . 

 But when a company deals with its customers , this business is not applicable , right ? 

 That's correct . It doesn't work if you're dealing with the public at large . 

 This business service is only available to group companies and their subsidiaries , so it will be inappropriate for your use. 

 If you need a common currency account , we have one called the Cross-border Account Service . 

 It's available to anyone who wants to keep some money on deposit in the foreign exchange market at a stable interest rate . 

 The exchange rate is tied to the spot price of the interbank market and there will be no deductions for service fees , so you can enjoy the convenience and profitability that it offers. 

 So if you need such an account , I would recommend this one to you . 

 But as far as this group company deposit business is concerned, please see our advisor in Account Management . 

 The advisor will be able to show you the benefits and features of this service . 

 Thank you for your time.
