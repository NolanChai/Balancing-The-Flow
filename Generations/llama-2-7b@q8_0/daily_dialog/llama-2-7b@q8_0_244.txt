Oh , yes ! 

 Good morning , Jimmy . 

 Good morning , Jimmy. 

 Now what is the problem today, dear? 

 His toys are noisy and they're annoying me . 

 I understand , dear . 

 Do you know that we have a new playroom in our waiting area ? 

 Yes , but it will be too noisy for Jimmy ! 

 We will have some soft music playing while your son plays . 

 That sounds like a great idea to me. 

 I think I'll try and relax with a cup of tea . 

 Thank you very much. 

 You're welcome . Goodbye , dear. 

 Bye bye, Mrs Williams.

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Yes , doctor . Thank you . I shall take care of him . 

 Goodbye , Jimmy . Have a good rest now . 

 Goodbye , doctor .

Does his heart beat very fast , doctor ? 

 No , it does not . 

 Oh good ! How is my mother, doctor ? She was in hospital with a broken leg.She's feeling so much better now that she came home last week . 

 Yes , I saw her at the hospital . But it was only for four days and now she can walk again.But you must look after her very carefully, Jimmy . 

 Thanks , doctor.I will. 

 That's good.Now lie still in bed and do not get up for a couple of days longer . 

 Thank you . 

 Goodbye , Mrs Williams ! And thank you for your visit . 

 You are welcome any time , doctor.

Upstairs . But I don't know whether Jimmy will be able to see him or not.He may come up later . Will he take something for his temperature , doctor ? 

 Yes , bring me some of those tablets of aspirin in a small dose from the bathroom. 

 How does your headache feel now , Mrs Williams ? 

 Not bad . I've got an attack again , doctor . 

 Does Mr Williams know about it ? 

 No , he hasn 't been home since lunchtime . 

 Shall you take something for that , too? 

 Yes . Please give me a couple of tablets. 

 All right. Now I must go. You must follow my directions carefully and Jimmy will soon be well again. Don't hesitate to call us if necessary. Bye-bye.
