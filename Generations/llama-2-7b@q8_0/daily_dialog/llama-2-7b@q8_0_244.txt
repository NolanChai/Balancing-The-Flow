" I see . "

" If it were a cold or a sore throat, you could give the boy some medicine , but with this disease you must have patience.Soon he will be himself again."

" Good-bye , doctor . "

The next day Jimmy felt better still and went to school.It was a beautiful warm May day.He walked about his garden and saw it covered in flowers:he picked some of them and brought them into the house.His mother said:

" How lovely ! But don't touch them , dear, or they will die."

But he forgot this advice.He brought a beautiful bouquet to school . His friend gave him an orange with many green leaves.Jimmy was very happy that day and went home quite late.In the evening he sat in front of his mother while she sewed.It was already dark.Suddenly,his father came into the room :

" Jimmy ! It's late . Go to bed at once ! "

" All right , daddy."

Jimmy went upstairs with a light heart,but when he was on his bed and had turned out the light,he felt very bad.He began to cry,and all of a sudden he remembered that he hadn't watered the flowers . So he got out of bed and walked down into the garden . He didn't see anything special but one little flower was still in bloom . He thought it looked lovely.So he took the orange,put it under his coat and went back to his room.

Next morning Jimmy woke up quite early as usual ,but when he got out of bed he felt very ill,and had a headache.He had to stay at home from school . It was raining .
His mother was angry with him :"You should have watered the flowers last evening."But he only shook his head and said nothing.Jimmy went to bed again ,but he couldn't sleep.It got colder and colder,and it began to snow.The next day there wasn't a sign of spring any more . It was a cold winter day .

Jimmy is lying in bed looking at the pictures on the wall.He looks so well !He doesn't know that he is sick yet.

131.Talking about sports

The games we play are different from country to country.We have tennis and table tennis, basketball , soccer, hockey, handball and volleyball in England.In Spain they play football, tennis, soccer , basket ball and golf .But in some countries there are still more games than this.For example, in South America people play chess, backgammon and bridge.

In England, sports like tennis or table tennis are very popular.They have got a good team for the next Olympic Games.You can hear about them on the radio , because they play every weekend .If you don't want to miss this important game , it is better that you buy yourself a television set !

Sports are also interesting in some countries like Italy or Spain,where they love soccer and football games.But here in England we have got another team for football and tennis.We do not have teams like South America , but if our team wins the next Olympic Games it will be very important !I think you will all hear about this on the radio !

There are also other sports which I don't understand at all .Like,for example, ice hockey or chess and backgammon.In some countries people even play with a ball inside of a glass!You can imagine that it is very dangerous !

132.The most interesting games

A few days ago we had a bad accident in the street where you live.But yesterday we went out again to walk.It was a nice day , so everyone could see us.In our group there were three couples .We played two games .First of all we looked for five objects which begin with 'F' and which are yellow or red !When we found them, we ran to the other side of the street.Then we started another game.

The second game was about a man who is very busy, but he has no time for his family.So , we had to find five things which begin with 'A' and which are made in wood !We couldn't find any wood !So , we had to wait until the next day .And what did you think about these games ?

133.My hobby

I have a lot of interests, but there is one sport that I really like very much : badminton.I often play it with my friends and I try to be as good as possible !You know , in this game we need a net between us and our opponents.And you must throw your ball into the other side of the court.But it isn't so easy, because if your friend can hit the ball before you do it , he wins.I like playing this sport with my friends, but I hate playing alone !

Why ? Well , maybe because I have a very bad temper and I often get angry .So, when I play alone sometimes I hit my opponents so hard that they don't want to see me again !

What about you?Do you like badminton or another kind of sport ?If it's not badminton , what is it?Are there some sports in your country which we haven't got here in England ?I should like to know all these things!

134.My favourite sport

Everyone knows that I am very interested in this subject,because my mother and father are professional golf players !They play a lot of matches on television.So you can see them every day .They won some important competitions last year.I know everything about this game,so I can help them when they want me to do so .

Now , what is your favourite sport ?What does it mean 'to be interested' ?Well, for example, if you are interested in golf you always think of it !You can play it and watch other people playing.But there are some sports which we don't have here in England.Like chess or tennis , but I am not so good at these games .I am more interested in football.Do you like this sport as well ?If not , why ?

135.What kind of exercise is better for us?

A few days ago one of the boys was sick because he didn't have enough food .He felt very tired all day long and then his mother took him to the doctor .The doctor examined him carefully.Then they found out that the boy needed more vitamins !So , they gave him some special tablets which will help him in future !

Do you know what 'vitamine' means ?Well , it is a natural substance which our body needs for living .If we don't have enough vitamines,we can get ill.It doesn't matter whether you are a child or an adult;you need these things too !So, you must take care that you eat right and don't forget your tablets !

Do you know any other important things for keeping yourself fit ?The first thing is to sleep enough every day .Don't work too much in the garden , because it might hurt your hands.And if you have problems with breathing or anything like that,see a doctor as soon as possible!I hope you won't need this advice !

136.Ways of exercising

A few days ago my mother was ill and couldn't get up from the bed .So , we had to look for someone who could help us.And our neighbour suggested that I should walk more often because he said that exercise is very important for keeping your body fit !Then I began to take special exercises with a friend of mine.We took them every day and they helped me a lot!

Now , do you know what 'exercising' means ?It means training our muscles .For this we need some good shoes, because our legs are very important for walking.If we walk too often or too far in bad shoes,we can get blisters on our feet.Do you think that these things are interesting ?We had to go to the doctor two times,because my mother needed special medicine and I got a small wound on my foot !

Sometimes there is very good weather outside , so we like to go out for walking .I am sure that when you're old enough,you will understand how important it is to have a good health.If you do not take care of yourself at all ,it could be too late then!So , don't forget about your mother and father !

137.Games in the air

A few days ago one of my friends went away for three weeks because he had to work .He said that if there wasn't enough money,he would come back sooner .But now he is still at his new job and we haven't seen him for a very long time.I don't know what it is like at the place where he works , but I heard that sometimes you can make a lot of money there !

So what do you think about this?Maybe it isn't so good for him to spend all his free time working ?Well,it depends on your job and how much money you earn.But if your friends come back,you have to write letters to them regularly ,because they need this from their family and friends!

And do you know why we should write letters ?Well , because sometimes we can't talk about our problems with our friends when they are away .When I go for a weekend trip to France,I always take some letters with me.So what do you think about this?If I want to tell my parents something which happened on the way,they will have to wait until Monday morning !

138.Healthy food and drinks

A few days ago my mother was sick because she ate too much fruit , but now it is better .She has got an infection because of this , so I've got to buy her medicine from the doctor !But what can you do against this?I hope that we won't need this again soon,but if there are no tablets for her , we will have to see a doctor!

What do you think about these things ?Well,you must take care of yourself and your friends when they eat too much fruit .Maybe you should try some other food instead !Like hamburgers or sandwiches .But remember that everything has got its good side as well as its bad side !So , what do you prefer?Sandwiches or hamburgers ?

Do you know why we shouldn't eat so many potatoes and bread ?Well,it is because they make our teeth yellow !If we don't have any money to buy something else at the supermarket , we should look for some old fruit instead of buying new ones .So if I had known this before ,I would never do it again!But now everything is better again and my mother feels much healthier than before!

139.Keeping fit with sports

A few days ago one of my friends was sick because he didn't take enough exercise !He felt very tired all day long, so he went to the doctor .The doctor examined him carefully and then they found out that his body wasn't strong enough .So , he gave him some special tablets which will help him in future!

Do you know what 'exercising' means?Well , it is training our muscles.For this we need some

" I don 't know, doctor . "

" Has he got a temperature ? "

" No , it's not that , doctor . My husband is away on business.He's in New York . "

" You can't go to him at once ? "

" No , doctor. I couldn 't go if I wanted to."

" Tell me when he comes back, will you ? "

" Yes , of course . Thank you , doctor.I hope Jimmy gets better soon ! "

" I'll call again tomorrow evening . Good-bye , Mrs Williams ! "

" Good-bye , doctor . Thank you very much."
