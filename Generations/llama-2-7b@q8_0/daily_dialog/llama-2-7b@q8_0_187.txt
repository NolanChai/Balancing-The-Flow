Thank you very much . We shall take the first offer as it is , and accept your proposal . But we have to see if our company has enough cash flow to meet the requirements of this deal .

 Okay, then let's set up another meeting in two days for further discussions on shipping procedures . 

 And thank you very much indeed for giving us such a good offer.

We can go into details later and talk about the actual shipments. 

 I think we can handle it with a little bit of cash flow , but I'll have to check with the accounts department first . 

 Thank you very much, Ms Li. 

 Bye for now.

Your quotation is higher than the ones we have got . I really think that your offer will be unacceptable . 

 I don't see how it can make a difference to you whether you buy one hundred brooches or five hundred , considering the quantity and the value of the goods .

Then what about the quantity ? 50 boxes at a time ? 

 No, we want at least two times as much . We can offer you a better price if you buy in bulk . 200 boxes for each style , at 19,000 yuan per box . 

 I'm afraid that won't do . Our market is very big . Our sales this year may exceed one million . We only need small quantities to fill the orders we have gotten in advance . We can place another order after we get back from our trip. 

 That is possible , if you want to wait for two months and pay us a deposit of about ten percent . 

 I think it's best if you accept our offer now . You know the time is short and we need the orders to be placed in advance . 

 Then how about making an agreement ? 

 Okay , let me call my manager . He can come down to your office to talk with you . 

 The manager will be coming down to you . 

 I want to talk to him directly . 

 All right, Mr. Yu will see you in a moment . 

 He is now on his way here . 

 Okay , let me go to your office . 

 Goodbye then .

It's unreasonable to ask for a discount of more than 5% . You know that the cost of production has gone up with the increase in prices of labor and raw materials . 

 I must tell you again our offer is reasonable . If you don't agree , we would have to take our order elsewhere . We'd really be sorry to lose your business . 

 Well , if you can't make it a little less expensive, let me go to other companies to see how much they charge for their products. 

 All right ; I'll take the matter over to my superior and get back to you as soon as possible . 

 Good afternoon !
