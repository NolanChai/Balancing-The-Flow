" You know how to bargain ; 15 boxes , then ? 80,000 yuan ? "

" We're talking about business here . As a matter of fact, I am not very enthusiastic about doing business with you . You will understand . "

" Well , we might as well be frank with one another. If the price is too high for you , let me know . "

" We are also dealing in goods and prices , so your attitude is incomprehensible to us . 10 boxes , at 15,000 yuan each ? "

" I can't agree with that price either. "

" All right . Let me check again . " ( The man glances at the papers on his desk and calls out ) : " Mr. Wang . How many boxes of waistbands do you have ? "

" 15 , I guess ; how much is each box worth ? "

( The clerk looks over the figures and answers, without looking up ) : " About 20,000 yuan . " ( Then he turns to Mr. Zhuang with a smile ) : " I'm sorry , sir, but you know how it is ; the prices of goods are rising all the time . This price is as good as anyone can offer you."

"I'll have to think about it then . Maybe some other time . Bye for now. " ( Mr. Zhuang leaves . )

CHAPTER SEVEN: TACTICS

( 1 ) The tactics of buying and selling are similar, but different.

Tactics in selling, as distinct from strategies , involve the application of several basic principles:

* Make your first offer the lowest possible price.

This will be accepted by the majority of buyers. You can then gradually increase the price to the level where you expect to close the sale. This procedure is particularly effective in face-to-face selling situations, such as door-to-door sales and telephone calls. It's a good idea not to go over your mark; however, if you are in a position of strength and can afford to give away some profit for a quick sale , do so.

* Find out what the customer wants before you begin negotiating prices or terms.

This will allow you to determine the most effective way of proceeding in making an offer. You'll also be in a position to discover whether the customer is interested in buying, and if not why he isn't . ( See " A Study on Purchasing Behavior" ) . This information will enable you to decide how far to go with your negotiation.

* Let the other party set the price or terms; then follow his example.

This tactic is particularly useful in negotiating contracts, and for a number of reasons: First, if you initiate the process , the other party will be put on guard against your motives. Second, you'll have an advantage over him because he must match or beat your price ( or terms ) . Third, you can use this tactic to encourage a bargaining spirit. If the customer sets the price, you can make several counteroffers of increasingly higher prices ( or lower terms ).

* Take into account the other party's situation and emotional state in making an offer.

Selling techniques require that you establish rapport with the other party and determine his needs as well as his ability to buy. If your offer is too far above his buying power, it will probably be turned down. On the other hand, if you make a low bid because of insufficient knowledge of the situation, you may miss an opportunity .

* If negotiations fail for any reason , be sure that there's no misunderstanding; then, say "Thank you" and leave immediately.

This will avoid a possible confrontation or a bad impression on the part of the other party .

( 2 ) Tactics in buying, as distinct from strategies , involve the application of several basic principles:

* Start out with a low bid; then gradually increase it.

The most effective way to buy goods is to make your first offer lower than that of any competitor . This will induce the seller to make his lowest possible offer in order not to lose you as a customer . If he doesn't have the goods, or they are not available at this time, it will be easy for you to turn down the offer and find someone who does.

* Always ask for a price breakdown; then negotiate individually for each item.

When bidding on large quantities of similar items ( such as furniture or appliances ) , always ask for an item-by-item breakdown of prices . This is especially effective in face-to-face selling situations, where you can examine the goods at once and decide whether to accept them.

* Find out what the other party wants before making your bid; then follow his example.

This will allow you to determine how high a price to offer and to get an idea of the total costs involved in buying from him . If he is not interested, you can use this information to decide whether it's worthwhile to try again later or with another company . You may also be able to negotiate on the basis of a partial order ( for example, just one item ) , which will reduce your total costs and give you more bargaining power.

* Make sure that there are no misunderstandings by checking the seller's response.

If the seller agrees, say " Thank you" and leave immediately . This avoids a possible confrontation or a bad impression on his part; it also helps to establish good rapport between you. If he refuses your bid, find out why and try again at another time if necessary.

CHAPTER EIGHT: MANIPULATIONS

( 1 ) How do the tactics of selling and buying differ from those of manipulating?

Manipulation is an unscrupulous tactic of obtaining something by deceiving or tricking others. This technique should be avoided whenever possible because it often leads to bad feelings between people who may have to deal with one another in the future. It also violates the law and is frowned upon by society .

( 2 ) What are some common forms of manipulation?

Manipulations can take many forms, but here are some of the most frequently encountered:

* Taking advantage of people's ignorance or lack of experience in negotiating.

This is a common tactic used by salespeople who try to make the best deal possible for themselves at the expense of their customers . The seller may know that his customer can't make an informed decision about the price of goods because he doesn't understand how prices are determined, so he will offer an unreasonably high bid or request a higher commission than usual.

* Making use of people's greed to get them into a situation in which they cannot back out .

For example, you may be asked for your opinion by someone who knows that it is worth more than what he is offering you, and then offered a reward if you agree with him . This type of manipulation can occur when buying or selling anything from real estate to investments; it often leads to loss for both parties involved.

* Convincing people to do something by appealing to their pride .

For example, you may be asked for your opinion on a certain subject because the person asking is interested in hearing what other people think about it , and then later told that if you agree with him he will give you an extra bonus or commission . This type of manipulation occurs frequently during negotiations; it can also occur when purchasing anything from real estate to investments.

* Misrepresenting the facts in order to make yourself look better than your competitors ( this is sometimes called " playing dirty" ).

For example, you may be asked for your opinion on a certain subject because someone else has been asking him what he thinks about it , and then later told that if you agree with him he will give you an extra bonus or commission . This type of manipulation occurs frequently during negotiations; it can also occur when purchasing anything from real estate to investments.

* Manipulating the timing of events to your advantage .

For example, someone may ask for your opinion on a certain subject because they are interested in hearing what other people think about it , and then later tell you that if you agree with them they will give you an extra bonus or commission ; this type of manipulation can occur during negotiations when buying or selling anything from real estate to investments.

( 3 ) What should we do to avoid being manipulated?

In general, the best way to avoid being manipulated is not to engage in any type of negotiation or purchase with people who have been known to use this

( He is a good man! )

" Our quotation is 10,000 yuan per brooch for shipment in June . The price includes taxes and transport fees . But you have to pay 5% down payment within two weeks. If we can't agree on the down payment , we are sorry but we will have to cancel this deal . "

" We cannot accept your conditions . "

" You know we are very busy these days preparing for the big exhibition at the end of June . It's not easy to get a shipment in that short time . If you agree to our terms , the rest is fine with us . "

" Well, I have no choice then . You seem to be doing good business . " ( He is a wise man!)

" That's right. And we can do much better if your company is willing to cooperate with us . "

" I will let you know the bank account number as soon as possible. We need to make this shipment within a month or so , depending on the sales . The rest of the money should be paid in cash upon delivery . "

" I'm afraid it will not do . You know our prices are the lowest . We also provide an assurance that all brooches in one box are identical . We can deliver the goods to your designated port within ten days from the day of receipt of the deposit . "

" It sounds very reasonable . "

" How about this? We will accept a 10 % reduction on the total amount and a discount of at least 5% for early payment , as well as an assurance that all brooches in one box are identical. "

" I can't agree with you there . What you offer is a little lower than our quotation . I want to keep it at the original price . "

" We can only say no to that . Let me tell you that this offer is final and we have other orders waiting for us . You're welcome to negotiate again tomorrow , if so desired. "

" Let's conclude our business now. "
