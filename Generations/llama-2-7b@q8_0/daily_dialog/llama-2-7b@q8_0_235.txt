What do you think ? Shall we try it for once? 

 I'm not sure . You have been asking me many times but i don't know what i should say . 

 Oh , come on . Let's have some fun . If i can't learn to ski by now, when will i be able to ?

We wouldn't get hurt unless we were buried in snow . We have to be careful when skiing though . 

 I know , but still ... I'm afraid of skiing . 

 Are you kidding me ? You are going to ski down this hill ! 

 That's not the point . I've never skied before and I don't think that I have enough courage for it either . 

 But you don't know how to ski , do you ? 

 It doesn't matter . 

 Hey look there . It looks like we are going to be late. We should go now if you want us to watch the show . 

 Yes, I guess so . Maybe it will be better if I try another time . 

 But I don't think that there is a way to learn skiing without trying . 

 So , shall we go and buy some equipment first ? 

 Well, ok . Then let me put on my skis. 

 All right . Mine are already on . 

 Are you sure that you should try this now? Don't you think it might be better to wait until tomorrow ? You can practice if we take the train and come here again ,right? 

 I guess so ... But I have to try skiing at least once in my life . 

 I understand . 

 Good luck then . Maybe next time we will go skiing together.

I guess it's artificially made in this huge building over there . 

 It looks like we should go back now . The temperature has dropped to about -30 degrees Celsius . 

 It is time for you to have a shower and warm up . Then , you can take an apple juice to keep yourself from getting sick . 

 Let's hurry and get inside before the ice outside turns into glass !

Well . It's true that many people criticize the machine as it could result in water shortage for humans and animals . But I am not sure about that because most of the countries using such machines have plenty of drinkable water . 

 What do you think ? Should we use this type of technology to make snow ? 

 As far as I know , people are still discussing it . There is no definite answer yet . Anyway, it's a very controversial issue and I hope the government will find a way for people not to get involved in any conflicts on such environmental matters . 

 I agree with you . People should try their best to protect this earth that we live on . 

 We should also learn how to deal with pollution . 

 Yes, that's right . However , many people tend to overlook the impact of global warming which is caused by us and will have disastrous effects for our environment if it continues . 

 I guess you are referring to climate change . Do you think we should do something to stop it ? 

 Yes, definitely . We can use renewable resources or recycle waste material to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere . And people have to be more careful when using products made from plastic because they can damage the environment if not disposed of properly . 

 You are right . Some countries still do not realize the importance of environmental protection even though there is already so much evidence for it . 

 So, what can we do ? Should we educate them ? 

 That's a good idea . But I don't think we should force others to act in certain ways just because we are convinced that they will be able to change their minds about the environment soon enough . Instead , if everyone works together as a team then maybe things will get better over time . 

 I totally agree with you . Now let me give you my personal opinion on this matter . What do you think ? 

 Well , in my opinion, it is best for people to have an open mind when they try something new . I believe that if someone tries hard enough , they will eventually be able to learn how to deal with pollution . 

 What about me? Do you think I am capable of doing this ? 

 You are a great skier and I am sure that one day you'll become an expert on this subject too !
