" Well , you could die then . But no one wants to die here ! So we have to be very careful when skiing . I can't wait to get on the slopes . "

" How about me . I don't know how to ski . Can I join you ? "

" Sure , of course . It's not hard and we are going there together . We will practice together too ! "

" There must have been some heavy snowfall last night or this morning . Look at that pile of snow . It's pretty high and very steep . "

" They say it was snowed in for two days . Do you know when the snow will melt ? "

" I am not sure . But maybe they can still ski here for a while longer . There are many other places we want to visit , so let's continue our journey . "

" I don't believe so . The amount of waste produced by these machines is very tiny compared to the amount of snow produced each year . "

" Oh , yes . I was told that every year, about 100 million tons of artificial snow are made in China . "
