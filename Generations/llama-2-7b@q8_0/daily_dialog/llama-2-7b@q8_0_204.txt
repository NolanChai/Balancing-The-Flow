" My first boss was very busy , but he never took his eye off the ball when it came to the team. I felt that if he had been a little more hands-on and interested in the day-to-day issues, we would have been more successful . "

" How do you manage your time ? "

" I think my most useful attribute is being able to prioritize projects effectively. I know what needs to be done first , then work on it . "

" Do you have any goals for this job ? "

" Yes, I am looking forward to learning new skills and working in a fast-paced environment ."

" I would take the time to sit down with my team leader, review the project proposal ,and then come up with a game-plan on how best we can achieve the objectives. I would break up the project into smaller phases, assign responsibilities , and develop a schedule that works for each of us . "

" Tell me about an experience where you were able to work as a team ? "

" I was working as a Team Leader on a very important project to launch a new website in time for our holiday sales. In the early stages , some members of my team did not get along well.It became clear that we needed to find ways to build trust and respect . I held a meeting with everyone, had them explain how they thought the site should be designed .We then divided into smaller groups to work on a specific phase of the project. At each stage we reviewed progress , gave feedback and praise when it was due . This allowed us to focus on completing the project and not personal issues . "

" Tell me about a time you disagreed with your boss ? "

" I have never had any conflict with my supervisors or managers, they are all very supportive of me and my career.I respect them highly and always do my best to communicate directly if we ever find ourselves having different opinions . It is important in business that people learn how to be direct without hurting feelings, I have been able to accomplish this effectively over the years. "

" Describe your management style ? "

" I am a very hands-on manager and believe that good leaders are the ones who set clear goals , empower their team members,and lead by example . As a manager it is my responsibility to let employees know where they stand on the company ladder, as well as how important their role is in reaching our business objectives.I like to be available to my team at any time and encourage open dialogue in order to build strong relationships among us. "

" Describe your work style ? "

" My personal philosophy on work life balance has always been the same, I think you need to be organized, have a routine ,and use your free time wisely . My biggest challenge is making sure that when I am not working I can still keep in touch with what is going on at work and my team members.I also find it very important to make time for myself, because if I don't I will burn out fast. "

" What type of person do you get along best with ? "

" I enjoy working with people who are direct , motivated,have a good sense of humor and are honest . I have always found that these types of people are very easy to communicate with because they take time to listen and then give clear feedback. "

" What kind of manager do you like ? "

" The type of managers I work well for are those who are fair , willing to listen,and supportive . "

" How do you deal with a difficult employee or subordinate? "

" First and foremost I try my hardest to have regular check-in meetings to see how things are going.I believe that if issues arise, it is better to discuss them sooner rather than later because most problems get worse over time . If this doesn't work , then I would sit down with the employee one on one and talk about where there may be some miscommunication or misunderstanding of job expectations . Sometimes what we say isn't always how others understand it. "

" Tell me about a time you were angry at your boss ? "

" I have never had a situation where I was mad at my supervisor, but if it did happen I would go to him or her and let them know what the issue is and ask for their input . If we can not resolve it then I would go above his head and get some help from HR. "

" Do you enjoy working as a team ? "

" Yes, I do believe that people work better together than on their own. It's important to have a group of individuals with different personalities , experiences and skill sets so that when there are issues we can rely on each other for support . "

" Tell me about your most difficult project? "

" As I mentioned earlier, it was my first job after college and everything seemed like an uphill battle at the time.I think one of the biggest challenges for me was getting used to working in a corporate environment with all sorts of different personalities . Another issue that I had trouble adjusting to was not having a set schedule because we were always dealing with last minute meetings or emergencies from our clients . It took some time , but eventually these things became normal parts of my new role. "

" What would you do if you disagreed with your boss ? "

" I have never had a situation where I was mad at my supervisor, but if it did happen I would go to him or her and let them know what the issue is and ask for their input . If we can not resolve it then I would go above his head and get some help from HR. "

" Give me an example of a difficult employee you had to deal with ? "

" As a manager, my job is not to be friends with everyone on the team but rather someone who is fair , motivating ,and respectful . I have always found that when this type of relationship exists then it is easy for people to communicate freely about any issues they may be having. I think one thing we need to keep in mind though is that we don't want employees feeling like their job security depends on how close they are with us. "

" Tell me about a time you were angry at your boss ? "

" As I mentioned earlier, it was my first job after college and everything seemed like an uphill battle at the time.I think one of the biggest challenges for me was getting used to working in a corporate environment with all sorts of different personalities . Another issue that I had trouble adjusting to was not having a set schedule because we were always dealing with last minute meetings or emergencies from our clients . It took some time , but eventually these things became normal parts of my new role. "

" How do you handle your work-life balance? "

" I have learned over the years that it is impossible to completely separate my personal and professional life because they are both intertwined together in many ways . For example, if I am not able to find time for myself then eventually I will burn out fast . Similarly , when things go wrong at work it can affect me personally as well. So what we need to do instead is set boundaries between them so that they don't mix too much and try our best to make sure that both aspects of our lives are taken care off equally . "

" When I was at XYZ Company , we were experiencing a crisis in our financial operations.A team of us worked 18 hour days for two weeks straight to meet the deadline, and we all had to do this on the weekend as well because one department's work wasn't complete.I think I was able to handle it because I have never been afraid to ask questions when I need more information or clarification . "

" What skills would you bring to our team ? "

" My skills are directly applicable in the way that you do business at Company ABC and I feel that my experience working with ABC would be a huge asset to your team . "

" Describe a time when your work was criticized by someone else . "

" I was working with a team of seven people , and we had been tasked with delivering an important project.One of my colleagues didn't feel that I'd been giving the right feedback on his progress so he went to our boss and complained about me.After a meeting between all the parties involved, my manager suggested that I go back and sit down with my co-worker to discuss the issue.I did , and we were able to resolve things . "

" What is your greatest weakness ? "

" I feel that one of my weaknesses in the past was not being a very good team player.But I've realized that if you are not willing to work together, there will be no progress or results.So now , it ' s something that I take great pride in and it shows because I have become known as a very supportive team player . "

" How do you feel about working nights/weekends? "

" I am open to it . When the time comes that I need to work overtime or on weekends, my family knows to expect it.I always make sure that they understand and that we have talked about how this will affect things in our lives , because I feel that's very important . "

" What do you expect your salary to be ? "

" When interviewing for a position like this one, my focus isn ' t so much on the amount of money I'll receive but rather the value that I bring to the organization.I believe that if we both decide that working with each other is beneficial , then any financial arrangements will be negotiated and determined based upon our mutual benefit . "

" Are you willing to travel ? "

" My answer is yes ! If that's something that your company does , then I feel like it would be very important for me to go along with what your organization requires in order for me to succeed at my job . "

" What are the two most significant events of recent history? How did they impact you? Why?"

" There have been a number of recent historic events that have occurred, and I'll tell you about two that I find the most interesting.First is Hurricane Katrina . This is one of the things that made me realize how much I love my home in Texas , because when people started to lose their lives and their homes, many left town without knowing what was going on around them or where they were headed next . The second event is 9/11 . This changed America forever and we all have learned some important lessons since that day happened . "

" What does being successful mean to you? How will you measure your success?"

" Being successful means achieving goals that I've set for myself.In my opinion, the most important thing is setting these goals so I know what direction to go in order achieve them and how much time it may take me . "

" Why did you leave your last job? What happened there?"

" I was let go from my last position because they wanted someone with more experience.I was willing to stay longer if that would have been helpful , but unfortunately , this wasn't the case . "

" If we called your references, what do you think they would say about you? "

" I believe that any person who is contacted for reference will say good things because I have always tried to be a professional employee at every job I held in the past . "

" Describe one of your goals and how you plan to achieve it. "

" One of my personal goals was recently to lose twenty pounds, which meant that I had to eat healthier and exercise more often than before.I started going jogging three times a week , making sure that all the food I ate contained less fat or sugar, while also watching how much I drank during meals . Within a few weeks , my clothes were fitting better and people at work could tell that something was different about me , so now it ' s become easier for me to stay on track with what I've learned about eating right . "

" How do you react when you make an error? What have you done in the past when faced with this situation?"

" Whenever I make a mistake, my first reaction is always to admit it and then take corrective action immediately.I don't like being late for work , so if there are times where I am running behind schedule on certain days of the week or month , I try to find out why and fix whatever caused this problem before it happens again ."

" Do you consider yourself a leader?"

" Yes! I have been called upon by my family members or friends to take charge when they needed help.I feel like being able to step up into leadership roles is something that will benefit XYZ Company because your team will trust me more than someone who isn't as confident . "

" What are some of the things you can contribute to our organization ?"

" I have worked hard all my life and am prepared to work just as hard for this job if hired.I also believe that it is important to learn from other people , so I would be willing to take on any responsibilities or tasks that were assigned . "

" Why did you choose your major?"

" What do you do in your spare time? How does this contribute to your life? "

" I enjoy reading books on finance, business , history etc.. The best thing is being able to find out something new every day so when it comes down to meeting deadlines or making decisions about work projects , these things are easier for me because they've already been thought through beforehand . "

" How do you handle stressful situations? Give an example."

" When I was working as an accountant at ABC Company, there were times when my boss would ask me to take on additional responsibilities that made my workload heavier than usual.I never felt overwhelmed by these requests because I knew they were necessary for our clients , and so if anything stressful happened in the office while he was away from his desk then I would just keep working until everything got done . "

" How do you think a company like ABC Company benefits from hiring someone who knows more than one language?"

" As an accountant at ABC Company , I am very aware of how important it is to know multiple languages.The clients that come into our office want their paperwork in English, so when they ask for help with something like this - especially if you aren't fluent yet! - we can provide them with what they need ."

" What are the qualities of a good leader?"

" A good leader is someone who motivates others to do their best work.They also have an eye on the big picture and know how to delegate tasks effectively , while also being able to give constructive feedback when needed.A great way for me to describe this would be by saying that my boss was like a coach who helped us all reach our goals ."

" What do you think of your previous co-workers?"

" Leadership means different things in different situations.For example ,

" Give an example of when you made a mistake ? "

" Last month in one of our major accounts , we had a computer program failure,which delayed shipping for three weeks.I think the company was very gracious and understanding about it all because I acted immediately and responsibly .

" I try to get to know this person better first,and then I listen intently when he or she talks.I look for common interests and traits so that I can learn more about the other person's work style and culture .
