I respect a person when he or she can make a quick decision,and the best thing is that they are able to stick with it.It shows maturity and confidence. 

 How would you describe yourself? 

 I am confident , honest, direct and have an open mind .

In my experience , it ' s not so much what he does , but how he does it . My manager can be rude to people . He also talks down to employees when we make mistakes or have problems.I think that is unprofessional and unfair to us because we are already stressed as a result of the work overload we deal with every day,and sometimes I ' m not sure if he is intentionally trying to get us off guard .

I prefer to organize projects based on the amount of work needed, but also on who has what skills.I believe in delegating tasks to people who have certain skill sets , so that everyone can contribute effectively to a project's success . 

 Do you feel comfortable with the pace and style of your current job? 

 Yes . I enjoy working for my supervisor because he lets me work independently, but also encourages my team and I to ask questions or come up with ideas as we see fit.He is a great leader , and I would not trade jobs with anyone else.

 What types of people do you tend to avoid ? 

 People who are disorganized and distracted . It ' s very difficult for me to be around chaos, because that 's the opposite of how I operate every day .

At a previous job , we were rushed at the end of the day on a big project that had been in progress for months.We had to finish our part, get it approved by the boss and have it sent to other teams for their contribution by midnight that same night.It was quite stressful because there were some mistakes that came up just as we were finishing . 

 What do you feel is your strongest or most important trait ? 

 My ability to prioritize tasks is a strength in my position . I know how to manage competing demands and give each task the time it deserves. 

 How would you describe your leadership style ? 

 I try to lead by example , rather than just giving orders . 

 What are some of your career objectives? 

 My long-term career goal is to run my own business . I'm very entrepreneurial and love the idea of being my own boss . That 's why I am pursuing an MBA now, because I think that will give me the skills needed to be a successful manager.

 Do you feel that your supervisor has given you opportunities to learn new skills ? 

 My previous manager was a great mentor.He gave me responsibilities that allowed me to grow professionally and personally.He was willing to teach me about all aspects of my job, not just the technical part .

The best way to describe how I handle my time is through an exercise I took once . It asked about how much time I spend on various activities like work,play,personal and homework.What was interesting is that I spent the same amount of time every week doing these things .What was different from some people ' s results , however , is that I used my free time to catch up with other activities or do something fun because I was very careful about making sure I took time off. 

 How would you describe your work style ? 

 I am an organizer by nature and a detail-oriented person . What I also like doing is learning from mistakes others make and then helping them avoid repeating the same mistake themselves or to other people . I believe in being a good leader , which means I'm a good follower too . The bottom line for me is that I am always working towards the best possible solution . 

 How do you like to be managed ? 

 I need someone who is going to give me specific instructions, set deadlines and hold me accountable . It's not enough just to say, "Be at this place or event by such-and-such time".If that's the only direction given , then there will be a lot of confusion as to what my responsibilities are and how I should handle it. 

 How do you get people to work with you ? 

 I believe in making sure everyone knows exactly who ' s responsible for each activity or event . The problem is that sometimes people change their minds about things without discussing it first, so if I don't know what they are doing , then I can't help them be successful.Once the lines of communication are open and understood by all parties,then the rest will fall into place .

One of my best ideas came from my boss.It was in a very competitive business environment and we were getting slammed by our largest rival with some pretty aggressive ads.I presented an idea to him that would effectively counter their strategy . I was nervous about it, because I wasn't sure if he ' d like it . But , I told him that I had confidence in my plan and that it would work . He liked the idea , so we went with it , but it didn't end up being our most successful ad campaign . 

 Describe a time when you took action without first checking with your supervisor . 

 Once I was running a team meeting for about thirty people who were on break from a long day of training.I had to move quickly, because we were losing a lot of valuable time and money if things didn't get moving again soon . When I started the meeting , it wasn't well received by some folks at first because they didn't think there was any reason for me to interrupt their break . But, I asked them how much it would have cost them to cancel a training session for the entire group ? Needless to say we got everyone back into action quickly and everyone was very pleased with my initiative. 

 Describe a time when you disagreed with an idea proposed by someone else in your department . 

 I remember disagreeing with another staff member about how much of our budget should be allocated for training purposes.I think the reason we didn't agree was because he wanted to keep his own job and mine.He made it clear that any decision I made would hurt him financially.So, I explained the logic behind my plan , but I knew he wasn't going to like it . However, after a few weeks of negotiating with me , we agreed on a compromise position where we split our budget in half and each got what we wanted. 

 How would you rate your skills in planning ?

 What type of leadership style do you most admire ? 

 My favorite leadership style is servant leadership , which was made popular by Robert K.Greenleaf in the mid '70s . Servant leaders focus on being effective stewards of the organization's resources and helping subordinates to become better at their jobs through encouragement, mentorship, and modeling behavior that's consistent with the organizational values . 

 How do you cope with pressure ? 

 I've always been able to handle pressure well , because I know how to relax before it happens.I usually exercise a lot or get away from work for awhile when my stress level increases . Sometimes I just need to talk out the problem with someone else who is objective . 

 Describe a situation where you had to make an unpopular decision about which group of people would be given a promotion, assignment , or award. 

 About five years ago , we had a very competitive program for our best sales reps , because they had all been working with us for quite some time and were all performing at a high level . We wanted to recognize their achievements, so we planned an incentive trip for the top three sellers.It was supposed to be a surprise when each of them got on a plane to go to Florida . However , one of my best reps asked me how much money I was going to give him and which resort I had picked out . He then told me that he didn't think it would be fair for the top three people to get the same amount , because they weren't all producing at the same level.I explained to him why we were using this method, but he insisted on making a counterproposal of his own . I then decided to tell him that he should go with the others and meet them in Florida instead of coming back early . He was very upset , because it cost him over $30,000 for one week.He told me that he thought my idea was unfair, but he understood why we were going through with it . 

 Describe a time when you had to persuade someone else to agree to your point of view ? 

 About two years ago , I had to try to get my boss to agree to my suggestion about how to improve our company's advertising campaign . The problem was that he was very set in his ways and didn't want to listen to any new ideas.So, when we got together for lunch , I started by explaining how things were different now than they were five years ago . Then , I explained why some of my ideas were better than what we had been doing . He kept interrupting me with negative comments or questions , but I kept going until he agreed to listen to the whole presentation . Once I finished , he asked if we could talk about it later instead of making any decisions right then and there . 

 Describe a time when you helped someone improve in his or her job. 

 When one of my former bosses left our company, I took on more responsibility for supervising some of the lower level managers who were still there . Even though they had been around longer than me , I felt that I could give them a lot of constructive feedback because we've worked together for many years.So , I began to give them suggestions about how their performance was hurting our team or how it was keeping them from moving up . They were surprised at first, but they soon saw the benefit and improved significantly over time . 

 How would you describe your negotiating style ? 

 I am a firm believer in win-win negotiation , so that's my primary tactic.I like to discuss everything beforehand with everyone involved , because I want to be fair to all parties and make sure there's no misunderstanding about expectations . If you treat people fairly and help them feel that they have a voice , then most of the time they are willing to negotiate for mutual gain instead of trying to take advantage of your weaknesses . 

 Describe a situation when you had to deal with an irritating coworker. 

 I'm not going to lie and say that it was easy , because there were times when this person drove me crazy ! But, once I realized he didn't have the best intentions for anyone around him , then I began to take a more passive approach with him . I still had to deal with some of his negative behavior, but now I could do so without getting too upset or frustrated myself . 

 How do you usually organize and plan your work ? 

 I'm pretty good at managing my own time , because I like being organized and following a system that makes sense to me.I don't really like it when other people try to change things up or come up with their own plans for how we should proceed . If you have something different in mind than what was agreed upon , then discuss it with the team first before doing anything else . 

 What does leadership mean to you ? 

 Leadership is very important , because I think everyone has a responsibility to lead others toward success if they are capable of doing so .

It's not just about being the boss anymore , it's now more about working together and helping each other get things done . 

 How do you feel about receiving constructive criticism ? 

 I like constructive criticism because it makes me a better person . If someone tells me something that could be improved upon or changed for the better , then I usually listen to what they have to say instead of getting defensive . It's easy not to hear them at first, but once I do , I can see how their suggestion might actually help us as an organization move forward together . 

 What is your style of giving and receiving feedback ? 

 My style of giving or receiving feedback depends on the person involved.If it's someone who I trust and respect enough to share my thoughts with openly , then I usually give them honest, direct feedback that comes from a place of concern for their well-being . But, if they are not receptive to this type of communication or don't have good intentions toward me as an individual , then I am more careful about how and when I speak up . 

 What is your ideal leadership style ? 

 My ideal leadership style would be servant leadership because it focuses on serving others before yourself . This means that instead of just focusing on your own needs or wants, you have to take time out of each day (and throughout the week) where everyone else's needs are put first. 

 How do you handle pressure ? 

 When I feel like things are starting to get overwhelming , then I try my best not only manage my own stress level but also help others around me stay calm . It's important for leaders at all levels within an organization to remember that they aren't alone in their struggles; everyone else has some sort of issue going on as well. 

 How do you feel about being a role model ?
