And what about me? I'd like to spend a week in Mexico and then come back and relax on the beach of Aruba for another week.

 What would be your ideal holiday? I've always wanted to go on a Safari in Africa.

 If you could go anywhere, where would it be? Well, it has been my dream to visit London since I was a child.

What do you think about summer vacations? 

 They are too short , don't you think ? 

 How many weeks did you spent in summer last year ? I only had two weeks off but I saved up so that I could go on a trip to Paris.

 What activities did you enjoy there ? The highlight of my trip was seeing the Eiffel tower. It is just amazing and it reminds me why traveling is such fun! 

Do you prefer working with people or being by yourself? 

 I would definitely say that I'm more of a people person , but I need alone time to recharge my batteries sometimes too.
