There are fewer people outdoors and so it is not crowded . 

 Yes , you can sit by the fire place . 

 It's warm . 

 And there isn't any traffic on the road . 

 Yes, I like winter. 

 Well , it has its good points too . 

 Yes , but it is cold and we don't have many flowers in our garden at that time of year . 

 Yes, you are right . 

 Oh , look ! There are two girls who are carrying umbrellas and they are not holding hands either. 

 Yes , I think so too . 

 Well, do you like winter?

It's beautiful out here . Do you want to build a snowman? 

 Sure . I'd love to do that . 

 Is it a boy or girl snowman ? 

 Oh , let's make a girl one . 

 You are so creative ! 

 That's my little sister . She is always with me . 

 It's cold now . Let's build a snow house for her to live in. 

 That would be nice . How about a fireplace ? 

 I have an idea . What about making it green? 

 Sure , that will look really great ! 

 Let's give her some cute clothes ! 

 You are brilliant . I love you! 

 It's getting late. Let's go back home now. 

 Goodbye ! See you next time !

No need to worry , I can handle it . 

 Let me take your hand in mine and I will show you how to walk . 

 That sounds like a good idea . 

 Great ! We'll be back soon . 

 Oh! Look at those pretty birds ! 

 Let's take pictures of them ! 

 That's a great idea . I have my camera with me , and here are some batteries for you to use it. 

 No problem , thank you . 

 How beautiful the sunset is today ! What do you think ? 

 Oh! Look at that nice orange light . 

 It's time to go home now . 

 See you tomorrow . Bye bye !

Oh . Look how beautiful this snow looks ! 

 Yes . It's so quiet here in winter . 

 We havenâ€™t any trees left now , and we have to see them only at Christmas time . 

 Yes . I'm waiting for Christmas too . 

 By the way , what would you like me to buy you ? 

 Let me think a minute . A new skate maybe . 

 Maybe it will be possible to find one in your city too . 

 Sure , there are many shops and they have everything here ! 

 Good night ! See you tomorrow.
