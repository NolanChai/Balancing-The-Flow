What kind of system ? 

 It's called a Heat Exchanger System and it recycles the heat produced by our process equipment back into our steam system. 

 That sounds like a brilliant idea - how does that work? 

 It works because we use the heat generated during our manufacturing processes to produce hot water instead of just throwing it away . So rather than letting all that heat go to waste, we recover and reuse it in order to reduce our energy consumption.

 Great! 

 But why do you say that you've managed to cut your energy consumption by about 15 per cent? 

 It's because the Heat Exchanger System costs more than what we expected . 

 Do you think it was worth investing in such a system ?

 Yes, definitely. It makes our process much more efficient and more sustainable.

Have you also reduced your water consumption ?  

 We have . It was quite easy to do because the ink doesn't leave much residue so we haven't had to increase the amount of water that we use for cleaning .
