" I see . Is that legal ? "

" Oh yes . It's absolutely legal . We do everything by the book - no grey areas at all. "

" You seem pretty confident in your answers . Why is that ? "

" Because we have a team of highly qualified people working for us . Our staff are very experienced and they understand every aspect of our business . "

" But I still don't know what you mean by 'heat recovery system'. "

" Well , let me show you . This is the printing press which generates the exhaust gases that provide heat to dry our printed products. "

" So, if you stopped your factory and used this as a power station, could it generate electricity ? "

" No , not really . It would only work for a short time in the day when there's sunlight . "

" Yes, but I was thinking more along the lines of a gas engine . You know, like in a car. If you had this system here , could it run your factory ? "

" I don't think so. We tried to do that once and it didn't work out at all. The exhaust fumes from our printing presses are too toxic for that kind of application . "
