Bye !"

**Question:** What is the next dialogue?

Well, that's a shame.

Yeah, I guess so.

But what are my options if I'm late?

I'll call and tell them when to expect you.

If they have to hold onto my room, they should charge me for it.

Alright then , I'll be on the road shortly after 10.

Great . Thanks !

Bye!
