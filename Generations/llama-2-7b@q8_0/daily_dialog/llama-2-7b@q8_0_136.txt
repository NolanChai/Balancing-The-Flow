Why was it going to be taken? 

 We had planned to take this break , because there would have been some changes in the class timetable . 

 What is being talked about here ? 

 There are to be many changes in our school timetable , and so we were thinking of taking a short break from today's class .

What do you think the teacher was talking about? 

 He was talking about the changes that would have been there in the class timings . So he had taken this short break of class as well.

Is it right , Mam ?

 And what about your father ? Do you love him and respect him a lot like the other children do ? 

 Yes , Mam ! I always take care of my parents when they are sick because we have to learn from their good example. 

 They always took care of us , so it is our duty now to look after them in return .

### 1-2:

 Yes , Mam! You are right . But I want to ask a question now . 

 What is your name ? 

 My name is Abdullah , but everyone calls me Khaldoon . 

 It ’ s an Arabic word means ” very clever ” . 

 Good ! Tell me something else about yourself . 

 I am from Riyadh and I live in Al-Aflaj with my family . 

 Where are you from , Mam? 

 My name is Rania . I am from Alexandria and now I live in Jeddah . 

 Tell me something about your family. 

 Well , there are four of us . We have one daughter who is seven years old and we have three boys. They are between ten and nine. Our daughter is very beautiful but she does not like her name so much because it means ” queen ” in Arabic . 

 I think your family is happy. 

 Yes , Mam ! We are happy. 

 Do you play sports ? 

 I love football and swimming . 

 Oh, I think you must be good at those sports. 

 Yes , I am very good at them both but my favourite sport is football because I want to be a professional footballer one day . 

 That ’ s very interesting . What about your mother ? Do you like her a lot too? 

 Of course ! She is my best friend and my idol . We are always together when we are at home. I love her so much that I can’t describe it in words. 

 I want to be just like her one day because she is beautiful , intelligent , strong, helpful and kind-hearted . I hope one day I will get all these characteristics. 

 What a good answer , baby ! It ’ s nice to see that you care about your family so much . 

 Oh , yes! 

 Your mother must be proud of you when she sees how much you love her and respect her. 

 Yes, Mam! She is very proud of me because I always do what I am supposed to do . 

 That ’ s right ! What about your father ? Do you like him too? 

 Of course , yes , Mam ! He is my hero in life because he gave up everything for his family. 

 Yes, it seems that both of them are good parents . 

 Yes , they are wonderful people and I love them so much! 

 Oh, it ’ s very touching to see how much you care about your family members , baby ! 

 Thank you , Mam! I am happy now! 

 See you tomorrow . 

 Bye ! Goodbye .

### 2-2:

 Hello , Mohammed and Rania. Where is the classroom ? 

 We are in the library because it was very noisy there , Mam . 

 Why did you come here? 

 Because I wanted to take a book but there were too many students sitting there and I couldn ’ t see anything. 

 What did you choose from the shelves ? 

 I chose a book entitled ” The History of Riyadh ” . 

 Oh , that ’ s interesting ! 

 Yes, it is because I love to read books about my country and its history. 

 Have you finished reading it yet? 

 No , Mam! I have only just started but I am enjoying it so much that I can’t stop . It ’ s very informative , entertaining and educational too ! 

 That sounds good , baby. Now tell me something about your family members . 

 My mother is a nurse at Al-Mouwasat hospital in Riyadh and my father works as an engineer for the Ministry of Education . I have three younger sisters who are all studying different subjects at King Saud University . 

 Your parents must be very proud of you because you always behave well . 

 Yes , they do. They always take care of me when I am sick and they are very supportive too . I want to get my bachelor ’ s degree in nursing from King Abdulaziz University so that one day I can follow in their footsteps . 

 That sounds like an excellent plan , baby ! Now tell me something about your family members . 

 My mother works at Al-Mouwasat Hospital as a nurse and my father is an accountant for the Ministry of Health. He travels to different places within our country every year . We have two children who are both in secondary school now . 

 That ’ s very good , baby ! It ’ s great to see how much you care about your family members . Now tell me something else about them . 

 Well , my mother is a very kind-hearted and caring woman. She always tries her best to help others who are in need of medical treatment or other kinds of assistance. I think she should become a doctor one day because then she could save more lives than she does now . 

 Yes , baby ! You ’ re right! Now tell me something else about your family members again . 

 My father is an intelligent and hardworking man who loves to travel around the world whenever he gets a chance. He has visited many countries so far but his favourite place remains Riyadh . 

 That ’ s nice to know , baby ! Your parents must be very proud of you because you always behave well too . 

 Yes , Mam! They are proud of me and they love me very much because I am a good student who never misses school or studies hard for my exams. 

 That ’ s very touching to hear about your relationship with your parents . I hope that one day you will get married too and have children so that you can pass on the same values to them. 

 Yes , Mam! That is what I want most in life . 

 Good ! Now tell me something else about yourself again . 

 Well , my name is Mohammed Abdullah and everyone calls me ” Khaldoon ” which means “very clever” in Arabic . 

 Oh , that ’ s a nice name , baby! It shows how intelligent you are . 

 Yes , Mam ! I hope to become very successful one day so that my parents can be proud of me and my family members too . 

 Now tell me something else about yourself again. 

 My favourite colour is red because it makes people feel happy and energetic . 

 That ’ s great , baby ! I hope you will become a doctor in the future so that you can help sick people who need medical attention urgently . 

 Thank you, Mam! I would like to see my father proud of me as well when he sees how successful I am in life.
