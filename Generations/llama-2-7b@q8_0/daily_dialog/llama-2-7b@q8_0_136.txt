" Hey ! Hey ! Siddharth is here ! "

" He will be happy , Mam . "

" No . I am not going to school today. "

" Oh ? Why ? "

" Because I have to give the report . "

" Give the report . "

" What should I do , Mam? "

" OK ! You write it on paper and bring here . "

" Where is that ? "

" On your table. Write there . "

" Ok , Mom. It will be ready soon. "

" Do you want me to make some food for lunch? "

" Yes ! Surely , Mam . I will have it . Thank You . "

" Come here , Siddharth . "

" Now let’s see . "

" What is that ? "

" It ’ s report , Mom . "

" Oh . That looks nice. "

" But I need to make a few changes . "

" Is everything alright , Siddharth? "

" Yes , Mam . Everything is fine . You can send it as it is . "

" OK . Wait here for lunch . "

" OK , Mom . It will be ready soon. Thank you very much, Mom. "

" Come on ! Let’s go . "

" Oh ! Here comes Siddharth . "

" Hi , baby . How did you sleep? "

" I slept well , Mam . Thanks for the breakfast . "

" You are welcome, darling. "

" Come on . Let’s get ready to go school . "

" Surely , Mam. "

" Didn ’ t you eat lunch? "

" No , Mom. I will have it now . Thank you very much . "

" Oh ! You look so cute when you say thank you , baby . "

" Thank you, my sweetheart. "

" Come on ! Let’s go , Mam . "

" Hey ! Hi there, Siddharth ! How are you? "

" I am good, Madam . And how about you ? "

" Oh ! Everything is fine now . It ’ s really great to see that you look so handsome today. "

" Thank you very much , Madam. I tried my best to look like this. "

" Surely , baby . You are always good . "

" OK, Madam . Good bye ! "

" Bye , Siddharth . See you after school . "

" Yes, Madam. Thank you very much for everything . "

" Come on , class. Please take your seats and start writing on your notebooks the homework assignment. "

" Hey ! What are you doing ? Sit down ! Sit down ! I told you to sit down . "

" Oooh ! It ’ s Siddharth again ! Oh ! You know what I think of him? "

" I don ’ t give a damn . "

" Yes , Mam. But tell me , please . "

" Ok ! Just shut up ! He is very annoying person . He disturbs the class all the time . "

" Why ? "

" Because he talks too much with his friends and makes jokes even when it ’ s not appropriate to laugh . And above all , he always gets late . "

" Oh ! I understand you very well , Mam. "

" Do you? "

" Yes, Mam . He is my best friend . We talk a lot and we laugh all the time . "

" What ?! You are talking about him again! "

" Yeah . But he disturbs me too . "

" Oh ! And what does he disturb you for? "

" Because I have to concentrate on my lessons. "

" Do you think that he is a good student ? "

" No , Mam . He is not a good one. "

" Oh ! Why did you say such thing? "

" Yes, Mam. But tell me the truth please . You know very well how poorly he does in his classwork and homework assignments. "

" I have to agree with him , Madam . He is not a good student at all . And moreover, he always gets late to school. "

" Oh ! He is like you ?! "

" What ? No , Mam . I am a very good student and never get late for school. "

" Well , it ’ s OK then . Go ahead please . "

" Okey , Madam . I will tell him everything that he did wrong today . He won ’ t like what you said, but we should let him know how annoying he is. "

" Yes! Do so ! If he does the same again, send him to me . You hear? "

" Yes , Mam . Thank you very much for telling me everything about Siddharth . I will make sure that he doesn ’ t bother anybody in class from now on . Good bye, Madam. "

" Goodbye . "

" Bye ! "

" Hey ! What are you doing there , baby ? "

" Nothing , Mom. Just going to school . "

" OK , baby. But I have something for you to do in your class today . "

" Oh ! Please don ’ t tell me about homework again, Mam . I got it already this morning . "

" OK , my son . No need to get upset . I know that you had some problems with your teacher. She said something bad about you yesterday and your friends told me everything that happened. "

" Yes, Mom. It was because Siddharth talked too much during the class and disturbed everybody in school. I didn ’ t like what he did , so I told him to stop. "

" You are very brave . "

" Thank you very much , Mam . But that ’ s not true. What I told my friends was just a little lie to defend myself from them. They always tease me because of Siddharth, but I never get angry with him . "

" Oh ! Is it ? I can ’ t believe that your friends said that you were annoyed about the teacher and all those stuff. They are the biggest liars ever! "

" Yeah , Mam . They made up some stories because they thought that I would be happy if someone else told a lie on me. "

" Oh ! I know who is to blame for it . You are not supposed to tell lies , Siddharth. But you did, so now your teacher believes that you were annoyed with her and everybody else in class knows about it as well . "

" I am sorry, Mom . It ’ s my fault because I told a lie. "

" That ’ s OK , baby . If only you would stop doing the same things again then we wouldn ’ t be having this talk right now . Come on ! You have to go to school and write your report so that we can send it to our friend, Madam . Let ’ s go! Bye! "

" Hey! Why are you leaving ? "

" I told her that everything would be alright , Siddharth . Just go home and work on the report. You don ’ t have any other choice . "

" Yes, Mam. Thank you very much for understanding me . "

" Oh ! That ’ s fine, baby . Take good care of yourself and I will see you later in school. Bye! "

" Goodbye, Mom. See you soon. "

" Hey! Baby , are you back yet? "

" Yes, Mam. Everything is alright now . "

" That ’ s great news , baby . How was it ? "

" Well, I told her about my report and she gave me some ideas to improve on it as well as some changes that should be made on the paperwork itself . But everything is going to be fine in no time. Thank you very much for helping me with this . "

" Oh ! I ’ m glad to know that everything went according to plan . You are welcome, Siddharth . Just take good care of yourself and I will see you later at school. "

" Goodbye , Mom. See you soon. "
