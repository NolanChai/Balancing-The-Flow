" Hold on . Maybe you'd better tell me who this 'angel' is first. I think you're losing your marbles . "

" Marbles ? Don't worry about that . I need a car ! "

" What do you want to drive it for , Robert ? Are you going to drive down to the coffee shop or are you just going to sit in the parking lot and wait for her ? "

" Oh, no ... I'm not waiting ! She said she would be working until 10:30 PM tonight . And then they close at midnight . So it looks like I have an hour and a half or so. But if you will get me that car , I can make my move after she closes up the shop. "

" Is this girl that gorgeous ? You're going to give me all of these details about your 'angel' , but you won't tell me her name . That doesn't sound right . Are you sure about this ? "

" I know what you mean . It doesn't make much sense ... She goes by the nickname, Angel . But she is so beautiful ! Her hair is dark brown and it falls over her shoulders in ringlets. And she has these wonderful green eyes that are just amazing ! "

" I need to see this girl , Robert ! Give me some details about her . What else do you know ? "

" You want more than her name, Cafe au lait ... ? OK ... well, I've never met anyone quite like Angel . She is a barista at Starbucks. So that means she makes the coffee drinks and stuff for everybody who comes in there. But she also talks to people and is so nice to everybody ! "

" Hmmm ... so what is it about her that attracted you ? "

" It's more than just her looks , Cafe au lait . She has this warmth about her when she speaks to other people. And she always seems happy . I don't know exactly how to describe her, but it feels like ... well, kind of a glowing light about her that draws you to her. "

" You said something interesting before , Robert. Didn't you say something about Angel's hair ? "

" Well, yeah . I guess I did mention that she has ringlets that fall over her shoulders . She wears it in a ponytail most of the time when she works at Starbucks. "

" Now, let me ask you ... was she talking to other people or just you when you were in there today ? And what was she saying ? Did she tell you anything special about herself ? "

" I didn't think much about it at the time . But now that you mention it , maybe she said something special. Well, I don't really remember. She is so nice to me and everyone else too. It wasn't anything specific that stood out in my mind ... but if you are interested ... "

" Yes , please tell me everything you can remember . Maybe this is why you went there today ? Tell me now ! "

" Well, I guess she did say something that might be important ... at least for me. She said to me ... 'You look good in a suit .' "
