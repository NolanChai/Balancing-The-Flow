That's what makes me the perfect person to ask for help with this.  

 Why is that, exactly ? 

 Well , I was just reading about the difference between an Italian espresso and a French caffe crema .  And the other day someone tried to explain to me how a cappuccino differs from a cafe latte . 

 You see why I can't keep them straight ? 

 Yeah , so do I.  

 That's why I want your help ! 

 OK. What do you need help with? 

 The difference between an espresso and a cappuccino . 

 But ... aren't those the same thing ? 

 No , no they aren't!  

 How can there be more than one type of coffee ?  

 Well, for instance, a latte is made by combining steamed milk with espresso. 

 OK , that makes sense .  

 But it isn't just the same thing as a cappuccino. 

 How so? 

 The cappuccino has a very distinctive foam layer on top of the coffee. 

 I see ... how does one make a cappuccino ?  

 First, you pour some espresso into a glass or mug .  Then , add your milk , steamed or not , and stir with a spoon to incorporate the foam into the liquid. 

 And then what? 

 Add a bit of chocolate syrup on top for a really nice treat!  

 That's it ? 

 Well ... there are different kinds of steamed milk. You can use regular milk , low-fat , or even skimmed . The foam depends on how much air was in the milk when you were heating it, so if you put whole milk into a thermometer to check its temperature, you would see that the fat floats up to the top of the liquid. 

 I'm sure it does.  

 You can use any kind of mug , glass or even a cup ! 

 Oh . I was thinking of just using the coffee shop cups . 

 Of course! 

 OK , thanks so much for helping me out with this. It was really helpful to have you explain it all in one place. 

 No problem at all .
