" How old do you think that she is ? "

" I don't know, but not as old as you are. "

" That's true ; she must be very young then . "

" Yes ! And I heard her mother say yesterday , that she had a birthday last week ! "

" Well, have you asked the new girl to come over and play ? "

" No; not yet. "

" She's too shy ? "

" I guess so . "

" That's too bad ; if she is a nice girl, she should be invited into our play-group. "

" Yes! And perhaps we could get her to join the band."

" The band ! Do you think that she would like to learn to play an instrument ? "

" I don't know; but I'll ask her when I see her at school tomorrow, and then tell you what she says. "

THE STOLEN GUN

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT 1906 BY CHARLES COOK & CO., CHICAGO.]

THE BOYS OF TOMMY'S FARM

"Tell me about the gun, Tommy. Did you ever see one like that before ? "

"No; I never did."

"What do you suppose it is for? "

"I don't know exactly; but it looks to me as though it were a cannon."

"Well, you are right ; it is a cannon. It was stolen last night from the village armory. "

"You mean that the soldiers took it away ? "

"Yes . But they did not take it all; for this piece is broken off , and I saw the men come to work with crow-bars trying to pull it out."

"The men were soldiers ? "

"No ; but some of them looked like that. Others were in suits as though they belonged to a church. But they all came here, for we found this paper on one of them . This is a picture of the broken cannon and the place where it was stolen. Here is another picture; this shows what happened at the time. "

"Were any people hurt ? "

"Yes! There was an old man who lives here, and he was frightened almost to death by the noise that came from this gun . But no one else was hurt."

"I should think they would be sorry they stole that cannon. Don't you think so ? "

"Oh, I don't know; perhaps some of them were glad. It might have been very valuable to the men who took it. You see that there is a lot of gold on this paper . And if it could be sold for gold , it would be worth a good deal. But how could they get rid of such a heavy cannon ? "

"They couldn't; and that is why I asked you what it was like."

"I think it must have been brought away in pieces. That is the only way it could have been taken here."

"It looks as though there were two cannons in this picture . What do you suppose happened ? "

"I guess that one of them exploded, and blew up the other gun with it. And so it was broken into pieces just like ours here."

THE HOUNDS OF LIONEL'S FARM

LIONEL : "I hear that you have two hounds. Tell me about them ."

RALPH : "Well, there is a dog in the woods out back of our house , and he has a big litter of puppies."

LIONEL : "Why do they call him a dog ? "

RALPH : "Because he doesn't bark like a fox or a coyote. He whines, just like the little pups we have around our house ."

LIONEL : "Whose dog is it ? "

RALPH : "His name is 'Pup,' and I think he must belong to some one who has been hunting with a gun."

LIONEL : "Why do you say that?"

RALPH : "'Because there are no foxes or coyotes in these woods; but there are plenty of rabbits. Pup hunts rabbits and makes them into his dinner, instead of trying to kill other animals ."

LIONEL : "He sounds like a good dog. He must be very useful."

RALPH : "Yes ! And you should hear the way he carries himself when he sees us coming in the road. Just as soon as he knows that we are looking at him, he puts on an air of importance, and walks up and down with his tail straight out, showing that he is our friend."

LIONEL : "He certainly looks as though he would make a good companion for us. But why doesn't Pup bark if you call him ? "

RALPH : "'Because he has never heard the sound of any dog but his own mother and father, and so he doesn't know what it is. When we came into these woods, I think that Pup was surprised to find us around; for he had no idea that dogs could be like us."

LIONEL : "He looks as though he would make a fine companion ."

RALPH : "'I don't know about that. He is such an ugly little thing that nobody ever likes him except Pup and his mother. And the only way to get any one else to like them, would be for them to do tricks."

LIONEL : "And can they ? "

RALPH : "'No; not as well as our dog does .'"

THE SHOOTING AT TOMMY'S FARM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT 1906 BY CHARLES COOK & CO., CHICAGO.]

LIONEL : "What do you mean, Ralph ? The only thing I ever heard that dog do was to bark at us when we came near his house."

RALPH : "'But Pup can't bark; he whines like a puppy."

"Well ! Do you think it would be worth while for him to learn tricks ? "

"That depends on how they are done. If they could do some of the tricks that our dog does , I believe that everybody would like them just as well as we do our own dogs ."

LIONEL : "What kind of a trick can a dog do?"

RALPH : "'Why, he can sit up and beg for something to eat. He can shake hands with you when you say 'howdy.' And he can make any number of different sounds, if he has learned them."

LIONEL : "But Pup couldn't learn to do that."

RALPH : "'I don't think so; not at once. But after a while I believe he would get along as well as some other dogs we know. You see, when the first dog was made by God, He gave him the power to understand things , and also to speak to us with his voice ."

LIONEL : "And what has that got to do with Pup's not learning tricks ? "

RALPH : "'Why, he doesn't know how to talk. God told our first dog that if he did his lessons well and obeyed all the rules that were made for him , that He would teach him to speak just as other dogs do .'"

LIONEL : "Then you think Pup should be taught ? "

RALPH : "'I certainly do. And I am going to see if I can find a man who will give him lessons.'"

THE DOGS OF LIONEL'S FARM

RALPH : "There is another dog in the village that I think you would like to know. His name is 'Sam,' and he lives on a farm not far from here ."

LIONEL : "'How did you come to know him ? '"

RALPH : "'I heard my father tell about it."

LIONEL : "Did Sam live where your father used to live, before he bought this farm?"

RALPH : "'Yes; but I don't believe that there was any connection between them. The old dog and the farmer lived together as friends for many years ; and then, when the farmer died , Sam went back to his own people in the village.'"

LIONEL : "Why did he do that ? "'Because they wanted him."

RALPH : "'Yes; but not because they knew any better how to take care of a dog than my father does. They liked Sam so much, that when the farmer died , and no one else came forward to claim the dog for himself, his relatives bought him.'"

L

" Is she thin or fat ? "

" No , not at all . I think that she is quite pretty . "

" She has a beautiful face . "

" Have you seen her hair? "

" No, but it seems very nice from what I've heard . "

" I think that you will like her . "

" Does she have a car ? "

" Yes , but not a very expensive one . "

" I can tell you how to meet her. "

" How? "

" When you see her, say hello and ask her name . Then invite her over for coffee . After that just let things happen naturally . "

" You mean we should act natural ? "

" Well , yes. Just be yourself. That's the best way to get to know someone better . "

" I'll try it. Thanks. "

" And then ? "

" Then I saw that she had a very pretty face and smooth skin . "

" What color is her hair ? "

" Her hair is light brown in color , with bangs across her forehead . "

" What about her clothes ? "

" She wears a nice, dark green dress . "

" Is that the only thing she's wearing ? "

" I don't think so . "

" Oh yes ! Her shoes are light brown with pretty flowers on them and her stockings are light blue . "

" That sounds very nice. Now, tell me what else you see when you look at this girl."

" I notice that she has a lot of freckles across the bridge of her nose and down across her cheeks , "

" I don't think I like girls with freckles . "

" Well, there's a reason for it. They're attractive to boys because they are considered sexy and cute . So if you want to get the attention of the boy of your choice then go ahead and be yourself , even if that means having some freckles on your face ! "

" I think she should wear a scarf over her nose though because it looks kinda bad. "

" What about her hair ? "

" She has beautiful long brown hair that is soft and silky to touch . "

" Well , if she's as pretty on the outside then surely her personality will be just as nice ! "

" I don't think so . "

" Oh yes, you do! Just because someone is attractive on the outside doesn't mean that they are going to be attractive on the inside. Look at all the celebrities out there in Hollywood , they're all pretty but some of them have such nasty attitudes and bad habits . "

" Well, I think she is pretty and if you don't like her then maybe you should move away from this town because there aren't any other girls as pretty as that one here ! "

## 출처

" Yes, I had to pass by a house one day and she came out of the doorway , right in front of me . "

" Were you looking at her? "

" Well , let's just say that my eyes were drawn to her."

" Didn't it seem like you wanted to talk to her ? "

" I think she noticed my stare, but it was too late for me . I had already passed by . "

" Is there a girl in your class who you like? "

" No , not really . "

" Maybe you're afraid to tell me that you're interested ? "

" It's just that all the girls seem so different . "

" I think that she is very pretty and she seems a little shy too . "

" How can you tell? "

" You could see it in her face when you spoke to her . "

" So , what are you going to do about this girl ? Are you going to ask her out on a date ? "

" I don't know, but I like talking to her . "

" Okay then, let's go back and talk to her . "
