" That's terrible ! I didn’t know she had a son. "

" Oh, he died five years ago . "

" She has always been very bitter since then , hasn ’ t she ? "

" No . Not at all . At first it was just so hard to understand why God could do this to her , but she never complained about him. I don’t know how she did it. Then a few months ago she decided to leave the church. "

" She left? Why ? What happened ? "

" I guess she had been thinking and praying about all these things and realized that nothing she could do would ever bring her son back or change what he has become . "

" So now she no longer believes in God’s sovereignty over our lives? She doesn ’ t think everything happens for a reason ? I guess you never know, huh? "

" No , not really. But it is kind of sad to see someone who used to be so strong and confident now doubting the very foundation on which she built her life . It seems like all she ever had was her faith in God and his ability to give meaning to things that happen, but now I don’t think she has anything left. "

" What is there to believe in? She ’ s lost everything . "

" Maybe so. But isn’t that the way it should be sometimes—when you realize all your possessions are nothing more than temporary and that really they mean nothing? Don’t we want our lives to be empty of ourselves at some point if it means having Christ dwell in us ? "

"I suppose . I just don ’ t understand why she can ’ t accept the things we have faith in. Is there something wrong with her, or is this just a natural part of growing as a Christian? "

"That ’ s hard to say . She could be experiencing a time of spiritual crisis like you are talking about , and it does seem that at these times she has turned from God , but I don’t think it has anything to do with the truth of our faith. The apostle Paul had times when he was confused, too, even though he had more faith than most of us will ever have . I ’ m sure he would still be confused if we could see him now—he would probably be asking himself why he did so many things that caused so much pain to himself and others. But it wasn’t the truth in our faith that led him astray; it was his own sinful nature. "

" I guess . Maybe my sister-in-law is having some sort of struggle, too, but she doesn ’ t even talk about what happened in her life after her son died , so how would I know? I don’t mean to be a nag or anything, but I can’t help thinking that we ought to have some kind of relationship with God and other people. Isn ’ t that why we were put on this earth—to worship God ? "

"That doesn’t necessarily mean we have to believe the same things . We are all part of a family, and no matter what our beliefs may be , it is important to care for each other in time of need. Your sister-in-law still has many needs and she doesn ’ t see God as the source of her strength—she sees herself. That’s not always bad; but it does limit her faith . "

"What do you mean? I thought faith was supposed to be unconditional. Isn ’ t that what we are taught in Sunday school ? "

"Yes , it is, but our relationship with God and with each other must remain true if we are going to live out our Christian faith. If she can’t believe that God could bring good out of something as tragic as the death of a child, then her beliefs don ’ t have any meaning for her at all. I think she should try to find some place in herself where she can make room for God and allow him to work within her . "

"You mean like we did? Is there anything wrong with how we believe now ? I can’t imagine it being any different from how we used to live. "

"No, I don ’ t think so . Maybe you should try to find out what is going on in your sister-in-law ’ s life and then pray for her—maybe the two of you could go to church together? You never know where God may lead you if you let him."

"I guess it wouldn’t hurt, would it ? "
