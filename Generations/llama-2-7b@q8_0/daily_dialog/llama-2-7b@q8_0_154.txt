What did she do? 

 She told me to go to hell , and that was the end of our relationship . 

 When we were together, she seemed very nice. 

 She even said that she wanted to get married someday . 

 It’s a shame. I really liked her. 

 Did you hear about Mary from anybody? 

 Who knows what happened ? 

 Everybody in town knew us as a couple. 

 I’d like to know more, but she doesn’t want to talk with me . 

 Now it ’ s all over . 

 What do you think we should do? 

 We can’t go on living without each other , can we ? 

 Mary is just being silly. 

 It’s obvious that she still has feelings for me . 

 I hope so . 

 She told me yesterday, over the phone, that she couldn ’ t stand me anymore . 

 She doesn’t realize that it would be better if we were friends than nothing at all. 

 Let’s give her some time to think about it. 

 It ’ s not too late for us , is it ? 

 I’ve been thinking things over. If Mary really wants to be with me, she can come back . 

 I understand why you were upset when we broke up. 

 But now I want her back in my life again. 

 What do you think? 

 I wish it would all turn out OK for us. 

 Do you have anything else to say on this subject?

 Do you think that Mary will change her mind?

 Is there anything that you can tell me about Mary’s personality?

 Do you remember why we broke up the first time around?
