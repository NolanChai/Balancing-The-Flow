Well , I have taken chemistry and biology at high school , so I feel confident that I can handle the challenge . 

 I don't think you can manage all of this , but we will help you out as much as we could.

Oh , that's OK . It is important to make up for it at the beginning of college. 

 I think I can handle biology and chemistry if I spend more time on it . 

 I can help you with your homework , but you have got to be responsible for yourself .
