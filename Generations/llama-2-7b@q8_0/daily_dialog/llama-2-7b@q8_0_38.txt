" Well you do. We don't live in a world without money any longer."

"I have $5 in my pocket . Can i use that? "

" Well, no. You can only put in quarters or dollar bills . "

"OK. I don't understand why you need change for something you already paid for . "

"It's simple really. We are going to get the change out of you . "

"So it's my money? "

"It is now. I have never met a person in this world that could live without money . It is what keeps everything moving around."

"Oh . Well, can i wash something?"

"Yes of course ! What would you like to do ? "

"I need my bed sheets washed , and then my pants and shirts."

"No problem. Just put them in there . "

"Okay . Thanks for your help."

" Here's my quarter. Now what do I do ? "

" Wait, where is your quarter again ? "

" This isn't the first time that has happened to me at this laundromat."

" Why don't they put a machine in there for free . "

" No. You're supposed to wait 2 minutes for the washer cycle to finish, and then you put your clothes in the dryer and hit start."

"The washing machine is finished . "

" Now you put your clothes in the dryer and push start . "

" The spinning stops . "

" Now you can take out the clothes . "

" That was fun . "
