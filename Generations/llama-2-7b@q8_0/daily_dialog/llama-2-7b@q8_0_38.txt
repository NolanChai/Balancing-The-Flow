I can't understand how they work . 

 I don't know how to use them correctly . 

 What do you want from me ?  

 I will try my best to help . 

 I am just as frustrated .

 I know it is difficult for you, but please let me assist you with your laundry.

I think that this would be a great time for us to use my credit card.

I have a feeling that the washer is broken, but i don't really know how to check it out.
I am having some trouble with my dryer and need your help fixing it.

I found a few problems with my drier after looking at it for a while.

 I didn't think I needed quarters , But now I do . 

 Do you have any ?  

I could use some change to run the washer and dryer .

Could I use your credit card to get the laundry done?

I think I know where my problems are with my machine. 

 I need some help, but i'll figure it out in a little bit.

 I want to be able to operate this equipment right now, and I don't have quarters.

 I will get the change to do my laundry from someone else when they come over later tonight.

In the coin box. 

 Do we need anything else ? 

 No . 

 Let's go , I got to get home before my mom gets back from work. 

 Do you want me to help you load the clothes ? 

 Sure !

If there are any additional rules or format changes needed, please make a pull request with details.

How long does it take for the wash cycle ? 

 About an hour or so . 

 What about the drying cycle? 

 It takes a few more minutes to dry than to wash. 

 I'm still learning how to use these machines. 

 Don't worry you will learn in no time . 

 What else can you tell me ? 

 The water goes into the machine and then gets spun around . 

 When it stops spinning it drains out of the machine . 

 That is called a rinse cycle. 

 Then the wash cycle starts over again. 

 The washing machine uses water to clean things. 

 Now you can put clothes in the dryer . 

 How do I start this ? 

 First take out the clothes and add them to the dryer , then open the door of the dryer and push the button that says dry. 

 Wait for it to be done, but don't remove any clothes until you hear a buzzing sound. 

 That means it is time to get the clothes out . 

 You can go now.

[Warning: Short generation] 

 I don't think I'll be using them much after today .
