OK , sure. 

 But wait . How about a movie ? 

 Oh , no thanks , I saw that already . 

 Is there anything else on tonight ? 

 Nope, not much . There ’ s something on at the movies . 

 OK , so what do you want to watch ? 

 Hmmm , what was it called again ? 

 Something about a girl who runs away and joins a circus . 

 Oh yes , The Greatest Showman ! That sounds good . 

 Sounds pretty cool , but I don’t really like that actor . 

 OK. Well, there ’ s another one on with the same guy . 

 Hmmm ... how about this one ? 

 Yeah , that’s it . I remember now ! The Greatest Showman is also coming out in 3D soon! 

 Oh wow ! I didn ’ t know they were doing a 3D version of that movie ! That sounds great ! 

 OK then, what time do we need to be at the movies ? 

 Uh , not until 5:20 . I want to get there early and get good seats. 

 Yeah, me too . 

 Should we order pizza ? 

 Oh yeah ! How about Domino ’ s ? 

 Ok! Let’s do that.

Yeah , but still , you should be watching that other show . 

 Fine . I won ’ t watch Ally McNeal , but it ’ s stupid of you to judge me for doing so . You know , some women are into girly stuff and some men like sports . What ’ s the big deal ?

No ! 

 You ’ re just jealous that I know what ’ s going on and you don ’ t . 

 Actually , I do . 

 Really ? What channel is it on ? 

 11. 

 What about your Xbox 360 ? Didn ’ t they just come out with a new game ? 

 Oh man ! It ’ s called Crazy Taxi 3 and you can actually ride the buses around .

 Oh , it sounds like a great game . 

 Yeah , I already pre-ordered it . 

 But I want to watch Ally McNeal . 

 All right ! If I don ’ t get this Xbox by myself tonight , you won ’ t even be able to play the damn thing anyway. 

 Oh ! All right .

I love how they show the bad guys fighting and getting tortured , but then when the good guy wins he gets the hot chick as his reward . 

 What do you want from me ? You know that ’ s not true . 

 Yeah it is . Look at that commercial where they showed them fighting in the desert , and then after the girl beat up her opponent she said " Hey , let ’ s go get a drink together . " 

 But that wasn’t on Dark Angel ! That was Ally McNeal. 

 Whatever . I just want to watch something fun . 

 I know what you like . What about the new season of Frasier ? 

 No , I don ’ t want some old TV show . I want something that I haven’t seen before . 

 Well , there ’ s always Ally McNeal and Dark Angel on cable. 

 Maybe they have those shows on a cable channel or something. 

 Yeah , maybe you can find it online somewhere. 

 Actually , I don ’ t want to watch any TV show at all right now . I want to go out and do something fun with my friends. 

 Oh yeah ? Well , if that’s the case why didn’t you say so earlier ? I was just trying to make a suggestion here . 

 You know , this isn ’ t really working for me . 

 Yeah , but I thought we had some good times together in the past. 

 Uh huh . And I thought it would be nice if you bought me dinner tonight at that new Japanese restaurant across town. 

 I don ’ t know why I always have to be the one doing all the talking around here . You never say what ’ s on your mind . 

 Why not ? What’s wrong with you ? 

 Nothing is wrong , but I feel like we should talk more about things that really matter in our lives . I think it ’ s important for us to communicate better. 

 It would be nice if you thought about the other person from time to time and tried to put yourself in their shoes sometimes. 

 You know , maybe one of these days we should talk about how much you don ’ t like me because I am a girl or something . 

 What ? Why do you say that ? That makes no sense ! 

 It doesn’t ? Well then why are you always so quick to tell people what they can and cannot watch on TV ? Don ’ t you think it would be better if we talked about things that matter to both of us instead of just watching stupid shows all the time ? 

 You know , I wish sometimes that we could go somewhere without worrying about whether or not we will have enough money for rent or food . If we didn’t have those worries maybe then it would be easier for me to focus on things like who likes what TV show and if you want to watch something new tonight. 

 I don ’ t know , honey , all of my friends are doing really well right now and they are able to buy nice clothes and go out with each other . Maybe it’s not so easy for me because I am working two jobs just so that we have enough money every month ! 

 No it ’ s not the same for everybody , and you know what ? It doesn ’ t matter whether or not we are doing well right now because there is always a chance that something could happen where we both lose our job tomorrow . Then then we won’t be able to afford rent anymore and all of those other things. 

 I don ’ t want to think about the future right now . All I care about is how much you like me and if we have enough money to eat dinner tonight at that new Japanese restaurant across town. 

 Okay , fine . Whatever makes you happy ! 

 Don’t talk like that ! You know what ? If this conversation continues then it might be better for us both if I left right now because if there is one thing that makes me mad it ’ s when people act like everything is going to work out fine just so long as they have a lot of money in their pockets . 

 You know , sometimes all you need is some common sense and the courage to face reality head-on ! Now please stop trying to talk to me about that stupid TV show ! 

 Look , I ’ m sorry if this conversation upsets you but it’s not like anything has changed between us . We still love each other even though our financial situation is not what we had hoped for at the beginning of the year. Now can we please just talk about something else ? 

 You know , maybe next time I should try to tell you what ’ s on TV beforehand so that way you won’t be surprised when I switch channels and turn off my TV remote control. 

 If we aren’t going out tonight then it would also help if you let me borrow $20 for dinner . It wouldn’t take long , but I really need the money right now because my boss said he couldn ’ t give me any more hours at work this week. 

 I know , but I don ’ t want to argue about anything else either . Let us just talk about what we can do together for fun later tonight . 

 Fine ! If it means that much then I will call my friend and see if he wants to hang out with me after dinner instead of going home alone. 

 What ? Are you serious ? Why would I want to go out with some guy who doesn ’ t like watching TV shows on cable ? That makes no sense at all . 

 Well , we could go somewhere else for drinks if it means that much to you . Just don ’ t ask me about anything else or try to talk me into something because I won’t do anything unless it is something good ! 

 Oh really ? What makes something good in your eyes ? Is there even such a thing as something being bad anymore ? Maybe we should just start watching some old TV shows on cable together so that way when we get tired of talking about the same things over and over again , then maybe you will finally realize how much I don ’ t like it when people try to tell me what I can watch or where they want to go out for dinner. 

 Maybe . If it makes you happy then I guess that might be okay . After all , if there was ever an opportunity for us to have some fun together again then maybe we should take advantage of it while it lasts instead of letting life pass by without making memories with each other ! 

 But what about money ? You said yourself that everything is going wrong right now and we need more money just so we don ’ t run out of food before next month arrives . I know how hard it is to save up enough cash for rent , but at least try to be happy if only until tomorrow ! 

 Fine ! If you want me to talk about something else then maybe I should start talking about why it would be better if we spent our time watching TV shows instead of having fun together . That way when I get home from work each night , all you have to do is turn on the TV and watch whatever show comes on first . Then maybe one day soon you will wake up and realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 Okay . If talking about TV shows makes you happy then maybe it would be better for us both if we stopped having conversations like this before bedtime each night. But remember , there is nothing wrong with watching your favorite shows , but don ’ t let them distract from all the other great things life has to offer ! 

 I guess . If only tomorrow never comes then maybe one day soon you will wake up and realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 Well , if we are going to do this then let ’ s get started right away ! Let us watch TV together tonight so that way when I get home from work each night all you have to do is turn on the TV and watch whatever show comes on first. Then maybe one day soon you will wake up and realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 No , we can ’ t watch it ! This conversation is not about me watching TV shows anymore . It ’ s about us spending time together instead , so let us go somewhere else for drinks instead before you have to work tomorrow. Maybe then one day soon both of us will realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 If we are going to do this then let ’ s get started right away !

Then maybe one day soon you will wake up and realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 Fine . If watching TV makes you happy then I guess we should just go somewhere else for drinks instead before I have to work tomorrow. Maybe then both of us will realize how much fun was missing out on because of that stupid show called Ally McNeal ! 

 No , this conversation is not about me watching TV shows anymore . It ’ s about us spending time together instead , so let us go somewhere else for drinks instead before you have to work tomorrow
