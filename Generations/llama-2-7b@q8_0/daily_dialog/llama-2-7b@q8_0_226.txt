I didn ’ t want to bother you , but I think we should do something about this . Can I talk with your husband ? We can give him a lot of love and be patient for our son , but I don ’ t know how long it will take him to change his habits . It is so painful for me everyday when he says these words . 

 Okay , I think you are right , we should talk with your husband , because this problem has affected many people in our family . We need to deal with it together .

What do we need to do ? 

 Firstly , we need to control him by setting rules and teaching good habits . Secondly , we must praise him every time when he does something right or says good words . Thirdly , we need to take care of his bad temper by giving him a way to express himself properly . 

 Mmmm , I ’ m not sure if our son will listen to what you say . 

 He should . We are talking about the health of your child . The sooner he learns good habits , the better it is for his future growth and development . 

Okay ! Bye bye .

But if he does not cooperate at all ? 

 I don ’ t know . You can punish him if necessary, and I am sure you won ’ t overdo it . But the bottom line is you must maintain a calm and relaxed attitude with your son . 

 Thank you very much , Auntie . I think so too . I ’ ll try my best to take care of Tony well.
