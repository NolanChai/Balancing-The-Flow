How is your son ?

 He's growing out of his clothes so fast that it seems to me as if he has grown 2 inches in height every month this past year.

 How is your sister? 

 She's doing well now. After her surgery last week, she's been on the mend and should be home by next Saturday.

How are you ?

I'm okay . I was really busy with work all last week.
