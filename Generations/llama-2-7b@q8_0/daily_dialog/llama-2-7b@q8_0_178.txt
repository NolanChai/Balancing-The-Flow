It was $100 . 

 My car's parked in the garage now .

 Do you remember who your parents were when you were born? 

 I do not know . Do you ? 

 Yes , my mother and father . 

 They lived down the road from where we live now . 

 My father was an accountant. 

 Have you ever been in a car accident? 

 No, never. 

 Have you ? 

 I was involved in one two years ago. 

 It was not my fault and I was lucky to escape with minor injuries . 

 Did you know that this year is the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing? 

 I did , but I don't remember it very well because I was only a small child. 

 I remember seeing the astronauts walking on TV and I wanted to be an astronaut too.

Oh that sucks ! 

 It wasn't my fault though , the guy must have just been having a bad day . 

 You're right . That happens sometimes . 

 Yeah, it's annoying isn't it ? 

 I guess you could argue that they need to make more money from parking tickets in order to keep people from parking wherever they like , but still... 

 It's always the same thing with governments - they want everything to be as simple as possible for them . 

 Yeah , I agree . 

 Anyways , are you going anywhere this weekend ? 

 No, probably not . 

 You should come out and see a movie with me at least once ! It's been ages since we went somewhere together ! 

 Sorry about that . 

 Not really , I understand . 

 I know it's your busy time of the year now, so you have to do all these preparations for the exam , but still... 

 No problem . I know you're just busy. 

 It's fine ! You should start thinking about what movie you want to see though, otherwise I won't be able to make a decision myself . 

 How about Star Wars ? 

 That sounds great ! I hope it'll come out soon in the cinema here ... 

 Have you ever seen it before ? 

 No , and neither have you ! 

 How can you not have seen Star Wars ? It's one of my favourite movies . 

 I guess I just never got around to seeing it - I should definitely change that soon . 

 Yeah, I think so too. 

 So where exactly are we going this weekend? 

 Oh , I don't know ... A normal movie theater is probably fine , but it would be even more fun if we saw a matinee at one of those old fashioned cinemas . 

 Do you mean like that one on 10th street ? 

 Yeah, that's perfect ! I heard they serve popcorn and drinks during the movie , and if it gets too loud in there, they have a room upstairs where you can just go and relax for a while . 

 Sounds good to me!

What about it ? 

 Well , now you'll have a fine . 

 Yes , but it will be worth it . 

 I think it was better before when we didn't know about the new parking laws and had no fines . 

 You can get a ticket even if it is your first time ? 

 That's right . 

 So what will you do ? 

 I'll park in a lot somewhere else . 

 What does the red zone mean ? 

 It means no parking from seven AM to midnight , every day of the week . 

 Why not ? 

 Because there aren't any signs there that say it is a restricted area for parking . 

 Really ? Well I guess I shouldn't have parked in a red zone then . What other zones are there? 

 There is green , blue , and yellow . Green means you can park on week days between seven AM and six PM . Blue means weekend parking from Friday at noon to Monday morning at seven . Yellow means that it is limited time parking only from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon. 

 But how do they know ? 

 Well , if you park there during those times then the police can come and give you a ticket because of what's called a traffic rule . They put all this information on their website so you can check it before you drive and save yourself some money . 

 So are the red zones for police officers to park? 

 That could be one reason why they're there , I suppose. 

 Yeah ? 

 Well , I guess I shouldn't park in a red zone again unless I want to get fined. 

 No , don't do that . There is a green and blue zone too for other cars so it isn't only the police that are supposed to be there .

Were you working late last night? 

Yes, I was. I had a lot of work to do. 

What kind of work did you have to do? 

I had to write a report about the latest trend in fashion. 

That sounds really interesting! What's the name of your company again? 

It is called "Taylor Fashion." It's the biggest clothing store chain on Earth!

I think they should give us more time to park on the street . 

 There are plenty of places to park . 

 The tickets cost too much . 

 They go up every year . 

 Are you going to pay for it ? 

 Yeah , I just got my bill in the mail . 

 What did they charge you ? 

 $50 . 

 Oh my god ! That's a lot of money!
