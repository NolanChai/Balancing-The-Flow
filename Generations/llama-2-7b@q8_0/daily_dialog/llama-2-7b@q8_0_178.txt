" So that was a $50 dollar ticket ? "

"Yeah. "

" Did you feel like it was worth $50 to just leave your car there ? "

" No. It's not my car so I don't care about it ."

" But the guy who owns that car might care a lot more than if he just left it there and got a ticket for it. "

" Yeah but that was his decision to make ."

"Ok, then what would you do ? "

"I wouldn't have parked there ."

"That doesn't change anything about the $50 dollar parking ticket . "



" My parking spot was taken by someone else's car . "

" Didn't they have any other spots that weren't red zone? "

" No . I tried everything . But the only one available was in the red zone and so I got a ticket . "

" Wow , I can't believe they would do that to you . "

" Yeah , but it wasn't the first time . They've been doing this for a long time. "

" So what happened after that? Did they take your money or anything ? "

" No , but they told me how much it costs . "

" And then? "

" I've never had a ticket before and didn't want one again . "

" Are you going to pay for it ? "

" Yes , but not immediately . "

" Why aren't you paying right now ? "

" Because I need the money for something else . "

" Okay, that's understandable. And then? "

" Then I called a friend and he gave me some advice on where to park next time so it wouldn't happen again . "

" Oh , thanks ! What was his name ? "

" Ummm, Bob . "

" Okay, thanks, Bob . Bye ! Have a good day. "
