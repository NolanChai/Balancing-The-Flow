 How long have you been living in this city? 

 Do you prefer to work on a team ,

No , Mr . Green , it's not that I don't like my present job. 

 Well , why do you want to change jobs then ? What are you looking for in a new job ? 

 My work here is quite different from that in my previous company. That's the reason . 

 How so ? 

 The duties of a sales manager require me to handle many things on my own , which means I can't depend on anyone else when it comes to the management and coordination of my team . 

 What do you mean by that ? 

 It means that I have to give every member of my team specific directions and assignments. When problems arise , they are all supposed to come to me for a solution. I can't delegate any responsibility to anyone else . This is really stressful . 

 I see what you mean . 

 The first thing is that I hope to have an assistant who can help me manage my team in an efficient way . 

 That sounds reasonable . But how will it work ? How would you like the new job to be organized ? 

 First , if we are both going to work together on a regular basis , you and I need to talk about our plans for working hours at least once a week. I can't afford to do the same thing every day . If I know what you plan to do each morning, I can arrange things in advance so that we will not be able to meet on those days. 

 Good idea . It's just like we have different schedules for different days . Let's say , we both work from Monday through Friday . On Mondays , Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I will only need you to answer the phone. I can handle the rest of the day by myself. On Thursdays and Fridays , I need your help in making presentations and doing research for me . 

 That's not all . If there are any other meetings or activities we have to attend on those days, you may also be responsible for accompanying me there. You should tell me the details of these events in advance so that I can plan my schedule accordingly . 

 What if you need to go somewhere else over the weekend ? 

 We will probably spend the entire weekend together . If we are going on business, I will have to make arrangements with you at least one week before. 

 Oh , I see . That's how it works . Then what about the holidays and vacation periods? What would you like me to do for those ? 

 You know that in China we have a lot of festivals during the year. We will need to take them into consideration too. Besides, if we both want to go somewhere else for our annual leave , I suppose we should talk about it and make sure there won't be any conflicts . 

 Well , I don't mind that at all . That sounds like a good arrangement . Now let me tell you what I need from your end. First, of course, you will have to keep my calendar. This means you have to call people on my behalf and make appointments when necessary . 

 That should be easy enough . Second , please check my schedule regularly so that there won't be any conflicts in it. I don't want to miss anything important due to my mistakes . 

 What kind of schedules do you need me to pay particular attention to ? 

 The things that are not on my calendar and the activities that have no specific time or place . In other words , if there is a meeting at one o'clock in the afternoon but I don't know it until later, let me know. If I am supposed to go somewhere but I can't tell you where I will be going until then, please let me know as soon as possible . 

 Ok , that makes sense . I will try my best to keep everything up to date . And another thing , Mr . Green , is that when it comes to making phone calls or dealing with people in person, there might be some problems at first. 

 What kind of problems ? 

 Well , if you need me to do anything for you , I will have a hard time doing it unless you tell me the reason why . As far as I am concerned , no matter who you are talking to or what you are supposed to say, I cannot answer their questions without knowing exactly what they want to know. If this is not acceptable to you , I would like you to let me know right away so that I won't go on with it . 

 Well , maybe you can tell them the reason later ? 

 It depends . You see, my job requires me to give people specific answers without delaying things. If they are not satisfied , they may be angry and even take action against us . In fact , I am willing to explain why we cannot meet their requirements as soon as you let me know . But the most important thing is that if there is a problem at all, you have to tell me right away so I can deal with it in advance. 

 Sounds reasonable . So how long will it take for us to get used to working together ? 

 Well , I don't think we will ever get used to each other . It takes time and effort to learn new things . But we will not have any major problems if we both make an honest effort . Besides, you can help me learn a lot of things in your daily work so that my performance on the job won't be affected. 

 I am glad to hear that . Now , what about your working hours and pay ? 

 Well , my previous job is from nine o'clock in the morning until six o'clock at night. I am used to working such long hours . If you can make similar arrangements with me, I will feel more comfortable and relaxed . 

 As for your salary, it's a little lower than what I pay my sales managers , but I think we can negotiate this matter later on once we get the hang of our jobs together. 

 That sounds fair to me . Thank you for listening . Goodbye !
