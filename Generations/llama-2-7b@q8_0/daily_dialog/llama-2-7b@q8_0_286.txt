" Well , actually the reason is not so much because of that . "

" Because of what then , Irene ? "

" There are some problems at the sales department where I was working . The boss there is a bit difficult to get along with . Sometimes he will yell at me and make me feel like running out of breath . I also feel that his work attitude is not very good . He always wants to go for his own interest and does not care about our employees' welfare . "

" I see , I see . Well , that must be a big problem indeed . "

" Yes . And there is another reason . You know , Mr . Green, it has been two years since I started to work for that company and I haven't had any increase in salary . "

" Oh ! Irene, don't tell me that ? Well, well. It is true that money does not make people happy all the time . But you need at least enough of it to keep yourself from worrying about starving to death and so forth . So I think you should get a raise soon . "

" Yes , Mr . Green , but it doesn't seem like my boss is willing to give me one . And there is another problem that bothers me . That is, the wages of employees in our department are very low compared with those who work for other companies . It makes me feel bad and embarrassed sometimes when I meet friends from other companies , especially salesmen , who make much more money than us . "

" Oh ! I see, I see . Well , you know, my assistant is not paid as well as people in your department either . And he is working very hard for me . You can try to negotiate with your boss and hope that you get a raise soon too . "

" Yes , Mr . Green . But I really appreciate the position of your assistant here . Your offer means so much to me . It helps me to make up my mind about leaving my old job . "

" Oh , good . Then come on in. Let's talk about it later ! "

Mr . Green : Hi, Irene! It’s a pleasure to meet you again. I hope you don't mind if I sit here in my study? I think it will be more comfortable than sitting around the conference room. Would you like something to drink ? A cup of tea , coffee, or orange juice?
Irene : Oh . no thank you! Thanks for asking me to come over though. It is nice and warm in your house ! Mr Green: How's that? Irene : Well , it's not so good here in my office. So, let's get straight to our meeting . I see you have been busy with the office stuff.
Mr Green： Yes ,I have to check some reports before we start discussing them. I am glad you got your pay rise at last. I was thinking that Mr Smith of Sales Department might not be willing to give you a raise because he thinks you are the best one in his department.
Irene : No, it's nothing like that . That is, Mr Green , what kind of office worker would have a better salary than me? I am pretty sure nobody here gets more money than me except the company manager. Besides, my boss Mr Smith is such a nice person to work for .
Mr Green： Well , it doesn't matter if you don't get along with your boss very well. You have another problem now. It looks like I will have to be in charge of our new employee soon because she wants to quit her present job and come here.
Irene : Yes, that is true . She said she didn't like the working environment at her present place so much. But Mr Green, can you give me some advice? When I try to persuade my boss for a pay rise , it seems to be very difficult. It makes me feel frustrated sometimes .
Mr Green: Oh ! Yes, I know what you mean. Let's talk about it later , Irene! We need more time to discuss all the problems and solutions.

Ms . Chen : Mr . Green, you didn’t say a word when I told you how my boss behaved himself. Didn't you think he was so rude to me?
