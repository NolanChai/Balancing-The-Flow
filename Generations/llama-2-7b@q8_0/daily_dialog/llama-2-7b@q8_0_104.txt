" Yes , I guess so ... But I need someone who could look after my son while I'm at work."

" May be you should return to your country and take care of him yourself ."

"I can't do that. I have a job, and it is not easy for me to give it up . "

"You should try and make time to go home , you don't have to live apart from your son !"

" You have no idea how difficult my schedule is .... It would take me days to explain everything to you ... "

" Don't be so negative ! I am sure there are a lot of families who would love to look after your son."

"Maybe. But I don't want just anyone to raise him ."

" I don't know what to say, but I hope we can still be friends ...... "
