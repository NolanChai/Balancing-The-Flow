" Sorry mate , gotta go . "

The guy didn't seem to take it personally. He walked off and I headed back into the train station where the bus would be leaving from .
I had forgotten my camera on the bus when we went around the town a few weeks ago so I was trying to decide if i should try and catch up with the group again or get some snaps of the place by myself.
I decided to go it alone and take a quick walk through the city, and maybe buy a few things at the market stalls on my way back to the bus stop.
So I went out into the street , taking a few photos as I walked along .
A few hours later i was sitting at the bus stop drinking beers , when i suddenly heard some familiar voices behind me. It was them again!
I turned around and there they were ! They had followed me back to the bus station and waited for me until i arrived. They also brought a few others with them . A few more friends who they invited along.
After a quick chat we all sat down at an outdoor bar together and had some beers and dinner. We ended up having another 8 beers between us and then headed back to the hostel where i stayed that night. It was great fun ! I met such a nice group of guys .
The next day they were going on a tourist boat cruise and invited me along as well. It was fantastic. There were so many beautiful buildings everywhere we looked , from every angle there was something to see. The river cruise lasted around 2 hours and the guide gave us some history about the city . I didn't have much time to take any photos because i wanted to enjoy the experience, but i managed a couple of snaps with my phone as we floated down the canals.
After the boat tour was finished we all headed back to the hostel again and had another beer before parting ways for the night. I never heard from them again , but it's funny because they left me with such a good feeling that i always think about my time there whenever i need some inspiration .

" No , thanks , really . "

" But it is so cheap , I can't believe how much they charge us for these things in the States. "

" Yeah, that sucks . "

" So anyway , my friend , you don't smoke weed ? "

" Nope . "

" Why not ? "

" It does nothing to me ! I mean , it just makes me feel stupid and lazy ! "

" Oh yeah ? "

" Yep ! You know , after smoking a few joints , you start to think that everything around you is soooo funny . So you can't stop laughing and the more you smoke weed, the higher you get until finally your mind just stops thinking altogether . And then , like you are floating or something ! I mean , it is kind of cool at first but after a few joints, I start to feel stupid and lazy ! "

" Oh yeah ? "

" Yep ! You know , when I am high on weed , all I want to do is lay on the bed and watch some TV or just sit in front of my computer . It gets boring after a few hours but it takes forever for me to get up off the couch to go do something productive, like play sports or go out and meet people ! "

" Yeah , I understand what you mean . "

" Oh , so your girlfriend does smoke weed ? "

" Nope , she doesn't . "

" Ahh . "

" But you know some one who does ? "

" Yeah , my sister smokes a lot of weed and it is starting to get on my nerves ! I mean , every day when I come home from work, I just want to kick back and relax but she is always sitting there on the couch , babbling on about what happened in class or how much she hates her teacher . It gets so annoying sometimes that I feel like smashing some one in the head ! "

" I know what you mean . "

" You don't smoke weed do you ? "

" Nope , never ever have and probably never will ! "

" So why are you asking me all these questions about it ? "

" Oh , nothing really . "

" Come on man ! I know what you want to ask ! "

" Nope ! You don't ! "

" Why do they call it weed or pot ? "

" What difference does that make ? "

" None at all but the other day , when my friend was telling me about how much money he made selling marijuana to kids in school, I asked him why he called it marijuana and not just plain weed . He said that nobody knows why they started calling it weed or pot back in the days but apparently it is a name from the past that stuck ! "

" Really ? "

" Yeah , and so far, no one has ever told me what the true origin of these words are ! You know , I mean like where did marijuana come from ? "

" Huh , well I have never heard any of this before . "

" So anyway , what do you think weed is ? "

" I don't know . "

" Do you mean to say that it doesn't exist at all and people just smoke some kind of herbs and call them marijuana ? "

" Well , I guess so . "

" Ok man ! Enough talking about this bullshit ! We should get outta here and go somewhere else for a drink ! "

" Ok , sure . "

And then after all that talk , we got up to leave but before leaving the bar, my friend decided it would be funny if he could make me laugh so he took an empty water bottle off the shelf behind us and filled it with some kind of liquid that stunk like rotten eggs . When I saw him holding this thing in his hand , I knew what he was going to do but I couldn't stop laughing as soon as he threw it into my face !

" Hahaha ! Oh man, you are so funny ! "

And then after a few minutes of joking around with me, we left the bar and went for a drink at one of those outdoor pubs on the main square in town .

" You’re so generous ! "

" So whatcha say, man ? "

" Thanks , but no thanks . "

" You don’t know what you are missing out on, brother . "

" No , I really do not need any drugs at the moment . "

" Alright, cool ! If you ever change your mind just let me know . "

" I will definitely keep that in mind . "

" Some weed ! "

" I like it when a lady speaks her mind ! But I guess you got to do your share as well right ? "

" So you smoke weed then ? "

" Occasionally yes , but not that often . "

" Well what about the blow and acid ? "

" Nope . Never used them . "

" And what ’ s the matter with you , I thought all the young people smoked pot these days ! You don ’ t even look old enough to have a driver ’ s license ! How old are you ? "

" Nineteen and half . "

" Oh sorry about that . So how old are you then ? "

" Twenty one , why do you ask ? "

" Well I don ’ t know . Is there something wrong with it ? "

" No not at all . "

" Well , I am only twenty six , but my friend wants to try some blow so can you help us out ? "

" Sure ! What are your names ? "

" John and Bill . "

" Ok , follow me into the back room of this car wash and we will get started . "

" I guess I could use a shower first though . "

" Come on John , we don ’ t have all day ! "

*

" What is that ? "

" This is the blow ! It should last us through two to three good sessions if you dose it properly . "

" And how many times will I need to smoke this stuff before my head will stop spinning and I can finally get some sleep again ? "

" Don ’ t know man , but at least a few hours . "

*

" Damn , that is the worst trip in the world ! "

*

" Bill, what are you doing ? "

" Nothing dude . "

" Well why do I feel like someone just punched me right in the gut ? "

" Probably because they did . "

" What ? Come on , you gotta be kidding ! Who would try to beat up a guy that is already tripping hard off of some blow ? "

*

" Man I think we are going to die here in the forest somewhere if this trip doesn ’ t get over with soon . "

" We need to find water fast Bill . "

*

" There it is ! That tree right over there has a stream running underneath it . Let ’ s check it out . "

*

" I guess the only thing left for us to do now is to get drunk and pass out so we can wake up in the morning when this trip is finally over with . "

*

" Dude ! That was totally awesome ! You really had me going there for a while ! "

" Thanks man . I didn ’ t expect it to affect you quite like that either . "

" Yeah , well my girlfriend and I used some weed this afternoon so maybe that is why I reacted even worse than usual . "

*

" That was one hell of a trip Bill ! Let ’ s do it again sometime soon huh ? "

" Sure thing , but next time let ’ s try and find an indoor spot to trip in though , this shit gets cold fast out here ! "
