What the hell do you think i want to smoke ? Cigarettes? 

 No, man! I'm not a smoker . I wanna smoke pot ! 

 It is my passion. I love it so much that I would be willing to share half of my life with it , if i could only get it . 

 Then you must have some too right ? 

 No ! 

 But why? Why don't you want to buy pot from me when you say you want to smoke it and like it so much? 

 Because I can't afford it, man. 

 What do you mean "you can't afford it"? You must be lying . What is your average income ? 

 Ummm $600 a month. 

 Shit ! That is more than enough to buy some weed dude! It does not even make any sense that you say you want to smoke pot but don't wanna buy it . I mean, do you have some other source for your supply ? 

 No , man . I only get some on very rare occasions and the price is always outrageously high. That's why i try to keep myself away from smoking until then. 

 But that doesn't make any sense ! Why don't you just grow your own then? You can easily set up a small scale home growing kit with $100 or so . 

 I don't think i could do it man . The thought of keeping plants in my house makes me nervous. 

 You are not very serious about it if you can't even take care of some little plant, right ? 

 Yeah , but the thing is , when they start growing and giving those nice big fat buds i just don't think i can handle them anymore . 

 You should really try man! It's so easy. And you know what else? You will be able to smoke a lot more pot for less money ! 

 I guess , but I still don't see why I have to go through the hassle of growing my own weed when i can get it from another guy for half price . 

 Why do you insist on not buying your weed? Are you worried about getting caught ? 

 No , that doesn't even cross my mind. I just don't like the idea of being in debt to somebody i hardly know and i definitely don't want to become a regular customer or something . That would ruin the fun of smoking weed . 

 Then you should grow your own man! It is so easy, just look at this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y5Jq2Bn8ZU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y5Jq2Bn8ZU</a> 

 No , i'm not gonna grow weed . 

 I really want you to be my friend and I don't know what else to do other than giving it away for free, just like this: <img src="https://scontent.flamg-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/16547855_269152352871487_715148866206490815_n.jpg?oh=0d2de7c3fdb5bafa3e0bfa3ae02ff3bb&oe=5A4FCC7E">

Not interested . 

 But it's OK if you want me to go on my own and pick up the weed for us.  

 Sure bro ! What ' s your address ? 

 1234 street, 1st floor , 3rd door from the left ! 

 No problem man . See ya at three in front of my house. 

 See you there then . 

 Bye , see ya later . 

 Hey , wait up ! What if I only want to buy a little and I don't do it on my own ?  

 How much would you need ? 

 About one gram . 

 OK. Here are five dollars for the weed, four hundred pesos for the blow . Now let me see your ID .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Um , sure but I don't smoke ! 

 You can inhale it , trust me man , it is amazing ! 

 So, are you ready ? 

 I guess so . 

 OK, let's go then !

Well , let ’ s say I want the weed but not the others . 

 Ok ! One ounce of pure chronic for free ! 

 Wow , thanks man ! How much is it ? 

 It will be $150 for the whole ounce . 

 I ’ ll give you $130 if that sounds good to you . 

 Cool , let ’ s go get it .

Ummm , let me think . 

 Hmmm , how about a few grams of weed . 

 Yo , man ! That’s like nothing ! I can get you one hundred pounds for that price ! 

 I am not really into weed . How much are the blow and acid ? 

 We got dope too ! Come on man ! Let ’ s make a deal ! 

 Okay , how about you give me three grams of coke , an eighth of mushroom , two hits of acid and one gram of ecstasy . I will also take some weed if that is no problem for you . 

 No problem ! What the hell , it ’ s just a few hits anyway . Let me go get my stuff . 

 We ’ ll do some more when we are back . Okay ?
