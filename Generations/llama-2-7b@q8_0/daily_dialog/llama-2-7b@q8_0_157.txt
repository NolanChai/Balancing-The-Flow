Oh my gosh ! What kind of place is this? 

 It's not very nice, but the price is right . How about paying now and signing the contract ? 

 All right. I ' ll sign it immediately . 

 Now , just a moment , I haven't yet seen my room ... 

 Well, you will have to see it in the morning as we are closing the hotel for the night . 

 It doesn't matter , I guess I 'll go out tonight and find another place. 

 Good idea! 

 Bye . 

 Bye .
