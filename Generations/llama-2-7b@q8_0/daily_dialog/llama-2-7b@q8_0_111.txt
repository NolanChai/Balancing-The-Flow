Because they have not given me a salary hike this year, and with all my expenses, it has become impossible for me to sustain myself anymore. 

 That's too bad , I wish you had come and told earlier . 

 I would have recommended you for another promotion instead of quitting the job ! 

 Now that you've quit the job can't we just continue as friends ? 

 No, it's better if we end all our personal relationship.

What do you mean by that ? 

 It means it's not worthwhile doing a thing unless one considers all its consequences. 

 Is there any other reason? 

 I donâ€™t like the working atmosphere here. 

 You are the boss , so if you want to change something, just do that . 

 We must be careful before taking major decisions as they affect our future and careers.
