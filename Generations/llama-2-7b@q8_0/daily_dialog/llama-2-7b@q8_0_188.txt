" I don't speak very well . "

" Thank you for your compliment. "

" Don't mention it . "

" That means, 'you are welcome'. "

" Do you know how to write Chinese ? "

" I can write but I can not read it . "

" You are very good at English. "

" You flatter me ! "

" It is a compliment . "

" I hope you don't think of me as being rude . "

" Not at all , why do you say that ? "

" I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression . "

" How can you possibly give someone the wrong impression ? "

" It is very simple, it means I don't like them . "

" Can I tell him how beautiful he is ? "

" Yes , but I wouldn't say that to a complete stranger . "

" A month or so now . "

" What do you think of it here? "

" Oh , I like it very much . "

" You speak English just as well as an American. "

" I'm glad you don't think me a foreigner because I have been in this country for many years ! "

" Oh , no ! "

" How long will you stay here? "

" We shall leave shortly after Christmas . "

" Where are you going next ? "

" I don't know yet . "

" Oh, you have a secret plan. "

" Yes , she is here at home . "

" Do you like it here ? "

" Yes ! It's a beautiful country . "

" What do you think of the people ? "

" They are very nice. "

" I heard that most Americans don 't speak English well. Is this true ? "

" Well , not all Americans learn to speak it in college . "

" But they must learn it some time. "

" Yes . Most people learn when they go to school and when they are young . "

" I learned when I was very young. My parents taught me at home. "

" What about you ? Did your parents teach you English? "

" No , they didn 't . My father is from Japan and my mother is from Taiwan . They don't speak any English. But they bought me an English book when I was a child and that helped me learn to speak the language. "

" So you learned before going to college ? "

" Yes , but in high school I began to study very hard so I could pass my English examination . "

" That 's good, Brian! You can pass an American examination for English ! Now let me ask you a question. Are there any foreign students here at the University of Maryland ? "

" Yes , there are. There is one from Japan and another from Korea and still another from India . They all speak very well too. I 've been to their homes and they also studied hard in college so they could pass their English exams and come here to study. "

" How do you think foreign students feel when they come to the United States ? "

" Sometimes they miss home very much . But as time goes by, most of them forget all about their homes and begin to like America. "

" That 's good ! I hope so. Now let me ask you a question. How many foreign students are there in this school? "

" There are over 10,000 . This is one of the largest Universities in the country with people from all parts of the world. "

" Do you think it's better to study abroad or at home ? "

" That depends on each person. I like studying here because there are many opportunities for foreign students to meet and mix with Americans. But if you want to learn a language, then I think you should study in your own country where you will have more opportunities to use it. "

" No , it is my first time . "

" Where are you going next ? "

" Las Vegas . "

" Do you have a good trip so far ? "

" It has been very good. We just arrived last night and we are already on our way to the next stop . "

" What part of Japan did your wife live in? "

" She is from Tokyo . "

" Oh, I was just there last month . Is it nice ? "

" Yes , very much so. We also went to Kyoto and Osaka . "

" How many days were you in each place ? "

" Three days in Tokyo . 3 days in Kyoto , 2 days in Osaka . "

" I saw a Japanese movie once. It was about samurai, warriors who fought on horseback. What do you think of that? "

" That is correct, sir. They were called " samurais " or " bushi ". There were many famous stories told about them and even today they are still very popular in Japan . You can read books about them as well as watch movies. I believe there will be another movie about samurai coming out next year. It is called " The Last Samurai" . 

" Oh , really? Can you tell me anything about it ? "

" Yes, it is a story that takes place in the last days of feudal Japan . The main character, a white American soldier who was stationed in Japan, becomes a samurai to protect his Japanese wife and her family. The movie will be produced by Tom Cruise , so I guess it should be pretty interesting."

" I bet you have seen many Japanese movies or TV programs about samurais. What do you think of the way they dress? Do they really wear such heavy armor? "

" It depends on which part of Japan the story is set in. If the story takes place in Kyoto , for example, they would not wear as much armor because it was a relatively peaceful time there. But if the story takes place during a war, then yes, they did wear heavy armor and had very big swords. The sword that they use is called a " katana ". It is a Japanese sword. I think you have also seen pictures of samurais carrying long spears. They call them " naginata ". In the movies you see many scenes where the warriors are fighting on horseback. They are very famous, because the horses were beautifully trained to fight in battles. One last thing , Japanese people think that samurai is a bad guy ."

" Why?  "

" I don't know why they think this way, but that's how it is. Samurais are considered good guys because they protected their families and loved their country. But when the Japanese lost in WWII , many people were afraid to mention the word ' samurai '. It has a negative image . "

" I see . Do you think this new movie will help change that ? "

" Yes, maybe so . In America , there was once a popular TV show called " The Lone Ranger ". He was always trying to save innocent people in trouble. This is similar to the samurais protecting their families and loved ones."

" What do you think about that?  "

" That's OK, sir . But I can tell you this: we are not going to see any samurai fighting on horseback ! They will probably only use swords or long spears. The horses would be too expensive and there is no place to train them for battles."

" Oh , really? Are there still many warriors in Japan now ? "

" No, sir . I think the last samurai died around 1950 when the American occupation army was still here. At that time, Japanese people were afraid of samurais and did not want to talk about them. That's why they made the decision to stop using swords . It would have been hard to change their minds once warriors started appearing on TV again ."

" How long ago did you arrive in America? "

" 1985, sir. I came from Tokyo , Japan."

"I see. How is your English now? Are you able to read English books and newspapers? "

" Yes, I can do that . But it depends on what the story is about, because if the book or newspaper article is too difficult for me to understand then I can't understand much of it."

" How long did you study English in college ?  "

" I studied for 4 years at Tokyo University . After graduation I became a translator and now I work part time at an electronics store. I enjoy speaking with people who come into the store."

"Do you like to talk to visitors from other countries? "

" Yes, sir , but not all of them can understand Japanese very well because they are not used to it yet . It's a challenge for me to speak English and help them in some way. But I enjoy it too because when we communicate with each other, our knowledge increases."

"How do you feel about America?  "

"I like it here. The people are friendly and they make good things. American products are better than Japanese ones so Americans can get more money for what they make . "

"Do you have a favorite American TV show ? "

"Yes , I like the 'Star Trek' series very much . It was made in America but it shows how life is on another planet called ' Earth '. I think everyone should learn about other countries because we live together here on this earth . If people understand each other then there will be no war. "

"What do you know about World War II ?  "

"I remember that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii . Then America fought with Japan until they surrendered to us."

"How did Japan win the war? What weapons did they use?"

"Japan used a special weapon called the ' kamikaze '. This was an airplane flown by young men who wanted to die for their country. The plane would crash into an enemy ship and explode . It was very effective in stopping American ships from getting supplies during wartime."

"What do you think of the Japanese food? Is it different than what Americans eat?"

"Yes, sir . There are many things that I like about Japanese cooking. But sometimes when they add too much salt or soy sauce , then it tastes bad to me because my stomach gets sick from eating them."

" How is your wife doing in Japan ?  "

"She is fine . She has been learning English for a long time and I think she will be able to speak better soon. I am very proud of her."

"What kind of things do you like about America? "

"I enjoy meeting new people because they have different ideas than what we do in Japan."

"Have you ever been outside your home country ?  "

" Yes, sir . I went to Mexico when I was in college and I had a great time there. They are very nice people so it was easy for me to make friends with them."

"What do you think of the weather here? Is it different than what you're used to?"

"Yes, sir . I like summer because it is warm outside but winter can be very cold if we don't have enough clothes on or heat inside our house. But even though we have some problems with cold weather , it's still better here than in Tokyo where they have snow every year."

"How did you get your American citizenship?  "

"I married an American woman and she helped me to become a citizen because I am not from this country originally so I had to apply for it myself. Now that I have my passport , I can go wherever I want whenever I want . It's nice being able to travel around America without any problems."

"How long did it take you to learn English?  "

"It took me about 6 years but now I am speaking pretty well because I studied at college for two more years before coming here. That helped a lot with my pronunciation and vocabulary skills . But even though I can understand most things people say, sometimes they talk so fast that it's hard for me to catch what they are saying."

"What do you like about being in America?  "

"I like the freedom here. There aren't any restrictions on what we can or cannot do . You can walk around anywhere at night without worrying about getting attacked by someone who might want your money. The government doesn't try to control everything either."

"What did you study in college?  "

"I studied business management at a university and then I got a job with an electronics company after graduation because my degree was good for that kind of work . Now I am working part time here while also studying English online so that way I can improve my vocabulary skills."

" No . My parents used to live in New York. They moved back when my dad was offered a good job, and I decided that I wanted to come out here for a change. The U S is very different from Japan."

"I guess I'll need to study some more English."
