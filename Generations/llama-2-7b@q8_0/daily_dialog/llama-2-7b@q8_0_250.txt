Miao Ping said goodbye to her friend. Then she went into the car of her husband and said  to him, "It turns out that they can borrow money from their bank accounts at any time."
"Yes, that is true," said Zhou Yan. " But it's not a free loan . The interest rate is high . Moreover, they must return all the loans within one month after the end of each quarter ."
"But what if you have more money in your account than needed for the loan ? You can lend some money to other people and earn extra interest ! " Miao Ping was very excited. " I think that would be a very good idea."

"So how much do we owe this month ? " Zhou Yan asked his wife, as he opened the bill from their bank.

"Fifteen thousand yuan . We still have more than thirty thousand left in our current account. I think we should be fine for now."

"Let me tell you something else , Miao Ping. The interest on the 20th of each month is settled at quarter-end. It also needs to be paid off when you close your bank account . "

" Miao Ping, in your opinion, should we open a Type A or a Type B Account ? "

" Well, the Type B account has many restrictions. If you want to use it in the same way as you do with your current account , I think the Type A account is best for you."

"Thank you very much. We'll have more time to talk about this later." Miao Ping said goodbye and then got into her husband's car. She then told him, "It turns out that they can borrow money from their accounts at any time."

"Yes, that is true," Zhou Yan said. " But the interest rate is quite high. They must return all loans within one month after quarter-end."

"But what if you have more money than you need in your account ? Then you can borrow some money from others and make extra profit!" Miao Ping was very excited. "I think it's a good idea to do that ! "
