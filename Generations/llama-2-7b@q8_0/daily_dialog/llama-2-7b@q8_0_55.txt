" Well , I think there is something to be learned from that. "

" Do you ? "

" Of course . In a way it’s true about me and my brother . I like to hear what other people are doing and thinking about. It ’ s the only way you learn anything or find out what’s going on in the world. That’s why I’m always asking questions . "

"What else do they say ? "

" They say, “ He thinks too much. ” I wonder what that means ? "

" Maybe it means you spend a lot of time alone with your own thoughts. "

" No , it must mean something else . It can ’ t be good to think too much because thinking is how we solve problems and find the answers to our questions . And besides, I don’t really think about things that much – not all the time anyway. Sometimes my brain just won’t stop thinking , but I try to shut it off. "

" Maybe it means you’re worried about too many things . "

"Yes . They say I worry a lot, and maybe they ’ re right. But when I find out something is wrong I have to do everything in my power to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I try to be the kind of person who does what she can to fix whatever needs fixing. "

"I guess that’s why you get so involved with other people ’ s problems . "

" Maybe . "

"You should listen to your brother ’ s advice. He said if someone doesn’t want to be bothered , they won ’ t answer a question or tell you anything about their life . "

"I know he’s right, but I can’t stop myself. Sometimes it feels like something is chasing after me and all I can do is run as fast as I can away from the problem that needs solving . "

"That sounds scary . Maybe you need to take a step back and look at what’s going on around you. It ’ s not easy, but it will make things easier for you if you try."

"I don ’ t think so. I have to do something about these problems right away or else they get worse and no one wins except the people who caused them in the first place . "

"Yes , but sometimes we just have to let things go . There are times when it’s better not to worry too much about things that don ’ t concern us."

"I can see how you would think that. But what if there is someone out there who needs me ? What if I could help them by being the kind of person they need me to be ? "

"Well, then maybe it’s time for a change . Maybe it ’ s time for new ideas and new ways of doing things."

"Yes , maybe so. Maybe that’s what my brother meant when he said I have too much on my mind – not in the sense that I don’t think enough about how others are feeling or what they need, but instead because I can ’ t stop thinking about how we might be able to solve these problems once and for all."

"Do you want me to ask your brother if he has anything else on his mind ? "

"No , please don ’ t . It’s better this way. But thank you anyway."

"It’s my pleasure, sweetheart. I love you very much ! "
