Well, why don't we go up to Lake Placid instead? We could ski and maybe go ice fishing!

 OK. I guess it wouldn't cost too much more to get up there than Europe . 

 I'll make the reservations on the way home today then .

how are you feeling today ? Did your headache go away ? 

 yes, it was awful last night , but I think my sleep deprivation finally caught up with me and wore off this morning . It's gone now. 

 that's a relief . Do you have any plans for the weekend ? 

 I don't know yet . Maybe I can go to the museum on Saturday. 

 oh, that would be great ! Did you see the new exhibit they put up in the Asian art wing last week? It's so beautiful ! I want to go back again soon . 

 maybe we could spend the afternoon looking at it together ? 

 how about it ? 

 sure . That sounds great.
