Well , the best thing is that I have no idea how to do that and it might take me years to get better at it . 

 Well , don't worry madam ! You can come here as often as you need until you are in shape again . 

 Oh , thank you so much . That sounds great .

Then we will help you with a nutrition plan . 

 And then we can train you in the gym . 

 Fantastic ! I am very happy with this plan . What is the price ? 

 Well , our plans are based on two basic components. Firstly , you pay for the time that the trainer spends in your gym . Secondly , you have to buy a package of food for yourself and prepare meals at home . 

Okay. That makes perfect sense . How much would all this cost ? 

Well , I can provide you with the details if you give me a few minutes to explain how our program works . Would that be convenient ? 

 Thank you very much for your help . Sure , tell me more about it and I will let you know whether I want to go ahead or not .

Do I have to go to any special place ? 

 You can do it in your home or at one of our gyms , whichever you prefer . 

 OK . Then how much will it cost me ? 

 We offer a free trial with no obligation for a week so that you'll have an idea of what we are offering and then decide if it is worth the money or not . 

 I guess I want to see what your gyms look like before making any decision , sir .

 Of course you can visit our gym first . If after that you decide to sign up with us , then you have nothing to lose since we offer a free trial for one week . 

 Thank you very much . Have a nice day .

I see . How about your fees ? 

 Our fees are reasonable , considering we provide not just exercises but also give you custom-made plans for your health needs and even have qualified trainers to teach you how to do things . 

 Thank you very much . And one last question : Can I try before making any commitment ? 

 We sure can . Come by the gym next week and we'll show you all our facilities . You could take a tour of the place , meet some clients who have been using our services and even get in touch with your personal trainer for an assessment . Then after that , decide whether to sign up or not .

For how much are you charging ? 

 Well , we have special offers now ongoing . The current rate is $350 per month for the first year of membership . 

 What's that all about ? 

 Oh, you can save almost $200 if you decide to pay in full and then apply our current offer. We will give you a free fitness assessment and half an hour training session on joining . 

 I think it's a pretty good deal . Thanks for your help . 

 You're welcome , madam .
