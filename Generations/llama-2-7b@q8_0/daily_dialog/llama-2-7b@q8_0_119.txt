" Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How about Radio City Music Hall ? "

" That sounds good . Let's go there."

" Great ! What time do you want to get in line for the tickets ? "

" I guess at ten o'clock would be fine."

" Ten o'clock it is then. I'll pick you up at nine-thirty, OK? "

" Sure . "

" How much time do you need to get there from here , anyway ? "

" Well ... about a half hour."

" Half an hour ! I thought the subway went straight there . "

" It does. But we've got to walk across town first, because this is Brooklyn and the trains don't run yet in the morning."

" Oh , OK ... I guess that makes sense."

" Sure does . See you later !"

After replying his/her mail, I went online again and found your post about the new vocabulary you learnt today on this forum. I like it so much and wish to ask for your permission to copy some sentences into a book which is written by our English teacher as a part of our English homework. I will not use any word from the article, just use a few phrases from them, but with your permission I can add your name to the list of authors so that it can be seen who wrote which sentence in the book.

> Would you mind if I did this? If you're OK with my doing so then I will copy the sentences immediately. I have no intention to use them on other sites and I assure you they won't appear anywhere else except on this forum or my homework book. I hope that doesn't bother you too much, if it does please let me know ASAP because the deadline for our English homework is next week.
