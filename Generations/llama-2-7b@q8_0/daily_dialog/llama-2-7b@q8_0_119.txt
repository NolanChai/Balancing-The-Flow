You know, there are so many things to see and do here. First of all, you could visit the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. In my opinion, it would be a great experience to climb up to the observation deck atop the Empire State Building because then you will get an amazing view over Manhattan . And I don't know if you have already heard about it but New York is also home to the Rockefeller Center , and its ice-skating rink there, for example. Or do you rather want to go shopping?

 Well , yes , that might be fun , too. 

 There are so many malls here in New York . You can buy everything in those stores. But I would recommend going to the Times Square area because it is really something special there . In my opinion, you have to visit the Macy's at least once because they offer a unique Christmas experience every year. It is definitely worth experiencing yourself.

 What time of the year do you plan to visit New York ? 

 That depends on whether I get a chance to go in July or December . If I can, I will go for sure ! I'm not sure yet , though.

 Have you already been to New York ? 

 No, this is my first time here . I am really excited about the city and about visiting New York during Christmas because that has always fascinated me ever since I was a child. I also think it will be nice if we could celebrate Christmas together here in New York ! What do you think? 

 Well , that's an idea . Maybe this is something to discuss later on , though, after my return from Florida . But when are you going there ? 

 That would actually depend on how long I stay here. I donâ€™t know yet whether I can leave New York by the end of December. There are so many people that want to go shopping around Christmas time because then you're able to get great discounts at most stores in New York . If everything goes according to plan, maybe we could see each other on 24th December and spend the holidays together? What do you think about that?

 I would love that !

You need to get out and see more than just museums . 

 You must be kidding ! What else is there in New York ? 

 There are lots of things to do . Have you been to the Central Park yet ? 

 I have no time for that kind of stuff . 

 I think you'd really like it . You don't even know what it is . 

 I know exactly what it is ! It's boring ! 

 Why , because you've been to the park once ? 

 Oh , yeah . And that was enough for me . 

 Oh , you were a kid when you went there. Now you should see Central Park again . You have to see it at night . It looks great at night ! 

 I don't believe it can look any different at night than during the day . 

 But that's what you have to do . You need to see things differently if you want to get anything out of them . 

 You're just wasting my time with all your talk , aren't you ? I don't see why I should bother going to Central Park again at night ! 

 You may regret it later . But don't say that you haven't been warned . 

 Why did you come here if all you want to do is criticize everything ? 

 I came because you're a friend of mine and because we used to be close friends in the past . 

 You still are . You just don't show it any more . 

 It seems that you've changed too much for me. And not only your attitude toward life . Your body has also been through some changes . I can see them in the way you dress and in the way you act . 

 What do you mean by "the way I act" ? I still behave exactly the same as I always did ! 

 No , that's not true at all . You used to be much more open and friendly than you are now . You used to have a big heart for those who were less fortunate than yourself. Now your attitude is one of total indifference . You just don't care any more . 

 I do ! And I care about people who are less fortunate than me . But not about the ones who keep whining and complaining all day long . 

 They may complain a lot , but at least they know how to be grateful when someone takes an interest in them . You've also changed like that . All you do is criticize everything and everyone ! 

 I only say what I think . And the truth is often very harsh . People need to face the truth if they want to change something about themselves. They can't be happy until they accept the things they don't like in their own personality , including you . You're always right and everybody else is wrong ! 

 I may sound harsh at times but that doesn't mean I'm right all the time . Sometimes , you too are right . And it would be a good thing for us to acknowledge this fact from time to time . But you can't do it because you're too stubborn and closed-minded to see the truth about anything or anybody except yourself. 

 I don't want to talk about myself any more ! I just want to tell you that you shouldn't be so hard on other people . They have feelings too , you know . You really hurt me when you said those things yesterday . 

 Of course it was harsh of me and I apologize for that , but at least now you understand how I feel about the changes in your personality over the years . If you don't like what I say about other people then maybe you should talk to them directly instead of going through me ! 

 You can't just go around telling everyone else what they should do without getting some feedback yourself ! That would be unbelievably selfish ! So , if there is something on your mind , tell me ! I'm willing to listen and understand . 

 That was very kind of you to say that. But you still have a lot to learn about the way people behave when they feel criticized and judged by others . You need to give them some space first instead of just throwing everything at them all at once ! I know how it feels because you've done it many times to me in the past . 

 Maybe so , but not always with the intent of hurting someone else . Sometimes we criticize people simply out of anger . It doesn't mean that we don't care about what they have to say or feel about themselves ! If you'd just listen to me and let me talk a little longer than usual I might be able to explain things better . 

 Yes , I think it would help if you did because as long as you continue to criticize other people there is no way for us to get back together again . It won't work unless we can learn from each other and understand each other. Otherwise , nothing will ever change between us !
