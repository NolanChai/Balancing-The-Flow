Well , when kids use computers and then try to write a sentence , their spelling is terrible ! 

 And they can't make up stories , or solve puzzles ... 

 Well , I guess that kids just need to learn how to think first . They should do things like drawing pictures before using the computer. 

 But what about computers in schools ? 

 That's a good question . We have computersin our school and we're making great use of them ! Our teachers are very skillful with computers , and they're teaching kids how to think and write at the same time , so it's a perfect solution for me .
