" I disagree . Computers take a lot of time , we must keep children busy with important things , like learning to read or write ."

" But you don't understand computers can be used as teaching materials , the programmes are very well structured and logicaly designed that they make our children think what they have learnt and even teach them more about the subjects ."

" I still insist on my point of view . Kids learn best with a teacher because they don't understand how to use computers properly , it's too complicated for their young mind ."

"I do believe that using computer is good for learning and also teaches children how to think logically. Computers have many benefits. Computers are not the reason why children cannot spell, add or subtract well because these things are not taught in schools. Even if we don't use computers there will still be people who can spell better than others.
Computer can be used as teaching materials for learning a certain subject, it can help to explain difficult concepts and make learning process easier."
