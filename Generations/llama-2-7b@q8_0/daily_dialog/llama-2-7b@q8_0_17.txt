I'm sorry, but we don't have orange juice smoothies.

Oh that's OK.

May I recommend some other drink instead?

That'd be great thanks.

Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry , we have a small stock of it left in our restaurant . It’s been quite popular with the customers who know about it. We don’t know how long we will be able to hold on to it. 

 Please do order them while you can ! We only serve caterpillar fungus for dinner , not lunch. We have a large supply of it stored in our restaurant's walk-in refrigerator . 

 Well , I think we will go with the smoothies and yogurt then, since it sounds like you don’t know how long they will be available. 

Okay! Great ! 

Do you have any other questions? We would be happy to help you in anyway that we can . Thank you for coming !
