" Hey , I know you were not aware of this trip before I invited your buddy . I figured since you have gone hunting with him in the past and he is an outdoorsman like yourself ... "

" Sorry ! We'll work it out. "

" Well , you said you didn't want me to come hunting with you and now you are telling me we can't go anywhere together for vacation . Is this the way things are going to be between us ? "

" Yes ! "
