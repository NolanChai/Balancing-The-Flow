Hunting ?! What would you do there?!

I'm not sure, but I bet the scenery is great.  In addition to the scenery it has lots of wild animals and fresh air.  I don't think that those things are bad.  What kinds of places do you like to go on vacation ?

I really like going out west , to Arizona . It is a very scenic state with beautiful mountains, deserts , and forests.  You can even see the Grand Canyon there. I bet it is even more beautiful than Alaska !

Yes, but you know my feelings about hunting . 

 It is a healthy thing to do in the great outdoors , and I enjoy getting away from all the stress of work. 

 You're not going to change me so easily , John !

What do you mean ? I've been perfectly reasonable up until now . 

 Well , you are just too negative lately . We need to start being positive together . 

 How can we be positive when it is so clear that we aren't going on vacation together this year ! 

 Why do you say that ? You don't have the slightest clue what I am thinking . 

 I have been paying attention to everything you have said over the last two months and I can tell , without a doubt , that there is no way we are going on vacation together this year ! 

 What do you mean by that ? That's all you ever think about these days . You need to be more open-minded . 

 Look , I am not open minded enough to believe that we could actually go on vacation together again and be happy . We are just too different ! 

 You don't know what you are talking about ! 

 No , I think I do ! 

 I was hoping you would see my point of view . Maybe after our time apart , you will change your mind . 

 Well , that is the worst thing you could possibly say ! There is no way I am going to change my opinion about anything in this relationship and if we aren't going on vacation together , then that is something we have to deal with right now instead of waiting until later . 

 All right, that will be enough out of you for today. 

 Fine ! It sounds like your mind is made up anyway ! 

 Maybe it is . I can't help thinking about this all day and everyday and it is starting to wear me down . 

 You know , if we are going to spend the rest of our lives together , then we need to be able to trust each other and I don't think that is possible right now . 

 I have always been completely open with you and you treat me like a complete stranger ! 

 I am sorry that upsets you so much but it seems pretty obvious that you aren't going to change your mind anytime soon , so we need to talk about what our options are from here on out . 

 I think we should try some counseling and see how this relationship can be improved . 

 Now you are just being ridiculous ! Why do you want us to go to counseling ? You are the only one who has ever mentioned anything about trying to improve our relationship in any way . I am tired of listening to your negativity all day long and we need to talk about how serious this situation really is . 

 Yes , it is pretty serious if you ask me ! We have a problem and someone needs to do something about fixing this problem so we can move forward with our lives in peace instead of trying to figure out what the hell went wrong . 

 Well , I don't think there is anything really wrong except that we don't get along as well as we used to . 

 Maybe you are right , maybe we need counseling but if we aren't going on vacation together this year then things may never be the same again and you will have to deal with the fact that I am not going to change my mind about anything ever ! 

 This is ridiculous . We have been through so much together in our lives already , how can it be true that we are not going on vacation together this year ? What has happened between us that makes you think something like that will happen ? 

 You know I don't really understand what is wrong with me but since we were both children , I have always been negative and pessimistic about everything . Now I am in a situation where my life depends on our relationship so I need to change the way I think and try to be more positive about things in order to get through this crisis together . 

 You can't possibly expect me to go along with that ! We are going to have a hard time even dealing with the fact that we aren't going on vacation together because of your negativity alone , let alone trying to change how I think and feel about anything else in our relationship right now . 

 Maybe you need some counseling as well so we can talk things through together instead of me just sitting back here listening to all your nonsense every single day ! 

 Now you are the one being ridiculous ! You need help because you don't understand why I am negative and pessimistic about everything in our relationship but I have been trying to tell you for months now that there is something wrong with me . 

 Maybe , maybe not . Maybe it doesn't matter what we think , if nothing else changes between us then nothing will ever change back again because of the way things are going right now ! 

 You know , I am tired of this conversation too , so why don't you just go ahead and tell me how serious this situation is right now ? 

 Fine ! I need to talk with someone about what we should do from here on out because it seems pretty obvious that nothing else will ever change between us unless we do something about the fact that we aren't going on vacation together . 

 We already know how serious this situation is . There isn't anything left for me to say and you don't have any more time to waste listening to me so please go ahead and tell me what your plans are now because I am really starting to get tired of all the negativity coming from you lately . 

 Okay , fine ! You want to talk about what our options are right now then let's just start by telling each other that we don't have any other choice than to go ahead and try some counseling together so we can figure out how serious this situation really is and what needs to be done in order for things to get better between us . 

 I think it would be best if you started off with a few questions first , so let me just ask one of them now before we continue on any further . How do you think counseling will help us deal with this problem ? 

 We need to talk about how serious things really are between us because our relationship is at stake here . 

 No , that's not what I meant ! I was just asking for clarification . If we are going to start seeing a therapist then it would probably be best if you told me exactly why we need one in the first place . 

 The whole point of counseling is so we can talk about our problems without interruption or judgment , which means that I need to know what kinds of things should be discussed during each session beforehand . 

 All right then , let's just start by talking about how serious this situation really is and then maybe later on down the road after we have talked through everything together you can decide whether or not it was worthwhile for us to go ahead and try counseling in order to fix whatever problems may arise between us . 

 I don't know if it would be wise for us to just start talking about how serious things really are without first discussing what our goals are at this point because there is a good chance that we could end up with more problems than solutions once everything has been said and done . 

 No , no ! Don't you get it yet ? I have already told you many times now that counseling isn't going to fix anything between us ! If you don't think there is a problem then why do we need to go ahead with this nonsense in the first place ? 

 There may not be any problems for either one of us right now but I am willing to bet that there will soon enough once things start getting worse between us . 

 You know , if you really wanted me to believe that counseling would work then all you need to do is tell me what your goals are at this point instead of telling me what mine should be because it seems pretty obvious by now how serious things really are between us ! 

 I don't care about your goals right now , I just want to know why we should start seeing a therapist so that both of us can finally talk about our problems without interruption or judgment . 

 If you really think it would help then maybe we could try talking things through together once every few days instead of trying to avoid all of this nonsense until one day we realize that nothing has changed between us . 

 Okay , fine ! We will talk about how serious everything is between us right now and see where that takes us . I don't want you to be afraid or anything because this isn't going anywhere good unless we both decide it is worthwhile for us to go ahead with counseling . 

 If things keep getting worse between us then maybe we should just talk about everything we have been keeping secret from each other instead of wasting time trying to avoid all of this nonsense until one day we realize nothing has changed between us . 

 What are you talking about ? It doesn't matter how serious the problem is , if nothing else changes between us then there will never be any way for either of us to fix things by ourselves ! 

 Maybe I should just go ahead and tell you now what kinds of things should be discussed during each session so we can move on with this conversation before anything gets worse between us . 

 All right , fine ! Let's talk about how serious everything really is between us because it seems pretty obvious that nothing else will ever change unless one or both of us finally decides it would be worthwhile for us to go ahead and try counsel
