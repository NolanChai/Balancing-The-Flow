" Of course ! And the whole world knows it . "

" What do you think they want from us ? "

" Well , it depends on what we have in our minds . If I were a UFO, then I would come and kidnap you to see how human beings work . But you are stupid and if I wanted that kind of entertainment, I could get better ones . "

" So do you think they exist ? "

" They probably do , but you don't need them to prove anything . "

" Do you want me to believe in UFOs ? "

" What is the point ? Belief is a bad thing , I know it from my past experiences, and I can assure you that there are many other things that will cause problems for us if we don't try to understand them . "

" You mean like religion ? "

" Yes , but only an idiot would call UFOs a religion ! They exist just as the moon exists . "

" But what do they want from us ? "

" It's too early to say that, and I can't tell you anything about it . "

" What if they come back ? "

" Do you think we should expect them to come again ? "

" Of course ! They might be our ancestors or the people who will come after us . "

" That is not what I meant , but now that you mentioned it, there are many things in this universe that need to be discovered . "

" Some of them . The ones from outer space are too far away but sometimes they come down here and I can see them flying across the sky . They go really fast ! And then ...they disappear . "

" That's a mystery . Why do they come to Earth ? "

" I don't know. Maybe because we have alien DNA so that we can communicate with other forms of life and maybe one day we will get in contact with the aliens from outer space . "

" Maybe yes, maybe not . There are too many mysteries for me to think about . But it is a great story ! "

" Well , I never really saw their face . They are small and green-skinned with big red eyes . And their ears are quite large as well . "

" That sounds awful . Have they done any harm to the people on Earth ? "

" No, they never did . "

" Is there anything you want me to tell about them ? "

" Just that they live in the house next door . "

" In the language of the aliens . "

" You can not understand each other ? "

" Yes and no ! We understand each other , but they don't understand us . They need my help because they have problems with our Earth . "

" What kind of problems ? "

" They are too sensitive to the sunlight , so they spend most of their time underground . But they like to go out on nights when it is cloudy and raining . "

" That means that they can not work or live during daytime in our Earth ? "

" It's difficult for them because the sunlight hurts their skin . They don't have any protection against it . "

" So , do you want to help them with something ? What do you think we should do to make a better life for these aliens ? "

" Well ... I think that we should build a tunnel underground from the ground of our Earth to their world . That way they can work and live on the surface without being hurt by the sunlight . "

" But there are a lot of people here who will disagree with your idea . "

" What do you mean ? They would be happy for the aliens . "

" There are many other things we could use that money for . "

" You're right , but I think it's important to help others even if it costs a lot of money . "
