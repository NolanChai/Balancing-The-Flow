" Oh, come on. "

" No . "

" I think it would be a nice idea if you both took some time off to get to know one another better and develop an understanding of each other ’ s likes and dislikes . "

" Are you crazy ? We don’t need that ! " Dick looked at his watch and said, "Look, I have got to be going now. It ’ s getting late."

The couple stood there, looking at one another, not knowing how to proceed from here. There was silence for a long time between them. They were both thinking the same thing, what on earth was going to happen next ? They couldn’t believe it !

" Hey , Dick . "

" What now ? "

" We ’ re going to be late for work . "

" Oh, right."

Dick said as he turned to leave.

" Goodbye. "

" Bye . "

Dick left the coffee shop, not knowing whether or not he would see her again. He had just gotten his coffee from the cashier when he saw her sitting there drinking hers. She smiled and said , "Good morning."

" Good morning. "

She didn ’ t sit down but asked him to join her for a second. When Dick sat, she said , "Thanks so much for taking care of me yesterday . "

" No problem at all . "

Dick smiled.

" I was just thinking we both are busy today and we hardly had any time for one another the other day . Why don ’ t you come over to my place tonight ? " She asked, with a big smile on her face.

Dick thought about it for a moment, then he said , "Well, I don ’ t really have anything special to do tomorrow night except hang out and watch TV . So that sounds great ! What time can you pick me up ? "

" How about 7:30 ? " She smiled again.

He nodded his head in agreement then stood up. He walked over to her side of the table, put his hand on top of hers and said , "I ’ ll see you tonight . "

She just kept looking at him as he left.

The next day passed by so quickly for Dick that he couldn ’ t believe it had already come 7:00PM and time for them to go out. He went over to her house, rang the bell and waited. There was no answer from within, not even a dog barked at him, which he found quite strange but he decided to wait until she came out anyways. Finally after waiting about 3 minutes, she opened the door and greeted him with a warm smile on her face , "Hello, Dick . "

" Hello."

He smiled back then followed her into the living room where there was already some light music playing in the background. They sat down on the sofa while they talked for about 10 minutes. It wasn ’ t until she asked him to take off his shoes that he realized how late it had gotten since he had arrived.

" Oh, man . " He said with a smile as he took them off and then threw them over by the doorway.

" You should relax more often , Dick ! " She laughed out loudly.

He looked at her from across the room and smiled back , "It ’ s nice to see you laugh like that . "

She replied with a big grin on her face, "I haven ’ t really done much of it lately but I promise to try harder ! "

" Well then, I guess we have nothing left to do now except watch some TV ? " He asked.

" I think that sounds like an excellent idea . " She replied cheerfully, while walking over towards the entertainment center in front of her sofa.

Dick sat down on the sofa, put his feet up and said with a smile , "I can ’ t believe how fast time flies by when you are having fun ! "

" It sure is ! And you know what else ? It seems like it ’ s going faster than ever these days . " She replied.

They sat there for about an hour talking and watching TV, when all of a sudden he got up from the sofa , came over to where she was standing and put his arm around her shoulder. He leaned in close to whisper something into her ear while smiling at her with those beautiful brown eyes which seemed to have captured her heart ever since that first time they had met.

Dick ’ s hand trailed down her back until it reached her bottom where he began kissing her neck softly. She was so surprised by his sudden act of affection , but then she couldn’t help but get caught up in the moment too because all she could think about right now was how much she wanted him to make love with her !

Dick ’ s hands moved lower until they were caressing between her legs, while he whispered into her ear some more things which made it even harder for her to resist his advances. He began unbuttoning her blouse before kissing every part of her body that he could reach without touching any sensitive areas !

Dick moved closer and pressed his lips against hers as they kissed passionately . Her hands found their way underneath his shirt, feeling the warmth of his skin through clothes which she wanted to rip off but knew better than to do so! Their tongues began dancing together while he continued fondling her breast with both hands until they were rock hard !

Dick pulled away from her kiss for a moment and said, "I love you !" as he moved his lips down to taste hers once more . His fingers began caressing between the folds of skin that protected her vagina before penetrating deep within.

He began making love with her so tenderly that it seemed like she was being carried away by a dream!

They continued to kiss passionately for some time until Dick finally pulled away from her lips, saying, "I ’ m going to go into the other room and get my boxers , okay ?"

Dick walked off in another direction without waiting for an answer . After a few minutes had passed by without his return, she said out loud , "What should I do now ? "

It was then when he came back with his pants in hand and smiled at her . Dick ’ s clothes were already removed before he entered the bedroom, where they had spent most of their time since arriving. He sat down on top of the covers while she got underneath him , so that she could kiss all over him again !

Dick began fondling between his wife’s legs until he felt her warmth begin to increase with every stroke ! He placed one hand against her chest and used it as leverage to penetrate deeper into her vagina .

As they continued making love , Dick couldn ’ t believe how much pleasure she gave him ! After an hour or two had passed by, he came inside of her so fast that the only thing left was a loud moan from deep within his throat!

He pulled away and looked into her eyes again with those beautiful brown ones while saying, "I love you too ." He smiled as she kissed him on top of his head once more before he rolled over onto his side of the bed !

Dick turned over towards his wife , who was still lying there looking at him. She said out loudly again, "What should I do now ? " And Dick replied with a smile .

He got up off the mattress and walked over to where she had been standing earlier on in this story . He picked her up by her hands , so that they could kiss one another again ! When he finally released his hold on her arms, she began caressing him all over as they kissed passionately once more !

Dick ’ s hands traveled down between their bodies until they found what had been missing since the beginning of this story . He began fondling her breasts while she kissed every part of his body that she could reach with her mouth !

After a few minutes, Dick pulled away from the kiss once more and said out loudly , "I love you too." But before he could say anything else about what was going on between them right then , she stopped him by saying softly .

" What should I do now ? " And this time he replied with a smile as they continued making love for hours upon end !

### 20. I Can ’ t Believe How Much We Have Learned About Each Other Since The Last Time We Made Love Together !

Dick and his wife were sitting there in bed , still making love after what seemed like ages ! They had learned so much about one another since the first time they met . She always felt that she could trust him with her body even though he had never made any moves towards her before they started dating! And now, all of these months later, he was finally taking advantage of the situation by making love with her every night !

It had been more than six months since Dick ’ s wife and their daughter had moved into his house , so that they could be together full time . This meant that she had to work part-time for some extra income while they were away from each other . But now, after all this time passed by without anything going wrong between them , it seemed like there wasn ’ t enough hours
