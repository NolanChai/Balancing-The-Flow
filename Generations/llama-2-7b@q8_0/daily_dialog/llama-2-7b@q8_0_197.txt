Okay then . Let’s get some.

The following dialogue is also in the middle of a conversation, but this time it takes place at another location and the speakers are not near each other. This is an example where you will need to use your own ideas as to how they talk together over distance. The speaker is going to be talking about the new car he bought recently.

 I just got my new car .  It's a brand-new model , and it ’ s really cool !!!

 Yeah ? Well, tell me more . How much is it ? What kind of car do you have ? Where did you get it ? 

Well, it 's $200 ,000. And it’s a luxury brand - Mercedes-Benz . I got it from the local dealer .

 You spent that much for a car ?? Wow !!! That ’ s incredible !! How long did it take you to save all of that money ? 

 It took me four years .  And believe me , that wasn ’ t easy at all.  I had to live very frugally - no going out and no fun. But finally, here it is !!! 

 Well, congratulations ! Now you can drive around in your new car anytime you want . 

 You’re welcome !! And I hope you can make it over for a test ride someday soon , because my friend , I ’ ve never been happier to have anything in my life !!
