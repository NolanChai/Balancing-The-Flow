I've heard that the famous painter Wu Changshuo was a specialist in flower-and-bird painting . 

 We have his best works with us . You should buy one .

 My wife wants to get it as her birthday present. Would you mind if we buy it and then give it to my wife ? I'm afraid that she may not be able to get a good birthday present if she buys one herself.

 You may do what you like with it . 

 It is our pleasure to provide service for our customers . We would like you to have your way !

Do you think it's expensive ? I want to buy it for my father . He has a lot of collections at home and he is very interested in antiques . 

 All right , let me ask the price . 

 The price is RMB9000 , that means nine thousand yuan . 

 Well , I'll think about it . 

 You can take a look around here . If you have any questions , please feel free to ask . 

 It was really nice talking with you . Good bye !
