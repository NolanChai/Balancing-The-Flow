So , exporters should be aware of this situation . 

 Too much product innovation will cause confusion for customers. 

 So , in addition to understanding foreign markets , exporters must also have a good understanding of their own market . 

 In addition, exporters need to ensure that their product is manufactured well and can withstand long-term use . 

 When exporting overseas , the quality of the product is an important factor in determining whether it will be successful or not. 

 Some customers may use foreign products for a long time , so exporters need to ensure that their products meet international standards and can last for a long period.  

 In addition, some exported products need to have certain after-sales services . 

 For example, the seller needs to provide users with technical support and service personnel who are familiar with their product , in order to establish a good relationship with customers . 

 It can be seen that foreign trade is not just about exporting goods alone. 

 Rather , it's a two-way interaction between both parties . 

 So we should always keep the customer experience at the center and strive to make their shopping experience a pleasant one.  

 In short, in foreign trade , it is necessary to pay attention to product adjustments and ensure that your products satisfy customers ' needs, wants and likes.

When it comes to the price , some products must have a lower price than their counterparts in the home country . 

 What's more , some products cannot be sold at high prices because of low quality , while other goods can only be bought at high prices as a result of a long marketing cycle and brand awareness . 

 As for packaging , exporters should design the packaging based on different needs , tastes, habits and so forth in target countries . 

 In some countries , consumers like to eat food with their hands , while others prefer to use spoons . 

 This difference may be affected by local customs and culture . 

 In addition , the packaging design should be adapted to the climate of the target country. 

 For example , if you are selling products that must be refrigerated or frozen in a tropical climate, you should include instructions for storing the products . 

 Also , it is important to remember that some countries do not allow certain ingredients and packaging materials . 

 It depends on which country you are exporting to. 

 As an exporter , you can choose the best marketing strategy after fully considering all these factors.
