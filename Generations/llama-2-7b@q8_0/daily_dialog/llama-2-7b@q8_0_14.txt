Oh , I ' m sorry . I don't know . Is there another flight soon ? 

 There isn't one until tomorrow morning. 

 So that's it then . We ’ re stuck here in this city until morning ? 

 Not necessarily . We could probably catch a cab and get to the airport before our connecting flight takes off . 

 But the taxi ride alone would take at least an hour ! There ' s no way we can make that connection now . 

 I guess you're right. 

 We should just cancel our flight and rebook for tomorrow morning. 

 Cancel it ? You don ' t mean to say it's a waste of money or something ? 

 No , it's not really that . The airline won't give us back the money we spent on this ticket until next year . It's more like a waste of time ! And we might miss our chance for seeing some real art in London, which is why we came here in the first place. 

 Yes , you ' re right . I know that . But do you think it would be too much to ask them to at least let us fly standby on a later flight ? 

 Hmmm .... I guess I could try calling and asking them if they'll allow me to do that . 

 All right then.If you call and say we want to take the next available flight, will there be room for us? 

 Most likely . But don’t expect too much.The first available flight after ours leaves at 8:25.So even if they let us on that one , it would get us into Toronto at 3 a.m., which is why we originally chose to fly home in the morning instead of waiting around in London for an entire night ! 

 Oh well . I'll just call them and see what they say.

Well, we can try.I guess there 's no time like the present.I mean, if we don't try and make it , then I know we won't. 

 Yeah , you're right . I 'll go get our stuff together while you go to check us in ... I ' ll see you at the gate. 

 Bye ! Have fun ! I love you . 

 Bye ! See ya soon!
