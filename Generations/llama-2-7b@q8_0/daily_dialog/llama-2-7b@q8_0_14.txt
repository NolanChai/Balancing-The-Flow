" Hmmm, I don't think you should worry too much. Let me call ahead and see if we can get our flight delayed a bit, so you have some extra time to catch it . "

" Yeah , thanks for that. "

" No problem! Oh, but where are your bags ? "

" They're right here with us. We just picked them up from the hotel and brought them here to the airport. "

" Hmmm. That might be a slight issue . Your connecting flight is arriving at terminal 7 , while you're trying to catch it at terminal 14 ... but don ' t worry, I can take care of that ! Just hang on a minute ... "


( A few seconds go by )

" Okay! That shouldn't be a problem . All you need is for me to call ahead and have your bags sent from one terminal to the other. It should only take about 10-15 minutes, so I suggest you just head that way right now ! "

" Yeah , sounds good! Thanks again ! "

" No problem . Just let me know if there's anything else I can do for you, okay ? "

" Okay. Will do ! "
