But now I am getting better thanks to your prayers and healing energies. 

 How did that happen ? 

 My friends, neighbors and relatives gave me a nice party last night. 

 Everyone was so kind. 

 They told wonderful stories about my life when they were young. 

 One of the old ladies said , "when I was young ,I had three sons who were all very good at school . 

 My third son was the best . 

 He always got the first place in exams and was liked by everyone." 

 I laughed and said, "That is such an interesting story." 

 I told her that it seemed like she had a perfect family. 

 But then something went wrong with all of you? 

 She smiled at me and said, "You know ,everything has its own time ." 

 But now everything's going well in my life thanks to your prayers. 

 I will tell you what happened next time we see each other.
