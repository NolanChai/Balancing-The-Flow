said the woman, and she went on to ask many questions. The woman became very frightened. She was still standing at the door when the ambulance arrived.
The man was carried in, covered with a blanket. His face was white. He lay on a stretcher beside an unconscious woman who had been hit by another car.
The man said to the ambulance driver: "Take me home." The woman watched him and wondered what he meant by that. She thought about it until she fell asleep.
She woke up in the middle of the night. Her husband was not in bed beside her.
When she got out of bed, she saw that all the lights were on and there was a man sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper. The woman stared at him for several seconds, then said: "Where's my husband?"
"Your husband?" said the stranger. "He died an hour ago." He pointed to the covered body in the corner of the living room.
The woman rushed over and took off the blanket. She saw that it was not her husband. It was the man she had seen at the restaurant.
She ran back into the kitchen, screaming: "Where is he?" The stranger looked up from his newspaper and said: "I don't know. He got out of here just before the ambulance came."
