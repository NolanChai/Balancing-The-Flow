Well, why don't we make this a pot luck event and then we can all contribute different things that we would like to eat 

 How about a video game tournament with prizes for first, second , and third place ? 

 I will get my xbox and some controllers to bring . Do you have the same thing or do you want me to bring something else? 

 What are your thoughts on making this an office party vs. just us having a fun time at a friends house?  

 Yes, let's make it a party for everyone in the office so that we can all enjoy ourselves and have some quality team building moments . It will be good for morale as well . 

 Do you think its appropriate to invite the significant others of our co workers or should this just be an employees only event?  

 I think that if we are going to make it a party we need to open it up to the spouses and children of the office as well because otherwise , who are we really celebrating ?

Cool , ok so where do you think would be best for this to happen ? The office ? Your place ? 

 I prefer your place if possible. I have something planned that will really get everyone in the spirit ! 

 Great ! What time does everyone need to leave by ? 

 About 10 or so . We could all stay up and watch movies or hang out afterwards . 

 Sounds good . I'll email you with details of where to meet. Thanks for your help , I look forward to seeing everyone again !

We need to talk about who will come and what time they can arrive . If everyone comes at once then things may get crowded . What do you think ? 

 I agree with that idea . So , let's invite people by email , phone call or snail mail . Do we have a budget for the party ? 

 There is no budget but we need to keep it within reason . It would be best if we can spend around two hundred dollars. 

 I agree . We should start getting things together now so we don't run out of time . I will take care of the food and you can get the entertainment lined up . 

 Thanks ! And remember to make your list detailed , because I have never been good at estimating costs. 

 That won't be a problem . Now let's get busy !

I think that is a great idea . Now for decorations, do we want something simple or extravagant ? 

 Extravagance please ! 

 That sounds wonderful . When would you like to hold the party?

 It could be either before Christmas or after it.
