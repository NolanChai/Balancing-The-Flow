" Thank you Christine . "

" I will be back at six o’clock tonight , Mr . Emory . "

" See you then, Christine . "

CHRISTINE SAT AT THE DESK, her face stiff with concentration. She had been at it for nearly two hours and still could not bring herself to cry. The tears welled in the corners of her eyes, but she refused to give them permission to flow. It wasn’t that they hurt or embarrassed her; rather, they symbolized an admission of defeat. She did not want to feel defeated, so she clenched her jaw and pushed them back down, focusing instead on her work.

She was a messenger for the CIA, which meant that her primary assignment was to deliver secret documents from one place to another, but it wasn’t just any delivery—she had to know what each document said in order to make sure she didn’t get into trouble by showing it to someone who wasn’t supposed to see it. It made the job more challenging, and occasionally, Christine found herself wishing for the easy life of a messenger whose only task was to deliver papers from one place to another without any scrutiny or curiosity.

But as she sat there trying not to think about Mr . Emory’s reaction, she couldn’t help but wonder what she had done wrong and whether her punishment would be more than just a tongue lashing in front of her fellow workers. It was probably nothing serious, she told herself; after all, this wasn’t the first time it had happened, but there were times when it almost felt like Mr . Emory took pleasure in finding fault with her work and berating her for mistakes that, although she acknowledged they could have been avoided, were not necessarily her fault.

The truth was that Christine was a good messenger, one of the best the CIA had ever employed—she always got to her destination on time, delivered documents safely without anyone finding out their contents, and never once missed an assignment in over three years as a messenger. She was reliable and trustworthy, which is why she was surprised by Mr . Emory’s reaction. After all, this wasn’t the first time it had happened; she’d lost important documents before and each time Mr . Emory had given her a stern lecture about the importance of keeping them safe. It seemed to her that he should have known better than to scold her again for something so minor—but perhaps, after all these years, he felt like he could no longer trust her to do her job properly?
As she sat there thinking about it, Christine’s eyes drifted down towards the pile of papers on her desk. They were a mix of reports from various agents around the globe and assignments for other messengers to deliver documents that needed special handling or sensitive information. The files all had different names on them—some were labeled “Sensitive” while others simply read “Top Secret” —and she knew not to look at any document marked with those labels until it was time for her to deliver it, and even then only after making sure no one was around.
But the file that had caused Mr . Emory’s outburst wasn’t like the rest; instead of having a label on it that read “Top Secret” or something similar, it was labeled simply with Mr . Emory’s name and her own. The only thing Christine knew about it was that Mr . Emory wanted to see it immediately upon returning from his appointment with MI6 at noon—and yet here she sat, unable to give him what he asked for until after five o’clock when all of the other messengers had gone home and there were no more assignments left to do.
As much as Christine tried not to think about it, the file kept nagging her mind; finally giving in to temptation she picked up one corner of its brown cover and unfolded it open flat on her desk before leaning back in her chair to read what was inside: a single sheet of paper containing only two sentences written in Mr . Emory’s neat handwriting.

“Mrs . Christine ,
I have received word from the director that you are no longer employed by our agency due to recent misconduct. We will be replacing you with another messenger as soon as possible, so please make sure your belongings are clean and ready for pick-up at six o’clock tonight.”

Christine blinked hard, trying not to let the tears that were threatening to spill out onto her cheeks. She knew she shouldn’t be surprised—after all, Mr . Emory had given her several warnings before finally letting her go, but somehow this felt different; as if there was something about losing her job and being forced to leave all at once without any warning or explanation that hurt more than anything else could ever hope to inflict upon her.

With one last look at the file sitting open on her desk, she stood up quickly before grabbing hold of a pen from her pocket. She jotted down the address of where she was supposed to deliver an envelope containing Mr . Emory’s letter and then proceeded through the door into the hallway without saying goodbye or looking back—it didn’t seem necessary anymore, now that she had accepted what must come next: the end of everything she knew and loved.

A few hours later, after returning from one final errand before departing for home, Christine sat alone in a small diner sipping her coffee while waiting for her ride to arrive so they could make their way back across town together once more without saying another word about what had just happened between them—but now that it was all over she felt better than ever before; as if whatever burden might have been holding on to her from deep within finally let go, freeing her up in a new and unexpected way so much that when the man sitting next to her reached out with his hand across the table, she smiled before taking hold of it without hesitation.

“Thank you for everything,” he said softly while looking straight into Christine’s eyes as if trying not only understand but also explain why he felt like this was somehow more important than all else combined; a feeling that made sense once they both realized what had happened between them—that love may be stronger than even the toughest challenges life can throw at us because it is capable of shining through even when everything else seems dark and hopeless.

With one last kiss on Christine’s cheek, Mr . Emory stood up and reached for his coat before turning around towards the door whereupon he smiled brightly as if trying hard to fight back tears while saying goodbye; “It was my pleasure Mrs . Christine ,” he said before walking out into the night air with a spring in step that only someone who knows they have done something right can muster—and then, with one more smile on his face, he disappeared around the corner leaving nothing but memories behind as if proving once again why love will always win no matter what stands in its way.
