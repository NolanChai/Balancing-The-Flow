Nothing much really . Just thought it might be nice if we went out for lunch today . 

 Uh - okay .  

 Great ! So where do you want to go ? 

 Let me think . I was thinking about that place on the corner of the street . You know , the one with all those different foods . It's a buffet . 

 Oh yes, I remember now . It's called "Different Food Buffet" or something like that. 

 Yeah , it looks good and the prices are really good too !  

 All right . That sounds great . Can we leave around 12:30 ? 

 Sure , why not . See you at noon then . Bye !

No , I need to go further . And where does the C train stop in Chinatown ? 

 C train is one letter , not two . Didn't you mean Avenue C bus ? 

 Oh right ... Avenue C . I got it wrong ! 

 Yeah , that's fine . 

 Bye .

 OK . Thanks . I will see you then . Bye.

I donâ€™t know yet . Are you meeting her at our place or should she take the B bus from Canal Street to Dockside ? 

 You should let me handle this . We agreed that we would all go together . 

 Ok . Thanks for your help , Ruth. Bye .
