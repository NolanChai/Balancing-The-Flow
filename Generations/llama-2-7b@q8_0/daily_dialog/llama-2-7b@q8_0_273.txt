" But there are two stops after that before reaching Canal Street . Do you mean to tell me that I have to get off at every stop in order to reach Canal Street ? That's ridiculous ! Why don't we just get off at the first stop and walk down to Canal Street together? "

" No , no , you are misunderstanding my instructions. You must go all the way from Chinatown to Canal Street . It will be better that way because the buses there are more reliable than those in Manhattan . So, make sure you get off at every stop ."

" Well , I'd rather walk all the way if it means that I don't have to ride on a slow and crowded bus . "

" Are you crazy ? Do you want to get to New York or not? What do you mean, 'if it means?' I never asked for your opinion. Just take my instructions as they are . You have to take the first available Avenue B or D bus that is going downtown. Once you get on board , make sure you sit in the front seat and don't change seats once you are on board ."

" OK, I will do it your way . "

" Good , because if you want to be my friend then you have to do as I say . "

" Yeah , but can I ask you something? "

" Go ahead . "

" Do you think we are going to be friends?"

" Is there another way to get to the hotel from here ? "

" Of course not . What else were we going to do , fly across town ? "

" How are you planning on getting home at the end of the day ? "

" The same way I usually do , by subway and bus . "

" You will have a long journey back to your house . Is there anything wrong with staying in Chinatown for the night ? "

" No , you don't understand . It isn't safe for me to stay out at this hour . I am not very familiar with New York . "

" There is nothing unusual about being on the streets at two o'clock in the morning . We're always on the streets then. Don't worry, I will take care of you. You can come home with me . My apartment has no windows and nobody will bother you there . "

" That's very kind of you, but it isn't necessary . "

" It is necessary for your safety, Ruth . We will take an Avenue B bus at Canal Street , go down to the ferry terminal, then we will get off together on the other side. Afterwards, I'll walk you back to your hotel and make sure you are safe there. That is my promise. "

" Well , I guess that will be all right . We can take a bus at the last stop in Chinatown. "

" Are you sure you don't want to stay with me ? You may find yourself in trouble if you get on the wrong Avenue B or D bus after we get off together at Canal Street. I won't let anything happen to you . You can be my guest for the night if you like . "

" Well , thank you very much, but I will just stay with you and meet up again tomorrow morning when I come in from work. That is enough for now . I am grateful that you are willing to help me out . But we should keep things simple and avoid any misunderstandings. This trip is too long for us to spend time together . "

" No problem. We'll have plenty of time tomorrow, Ruth. When do you come back to New York ? "

" I am on vacation right now until the first week of January, so we will probably meet then at your place or somewhere else . "

" Sounds good , Ruth. See you then . Bye for now . "

# 68. 美国人陪你到房子里吗？

**Question:** Would an American take a stranger to his home?

# Answer:

In the last three stories, we have had two girls being helped by two different men. Ruth and Carl are in love with each other but they've never met before until now. In this story, we will learn how a young man would act if he was in this situation.

If you were at a restaurant or a bar with someone you didn't know very well and that person asked you to walk them back to their house after closing time, what would you do? If the person you are walking home is male or female, does your answer change? Would it be safe for you to walk home alone in your hometown late at night?

" Yes , but don't tell me how many buses to take . It is a long trip from Queens for her and she doesn't know where Chinatown is ! "

" Well , I'll see you at 10,45 then . Bye . "

Ruth hung up the phone. She had forgotten how many buses there were in the city! Oh well. It didn't matter. The important thing was that Ann would be able to see the sights with her friends tomorrow.
