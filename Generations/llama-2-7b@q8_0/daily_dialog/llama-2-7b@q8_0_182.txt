Monica, can you tell us a little bit about your background? 

Sure ! As I mentioned earlier , I have been an accountant for almost five years . Before this , I was working in the auditing department and I am also familiar with accounting principles . I think my knowledge as well as working experiences will help everybody here .

Well, Monica. We are very happy to have you on our team and we look forward to your contributions.
