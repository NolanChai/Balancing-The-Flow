Okay . I don't think so either but let me check in the afternoon . If they are open then, we can go there . Do you like their food ? 

 I really don't know much about it . But everyone is talking about how good and cheap their lunch is now. It must be pretty good or else nobody would recommend it to others .

No problem. You know, though, that some people consider that to be an affectation on your part ? 

 I guess so ! But maybe they are wrong . Maybe there really is something in my genes that makes me sad when the sun's not shining. It's always been like that . 

 What , if anything, do you think the rain has to do with it ? 

 Well , I just don't feel good on a rainy day . That's all there is to it . Maybe I can blame my parents for being such pessimists. I guess they could be partly responsible for making me that way. It would be nice if things didn't always have to go so smoothly in life, wouldn't it ? 

 Sure ! But why don't you and I take advantage of the fact that we can make it rain any time we want ? Let's do it right now , shall we ? 

 I think I'll pass . Maybe another time . 

 You really shouldn't give up so easily on things like this, Peter. I know you don't believe in miracles or the power of prayer and that kind of thing , but think about it : what could be easier than making rain ? I mean all we have to do is wish for some and we get it ! 

 But you can't just make rain out of thin air . It requires a certain amount of moisture in the air or else nothing happens . We live in an arid climate , Bill , where the humidity is so low that the best we can hope for most of the time is some evaporation. 

 Well , maybe you're right . But why not give it a try ? Let me think about it and I may call you later on . If it works , you may have something there ! 

 Okay . Thanks anyway, Bill . Have fun at the cafeteria with your lunch. 

 You too, Peter .
