Why ? 

 Because that is where your car is parked . 

 Where do you think it is now ? 

 How would I know ! I don’t have my keys with me and the car isn ’ t in the garage ! 

 Oh, come on , Gary ! This is ridiculous . You couldn ’ t even remember where your car was parked ? 

 Yeah , but why should I do all this work for you ? If that’s what you think I am doing , you are dead wrong ! Now leave me alone ! 

 Well, I will go and get the keys from the garage . I ’ ll be back soon . 

 OK , I guess so.

Yeah, maybe. 

 We could go for a walk in Central Park after dinner. Maybe we can get something at that diner on 72nd Street . Or would you rather go somewhere else ? 

 It doesn ’ t matter to me . I don ’ t eat much anyway . What do you feel like having for dinner tonight ? 

 I don ’ t know , maybe a sandwich from the deli next door. But let ’ s check it out first and then we can decide where we want to go . How about if I call you later today and tell you where to meet me for dinner ? 

 Yeah, that sounds good . Well, gotta run now Gary. See ya!

 I guess we won’t see anything good then .
