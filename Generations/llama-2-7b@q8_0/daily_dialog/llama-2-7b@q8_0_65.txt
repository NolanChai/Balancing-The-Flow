" No , no ! You did nothing wrong . It ’ s just that you had trouble with your car and then you called me, right ? "

" That ’ s true . But why didn ’ t you answer the phone ? "

" I don ’ t know . Maybe I was too far away to hear it ring . And , well , there are a lot of people calling at this number every day, so sometimes they get through and sometimes not . "

" That must have been annoying for you ! I really hope it wasn ’ t an important call . "

" It was nothing important . You can just imagine that I was already in a bad mood when the movie started without me . And then I had to wait 20 minutes before we could leave the theater . "

" Why did you stay there anyway ? Didn ’ t you see my car parked on the street ? "

" No ! There were too many cars in front of the building and I couldn ’ t see yours at all , so I just thought it was not a good time to call you . "

" Oh, I see. Sorry about that."

" Never mind . I really have to go now . I have an appointment with someone who wants to rent my apartment for the summer . "

" OK ! Good luck then . See you soon ? "

" Yes , yes . You too ! Bye, bye ! "

" Okay , okay . "

" Come on in ! "

" Hi, Gary! What happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there?

"I thought we were supposed to meet here."

"Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment!"

"I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other."

"Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions?"

"You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie."
