Yes , they are . 

 Have a nice day . 

 Good morning , madam . Could you please check your bag ? 

 Sure, what did I forget ? 

 Oh , nothing . You just have to put it here and we will search it . 

 Thanks. I’ll do that. 

 Can I see your passport , please ? 

 Of course . Here you are . 

 Thank you very much. 

 Thank you for having a pleasant trip . 

 Bye bye !

Just a bag . It is right there by the door . 

 Thank you for your cooperation . Please step out to security. Have a nice day !

Of course . I hope there is no problem with my luggage. 

 Oh ! I forgot about it. It has a liquid in it, so we'd better put it on the belt first and check its security after that. 

 That is a good idea , sir . 

 Is this all you have ? 

 Yes , this is all . 

 Okay , then I think there is no problem with your luggage, too. You may proceed to the next counter for your flight check-in and security inspection. Have a nice day . 

 Thank you .

 No , I don't think so . What is the weight of your luggage ? 

 About thirty kilos . May I see your boarding pass? 

 Yes , sure . Thank you . Have a nice flight !

No . Why do you ask this question ? 

 Well , sometimes people try to smuggle animals across the border without quarantine. We've had a few cases lately . Do you have any prohibited items in your luggage ? 

 May I see it for a moment ? 

 Yes , please . Please check it with me carefully , because there is a big risk that smugglers can pass through the border with illegal products . You understand , sir ? 

 Yes . Of course ! There's nothing to worry about . What do you mean by "the risk of illegal products" ? 

 I have a small sniffer dog over here . He might smell something from your luggage . 

 Oh ! My God ! It's not that serious , is it ? 

 OK , sir . Now , please go and wait in the waiting room . The custom officer will call you when he finishes checking your luggage. 

 Thank you very much .
