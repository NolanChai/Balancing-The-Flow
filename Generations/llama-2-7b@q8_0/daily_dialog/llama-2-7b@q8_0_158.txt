Thank you, that would be lovely . 

 What are your plans now ? 

 Well , I'm going to take a short nap before we go out for dinner with some friends of mine. 

 Good idea ! It's been ages since we've seen them. 

 Are you going anywhere special next weekend? 

 Yes, it should be very exciting . I'm flying to Beijing to spend the long weekend with my family there . 

 Nice ! 

 You should come and join us sometime if you get the chance. 

 That would be great. I really hope we can make a plan for that soon! Bye!
