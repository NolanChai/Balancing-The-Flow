OK , I will call and check the status of our order with the office supply store , but it is still early in the day so they might not have an answer for me yet. 

 As far as toner goes , we usually just purchase it from the housekeeping department , so if there isn't much left over by tomorrow , I will run the order by them too . 

 Great , sounds good . We need to get a large order in before the end of business day for two reasons . One is because the supplier tends to sell out quickly of our regular orders , and secondly we are planning to have a toner cartridge re-filling event on Friday afternoon after work for the employees to learn more about saving money through re-using . 

 Is there anything else that we need ? 

 Nope ... I will call you back later this afternoon with an update . Bye.
