" What do you look for in people when recruiting ? "

" Experience and attitude . We try to hire people who are interested in working with us , not just looking for a short term job . We want our staff to be loyal , dedicated and willing to go the extra mile for their customers . If we've got those qualities in someone , they will stay here for many years . "

" Are your workers unionized ? "

" No. We are not affiliated with any union. The only reason I can see to do this would be to improve productivity and raise wages . I have nothing against unions per se , but the current labor environment is a big competitive advantage for us ! "
