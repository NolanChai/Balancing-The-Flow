No . We have an HR department that does most of that work for us . The managers on each shift are responsible for ensuring that sufficient staff are available to meet our targets for production . 

 Have you ever had problems with labour shortages in the past ? 

 Yes , but only during peak periods . We have never had difficulty filling positions , although sometimes we need to provide training before employees can get up to speed . 

 What is your turnover rate like ? 

 It varies from quarter to quarter but it's pretty low overall . 

 What do you do with those who leave the company ? 

 We ask them why they are leaving and then try our best to retain them . We want people to stay on , as they know our systems well and are efficient .
