Oh no ! There are many different types of food in the world , and 
I like it all .  

 I can cook for you if that would be better. 

 I guess so . How about Italian ? 

 Yes , but please don't think my cooking is as good as an Italian restaurant .

 We'll see how you do . I'm going to get ready now !

Yes , that would be fun ! 

 Ok. Let me call for reservations then . 

 Great ! You'll love the place ; it's near the park too . 

 I think I've heard of it . 

 It has a lot of character and you can sit outside . 

 Sounds great .

### 30 seconds :

It seems that everyone is talking about your great idea for the restaurant , maybe even better than the restaurant you were thinking of.

 I like the idea of walking somewhere . Where to ?

 I have an idea but it might be too far . May I join you ?

 Yes let's go ! 

### 60 seconds :

Great , now everyone knows about the great restaurant we are going to eat at . They all want to know how much it costs or if they should make a reservation . What do you think of that ?

 I like walking so let's walk there ! How far is the place ? 

 I like your idea for lunch better than mine , and it was my idea we were discussing.

 We can all go to dinner together sometime . I need to ask if I am available then . Can we do that at a later time ?
