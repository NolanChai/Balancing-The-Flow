No thank you I'll just go with the first thing on the list 

Sir we have a lot of different types of beverages here but there is only one entree. Do you think that would be ok ? 

Yes . I'm in no mood to try anything new tonight, thank you very much. 

Thank you sir. I hope you enjoy your dinner , and thank you for choosing my restaurant .

The chicken kebab please ! 

 Certainly , sir ! 

 How about a salad to go with that ? 

 Sure ! 

 May I start your meal with some bread? 

 Please do . 

 Here are the beers you ordered. Would you care for more drinks while you're waiting ? 

 No thank you , but could we have a moment to discuss our bill please? 

 Yes , of course ! That'll be right over here . 

 Here it is , sir. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you .
