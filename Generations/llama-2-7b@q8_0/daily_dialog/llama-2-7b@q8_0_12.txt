I could send some information to your boss, but he told me that it would be better if we talked in person. 

 Well, there's no way that you can talk with him until next week , because he is going out of town . 

 And if possible, it will be even more difficult for us to make a decision before the first of May. 

 You know, this is an important position and we really want to do what's best for our company . 

 We could talk tomorrow morning , but I don't think that would help matters because the President will be here on Wednesday.

 Good idea. 

 Do you have anything else in mind ?  

 I'll give it some thought and get back to you soon. 

 I look forward to hearing from you , so thanks for calling .
