" Last week we went to Mount Sopris , which is in western Colorado ."

" I know, it is just below Aspen Mountain . "

" Yes, we went there to climb a cliff on the mountain."

" How many days did you spend camping ? "

" We spent two nights and one day camping."

" Did you have much equipment with you ? "

" We had enough food for three or four people , but we had too little fuel for our camp stove."

" What is a cliff on the mountain like ? "

" It is about 300 feet high and it has some steep parts."

" How much of the mountain did you climb ? "

" We climbed most of the cliffs and we were near the top of the mountain when we left for our camp."

" Sorry too, but there will be another one next week. "

" You are always doing something interesting . What should we do this weekend ? "

" Maybe we can go hiking in the mountains or maybe skiing in the winter. "

" Do you like to go hiking and climbing?
" I love it ! It is so much fun . Sometimes when we are at a rest stop, there is some guy who looks like he could be an actor sitting near us reading a newspaper, but we never see him in the movies. "
