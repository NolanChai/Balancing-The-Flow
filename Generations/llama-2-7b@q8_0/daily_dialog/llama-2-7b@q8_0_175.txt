" Our chances of winning a medal in the 10,000 meter race is good , because one of our athletes has won it several times before at international meetings . In the marathon I don ’ t know , we haven ’ t had many good results so far this year . "

" Well I hope everything goes well for them . "

"I think you are right . We must be patient and not start to worry about things until it is too late . "

" I heard one of our rowers broke his arm this weekend . "

" Did he make the Olympic squad ? "

" Yes , but that ’ s no problem for him . He ’ ll just sit on the bench and watch everyone else win gold medals . "

" The Olympic team is very good . I think we have a chance to do well in every sport . "

" Maybe , but I don’t see us winning too many medals . We haven ’ t trained properly this year . "

" Our football team was so terrible at the world cup . There ’ s no way they could beat any Olympic team . "

" Oh, you watch a lot of football then ? "

" No , I just like to play it . It’s the only sport we did well in at the last Olympics . "

" So, are there going to be any Olympic games next year ? "

" Yes, but that doesn ’ t mean our team will do well . We might not win any medals . "

" I think you should give them more time before saying that . They haven ’ t even had any practice yet ! "
