I think that ’ s a pretty good prediction . We could easily get one or two gold medals in track and field events . I saw there are some other events too , like cycling and swimming .

Yes, that’s true . Our swimmer won the gold medal in the last Olympics . I don’t think we have any chance of getting a gold this year but maybe we could get one or two silver medals .

I think we have a good chance in most of the track sports . The only sport I think we might not win any medals is swimming . We don ’ t seem to be very strong there . 

 I agree with you . But at least one of our swimmers should come fourth or fifth and get a medal . 

 Yes , that ’ s true . And at least two of our cyclists will win silver medals in the road race . 

 What do you think we have the best chance to win gold medals ?

I think our best chance to win golds is in the women ’ s rowing team . They won it last year and I can’t see any of our other teams beating them this time . 

 I agree with you . I think they should come first again at least . But we might not win any medals in football or cricket . 

 Why do we always lose in sports like that ? It ’ s very frustrating . 

 Yes, it is frustrating . I don’t understand why other countries are so much better than us at those sports . Perhaps they train longer or harder or something . 

 They must do ! I think the only reason we won an Olympic gold medal in cricket a few years ago was because that country had a disaster and sent only one team of eleven people instead of twelve . Otherwise, they would have beaten us by many runs . 

 Maybe , but it still doesn ’ t make me feel any better about losing all the time . 

 How do you think we should improve our chances in sports like cricket ? 

 Well , I don’t know if we can improve anything at football or cricket, but I do know that we need to train harder for the more traditional Olympic sports . And I ’ m sure Mike farmer will win a medal this time around as long as he keeps training . 

 Yes , and I ’ ve heard that the head of our swimming team is trying to convince some of the best Australian swimmers to come over here to train . If we can get some more world-class swimmers like that then we should be able to win a lot of medals in future Olympics . 

 Yes , I agree with you completely . I think that ’ s our main problem at this year ’ s Olympics — not enough people training hard enough and long enough .

What about track cycling . Are you looking forward to that event ? 

 I really like it when they ride their bikes around the velodrome . It ’ s so exciting to watch and I hope we have some British riders on the podium .
