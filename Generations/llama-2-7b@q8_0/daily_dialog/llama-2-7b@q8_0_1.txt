He is looking at a picture. 

 Can you see it from here? 

No, I cannot see it from here. 

Why can’t you see it from here? 

Because I am standing in front of the picture. 

 And what are you doing ? 

I’m trying to guess who is in that picture.

Who is in that picture? 

 I don’t know , but he is looking at me and he is very happy . 

What is he doing? 

He’s waving his hand at me. 

Who is the man ? 

 Oh, I forgot to introduce him. He is Uncle Henry’s friend . 

 And why is he waving his hand at you? 

I don’t know , but maybe because it was a present from Uncle Henry for me. 

 What are they doing now? 

They are walking in the garden, but Uncle Henry has gone to the bookshop and will be back soon. 

Where is the garden ? 

The garden is on the other side of the house. We call it The Garden of Love . 

 When did you come home? 

I came home two weeks ago. I have been to America with Uncle Henry .
