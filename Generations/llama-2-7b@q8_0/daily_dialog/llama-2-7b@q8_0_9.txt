Oh really ? That would be nice . 

 I was thinking about buying a CD of his work . 

 Really? Do you have one in mind already ? 

 Actually , no . Just want to know if it's worth spending money on or not. 

 I can tell you that the guy is really talented . He is even famous for having composed music at an early age and was very intelligent himself . 

 Thanks,I'll be sure to get some Mozart when I have a chance!

 Have fun!

Actually , I don't really know about classical music . I was listening to the same station every day and they played only Mozart . So , I like Mozart . 

 Wow ! So you listen to a specific radio station everyday? 

 Yes . It ' s called the " Classical Music " station . And they play lots of Mozart's music . 

 Okay. Well , goodbye . I 'm going to bed now . See you tomorrow!

Ah . Do you know anything other than popular music ? 

 Not really. All I like are pop, rock and jazz . 

 What about hip-hop? 

 I don ' t think so , but I ' m not very familiar with the genre . 

 OK, then it's time for you to learn more about this style of music . 

 I can ' t believe I never noticed how good they are !

You don't like to think much when you listen to pop ? 

 Not really . 

 Do you listen to the lyrics or do they mean nothing to you ? 

 The lyrics are very important to me , but not always understandable . 

 But it doesn't matter. If a song is good then I don't have to understand what it's about . 

 So, what kind of music did you listen to when you were younger ? 

 I liked rock at that time . 

 Really , my mom likes rock too and she listens to the same bands as me now. 

 Yes ! That ' s cool ! But there are so many different kinds of music nowadays . And you can't listen to everything in life . 

 I agree with you . And that is why I don't like classical music anymore . It seems old fashioned for me now . 

 So , what do you think about the future of music ? Will it become more complex or will it be just an easy way to relax ?

Since high school . What about yourself ? 

 I am just getting started to listen to some more complicated songs lately . What are your favorite bands or artists ? 

 The Beatles , and U2 . They are my all time favorites . Do you like rock n' roll at all ? 

 A little bit , but it isn ' t my main interest . I don ' t get the point of listening to heavy metal music . 

 What kind of music do you think is most relaxing for you ? 

 Pop or classical, whichever is available . Do you like any modern bands . 

 Yeah , I like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin , among others . Are they popular in your country ? 

 Not really . What are some of the most popular bands in Australia then ? 

 I don't know , I can ' t really say . How about you ? 

 The same . I listen to all kinds of music. What kind of bands do you like ? 

 A bit of everything, from classical to pop and rock n' roll . I love listening to the Beatles and Elvis Presley . 

 Cool ! Do you prefer old or new music? 

 Older is definitely better ! Why don ' t we take a walk in the park ? It's such a nice day. 

 OK .

Yes , I do . It is one of my favorite hobbies . How about you ? What kind of music do you like to listen to in your free time ? 

 Well . I don't really have any favorites . I just like whatever comes on the radio . 

 I see . Do you ever go out at night to hang around with friends ? 

 Oh, sure ! When I was younger, we always used to go to clubs after school . Now that I ' m in college , it's much easier to meet up with my friends . We often hang out together . 

What do you like doing most ?

Well , nowadays when I go out at night , it's more likely to be for a nice dinner than clubbing or bar-hopping. I think that as we grow older, our priorities in life change . 

That ' s true . 

I know right ! It seems like only yesterday that we used to stay up all night on weekends and have no class the next day . That was so much fun ! 

Yeah , it sure was. Well, I guess I'd better be getting home. See you tomorrow . 

 Yeah , see ya ' . Bye .
