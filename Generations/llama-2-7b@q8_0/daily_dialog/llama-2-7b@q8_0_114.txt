" George ! What about the kids ? They can ’ t sleep in your van . It is not comfortable . "

" Come on Lili, relax. We don ’ t have to travel all the time. We can stay at a hotel for one night , when we want to spend some time in an amusement park or something like that. The rest of the time we will be sleeping in the van . "

" Well , George . You are right ! I ’ ll go with you this time . I hope my friend is not going anywhere on vacation during this week . We can travel for a couple of weeks . "

Their friend had just bought an RV and he said he was planning to go away in the mountains, near the coast. He would stay there for a few months to be close to his daughter who lives in that area . The time he spent with his family made him happy . He wanted to spend some more time with them before returning to his business life , which made him unhappy .

He said his friends could use his RV if they wanted to . They were welcome to travel the country as long as it didn ’ t interfere with their work. " Come on , I know you will enjoy this ! "

Lili and George spent two weeks in California . It was a very hot time of the year, but they enjoyed being together while seeing new things around them. Their friend ’ s RV worked like magic. They visited places they had never seen before, like Disneyland , Yosemite National Park and Hollywood Boulevard.

When they returned to their home in Los Angeles, they both felt tired from traveling and happy about all the memories they had shared together as a family .

### 4.3.2 Actions that require "permission"

Some verbs need an object after them. This is because the verb requires some action on your part to be carried out . Examples of such verbs are "give" , "tell", and "ask". In these situations, the pronoun _you_ can also appear as a subject in place of the direct object that follows the verb.

The word "permission" means giving someone permission to do something or allowing them to have something . It is used when someone asks for permission from another person , company, organization etc.. 

If we want to ask for permission then we need to use a question mark at the end of our sentence . Example : _ Do I have your permission to take off now ?_ ( _Can I leave?_ )

When you say "I would like to know if ..." , it means that there is no problem with doing whatever action was just stated, but one needs confirmation or authorization from someone before actually doing the thing . Example : 

_"Do you mind if I use your bathroom?" _("I want to ask if I can go in there.")

"It would be great if we could stay at a hotel while we visit New York." ( _We would love to stay somewhere comfortable during our trip._ )

"I really hope my boss does not mind us working overtime this weekend so that we finish the project on time ! " ( _I want him to approve of this extra work_ .)

"Please excuse me while I ask if you can tell me which door leads out onto the patio ? " ( _Please don't mind my asking this question._ )

"Do you have permission for us all to go out tonight after our shift ends at 9 pm , sir ? " ("I want to know if we are allowed to leave early.")

" Yeah ... I guess so. OK ! It sounds good . I accept your plan . But don ’ t forget to bring some bed sheets and pillows ! "

" Of course 14 . So , tomorrow morning you will pack some stuff for the trip . Right ? "

" Yes . Bye . See you soon 13 . "

" You too. Bye . "

" George , there aren ’ t any restaurants in the state that serve good Chinese food . "

" But one or two 10 Chinese restaurants are pretty good ! "

" Maybe some of them . But still not enough to satisfy all your cravings . "

" Oh , I think we should try anyway . Besides, when do you have time to eat out ? "

" Well , that ’ s true . I only go out with friends from work once in a while . "

" So what are we waiting for ? Let ’ s start ! We will take the van and leave right after work tomorrow . "

" Ok . "

" You better get some sleep now. We have an early start tomorrow morning . See you at 7:00AM . "

[ 21.06 ]

" George , I can ’ t believe how lucky we are ! "

" What do you mean ? "

" This restaurant has the best Chinese food in the state ! We had a great time last night . But look at this menu . It’s pretty expensive ! I think it is more than 40 dollars for two people with drinks included . "

" Oh , it ’ s nothing . I know how to order dishes that cost less money . "

" You can ? How come you never told me before ? "

" Oh , just now . You didn’t ask . "

" Well , why don ’ t we try a different restaurant this time then ? "

" I think it ’ s better if we order the same things next time so that we can compare how the taste changes with each dish we ordered last night . "

" Ok . "

[ 21.07 ]

" How was your trip to Los Angeles ? "

" Pretty good . I am glad I came back here for my vacation . "

" Yeah . Why didn ’ t you stay there with George and Lili ? "

" I don ’ t know . Maybe it will be fun next time . But this was a nice break from the routine of everyday life . We visited museums , parks , restaurants . It wasn ’ t too expensive either . And I got to see a lot of interesting things . "

[ 21.08 ]

" Oh , Lili ! How much money do you think we have left ? "

" George , I don ’ t know exactly . We can check the bank statement tonight and get back to me later . "

" But I really need some new clothes for work . "

" You shouldn ’ t have used your vacation days before starting a new job . "

" Hey ! Why are you always on my side ? George , I thought you were going to take care of the finances in this family . "

" Well , we had some expenses . "

" Yeah , like eating out every night after work and drinking at the bar almost every weekend . "

" Oh ! I think we can control our spending a little bit better . But you can ’ t stop me from buying new clothes if I want them . Besides, I already bought some of these jeans when I was in LA with George . "

" Lili , the price of those clothes is pretty high . You could have bought them in a cheaper place. "

" What ! Are you saying that I should go to the thrift stores ? That ’ s not very cool for a professional like me . "

" How do you know you are a professional ? Have they paid you yet ? "

" No , but we haven ’ t even started working together officially . "

" So how can you say you ’ re a professional ? You don ’ t have any experience. I think you should stop buying things that aren ’ t really necessary and start saving money for your future family instead of spending it on clothes and food . "

" George , we have been together for 8 years now ! If I can ’ t buy a new dress when I want to, then what is the point of being with you in the first place ? You should just take care of yourself and leave me alone . "

[ 21.09 ]

" George , where are we going tonight ? "

" Do you remember that Chinese restaurant last night ? I think it was very nice . "

" Yeah . But Lili said the food there is expensive . "

" It is not as bad as she thinks . Let ’ s go again . "

" George , let ’ s eat at a different place this time ! "

" Why ? Are you mad at me ? Didn ’ t I take you to a very nice restaurant last night ? You said it was the best Chinese food in the state . "

" Oh , we just want to try something new . It would be interesting . "

" But it ’ s not necessary . Besides, Lili said that she likes eating at this restaurant . "

" Well . Let ’ s go there then . I don ’ t mind . "

[ 21.10 ]

" George , is everything ok ? You look a little bit sad tonight . "

" Yeah . Just thinking about Lili ’ s comment last night . She said the food in that Chinese restaurant isn ’ t as good as she thought it would be and I didn ’ t know how to order dishes that cost less money . "

" Oh ! But it was still good . We could have ordered something more affordable if we wanted to . "

" No , it is not good enough for me . I think there must be a restaurant in the area with better food than that one . "

[ 21.11 ]

" George , why are you so angry ? Is Lili bothering you again ? "

" Oh , no ! Not at all . I have been thinking about how to improve my cooking skills . And today I found a great cooking class in town . It is very cheap too ! I ’ ll register for it tomorrow after work . You should come with me and check it out . "

" But I don ’ t think you can learn anything from that class . "

" Why not ? Don ’ t you want to be a better cook so we can save money on eating out more often ? "

" Oh ! Yes , of course . You can also find some great recipes online or in the library . I have a book with Chinese dishes in it at home that I used when I was living there before . If you want, you can borrow it and check it out tonight . "

[ 21.12 ]

" George , how did your cooking class go today ? "

" It went well ! The instructor taught us a lot of great recipes . I will bring some home next time so that we can try them together . "

" Ok . But why are you looking at me like this right now ? Didn ’ t the chef teach anything worthwhile to you today ? "

" Of course he did ! He taught us how to make fried rice and egg rolls . I will show you the recipe when we get home . "

[ 21.13 ]

" George , don ’ t worry about it . Just do what you think is right . You should not be bothered by her comments like this all the time . It isn ’ t worth your time . "

" But she is my wife and I have to respect her . Besides, when did I say that I would quit working ? I will continue to earn money for our family . And you also need to start a new job so we can live better ! "

" Oh ! Don ’ t get upset. You are already doing your best . If anyone needs to change something it is Lili who has been spending too much of her salary on clothes and food all the time . She should stop buying things that she doesn ’ t really need and start saving money instead . "

[ 21.14 ]

" George , I think we will not be able to save any money at this point in our relationship . You know what Lili said last night when you went out with her friends from work ? She thinks the food in that restaurant is expensive and that you don ’ t know how to order dishes that cost less money . "

" Oh ! I am tired of listening about this subject all day long ! Do you want me to quit my job so we can be more frugal at home ? "

" Well , I think it would be a great idea . Then we could use the extra income for something important like paying down our credit card debt or saving money for our future family . "

[ 21.15 ]

" George , don ’ t tell me that you want to quit your job because of Lili ’ s comments last night . What are we going to do if you leave the company ? You have been with them for such a long time and they have invested so much in training you ! They will never hire anyone else who knows as much about their business as you do ! "

" I know that . But how can she be so rude all the time ? Why does it bother her when I eat out with friends from work every weekend ? She never complained when
