George , I don ’ t think that will be enough fun ! 

 Well , Lili , if you don ’ t want to go , you can stay here . I ’ m sure we can have some fun together by ourselves . 

 Yes , let ’ s do it this way then . 

 George , are you going to invite your friends ? 

 No , not at the moment . Maybe they will come over on weekends . What about you ? Do you want to invite your friends too ? 

 I don ’ t think so ! I need some time alone with you . And don ’ t worry ! We can have our own fun together and that’s what matters most . 

 Oh , I see …Well, George ! 

 Yes , Lili? What do you want to say ? 

 Well … You are not the first guy in my life who is trying to be a hero by helping me when we have financial problems . But after all this time we should stop blaming ourselves and look for ways how to get more money from other places , like we did before with our businesses . And don ’ t you agree ? 

 I do ! I think we can ask your mother if she has some spare money left … I know that she always kept some money in reserve for such occasions . 

 Lili , do you trust me or not? 

 Yes, of course I trust you! Why wouldn ’ t I ? I love you and I’m sure we will manage somehow ! 

 Yes , let ’ s do it like that then . But before all this, let ’ s have a little fun on our own first ! And now I want to tell you about something else . 

 What? Tell me! 

 Well … Whenever I go out of the house alone, I often meet different people from your country. Some of them seem kind and friendly , but some of them are quite strange. They are very intrusive in their approach and they always ask questions about you . They try to find out everything about us , including our income . 

 Well … Is that a problem ? I don ’ t think so . Everyone is welcome here ! 

 No , no, not at all! But the way they act makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes. Some of them even ask me if you are in love with me and why I ’ m dating such an ugly man . 

 What? They say that about us ? Well … Lili, they must be crazy ! You know I have been in love with you since the very beginning! And what can I do about my appearance , right ? It’s something I don ’ t have much control over . 

 Lily , it doesn ’ t matter how you look because you are a beautiful and intelligent woman . But that does not change the fact that other people judge you by your looks . So, if they say something bad about me in public or even to your friends, what can I do? Will you still like me as much ? 

 Oh … I ’ m sorry ! Of course , I will always love you no matter what others think! That was a stupid thing to say ! But I just didn ’ t want to talk about it right now . Let’s not ruin this beautiful moment . 

 George , are you sure? Because I can ’ t live without your approval or love anymore … 

 Of course , Lili. You know that too well! I have never been so happy with anyone before and I don ’ t intend to stop now! We will find a way out of this problem . And it won’t change anything between us . 

 Lily , you are the most beautiful woman in my life ! The fact that someone thinks otherwise is nothing but pure nonsense. Do not let them affect your relationship with me or make you feel bad about yourself ever again! You know that I love everything about you – even your appearance which makes me crazy about you . 

 Thank you, George … Now I ’ m feeling better already ! Well , what else is on the agenda? We have plenty of time to talk … 

 Do you want to go for a walk or watch TV tonight ? Maybe we can play some games together and order pizza … 

 Oh . that would be nice! But let me ask my friend first if she wants to join us … 

 Sure, Lily . Just call her over whenever you are ready ! 

 Okay , George. I ’ ll get back to you later …

It gets cold at night and we will have to do some cooking ! 

 I will bring food from home so that you can prepare something easy for us , George ! 

 Great idea ! We ’ ll be able to eat a lot cheaper than in restaurants ! 

 What should we see first ? 

 I have already picked out an itinerary for us . Let ’ s start with San Diego and then drive down the coast through Santa Monica and Malibu Beach . The next stop will be Anaheim . Do you know where they have all those Disney parks ? After that , we should visit Las Vegas because I never been there before . 

 George , let ’ s just take it easy this time . It won ’ t make much difference whether we see all of these places or not . 

 Lili , you don ’ t understand me ! We have to go and explore the country !

Yes , but I am not sure I can stay in our van for several days . It is going to be difficult . 

 What ? You mean you are not used to living like that? Okay, let’s forget it . Don ’ t worry about the money . I will get a loan at the bank tomorrow and we will go on vacation ! How does that sound ? 

 That sounds nice !

OK , Lili , when will you be ready ? 

 Monday morning . George , you won ’ t have to drive me to work in your van this time because we don ’ t know exactly where we are going to stay . So I should find a way to get there by myself on my own . 

 George , can I see the route before our departure ? 

 Sure thing . I am making a map right now . Just wait . 

(SPEAKER)

Lili and George will be going to vacation in their van. They are both happy about the idea of taking a holiday without any money. They will be sleeping in the van, spending very little on food and gas, having fun during daytime. George is not satisfied with this trip because he cannot take Lili to work everyday. The map is being prepared so they can start their journey at once.

(LISTENER)

Okay ! I can’t wait ! 

 Lili , stop day dreaming and pack up quickly ! We have to leave in the morning! 

 George . What are you saying ? I will be ready in five minutes . And what do you mean that we ’ re going to eat Chinese food all along the trip ?
