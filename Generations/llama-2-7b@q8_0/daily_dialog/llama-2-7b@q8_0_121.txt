I started it when my brother died . I was so devastated by his death and I had no one to talk to about how I felt . My friend suggested me that I should start a blog and she offered help me set up a blog site . So , I accepted her advice . I think it's the best way for me to let people know my feelings about him . 

 what kind of blog did you create ? 

 at first , I was going to write just like an online diary . But after some time , I found that it is more interesting to post comments on other people's blog sites . So I started to leave comments on several different blog sites . It turned out that people liked my comment a lot and they started visiting my own blog site too . 

 so what kind of topics are you writing about ? 

 actually , there is no specific topic that I am writing about . The main aim of the blog is to share with others how much I miss him . So everything relating to his death or memories that I have about him can be posted in my blog . Sometimes , when people leave a comment on my site , they ask me whether I would like to write more details about what happened and some times I do write it in the site too . 

 but why did you choose to publish your comments ? 

 I'm not sure . Maybe because most of the blogs that I read are published and when I started posting a comment , I realized that many people like my thoughts so I continued doing it . 

 how do you feel about other people reading what you write ? 

 at first , I felt a little bit hesitant about the publicity but after some times, I got used to the idea and now I don't mind if strangers read what I write . In fact , many of my readers are not even friends or family members . 

 do you think that your blog helps people to know more about your feelings ? 

 yes it does . It doesn't matter how big the audience is as long as they can understand me better . 

 how often do you post in your site ? 

 I normally write one or two new posts a week . But sometimes there are special occasions and I will spend more time writing about them . 

 would you like to become famous with your blog? 

 no , not really . I think that the main aim of my blog is to share what happened in my life and I don't care too much if other people read it or not . I'm just happy that my brother's friends get to know more about him through the information on my site . 

 well , thank you for your time . Do you have any advice for bloggers who are just starting out ? 

 sure thing ! First of all , don't be afraid to share with other people what is happening in your life . Secondly , don't try to copy other people 's works too much because they might find it uninteresting . Finally , try not to post anything that would hurt the feelings of others .

Well , most of my posts are on Chinese politics and economics . I also have a few posts on the local community in which I live . 

 that's very interesting . I think it is more interesting than reading some news articles . 

 yes , that's true . 

 ok. So what's your blog called ? 

 well, it's called "The Blogger from the East" . 

 that sounds good ! so when was your last post ? 

 I don't know exactly . But I think my last post is about two months ago . It was on the development of China's economy . 

 and how do you usually get ideas for new posts ? 

 most of the time , I write what I see or read in the newspaper . Sometimes, people would also leave comments asking for my opinion about certain issues. 

 oh, that seems to be a good way of getting ideas . 

 yeah ! it really works ! 

 well, I think that's all . Thank you very much ! 

 thank you very much .

not as often as I used to be . At first , it was almost every day . But since I began working , I can only find some time when I get home and spend it writing posts instead of hanging out with my friends . 

 how many visitors do you normally have per week ? 

 well , I don't know exactly . There are thousands who read my blogs every day but I just use a free website so there is no way to figure it out . 

 oh ! That's a pity . If your blog gets popular one day , you could make some money off of it ! 

 I know . But that will never happen any time soon . To me , the most important thing is just for my friends and family back home to get an update on what happened in the US once in a while .

not now . Because I'm here studying . 

 oh , I see . Where do you study ? 

 I go to a language school in San Francisco . 

 where is San Francisco ? 

 It 's located on the west coast of California . 

 Wow . How big is it? 

 it's a small city and not too far from Los Angeles . 

 oh , I see . What kind of courses are you taking in your school ? 

 English classes and I have to take public speaking class as well . 

 what do you think about those courses so far? 

 the public speaking class is interesting because we can talk about different things on our own topics . The English classes aren't too bad either , but it seems that my teacher has a hard time making us understand some complicated grammar points . 

 why ? 

 I think she tries to be very formal and goes into details sometimes without considering how difficult the subject may be for us foreigners . But if I were you , I'd do exactly what she tells me because she's been here for a long time and has more experience than anyone else in class . 

 oh , that's a good idea . Do you have any other ideas on how to make her lessons better ? 

 it depends . If she wants us students to come up with our own topics , I think we should choose interesting ones so we can speak about something exciting without having problems expressing ourselves in English . 

 that sounds good . But what if we can 't find any ideas on our own ? 

 I don't know . Maybe we could ask her for some help . 

 yes , maybe she could suggest a few topics to us so we won't run out of ideas during class . 

 sure . Good idea! Do you have anything else planned for today? 

 not really . I think it's time I should go home and study English by myself . 

 ok then , goodbye !
