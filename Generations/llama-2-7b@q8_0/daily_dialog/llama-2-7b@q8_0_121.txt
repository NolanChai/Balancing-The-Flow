" well , most of my blog entries are on travel , food and culture . Recently , I wrote a post on the 9/11 memorial as part of my New York trip series ."

" wow ! How did you decide to start your first blog entry ? "

" actually it was my boyfriend who motivated me to write down my thoughts and experience at that time . I didn't expect to have a blog but he encouraged me to do so . Then , he suggested that we set up a travel blog together which is what we are doing right now."

" oh ! So you are an experienced travel writer ? "

" not quite . My blog doesn't get much traffic or readership . But I learn from other writers and hope to be able to write well like them in future ."

" how about you ? What do you usually write about on your blog ? "

" my blog is more of an online journal for me . I don't really plan what to write or where to go but rather write about the things that I do and think along the way."

" so are you also a travel writer ? "

" not at all ! Travelling is something I enjoy doing but writing isn't one of my strength . I prefer to share pictures instead ."

" It'd be at least three times in a week . "

" Wow ! I can hardly get one for the whole year . You must be very hard working and have plenty of time to spare . "

" Well , it doesn't mean that I don't have any other things to do . In fact , I often have more to do than I can handle in a day . "

" Then, how come you can get so much time for blogging ? "

" Because I think blogging is one of the most important and fun things that I need to do . It keeps me connected with my friends and families back home , helps me express myself better when I'm trying hard to learn English, and makes me feel more confident as a writer . "

" Yeah . That sounds great ! Do you get any pay for writing ? "

" Well, that's the good thing about blogging . There is no specific goal , no reward and no requirement of time or money . What I get from it is happiness . "

" So, do you plan to write a book one day ? "

" You know what ? I might just publish my own book when I'm done with college . Maybe after that , people can read my blog on paper ! "

" sure ! Even though there is no one comments , I still keep writing the articles . "
