" so you're quitting ? "

" yeah , sort of . "

" that's too bad Amelia. I think this will be hard for everyone else in the office , especially Drew . "

" yah , I know . But it's a decision that I had to make . I hope you understand. "

" Oh ? Where are you going then ? "

" it's not decided yet . But there is an option to stay in Australia , which is what I want . So , my decision has been made ! "

" Wow ! Well , that sounds like good news for you . Are you moving on your own or with the family ? "

" well, it depends . Let's wait and see . "

" how long will it take for your new position to start ? "

" they said 2 months at the earliest , but more likely 3 or 4 . "

" well that's great news ! When do you leave here ? "

" I don't know . I haven't actually told my boss yet . I need to go away for a few days and think it over first . "

" sure , but if you like your new job , just do it then and there ! If the money's good enough, you have no obligation to give them any notice at all . Just say you're going to start working straightaway . "

" well , I guess you've got a point there. Thanks for talking me through it Amelia . It really helps . "

" I hear what you say about using English . I'm not sure how it works for you but if I'm honest , I prefer speaking Mandarin . "

" well , it's like this . If I talk to my bosses in English , they can only understand half of what I'm saying . But when I speak Mandarin with them , I know exactly how everything sounds . "

" but surely that wouldn't be so bad ? Wouldn't you rather understand 80 percent of what's being said to you than nothing at all ? "

" I guess it's a good point . But there are other reasons why I prefer speaking in Mandarin , which is the language of my country and where I grew up . I mean , if I want to use English to communicate with overseas companies then I need to practice it as much as possible so that it doesn't become too difficult for me to express myself properly . "

" well , that's true . But perhaps you'll be surprised how quickly your skills will improve once you start using English regularly in the office ! "

" but you know what ? I think I prefer speaking Chinese . "

" oh , thank you ! That means a lot to me . "

" it was no problem . "
