oh really ? Why? 

 the job is just too stressful for me . I can't stand the constant pressure any longer . I think it's time to quit. 

 that's a shame , Amelia , since you've been there for quite some time now . 

 yes , but maybe it was better if I had left sooner ? 

 why do you say that ? 

 well , since you know me very well by now and my personality quite well, I can only hope that the company will find a suitable replacement fast enough so that nobody notices too much. 

 ok . You're absolutely right in saying that . 

 thank you for understanding . 

 you're welcome , Amelia . Now I have to go and make some phone calls , bye !

but , we have a lot of projects underway, and there are many more we need you for . What about the pay raise ? The bonus ? 

 Amelia , I am going to miss this job very much . But as you know, I've been thinking about my future for a while now. I want to move into a more creative field. I was accepted at an arts college and they have agreed to take me without any qualifications. The only thing is the tuition fees are quite high . 

 what ? You can afford that ? 

 well , not entirely . But my parents offered to help out with it as a surprise birthday present for me. And since you're giving us both a bonus, I have enough saved up for the rest of my tuition . 

 so you quit your job because you got an arts degree scholarship ? That seems crazy ! 

 actually , Amelia , this is something that I've wanted to do for a long time. You see, when I was little I always wanted to be an artist . 

 but I had no confidence in myself at all . My parents told me not to waste my life on art and pushed me towards science instead . I just did it because I thought they knew better. But now that I've grown up , I know I can do whatever I want with my life . And that is what I intend to do. 

 well , if you ask me, this is the craziest thing of all. You could have got a loan , or saved your money . 

 but it's not as simple as that Amelia . My family couldn't afford that kind of payment and now they will be able to help with my studies . It's going to give us all a second chance in life . We are so happy about this opportunity . I can hardly wait to tell my parents ! 

 well , it does sound like you want to do something you really care about. And I respect your decision, and that is why I have been saving up to get a good start with our new company . I know you'll be able to do whatever you set your mind on Amelia . So if this is what makes you happy , then good luck in everything you do .

oh ? Where from ? 

 yes , the company that wants me has more opportunities for my career . It also offers a higher salary and much better perks . 

 okay ... But what about your co-workers here at this firm ? Are you sure they won't miss you ? 

 yeah , I am . My co-workers will be happy that I left because the company is going to shrink even more and I was actually one of the most troublesome members of staff here . So they should all be pleased that I left !

are they paying a higher salary or better benefits ? 

 both . And there's more . They're offering me a car and accommodation for my family too . 

 wow ! that sounds great , Amelia . I hope everything works out well for you . 

 thanks . Well , it's been nice talking to you again . Hope we can meet soon.

oh ? That's interesting ! You didn't tell me that before ! 

 well , you never asked . Anyway , it sounds like things are going well for you too . What's new in your life? 

 my girlfriend and I just had our first baby and we named her Kirsten . It was a difficult pregnancy but she's finally here ! She looks so beautiful . 

 oh ? Congratulations again . What do you think of being a father ? 

 well , it's certainly different from the way I imagined . The baby is always hungry and I'm learning to deal with that . But on the whole, it's a really rewarding experience. 

 well , as for me , I'm just about ready to start my new life in New York . I guess our paths will never cross again ! 

 oh ? That makes me a little sad ! I'll miss working with you here and having lunch with you every day . 

 I hope it won't be the last time we speak , but I'm sure things will work out fine in New York for both of us .

thanks . I really appreciate your help . It's been fun working with you . 

 me too , Amelia. Hopefully we can stay in touch once I get settled overseas . 

 ok then. Let's go back to work now . Good luck !
