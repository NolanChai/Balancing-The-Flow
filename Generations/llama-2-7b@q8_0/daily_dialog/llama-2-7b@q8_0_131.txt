" Didn't they pay any social security or workers' compensation for her death ? "

" Not enough for us to live on without my income . "

" Well , Dad, I am thinking of buying a $ 250,000 policy with a $ 65 monthly premium and a $ 75,000 payout. It would be available from day one . "

" What's your age ? "

" 38."

" When do you intend to die? "

" I have a few years in me yet , Dad , but don't feel comfortable with that policy . I like the one on which if you drown, they pay double. If you are attacked by wild animals or die in an airplane crash or any crazy, stupid accident , they pay only once."

" But, son, there is no such thing ! "

" It's in your policy . I checked it out on the Internet and I have been saving money ever since. Don't bother to say that I didn't tell you anything . You'll never know how much you were spared by taking advantage of my advice. I knew this would be a shock, but now that we have had time to reflect , let us move on."

" I don't think there is any more need for insurance . "

" You have given me the greatest gift anyone could ever ask for, and I thank you from my heart ! "

" Dad, I understand what you mean, but I'd rather not discuss this topic . "

" Okay . But please give it some serious thought . I will call your mother and ask her about you . Bye. "

"Hello Mom ? "

" Hi , how are you ? "

" Good . How is Dad doing ? "

" He's fine, but he asked me to tell you that you should buy life insurance as soon as possible . "

" Oh , I see . Do you know about it ? "

" No , not really . I don't want to be reminded of death and things like that . But you should consider buying one anyway . "

" Okay, thanks for the advice. Bye Mom. "

"How's it going ? "

"It's fine , but I'm feeling a little tired."

"Want to go get something to eat?"

"Not really . I just need to rest for a bit."

"Oh, okay. Are you sure that you don't want to come with me ? It'll be fun ."

"I wish I could , but I have an appointment tomorrow morning at 9:00 and it's too late to drive home now . "

"Hmmm. Well, if you don't feel like going out tonight , we can still hang out in my room."

"I guess that would be okay for a little while , but I need to go home eventually . "

"Well , it's a date then ! "

"Sounds good. Can you pick me up at 9:00 sharp ? "

"It will be my pleasure."

"Good night. See you later, bye."

"Hey , how are you doing ? "

"I'm fine , thanks . How about yourself?"

"Pretty good . What's new with your boyfriend ? I haven't seen him around lately . "

"That's because he has been working a lot to pay for our wedding and honeymoon . "

"Aww, that's so nice of him."

"It is . We should have some pictures taken in the next couple days if everything goes according to schedule . "

"Oh , you mean your engagement photo ? I can't wait to see how it turned out ! "

"I know. Neither can I . "
