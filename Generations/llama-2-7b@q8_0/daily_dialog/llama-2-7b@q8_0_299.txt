" Could you show me how much the bell-bottom pants are by themselves ? "

" No, sir ! That's our policy. We don't sell items separately here at Sears . "

" Then why don't you have signs on the coats to tell us how much they cost without the bottoms? "

The customer had made his point and was not about to let it go any further.

So, if you want to save some money this Christmas, come to the one-price shop.

I'm so glad I never owned a pair of bellbottoms!
I think that's the best one yet! I didn't read all the ones but this one is really funny.
