The Dragon Boat Festival, or Duanwu Jie 端午节 / 端儀节 , is an important Chinese public holiday celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month according to the lunar calendar. It honors Qu Yuan (340–278 BC), a famous poet and politician of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. His suicide by drowning himself in Miluo River is said to have been caused by the fall of his native state, as well as political persecution by its successors, so on this day, people traditionally race dragon boats and eat Zongzi (雜碼) , a kind of Chinese food.

## History

Qu Yuan was banished from his home because he opposed corruption among the Chu state's government. He spent his time writing poetry that reflected the suffering of the common people in ancient China. A poem titled Li Sao (離騷) is one of his greatest works, which describes him as "drifting on a raft alone", unable to return home or go elsewhere.

The festival originated in 214 BC when the third-century poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in a river after being banished for opposing corruption among the royal court of Chu. The local people raced their boats on the river to save him from drowning, and dropped rice dumplings into the water as food to lure fish away from Qu Yuan's body. This was because the fish were thought to be his favorite food.

The dragon boat festival became more widely known when it was made a national holiday in 1963 by the Chinese Government. It is now celebrated on the fifth day of the lunar calendar (which usually falls between May and June on the Gregorian calendar). The event also commemorates another patriotic poet, Li Bai (李白), who died in A.D. 818.

## Zongzi

Traditional zongzi are triangular-shaped bamboo baskets filled with sticky rice and wrapped with banana leaves or reed leaves. There is a variety of fillings including sweet red bean paste, glutinous rice with meat filling, savory pork, etc., but the most commonly used type is sticky rice with salted egg yolk inside. This kind of zongzi is also known as "zhong" (粽) .

The festival's food also includes Zhongzi 馅子 and Tangyuan 汤圆. The word tangyuan literally means "round ball", which refers to the round shape of glutinous rice balls, usually filled with sweet fillings such as red bean paste or black sesame paste. It is one of the most popular festival foods in Chinese culture and a traditional New Year food.

Dragon boat racing, as well as eating Zongzi and drinking realgar wine (硫黃酒), is an important part of the festival in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and other areas with large Chinese communities. The dragon boats are made of wood, usually from teak or other fine hardwoods and covered with skin or cloth, and they have a dragon's head and tail at the bow and stern, respectively; they are rowed by 20 to 70 paddlers in a sitting position, facing toward the bow of the boat.

Dragon Boat Races take place on the fifth day of the fifth month, in memory of the suicide of the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan who drowned himself in Miluo River because his political views were not accepted by Emperor Chu. It is believed that if he could have reached land on this particular date, he would be rescued from death.
