### Heroes 

My father was in the army as well. He also went to war but didn't make it back alive. Thatâ€™s why, every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . You were showing respect and admiration for them . I wish I were a hero . Then my mom wouldn't call me "pig" anymore .
