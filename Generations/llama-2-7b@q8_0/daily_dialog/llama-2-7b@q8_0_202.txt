" Sure . " ( The salesman looks at the book , nodding his head in agreement and punches out a ticket )

" That'll be $3.00 please . "

" OK , here you go."

(The man hands the salesman the ticket)

"Thanks a lot !"

(The salesman looks at the ticket )

" I think this is for the wrong amount . " (The man turns around to see who has been behind him )

" Oh , that's OK . I don't really need three thousand dollars, just three hundred US Dollars . "

"Oh ! Sorry . I didn't look at my ticket."

Answer: I have to say it is the most obvious and well known proverb in English.
The \strong{\em{real question}} should be what are some other similar idioms or proverbs in your native language.

" One hundred , five hundred and one thousand dollar travelers' cheques. "

" Okay, what denominations do you need them ? "

" Five hundeds dollars."

" That's not a denomination, that is an amount."

" Oh , sorry about that . What is your passport number please ? "

" 1432879. "

" All right , I need to see your passport also."

" I don't have my passport with me. "

" Then I can only sell you two thousand US dollars of traveler's checks . "

" Why not three thousand ? "

" The limit is two thousand US dollars in travelers' cheques per person, unless you present your passport."

" But my passport says that I have four thousand dollars available to me. "

" Well, we are only going by what the bank computer has told us."

" What about my Visa card ? That's good for five thousand US dollars . "

" Yes , it is but we can only honor those if you present your passport in person and sign the form. "

" Can I send you a fax of my passport so that you can sell me three thousand dollars worth of traveler's cheques ? "

" No, sorry. I can't do that."

" Okay , how about this . Can I use your phone to call the bank and order three thousand dollars in travelers' checks over the telephone so they can be shipped to me by airmail ? "

" I don't know if we have a fax machine here. "

" Look , let me show you something . This is my Visa card . If I put it on your desk and type in my four digit pin number, will that satisfy the bank computer to authorize three thousand US dollars in traveler's checks ? "

" Well... yes . "

" Okay. Now, can you sell me three thousand US dollars in travelers' cheques with a one hundred dollar service charge , please ? "

" Sure , but I can only do it if I see your passport."

" But my Visa card proves that I am authorized to withdraw four thousand dollars. "

" That is true, but we are required by law to get your signature on the traveler's cheques sales form and to photocopy your passport as well."

" Okay , can you do that over the phone ? "

" No . I am afraid not. We are a branch office so all transactions must be handled through our head office in London or by courier. We cannot process travelers' cheques for our customers. You will have to send us your passport and then we can complete the transaction. Is that understood ? "

" Yes . Thanks."

" Thanks . "

The next morning she comes into my room and says: " I made a terrible mistake ! They were stolen at once. "

I said: " Didn 't you know how much they were for ? You should have gotten some change."
