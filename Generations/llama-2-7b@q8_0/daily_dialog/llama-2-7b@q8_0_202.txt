300 euros please ! 

 Ok . Do you know your PIN number? 

 No, I don't ! 

 Alright . Then would you like to get a new one? 

 Yes, please! 

 Alright. Let me write down the amount and the new PIN-Number for you:  

 300 euros - 123456. 

 Thank you very much ! 

 Bye bye.

You don't have to give me the passbook . Just write down what is in it and bring the book back later . 

 I know I don't have to but that's not the point . Just put the amount in cash. 

 Fine . Now do you want a pen? 

 A pen ? 

 Yes , a ballpoint pen . You can use it here for writing down your number, which is on this slip of paper and you should keep it safe so that I don't have to ask you again. 

 Can I also have some stamps? 

 Sure . We have them. Do you know the denomination ? 

 No , I think they are all different sizes . 

 Well, all right. Here is a stamp. You should use it whenever you send us letters or anything like that. 

 All right. That's fine now . And what do you need a pencil for? 

 For my calculations . 

 That's alright. You may also take one. Now, I have to go and ask someone if he will lend us the money, which we would need in order to give you all that stuff.
