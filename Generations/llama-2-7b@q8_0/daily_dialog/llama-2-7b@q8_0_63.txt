Yes . Many times ! But this time it didn't work well . 

 Tell me about your experience . 

 It was so bad that my friend , who used the same site before , told me it could never happen to him . He had a very good shopping experience there . I have never known what happened because he never mentioned it . So when I tried to shop online and make the payment with Paypal , it didn't work . I think I was cheated . 

 How did you know that ? What actually happened ? 

 When I got into their website and clicked 'Buy now' , I was led to another page to fill in some information , such as my email address , credit card number , etc . 

 You must be careful when you are filling out the information . It is a very common trick of online stores . If they steal your information , it might cause a big damage . They may use the bank cards or cheque books for making their own purchases or they can sell your personal information to other people who make frauds on Internet . 

 That's really bad ! What did you do after that ? 

 I was very angry and decided to go back home right away . Then I saw a red line below the 'Buy now' button . When I clicked it , I found out that this website had been banned by Paypal for fraudulent activities . So they were not allowed to receive payments from people who use Paypal . 

 That's good ! But you should be careful even when you shop online with your credit cards or debit cards . You can ask the customer services of your bank about this matter . They will tell you what precautions you need to take if they are going to refuse payments made by you because their stores are reported for fraudulent activities .

You need a valid e-mail account to register an online store . In fact , there is nothing difficult . 

 Can you tell me which one is easier to operate , an online or a real shop ? 

 I ’ m sure both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages . An online shopping site can save us a lot of time . As for the real shop , we needn ’ t wait long lines to find what we want .
