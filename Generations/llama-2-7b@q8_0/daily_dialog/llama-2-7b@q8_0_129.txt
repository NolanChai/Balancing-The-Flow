" A steak ! "

" Oh ! Sorry about that . Let me try again , what would you like for a main course ? "

" Hmm ... Well I was thinking about having a juicy steak with some mashed potatoes and salad on the side. "

" That sounds really good , so are we going to be eating in or taking out ? "

" Oh ! Sorry again . Let me try again , are you saying that you want us to eat at your place ? "

" Vegan ... I don't eat anything that comes from an animal . "

" Oh OK . That's fine with me too ... let me go get my keys and jacket ... "
