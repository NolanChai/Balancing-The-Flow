Wow, thats so great ! There is this place called Moo Moo's that serves the best steaks in town. It is just around the corner from my house . 

 That sounds awesome ! What do you think ?

 I totally agree ! We should go there right now. Its a little early , but we will be there as soon as it opens .

 Great ! So we can meet there at like seven in the morning, or is that too early ?

 Yes, seven AM works perfectly for me, so let's do it!

No , I just don't like how the animals get treated for food . 

 I hear you , and I respect your decision to be Vegetarian . Now let me ask you this ; what will it take for you to eat meat again ? 

 It's not about eating meat again ! I am not going back to eating meat! But it would probably have to be a really big steak , and I would have to be in the middle of nowhere with no options at all . 

 How long until we are there Julie ? 

 Let's hope soon, but let me ask you this again. Do you think that what I am doing right now is morally wrong? 

 Absolutely not ! What would make you say such a thing ? 

 Well , I was just thinking , if we were out in the middle of nowhere with no options , and I wanted to eat meat, what would your answer be then ? 

 I don't know . That seems like a pretty extreme case. Let me think on it for a bit . 

 OK . Just so you know, it's been about five minutes since we started driving. How are those options coming along? 

 They look good to me , but I have had no experience with this restaurant yet! What do they normally offer ? 

 Well , my experience is that they always have some kind of special dishes . They are famous for their steaks and pasta ! 

 OK . I can't wait to try the pasta ! I love Pasta ! I hope there isn't anything on your plate that looks like meat or eggs! 

 Don't worry about it Julie , you will be fine. I will just be sure not to get any pasta that is cooked with cheese or red sauce . 

 How about we head inside and see if there are any tables available ? 

 That sounds great ! Oh , but before we go in, let me ask one last time : What makes you think what I am doing right now is morally wrong? 

 You will have to explain yourself because my answer has not changed . 

 OK , well what do you say we just get some food and talk about it when we are done ? 

 Sounds good to me! But I feel like we've covered a lot of ground already !

Vegetarians don't eat meat , but vegans don't eat anything that comes from an animal - they are even careful of things like honey and cheese. 

 Wait . How can you eat cheese if it comes from a cow ? It would be dairy cheese right ? 

 That is a great question ! Dairy products do come from cows , but vegans don't consume any products that are produced using animal by-products - like milk, cream, whey or anything else. They also avoid gelatin which can be made from an animals bones and skin . 

 So you just eat fruits and vegetables then ? 

 That is a really good question ! I do eat a lot of produce , but I have to be careful because there are other things that may contain animal products. Things like soy sauce or rice wine can contain fish - something as simple as a fruit smoothie could also have gelatin . You would think the list would be easy to read, but it is not always very clear - and even some items are misleading in their labeling . 

 Wow . I never realized how complicated that was ! So , if you wanted to eat something like a vegan pizza or pasta sauce , where would you go to get it ? 

 Well , the good news is that there is an entire community of people who are part of this lifestyle - and they are often willing to share recipes, or even prepare meals for one another. They also have a wide variety of stores and restaurants that will cater specifically to them . 

 That makes sense ! Do you have any favorite vegan dishes ? 

 I love Thai food , but there is one thing about it - the curry paste that they use usually contains fish sauce or shrimp paste. Some brands are vegan though and you can read the label to be sure . I also really enjoy Indian food and their specialties like dahl soup, tikka masala and naan bread are all vegan as long as it isn't made with ghee - butter that is clarified by heating. 

 OK . So I will need to watch what ingredients they use in the foods that we get ! 

 You know , even if you don't identify as being a vegan , or are interested in following this lifestyle - it can be really good for our environment and overall health. 

 Yeah . I hear that meat production has huge impact on climate change . Do you think a lot of people have considered going more plant based ? 

 Sure ! We all know that the world's population is growing , but there are other factors that may contribute to this shift . As much as I hate to admit it - millennials aren't really into eating meat and they even seem to be rejecting dairy products. They do not want to eat anything with a face or an eye - so we might see the future of food being more plant based because that is what is becoming more popular .

Actually , it is quite easy nowadays . There are so many options out there for vegan products . They make all kinds of foods from mushrooms to chocolate with no dairy or eggs in them ! Plus I have cut out meat and dairy which helps me lose weight. My doctor was very happy that my cholesterol is down , but not so happy that it took me 40 years for the vegan diet to kick-in ! 

 You are hilarious Julie !! You have no idea how many people I know who need to make a change and you always lighten up the mood when you come around with your stories ! I am going to try that diet , but I doubt it is going to work out . 

 No way ! I bet you will like it once you get used to it . Maybe we should go on an adventure together soon ? 

 Yeah . That sounds good . You are not vegan though are you Julie ? 

 No , but I want to eat healthier so maybe this diet is for me too. It's not like I am going to have to give up my favorite foods though because they still make delicious and yummy things that aren't meat . Like the ice cream from Ben & Jerry's or even the vegan burgers are amazing ! 

 Wow . I bet ! I love them too so I will definitely try it out with you ! I need to find some more energy though . I am feeling kind of tired and not as healthy as I normally feel . 

 Oh no , what's going on ? Have you been sick ? 

 No . It is just that I have felt tired lately. Maybe because I have been doing a lot of work at home . Like right now I am trying to fix up this room so it will look better for when the kids get back from school tomorrow . Plus it is a great excuse not to go out and socialize . 

 It is OK if you don't feel like going out . Maybe we can come over later tonight after your kids go to bed and have some coffee ? 

 Yeah ! That sounds good ! I haven't seen you in ages Julie , so it would be great to catch up ! But I need to get my room done first . 

 Sure ! I understand . I'll stop by around dinner time or whenever you finish. It will just be the two of us then ? 

 Yep ! Just me and my mom who is coming over to help me with all of the projects we have lined up for tomorrow morning . But it will definitely be worth it because she does amazing work. I am not sure if you are familiar with her Julie , but she has an Instagram account where she posts pictures of all kinds of cute things she makes. 

 Wow . Sounds like your mom is pretty cool ! 

 Yeah ! You should check out her page . She doesn't have a lot of followers yet though . I don't know why , because everything she does is just amazing and she puts her whole heart into it every time . 

 Sure ! That sounds like fun . I love finding new people on Instagram. You never know what kinds of stuff you will find there . Like this past weekend I was looking through my feed and found a bunch of posts from other moms who are vegan too. Some even have blogs or websites with recipes that we can try out together ! 

 Oh wow ! That's so cool Julie ! You know , I think you are right . Maybe it is time for me to try this diet too . But first I need to find a new phone though. My current one doesn't have as much memory space on it and the camera quality isn't as good as yours is either . So I am going to go buy another one today so I can start taking better pictures of my food ! 

 Wow . That sounds like fun Julie ! I'll be sure to follow you on Instagram once I get a new phone too. You should have your mom take some pictures of her work and post them for me , because I know she is going to do an amazing job on everything ! Oh man . I can't wait until dinner time so we can hang out . 

 Great ! We will see each other soon then Julie .
