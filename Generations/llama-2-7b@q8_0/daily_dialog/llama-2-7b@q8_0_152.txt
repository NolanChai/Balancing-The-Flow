Mr Smith's remains are now being prepared for viewing . We will be ready to receive you at twelve noon tomorrow . 


I've already sent flowers and a card . What else can I do ? 

 Well ... We have just received the family's new address , if you wish , you may send a sympathy card. 

 The funeral home will be in contact with them to coordinate delivery of all items from Mr Smith's service.

My wife was his sister . He lived with her after they got married ... 

 You may see him if you like . Just stand back from the casket until it's time to leave . 

 The service is scheduled to start at four o'clock , and we must get you home before then . 

 But you can sit right here in this chair , Mr . Smith , with your head resting on ... 

 No . Please let me just stand up by the casket for a while . I don't know what to do . 

 Just sit back and relax . There is nothing you could have done differently . 

 But if it would help, you can talk to your wife about this later , once the shock wears off . 

 Okay ? Well , see you at four then .
