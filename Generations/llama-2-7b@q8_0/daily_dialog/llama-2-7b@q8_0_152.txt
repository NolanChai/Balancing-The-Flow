" No . I just wasn't prepared for him to be ... "

" Right . We can't predict death . And when you think about it , we don't really want to prepare for it either. It's something that happens outside of our control, so it makes us feel more vulnerable . But what do people say in a situation like this ? "

" Well ... I don't know . We have to be professional , right ? "

" Exactly ! Now I need you two ladies to look over some papers for me. We've got a funeral tomorrow afternoon at the chapel next door and we'll need to set up chairs for all of our guests. The family has requested an open casket service , so the deceased's face will be exposed to everyone there . Now I'm going to hand you each one of these envelopes, and inside is a picture of Mr . Smith. When I take you downstairs , he will be lying in his casket , right here at this spot. I want you two ladies to memorize that face so you can help me direct the guests tomorrow where to sit, and what direction they should look at while the service is going on . "

The funeral director held up one of the envelopes for each of them. "All right , now let's go downstairs . " The two women followed behind him, not quite sure how this was going to work out. They were led into a basement room that had three caskets lined up against the back wall and a large light fixture hanging from the ceiling directly over Mr. Smith.

The funeral director took the envelope from one of the women, and held it up so she could get a good look at the deceased's face. "Now , do you remember him ? " he asked her . She didn't hesitate before answering him with a definite yes. They switched places and now Mr. Smith was being shown to the other woman, who again identified the man as her best friend. The funeral director then took their envelopes back upstairs , and told them they were excused from further duties .

The women found themselves in front of a casket, and once again, saw the deceased's face. "Is that him ? " one of them asked . "Yes it is ! " replied the other.

The next day at the funeral , Mr. Smith was lying in his casket just as he had been when the women were shown to him downstairs. The funeral director walked over and stood behind one of the ladies so she could get a good look at Mr. Smith's face . "Do you remember what this man looked like ? " he asked her . "Yes , I do . " she answered .

The funeral director then moved to the other side, where the other woman was standing and staring at her friend's face in his casket. The funeral director held up a picture of Mr. Smith so that she could get a good look at him. "Do you remember this man ? " he asked . She didn't hesitate before answering him with another definite yes.

The next day, the women were back at work, and once again they saw the deceased lying in his casket. One of them was able to recognize her friend right away , and she took a good look at Mr. Smith's face so that she would know where to direct all of their guests. The funeral director then held up a picture of Mr. Smith for the other lady to see. "Do you remember what he looked like ? " he asked . She didn't hesitate before answering him with another yes .
