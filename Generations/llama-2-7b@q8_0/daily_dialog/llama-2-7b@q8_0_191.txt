" I think you're right . It will be more special because it has three diamonds in each ring . "

" No . It won't make any difference to me . "

" The last time we went out, we didn't really get a chance to talk about anything. You were on your phone most of the time and then you had to go home. I don't know how serious this is going to be for us but I want to make sure we take it slow . "

" I guess you have every right not to like me. You are just a jerk though . "

" What ? "

" That was a long time ago. Things were different back then . "

" It wasn't that long ago . We got married in May and we've been together ever since . "

" Well, it is true that we have some differences to work out but I want us to try again anyway. If we give up now, it will be over before it starts. "

" I can't even believe you just said that ! "

" I don't know what to say . You have to tell me how to make things right for you. Tell me what to do and I'll try my best to make it happen. "
