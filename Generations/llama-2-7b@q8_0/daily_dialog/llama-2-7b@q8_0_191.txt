Now let us find out how much they are worth ... 

### ****

This is a very simple trick. 

The diamond in one ring (let's say it's this one) is worth $1,458. 

That makes the price of each ring $1,458 + 3 * 1,458 = $4,872 . 

How much is that in British Pounds ? It takes $4,872 and divide it by £0.69 to get £7,140 ... or roughly $14,300 .

You have to wait until the right guy comes along , not just any old man will do ! 

 They'll say they love you but it won't really matter . 

 One day , I'll buy myself something big ! 

 Oh that would be nice ! 

 It's all about how you wear them . 

 Ooh ! How sexy ! 

 Stop it ! 

 Don't go in the water . 

 You'll get wet ! 

 But they don't bother me , I just use them as a fashion accessory ! 

 What !?!? You do wear them every day ? 

 They are kind of expensive but I feel better if I have them on . 

 What is it about diamonds that makes you feel this way ? 

 It's my birth stone . 

 Well , the first time I ever got one from a boyfriend was when I turned 18 . 

 That was my high school boyfriend ! He bought them for me every month and he used to call and talk to me all the time , and then he moved away after graduation ! 

 After that , I started getting diamonds from other guys in college ! It made me feel special ! 

 I don't think they have any special properties . They are just rocks! 

 What ?!? They're not worth much at all - it's just a rock ! 

 Yeah but they still look pretty . 

 They are actually very expensive for what you get . 

 It depends on how good they are , I guess. 

 You don't have any diamonds ? 

 No , and I never will ! 

 I really like them - they make me feel happy when I wear them . 

 Really ? Well maybe I'll get one sometime .
