" What is it then , doctor ? "

" Well , this is the result of the blood test . "

" Oh my ! "

" Take a look at your hand , young man . Your life is in there . Do you understand now ? You are lucky I found out about it before something else happened to you . If that was left unchecked for longer ..."

" But how did this happen ? "

" Well , from what we can tell , your blood contains too much iron . The levels of haemoglobin in the blood have become too high and the liver cannot keep up with removing it. Your red blood cells are bursting . This is called hemolysis . Do you understand now ? "

" No . I don't know any medical terms . What do we do then ? "

" Well , there isn't much we can do except watch and wait . The levels of iron in your body will keep increasing until they reach a point where it is fatal . "

" Fatal !? Are you sure ? "

" Yes ... "

" What about treatment then ? "

" There isn't anything else we can do for now . "

" But I don't want to die , doctor . How long will it take me to die anyway ? "

" We don't know ... Maybe a few weeks , maybe a month or two ... maybe even longer . "

" Doctor ... please ... What does that mean? Do you think I have another year of my life left then ? Two years perhaps? Three at most ? How can I live like this ? Is there any way to treat me and cure me ? "

The doctor shakes his head. "I'm sorry , young man . We simply do not know how to cure it at the moment ."

"Please don't give up hope just yet ... If we can get you into another hospital , there is a possibility that they will have something new . We are making arrangements for you now so don't worry , it won't be too long before you will be transferred to a better place . "

"Yes , I believe you . Thanks doctor , thank you so much ... "

The doctor shakes his head again. "I hope that they will have something there too , young man."

The young man coughs and shuts his eyes as he slowly turns away to face the wall again. He has been told the same things many times before . They will never have any answers for him ...

### Hematology

The study of blood and blood disorders is called hematology or haematology (/ˈhiːmətɒlədʒi/; from Greek αἷμα, haima "blood" + -λογία, logia "study"). Hematologists are physicians with specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of blood. The field was created by William Osler, who called for more attention to hematology in 1894:

It is time that this subject, which so affects our life and health, should have a separate existence as an independent branch of medicine ... In many cases it becomes the special duty of the general practitioner to deal with these diseases, not merely as they come into his hands, but by continuous study, keeping abreast of all that is done in this field.

Hematology has three main branches:

1. Coagulation disorders and hemostasis: the clotting mechanism and bleeding tendencies are studied to understand their causes, pathophysiology, clinical significance and management
2. Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, including leukemias (of various types), lymphomas, and solid tumors that may also involve the hematopoietic system (such as myeloma, histiocytosis, multiple myeloma)
3. Congenital anemias and inherited disorders of blood cells (including hemolysis and other erythrocyte abnormalities)

" Doctor , my fever is worse . Can I have some medicine now ? "

" Let's wait a while longer , young man . I want to keep you out of danger . You may feel sick for a few more days . "

" But my head aches so much and I am coughing constantly . "

" That is normal in cases like yours . If you get better within two weeks , I'll be satisfied . "

" How can you say that ? You told me it would only last a few days ! "

" Just as I said before - it may last up to three weeks . "

" Doctor , my cough is much worse and I have a fever again . Is there something wrong with the medicine ? "

" Well , young man , your illness has already been in progress for several days . Don't worry. You are getting better now ! "

" I feel worse than ever before and my cough is very violent . My fever keeps rising and I don't understand what is going on here ? "

" Young man , you have a bad case of pneumonia ! It's quite serious this time . You must stay in bed and drink as much water as possible to keep your temperature down. Do not worry though - it will pass soon enough . "

" Doctor , I can hardly breathe . What should I do ? "

" Don't talk so much . Just lie there quietly and rest . It won't take long before everything gets better again ! "

" Doctor , what are you saying ? Am I going to die ? "

" Young man , that's enough . You must be calm now . You will get well soon . But in the mean time it is very important not to talk too much or cough . Do you understand ? "

" I do, Doctor - but my fever is back again and I have a terrible headache . It hurts so much ! "

" That's normal , young man . If your illness continues like this for a week or two , we will be able to get rid of it completely . Do you understand now ? "

" Yes , Doctor - but the pain is unbearable ! "

" Well, my dear boy , just bear with it for another day or two and everything will be alright ! Now get some rest before your next visit tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock . I'm very satisfied with you so far . "

The patient is not a doctor - he is just an ordinary man who went to see his doctor. He told him about a headache and a cold , but the doctor didn't believe him . The next day he came back saying that he had a fever again , which was confirmed by the doctor who said it would last only two weeks.
The patient went home thinking that everything is going to be alright now ! But his condition became worse everyday and after three days his fever rose even higher than before . He felt like dying all of a sudden and when he finally got the courage to ask for help again , he was told by the doctor that it's only temporary - nothing serious at all !
The poor man couldn't believe what was happening anymore so he decided to leave without saying goodbye! The next morning his wife called him telling him about her husband's death . She said that doctors were not able to save him because of their ignorance and stupidity , but she didn't want them knowing how angry she felt ! So here we have another example for you guys: _Doctors can be very rude sometimes_ - especially when they don't understand what is happening with someone else's body.
This article will discuss all kinds of doctors including their good and bad sides! We hope that you found it interesting because our aim was to show how important knowledge about medicine really is . If we had been able to diagnose the patient in time , he probably wouldn't have died so soon after such a short illness .

" What's wrong with me ? "

" You have tonsillitis , my dear young man ! Your fever is probably caused by an infection in your throat . "

" Oh , that explains everything . I'll be fine then ! Thanks doctor . "

" No problem . Get some rest and eat soft foods . Do not talk too much , or you may make the inflammation worse . "
