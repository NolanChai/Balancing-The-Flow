No ! 

 But your throat looks like it does to me . 

 Oh , this is nothing ! 

 You should take a look at my son. He has been sick for almost two weeks now. 

 How's he doing today ? 

 Not very well , doctor . I am afraid he has typhus . 

 Well, let us see what we can do to help you both. First, have you ever taken medication for fever and headache?

 Yes ! My friend gave me some aspirin . 

 How does it taste ? 

 It is OK , I guess. But I really hate the smell of that pills! 

 Now, let's see if I can prescribe something for you both. You seem to have a fever and a bad headache. Maybe this medicine will help you: two aspirin tablets every four hours. Take them with food, and remember not to take more than six tablets in one day.

 Great ! I'll be sure to give it to my son as soon as he wakes up .

How long has this been going on ? 

 For about two days . 

 Have you taken any medications ? 

 Yes, ibuprofen for the pain , but it hasn't helped much . 

 Well, that won't do anymore . You must go to the hospital immediately. Do you have your wallet with you ? 

 I don't think so . It's in my car . But wait! I know where I can find some money ! 

 What? 

 Yes , i left it on top of my car in my apartment building. If I hurry, maybe I can get there and back in time to catch the next train out of town. I'll be back soon . Promise !

[Warning: Short generation]

But I'm going to the school dance with my girlfriend , Doctor ! 

 Stay in bed ! 

I want to be able to walk without using my crutches. Can you help me?

Of course, Dr. Jones! The good news is that you should heal up well if we stick to your rehab plan and keep doing what you're doing.

Thanks for the confidence. I will continue to work hard at it.
