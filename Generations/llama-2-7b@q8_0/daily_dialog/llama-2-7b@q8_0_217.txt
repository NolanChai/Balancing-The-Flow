That must have been exhausting . 

 And then his face changed ... and the surgery followed .

 I guess if you're rich enough ... it makes sense to get it done in a couple of months , but I can't help but think he looked better before .

 Now that you mention it - I do think he looks more feminine than masculine ! 

 It was so sudden , though ... just one day she woke up and suddenly had all these surgical scars on her face and body ... 

 I'll say this : at least the change didn't happen in stages. 

 But that's my only complaint - it's too much, too fast , and in a single day .

He used to feel like his body was being broken down while training for the decathlon 

 But he never complained and did what he had to do . 

 That's what he said anyway ...
