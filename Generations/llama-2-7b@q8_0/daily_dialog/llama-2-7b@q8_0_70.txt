The door closed. Miss Minton walked back into the room where Mrs. Crosse was waiting. She looked at her.

" I hope you don't mind my leaving so abruptly . I'm afraid I have rather upset that nice girl."

Mrs. Crosse looked startled. " Who? What are you talking about? I haven't seen anybody in the room but you, Miss Minton!"

Miss Minton turned to her with a strange look on her face. " You didn't see her? She just came in here . I was so interested in what you said that I never noticed her at all."

" My dear," cried Mrs. Crosse, "I have seen no one but you!"

The two women looked at each other a moment in silence. Then Miss Minton sat down in the chair where the mysterious visitor had been standing and buried her face in her hands. She did not weep, for there were no tears, but she sat for several moments in a position of despair. When she lifted her head Mrs. Crosse saw that her eyes were wide open, but that they looked as if they had been screwed into their sockets. They stared fixedly at some point far beyond the range of Mrs. Crosse's vision .

"My dear," said Mrs. Crosse gently , "what is the matter? I'm afraid something has upset you."

Miss Minton shook her head. There was no movement of the lips which accompanied this gesture, but it was not necessary in order to convey her meaning. She merely sat there, staring into nothingness . Mrs. Crosse had never before seen Miss Minton so utterly overcome by anything , and she wondered what she could have said that would affect her so strangely.

She herself felt somewhat bewildered at the manner in which this young woman was behaving . She sat on, waiting for some explanation of what had happened. Presently Miss Minton got up from the chair and began to walk about the room. Mrs. Crosse did not like to leave her alone , but she could see that the girl felt so uncomfortable in the silence that she was better off with a companion .

She walked slowly up and down, still staring into nothingness. She seemed to be going over some experience or memory which troubled her more than anything else could possibly have done. The mystery of this behaviour on Miss Minton's part made Mrs. Crosse feel more uncomfortable than she had ever felt before .

What was the matter with the girl? What did she know that no one else knew? Had she found out something about her mother which she did not care to share with any one else?

Mrs. Crosse stared at her in amazement , while Miss Minton went on pacing up and down . She was very close to the chair on which Mrs. Crosse sat, but she never once looked towards that side of the room . It seemed as if there were something between those two women which they did not wish each other to notice.

Mrs. Crosse made her way over to Miss Minton's side and laid one hand on her shoulder , while with the other she drew down the girl's head, so that their faces were only a few inches apart . This action had no effect in bringing Miss Minton out of her strange trance-like state. She sat there quite still. Mrs. Crosse bent towards her ear and whispered:

"Miss Minton , I think something has upset you very much."

The girl raised one hand slowly and pushed the hair away from her face . There was an expression on Miss Minton's face which was very different from anything that Mrs. Crosse had ever seen there before. It was not a look of fear or anger, it was rather one of surprise , almost of bewilderment . But she did not utter any sound, nor did she move her lips.

"What is the matter, dear? Tell me."

Miss Minton looked at her gravely and slowly shook her head . She gave no explanation of her strange behaviour , but she let Mrs. Crosse know that she understood perfectly what she was feeling. The look on Miss Minton's face expressed sympathy for another's trouble, which Mrs. Crosse had never seen there before . It made the other woman feel quite uncomfortable in spite of all her desire to help.

Mrs. Crosse put a hand on Miss Minton's arm and tried again to lead her away from these thoughts. " I can see you don't want me to know what it is that is troubling you . But I feel sure there must be something I could do for you."

Miss Minton looked at her with eyes which were not unkindly, but which seemed almost accusing. She shook her head again and moved slowly away from Mrs. Crosse's side. " No , there is nothing you can do ." She paused a moment as if in thought, then continued:
" You could help me though."

Mrs. Crosse was so surprised at this statement that she looked at Miss Minton in amazement. " Help you? How?"

Miss Minton's eyes flashed for a moment and her face took on a very stern look . She moved away from Mrs. Crosse, saying:
" I can't tell you how."

Mrs. Crosse sat there for several moments thinking about what had happened and wondering where the girl was going with this strange request. The thought came to her that she would like to see Miss Minton before she went away . She might find out something of great importance to her if she could only manage to persuade Miss Minton to tell her .

But there seemed little chance of Miss Minton doing so when they met again, for the girl gave no indication that she was willing to speak. As Mrs. Crosse turned away from this last encounter with Miss Minton, she wondered how she could possibly find out what had upset her so much.

Chapter Thirteen

Miss Minton returned to London and began preparations for her departure to England. She went out on several occasions while the preparation was in progress, but never for any great length of time . It seemed as if there were something that she wanted to do before leaving. Once again it became apparent that she spent a lot of money during this period .

It did not seem likely to Mrs. Crosse that Miss Minton would be going back to live in England, but when she asked her about this she was told: " I am returning there for a few months." She seemed so sure of herself that it was almost impossible for Mrs. Crosse to doubt her.

On the day before Miss Minton was due to leave London, Mrs. Crosse paid her an afternoon call and found her alone in the drawing room . She looked at Miss Minton as if she expected some explanation from her, but none came. She merely shook hands with the other woman and said: "I'll be back soon."

It was then that Mrs. Crosse realised that something had happened which would prevent Miss Minton returning to live in London . She must have known about this herself before she made her departure, but for some reason she had not told anyone else what it was that was making her go away from them.

Mrs. Crosse sat down and looked at the girl as if expecting an explanation of all that had happened since they parted on such a strange note . But Miss Minton seemed to have forgotten about this meeting, or perhaps she thought she would find out something more about it later . She was not likely to be satisfied with what Mrs. Crosse could tell her.

Mrs. Crosse walked over and sat down beside the girl again. They were now quite close together , so that Miss Minton could have touched her if she wanted to. But she did nothing of the kind . She looked at her with a sad smile on her face, then said: "I'll be back soon."

Chapter Fourteen

" Well , I suppose I must be going now." The young woman's eyes were fixed on a spot somewhere out in front of them . They were like those of a man looking at a landscape , with the same expression. But there was something about these eyes which made it hard to tell whether they were fixed on some distant object or not.

Mrs. Crosse looked up from her book, and then back down again quickly as if she had been caught doing something wrong . She said: " Oh , I'm so sorry."

The girl seemed not at all concerned about what was happening. Her eyes were still looking out into nothingness . Mrs. Crosse began to wonder whether there really was any reason for her presence here and, if so, why she had come. She wanted very much to ask the girl's opinion on this matter , but it seemed impossible for her to do so until Miss Minton spoke first.

" I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful . It was a great deal more than anyone could have expected . But there are some things in life which cannot be changed and we must make the best of them."

Mrs. Crosse sat up straight again and stared at this stranger who had come so suddenly into her house, saying: " But why should you feel that way about it
