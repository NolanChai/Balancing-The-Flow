I'm afraid I must be going now. I have no idea it was so late. Stay for dinner with us. I'm afraid I can't. I have a dinner party at seven tonight. You see, I am going to England the day after tomorrow. What! Are you leaving that soon? We thought you were just visiting us. No, no...I live in London. Well, goodbye for now.
