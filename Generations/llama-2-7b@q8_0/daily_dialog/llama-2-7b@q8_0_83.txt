I thought that he would be staying there for sure ! But I guess that he has been blown away by wind.

 What can we do? We're supposed to get on a train in one hour, and we must find him as fast as possible!

 How long have you lived here ? 

 Two years . 

 And how is the life there ? 

 It's not bad , but it's still far from perfect. I'm always feeling cold . 

 Is that because of your age or the city itself? 

 It's a bit of both . When you are young, your body warms up quickly and you don't feel much coldness. But when you grow older ,your metabolism slow down and your temperature goes down . That means that I have to put on more layers of clothes than the others . 

 And what about your neighbors? Are they friendly ? 

 They are so! We always help each other if someone is in trouble. The kids love playing together. But there's one neighbor who sometimes makes trouble for us . 

 What kind of trouble? 

 Sometimes he puts a lot of garbage at our back door .

 And what do you usually do when this happens ? 

 We call the police and report him.

 I can understand that ! 

 It's not nice to have someone who doesn't like us living in our neighborhood! 

What is he doing to be such a trouble maker?  


 Well , his name is  , but we usually call him "the bully" . He's always picking on kids and adults alike. One day when I was walking with my dog, he decided to throw stones at us .

 What did you do ? 

 I picked up a stone of the same size as his , but more carefully! And then I threw it back at him ! 

 Is that all? How did he react? 

 He was surprised because he didn't expect me to fight back. Then he ran away without saying another word .

The dog was stolen !

### 2. 

It is too bad today .

 What happened ?

 My son was lost. I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping, but he ignored it.

How did you find him at last?

 The dog was stolen!
