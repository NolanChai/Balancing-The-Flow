Oh ! All right . But you'd better get going pretty soon . It looks like rain again !

 Yeah , it's raining cats and dogs out there ! 

 I hope you have a good time at your party tonight . 

 Thanks. I expect to enjoy myself. 

 Goodbye, then . See you later . Bye bye !

Yeah , but the whole place will be crowded ! I hate going through all that traffic in rush hour ! 

 Oh, well. I gotta do this now . I want to get back to work by four o clock. 

 Okay ! Now let's get moving or we'll never make it out of here.

Fine with me !
