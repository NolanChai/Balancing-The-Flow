She looks like she's recovering fast . 

 She says she can't wait for you to get out of school so she can teach you how to ride horses again . 

 I'm not sure when that will be, though . 

 I really want her to get better before we try riding horses together.What are your plans this summer ?

 I don't know yet.I have a job interview next week and I don't think I'll make it if the car won't start again today. 

 Do you think we should call the mechanic again ? 

 Yes, I do.You're right, the last guy was so rude to us .

 What time did he come ?

 About one o'clock . 

 Oh no !He said it would take him until two o'clock but that he could probably have a new part by three.

 Why not just call the other garage where he got the part?It's right down the road from here, isn't it ?

 I don't know .I didn't catch the name of that place and anyway ,they weren't very helpful on the phone . 

 I guess we're just going to have to be patient.

So be it ! 

### Exercise:

Re-order this dialogue.

I'll go with you, Jane!  
You should catch a number 7 bus, but a number 13 bus will do too.  
Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there?  
So be it!  
Where are you going, Jane?  
I'm going to the hospital to see Susan.  
I saw her yesterday and she was little better.

That sounds like it happened to me sometimes . 

 Didn't the driver tell you that ? 

 No ! He didn't say anything at all! I thought I was going in the right direction. 

 It must be very confusing for foreigners when they catch a bus in England ! 

 I suppose so , but what can we do? We can't ask them to speak English all the time !
