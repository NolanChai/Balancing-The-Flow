" Ok . Thank you ! "

" Then which is better? "

" I think it's best to take the 13 bus , because you can get off anywhere when you need to. "

### Explanation of the answer:

We can see that we have used the following structures in this dialogue:
- Present Simple to talk about things which are going on now and will continue (e.g.: We use the present simple for everyday habits). 

"Where are you going, Jane?" is a question to get more information from somebody who we already know. This type of questions often come in English conversation: "What time are you going out?" "How long does it take to get there?" 

We use the Present Continuous when something happens now or at that moment, for example, when someone is speaking: “I’m playing basketball” (at that moment) or when somebody is doing something right now.

In this dialogue we have used: "She was a little better" which means she isn't feeling as bad as she did before. The verb to be + adverb is called the "be-adverbs", and they are used to show how someone feels at that moment. 

Whenever we ask for information or want to make an offer, it’s best to give options: “A number 7 bus will take you there.” We can use this structure when making offers in English conversation (e.g.: Would you like another beer?)

“The 13 buses run much more frequently” shows the frequency of the bus service and the fact that the information is accurate (because Jane said it).

When we give advice, we can say which option is best: “I think it's best to take the 13 bus because you can get off anywhere when you need to.”
