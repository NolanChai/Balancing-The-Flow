I think you don't know me . 

No , I don't have enough money to buy anything . 

Yes, I do . 

What ? 

Look at them . They are really interesting . 

What's there to be interested in ? 

They are so funny ! 

What's so funny ? 

You want me to explain everything for you ?! 

Just stop bothering me . 

OK , I will go there with my friends . 

But it is very expensive . 

How can it be expensive if they are poor and helpless people ? 

So what ! It's all their fault . 

I don't care about them . I just want to spend a good time with my friends. Bye.

Yeah , I know it's a circus . They can make them do whatever they like.I don't think you are really watching the show,I guess you are just sitting there thinking about how cruel they are towards those animals.

I don't know . I'll be fine without it . 

 But , they are going to take it away if you didn't give it . 

 It doesn't matter . You can give me the bananas . 

 What ? You have nothing in your hand ! Come on, give me one . 

 No , no . I want to share this with my daughter.She is coming here . 

 Oh, what a cute little girl . Do you like this animal show too? 

 She likes it very much , but she doesn't understand the language they used in this circus . 

 Why don't you help her to know ? You are good at Chinese, right ? 

 I can . But do you want me to translate every single word of their speech? 

 No , no . Just help her to get a better understanding of the meaning of the show. 

 All right . Let's go there now ! 

 The circus is about to begin .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 I'm not . What makes you think that ? 

 I don't know . 

 Anyway, I want to go home . Let's get some dinner and go back.
