" Yeah, but why do you need to beat it into submission ? It just wants food . "

" Well , the children will love it . "

" Children don't know any better and they are going to get nightmares . "

" Oh , come on , they are laughing . "

" They can laugh at home , why here ? And , is that little girl going to be scarred for life or what ? Look at her screaming like hell . I think she might have PTSD . "

" Why you so negative ? It's a circus show . "

" We can go over there and look at the tigers later . "

" But we are going to sit there now , watching this crap ? And if they didn't beat them , then they wouldn't perform . You don't want the kids to have nightmares , but you want them to see a circus show ? That doesn't make any sense . "

" Look , I can't sit here and argue with you all day long . The children are having fun and that is what counts . "

" Oh, so this is the fun they had yesterday ? You didn't mention it before . "

" Well , of course we had more fun then ! We went to the amusement park and rode a rollercoaster . "

" And you did not get scared ? Because you know that animals will never do that when they are in cages.But humans don't have any problem getting on roller coasters , I suppose . You didn't say anything because you were too busy enjoying yourself and you just wanted to shut me up ! "

" Well, no , it was not like that . It was fun and I had a good time.But this circus show is just weird . "

" Okay then , I guess we should go home now and watch the TV . "

" What ? Why are you so mad at me ? Did I make you uncomfortable ? "

" No , of course not . I was thinking about my own children . I didn't know that they were going to show this stuff in front of them . "

" You know what , it is your fault anyway.You should have asked me before we bought the ticket and if you knew it was like this, then why didn't you say something ? "

" Well , I thought they wouldn't let us inside unless we got a ticket . "

" Why are you so mad at me for being honest ? I am just telling it how it is . "

" It does not matter anymore.We are here and we have to watch this circus show now ! We cannot leave the place because they will think that we are protesting against them or something like that . So , let's go inside and sit down with the children in front of all these animals that are being tortured before our eyes . "

" Okay then . I guess you win this time . You want to see what is going on over there ? Come on.You can watch them beating the horses until their hearts stop beating , or you can come with me and we will get a seat closer to the clowns so that you can laugh at them while they are making fun of the people who don't like animal abuse . "

" Oh, you want me to laugh ? Are you sure ? It looks like I am going to have nightmares again tonight and maybe tomorrow too.But , okay then , I will go with you . "

"No, I don't want to."

"I've never seen you like this. What happened?"

"They are animals , not human , but they can feel pain just the same ."

"That is your opinion ."

"It's the truth , I know how it feels like when someone torture us . "

"Torturing ? You always have that kind of feeling when you are watching circus show."

"That's right , it just hurt so much to see them suffer so badly in front of our eyes. That little monkey was beaten into silence and its cute little face is gone , I can still remember how beautiful and cheerful he used to be . "

"Sigh , Ben , you really make me sad when you keep complaining about the world . What are you going to do ? You will never change this cruel world unless you start with yourself."

" I don't know , just can not stand the sight of those poor animals being tortured by humans . "

" Come on ! We paid good money to see them show . "

" But it is cruel . "

" Look , that little clown is coming this way. Hey, Ben, get a banana for him . "

"Me ? Never , I hate those animals and their owner ."

"Hey , do you want to be arrested by the police?"

" I don't care , what can they arrest me on ? "

"Look , that little clown is crying . He doesn't understand why his friends are being hurt so much."

"That's enough ! I will not stand here and watch it any more . "

"Why don't you just leave?"

" Leave ? No way ! I have paid for the ticket, and I am not going to waste my money. I want to see what else this circus can offer."

"OK , come with me . "

"Come on, Ben . It's time to watch a new show . "

"I don't care . I will stay here till the end . "
