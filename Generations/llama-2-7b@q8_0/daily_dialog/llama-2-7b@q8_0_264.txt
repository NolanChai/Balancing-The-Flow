" Well , maybe you could help me to pass it any way. After all , I do want to take that course at some point in my life. "

" Okay , see what you can get through so far for credit next semester. Maybe you will be able to take the class by then . "

" All right ! Thank you very much Professor Donald."

" I appreciate it very much , Professor Donald , thank you. "

" I wonder if I could speak to you for a minute ? "

" Sure, go ahead, what is it ? "

" You have always told me that there are no rules in this household . "

" That's right , I have . "

" Then why do I feel as though I have to get your permission before I can talk on the telephone with my friends ? "

" You don't have to get my permission but I ' d like it if you did . "

" Why ? "

" Well , because I want to know who they are and what their names are. "

" How do I know that is so ? "

" It seems kind of obvious doesn't it ? "

" All right , I ' ll tell you the truth . They are my friends at college and we call each other on a regular basis, they think it would be fun for us all to get together in Chicago during the summer. What do you think ? "

" It sounds like you've got your mind made up . "

" That I have ! "

" How did you find this place ? "

" Well , it was the only one that looked decent and available when we left the city in a hurry on Sunday night . "

" I see, there are three other rooms occupied . "

" That's right , they just moved in yesterday. We could move out if you want to have more privacy . "

" Oh , no . It's all right with me. "

" They're nice people too and their kids play together with ours . I think you might like them. "

" I 'm sure we will get along just fine . "

" I'm afraid it was a mistake to rent this room for you two young women. "

" Why ? "

" Well , this house has been occupied by men only since we moved in last November and there are a number of things about the way they keep the rooms that you are not going to like . "

" What kind of things do you mean ? "

" Things like drinking beer in their rooms, leaving their dirty socks on the floor or hanging over chairs , burning food and leaving smoke smells in the kitchen. I guess I don't have to tell you that I can't stand the cigarette odor . "

" Of course not ! "

" And I think you are going to be surprised at some of their habits. "

" Surprise ? "

" Well, for instance , one of them washes his dirty clothes in a basin and hangs them up to dry on the staircase . This may not seem so bad but he leaves grease spots all over everything when they come down again. The other guy has been known to throw food out of the window into the yard , sometimes hitting somebody. "

" I ' m sure we ' ll get along fine . We will do our best to keep things clean and neat . "

" Did you buy a new suit ? "

" Yes, it's very pretty, isn't it ? "

" Well, if I say so myself , it is ! It fits like a glove too , doesn't it ? "

" Oh , yes , but ... "

" But what ? "

" I don't think the sleeves are long enough. I'd feel more comfortable with them coming down over my hands . "

" Well, that wouldn't look very good . "

" I know it wouldn't , but if they were short like this, would you notice ? "

" I guess not . What do you think ? "

" Maybe not. "

" My mother is going to be here for a couple of weeks and she would love to have someone stay with us in the country while we are away . "

" How does that sound to you ? "

" I guess it sounds pretty good , but I ' m not sure whether your mother can stand my cooking. "

" Why do you say that ? "

" Well, she hates my baked beans and cornbread . "

" But we both like them ! "

" Do you really ? I've never seen either of you eat any at the same time. "

" You say that you would like to have an apartment in this building . Is it possible for you to get one ? "

" Well, there are only two vacancies and they seem to be holding out on us. They're going to charge more rent than we want to pay and expect us to make our own repairs. I don't think that is fair. "

" I see , but what can you do ? "

" Well, there are two ways we could get an apartment here . One would be by waiting until they vacate them or the other would be by making an offer for one of these houses at $ 40,000 which is their price. We have an offer on another place for $ 38,500 that would make us an equal profit if we sold it . "

" My brother and his wife are going to take the children skiing tomorrow so they can't be here when I want them . Can you come over in their place ? "

" Of course , I ' d love to help out. What is it that you need done ? "

" Well, my husband took all our clothes into town and forgot to bring back the dry cleaning. The laundry is closed today so we have nothing to wear tomorrow . We could just stay home or I guess I could take the children with me and go anyway , but I ' d rather do it myself. "

" I'll be glad to help you. Can we wash your dresses at the same time ? "

" Sure, if they are white . "

#17 
Mr. Donald
" What can I do for you today ? "

" Well , I ' ve been thinking about it and I decided to take out a loan on my car. "

" Do you think that is wise ? "

" Maybe not but I need the money . I was going to ask for $ 5000 and I ' ll pay it back with interest in three years if I have to . "

#18 
Mrs. Donald
" Is my father coming today ? "

" Yes, he will be here at five o'clock . Why do you ask ? "

" Well , he told me that he might bring a few friends along but I don ' t see anybody else in the car with him now . "

Mrs. Donald
" We can get started on the work as soon as we buy our lunch . Where would you like to go ? "

" Well, let me think about it for a few minutes and I ' ll tell you later . "

" All right , that's fine with me . "

" My mother wants us to have an old fashioned Christmas with her this year so we are going to buy the tree tomorrow at the country store and set it up on Thursday morning when my father gets home from work. We'll decorate it then and sing a few carols afterwards . I think that is going to be very special , don ' t you ? "

" Oh, yes ! I ' d like that very much . "
