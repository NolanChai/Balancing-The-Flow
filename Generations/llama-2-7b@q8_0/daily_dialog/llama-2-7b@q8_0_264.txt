I'm sorry but it is full . 

Oh ! It is always like this . 

It was full when I registered too . 

Would you please take my name off your list then ? 

Sure , I would be glad to do so . 

Well , you can try taking a course in geomorphology. 

Thank you Professor Donald . I'll take it . 

Bye now . Have a nice day !

Don ' t worry about that , professor , I know geology very well from taking my brother ' s advanced courses. He is a senior at Caltech in geophysics . 

 That's different . Geophysics involves physics as well as geology . 

 Not much more than a little calculus and some electromagnetics anyway . I took that last semester ... 

That's not enough to make you qualified for my course , and your brother can ' t take it again even if he wanted to . He has a senior thesis to write . 

What about if I take the course as an advanced elective ? My department chairman said that would be okay . 

Sorry , that won't do either . You have enough credits to graduate with a major in geology . 

I don ' t understand ... 

Well , you should think of yourself first. Don't take more than is required for a degree and make it impossible for your brother to get one if he wants to be a geologist too. That would be bad planning on your part, wouldn ' t you say ? 

What are you talking about ? My brother is going to get his masters in geophysics ... 

All right , I believe you . But that doesn't mean you can take the course and keep up with the others. We won ' t have time to cover everything you don ' t know . You really need to enroll in another course if you want an advanced degree . 

What other courses ? 

All sorts of geological sciences, physics, mathematics ... 

Oh , yes, I know that. That's why my department chairman said it would be okay to take this one as an elective ! 

Sorry , but he is wrong again . We have enough advanced graduate students in the class and we don ' t need any more than that ... 

But I can do so much better than they can . You know how good my grades are ! 

I know, but even if you were at the top of your class , there aren't nearly enough courses for you to graduate with honors in geology. 

It would be a disgrace if I couldn ' t graduate as an advanced major . I have worked hard for three years and my department chairman says it will be okay ... 

Well, your department chairman is wrong again ! We don't need any more majors than we already have in geology. Don't worry about the honors ; just get a degree if you can . 

I really want to graduate with honors and I ' m not going to quit now that I know it isn't impossible ... 

Well, maybe this isn't your brother ' s best idea after all. If you don't quit , he could get his masters in geophysics without taking any more courses . 

Oh ! Then we would both graduate with honors ! That would be so wonderful ! I guess my department chairman was right to suggest that this course should count as an advanced elective ... 

Well , you ' re welcome. See you next semester in the geology department .

Thank you very much ! 

Good-bye , professor !
