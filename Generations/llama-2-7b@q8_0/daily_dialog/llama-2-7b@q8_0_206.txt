I’m talking about the location of your files, the form of their storage, the name of your system and its size.  

 All right . That is a good start . 

 So , where should I put my files ? 

 The first thing you have to do is to decide on a place for your documents . It is recommended to choose one room in your house with ample space so that it would be convenient for you to find any document if needed.  

 I’ll go with that idea . What other things should I consider while choosing the location ? 

 The second thing you have to do is to choose a filing system. It means that you have to decide whether to use file folders and cabinets, or boxes , or notebooks for storing your files . Also it’s better if you keep in mind such points as ease of access and cost.  

 That’s really an important thing  . How should I name my system ? 

 The third point you have to take into consideration is the name of your filing system . It is recommended to use the system with its original name or a systematic name. Also it is good if you remember how big your system is and what number of documents are in it, because those details will be needed when you decide on which place for storing the files you’d like to put your filing system .  

 What about the size ? 

 The fourth point you have to take into consideration is the size of your file cabinet. It is recommended to use a cabinet with the smallest width , the deepest height and the largest length you can find, so that it would be easier for you to put files in the drawers without any problems .  

 Well , I’m sure that if you keep these points in mind while organizing your documents you’ll never have trouble finding them when needed.

The most important point is to know how many pages you have written and then fold it on four .

 Is that right? 

 Yes sir . Thank you very much . 

### Sample 2: 

I hope everything's well. 

I would like to know about the different file types, file sizes, and formats we can use in our organization. 

First of all, what are the file types that we should consider when sharing files with other users? What kinds of things do you mean by file size? And finally, how is this format applied in our company's document system? Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.
