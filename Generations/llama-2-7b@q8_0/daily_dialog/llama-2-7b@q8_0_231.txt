**Notes:** _Another tough day of negotiating . I've had to spend a lot of time in the space port and it ' s not the most pleasant place. The air is recycled , and there are just too many people packed together, especially at this time of year._  
 _At least I got some good news today, though : the UN has officially approved our contract with the_ UNSC _. It was a long process, but it ' s finally done . Now I can go home to my loving wife and kids!_

"Hi there !"

"Leo ! Hey , how's things ? "

"Great ! Everything is great . Just finished negotiating the contract with the UN on behalf of my company. Now I ' m on my way home to celebrate . What are you doing ?"

"Working late again . We ' re almost done with our new contract."

"Busy day ! "

"You can say that again . It's been a very hectic week for us. But we ' re nearly ready to sign the final paperwork, and then I can finally go home and see my family."

"It sounds like you ' d love to get out of there ! "

"I would , but unfortunately, I can't make it this time . We have a major delivery tomorrow morning, and I need to be here in the office on time . Sorry about that, Leo."

"Don't worry about it . If you can ' t make it tonight, maybe we can try again some other day ? "

"Maybe. It ' s just so hard with all of these late-night deliveries. I work all the time!"

"I know . Maybe if things calm down a little , then I can come to see you sometime."

"That would be wonderful !"

"Well, it was nice talking to you tonight . "

"You too . See ya ! "

"Bye bye ! "

**Notes:** _Another day , another delivery ! I ' m really getting a lot of work done here at the space port, and it ' s nice to get away from my wife and kids for a while. They need some time together without me around._  
 _But I can tell things are getting tougher between us . When we first married I was so busy working all the time that she became jealous of our relationship, because I spent almost no time with her at home. It ' s a common problem for young couples starting out in their careers._  
 _I guess she was hoping things would change when we had kids . Well , they haven't ! So it looks like the marriage is coming to an end and we may have to divorce soon . But I can handle that. I ' m a strong guy._

"Hi there ! How are you doing ? "

"Good ! You ? "

"Great ! Another busy day at work . But it looks like I might be going home tonight after all."

"Why's that ? "

"Well , the delivery was much easier than expected. And there ' s something else : Susan just called to say she wants me to come over for dinner again tonight."

"That sounds nice ! But aren't you getting a little tired of going home every night ? "

"Maybe . But we still have a lot to talk about, and it ' s not like I can keep putting things off forever. So I guess that means I ' ll be seeing you tonight after all."

"That sounds great ! What are you planning on doing for dinner this time ?"

"Susan wants me to cook for her again ."

"She loves your cooking ! "

"She really does ! She can't wait to eat what I make. And she says I don ' t need an excuse to come over every night, since the kids are asleep by 9:30 every evening anyway."

"That sounds nice ."

"I hope we ' ll get a chance to talk soon ! See ya later tonight!"

**Notes:** _Another day of deliveries at the space port . My wife was right, there's not much room for privacy with this many people around._  
 _But I do like the fact that we don ' t have to worry about security here. The main concern is that someone might steal your package before you get it into their hands ! But aside from that , everything else goes pretty smoothly most of the time._  
 _I guess I could try calling Susan again tonight and see if she has any time for me after dinner, but I ' m not sure what would be good to talk about . She seems like such a busy person these days !_  
 _Maybe it's time for me to go back home. But then again , maybe we just need some space between us right now._

"Hey there ! How are you doing tonight ? "

"Good ! You ?"

"Great ! We ' ve been pretty busy with deliveries today, but it looks like things may finally be calming down."

"That sounds nice . So I guess that means you won ' t be able to come over this time after all ?"

"I'm afraid not. Sorry about that."

"Don't worry about it ! You should still spend some quality time with your wife and kids tonight."

"That ' s a good idea ."

"So I guess that means we won't be able to talk anymore?"

"Probably not. Sorry about that."

"Okay . Well , see you next time!"

**Notes:** _I ' m definitely getting a lot done here at the space port, but it does seem like things have slowed down a bit recently . It doesn't look like Susan has been able to find any time for me again today._  
 _But maybe she will be able to make it tonight after all ! I hope so ._  
 _If nothing else , I could really use some company right now. With everything going on at home with my wife, it ' s starting to get pretty lonely around here._  
 _I guess I should just go ahead and call her again though. It ' s probably better if she knows what 's going on instead of worrying about me being alone all the time !_

"Hey there! How are you doing tonight ? "

"Good ! You ?"

"Great !"

"That sounds nice . So I guess it looks like we might be able to finally have a talk after all."

"Sounds good!"

"What were you planning on talking about tonight anyway ? "

"I don't know. Just whatever comes up, I guess . You should probably tell me what ' s going on with your family first though . We need to be honest with each other if we want things between us to work out."

"I suppose you're right ."

"So why don't we start by telling each other how much we miss each other ?"

"All right, then . I guess that means I ' ve gotta be honest with you about what ' s going on here at home ! But before we get started , let me tell you something else : it's been great talking to you tonight. Even though things aren't exactly perfect between us right now, hearing from you makes everything seem a little better ."

"I'm glad to hear that . So how are things going with Susan ?"

"Not good ! She just doesn't have enough time for me anymore."

"That ' s too bad. But maybe there will be more opportunities in the future . We ' ll see what happens."

"Yeah, I suppose so . What about you ? How are things going with your family ?"

"Well , it's been hard for us since we got divorced last year . There isn't really anyone else in my life right now except for my kids and friends, but they ' re all good people too."

"Sorry about that ! Maybe things will get better eventually though ?"

"I hope so ! I guess it ' s been nice talking to you tonight ."
