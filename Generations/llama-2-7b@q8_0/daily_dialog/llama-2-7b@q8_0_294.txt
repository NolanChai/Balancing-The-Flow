So what's going on ? 

 Not much .  

 I didn't think it was going to be a very good week , but now I'm starting to have second thoughts. 

 Why not? 

 Nothing's really wrong . It's just that a lot of the things we planned to do this week just never happened. 

 You know how sometimes you just start out on the wrong foot and everything goes downhill after that ? 

 Yeah , but why would we get started on the wrong foot? That's weird ! 

 I don't think so . 

 Well, what do you mean then ? 

 Look at this week. 

 Here it is in a nutshell. Monday I was supposed to go with you to that thing about the environmentalists . Then last night I was supposed to take Bean and Nora over to the science fair . I'd already planned to drive them , so what happened? 

 Nothing ! They never got back to me about when it is . So ? 

 And then there's today. I had a date with Cynthia at three but she stood me up . Then I went over to the video store to get your movie and they didn't have it in stock anymore . Finally , just now, I finally got around to looking up that information on the car dealer we were considering last week. 

 So? You gotta admit you had a good start. 

 Maybe . I did manage to talk Bean into taking that driving course after school. But if it goes bad like it went yesterday , she'll never make it. 

 We don't know what happened yet. 

 Maybe not , but there was a guy who got mad at her and started throwing rocks at the car . 

 Well, that's not too bad. She could have been hurt. 

 Yeah , maybe . But it was real scary for a while there ! I had to put my arm across her shoulder so she couldn't move. And all the time we were driving he was throwing rocks at the windshield and making weird noises . 

 Gee whiz ! 

 Maybe you don't remember, but it didn't happen that way last week . I picked up Bean after school and she told me about some guy in front of her car who had been picking on her all afternoon. Finally he got mad and started throwing rocks at the windshield . 

 That doesn't sound like you ! 

 Well, that was last week , and this is a different guy, but it was still scary . Bean said she thought we were going to have an accident because I couldn't control the car. She was right. It wasn't my fault though. When they threw rocks at us before they broke our windshield , there was nothing I could do about it. 

 And then when he started throwing rocks after you were able to get away, I would have said that was your problem . 

 Yeah ! Right! The guy had been throwing rocks all afternoon at Bean's car and she never even got mad at him . But the second time we were attacked , this guy in front of her car suddenly got mad and threw a bunch of rocks at our car. And when I couldn't control it, it was my fault ! 

 I'm sorry you had such a bad day. Maybe it will get better tomorrow . 

 Maybe . But right now everything just seems like an effort. 

 Well , there is something we need to talk about . 

 Like what ? 

 Just one thing, but I have been thinking about it for awhile and I think you need to hear my side of things. 

 You mean about Bean? 

 Not exactly . What I really want to tell you is that if you don't mind , maybe we could find some other place where we can talk. 

 Why ? 

 Because when I am around, there are a lot of times when we get into trouble just talking. And when we do, the worst thing about it is we never even have time to think things out or get advice . We just end up with one big argument that takes forever and leaves us both feeling worse than before we started. 

 What's wrong with talking? 

 You know what's wrong ! You've been in on a lot of them yourself . And so has Bean, so she knows too. She'll tell you. We get into trouble just from getting together and thinking about things . So I think maybe it would be better if we talked about this somewhere else instead of here. 

 All right , if that's what you want to do. 

 Is there anything else? 

 Not really. Maybe you should go now. You have a date with Cynthia at three, don't you ? 

 No . I thought she stood me up yesterday. 

 Well , she must not have. 

 Goodbye then. 

 Bye.
