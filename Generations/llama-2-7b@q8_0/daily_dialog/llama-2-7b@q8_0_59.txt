It won't do any good at night . 

 You can't read when the lights are out . 

 I don't think I'm going to be able to .

 I have too many things on my mind , and it isn't like me to worry so much . 

 I know it's a little early but you should start thinking about what kind of presents you want for your birthday next week . 

 You can ask for almost anything you want and I will get it for you. 

 Well , if you really don't like any of them , I guess they are not very good gifts . 

 They were on my list too . 

 I was surprised when I opened that box the other day . 

 I was happy about receiving them but at first it didn't seem right. 

 It felt wrong in a way . 

 You can have an ice cream cone for dessert if you like . 

 It would be better than what we had last night . 

 You don't like ice cream any more do you ? 

 I think you should eat something , and maybe go to bed early tonight . 

 Well, goodbye. 

 I hope that helps .
