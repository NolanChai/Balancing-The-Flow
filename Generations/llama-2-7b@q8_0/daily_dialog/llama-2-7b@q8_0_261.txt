" You are right , it is hideous . "

" Thanks . What do you think of this one ? It was on sale . "

" So so , eh ? "

" But I can change the belt and put these shoes with it . "

" Oh , but those shoes are too tight ! You will have terrible corns in a few days . "

" So what do you think of this one ? It was on sale . "

" Hmmm , so-so . "

" I love the color . "

" The color is OK , but those shoes are too tight and ugly ! You can change them with these ones here . "

" These shoes aren ’ t that great either . "

" But they will make you look a bit more dressed up . And I hate to see you dressed up so badly . "

" Yeah, but don ’ t you think it is better to have ugly feet than an ugly ass ? "

" Well , no one can see your ass unless you want them too . But your feet are in everyone ’ s way all the time . "

" Oh I don ’ t mind having people staring at my feet . "

" So what do you think of this one then ? "

" It is OK . "

" How about this sweater ? "

" Not too bad, but it looks a bit tight. "

" Maybe we could try this one on and see how it looks with my skirt ? "

" Ok . Let ’ s do that then ! "

" We are going to the movies tonight , right ? What is playing ? "

" Nothing interesting I think, but since you want to go it will be OK. "

" Well we could always grab a bite afterwards. You like Chinese food ? "

" Sure . Do you mind if we eat with some other people ? "

" Not at all , just as long as it is cheap ! What do you think of this place ? "

" It looks OK, but I think there are nicer ones around here. "

" You are right . Let ’ s go in and have a look anyway. "

" Hey, how about going to the club later tonight after dinner ? "

" Yeah , sounds like fun. Are you coming ? "

" Not if it is too crowded and I don ’ t know anyone there. But you should come along . "

" I don ’ t really feel in the mood for going out to a club tonight, but maybe later in the week. "

" OK , that’s fine . Maybe we will go on Wednesday ? "

" No , I have to work that night . "

" Oh , well I guess it can wait. See ya ! Bye . "

" I heard you . You want me to choose the worst sweater in our wardrobe and tell you that it s not too flashy . "

" Yup ! "

" Sorry , but we are both so shallow . "

" Whaaat ? "

" We are so shallow ! I ’ m just as shallow as you are . You are looking for the best, the most beautiful , the one with more or less of whatever that suits your fancy and I am doing the same thing . "

" Okey , now you have to explain what you mean by "shallow" . "

" It s easy : we both like things for superficial reasons. We look at all these beautiful items in shops, but we don ’ t buy anything because we really need them or want them or believe that they fit with our personal style . Instead of choosing something that we know will make us feel good , and that we are sure will be used often by us, we choose things just to please other people. We buy stuff for others ! "

" Yeah but there ’ s no harm in that . "

" I guess not . But when you give an expensive sweater to your aunt because she likes it and you hate it , but you don ’ t tell her why, you are shallow . You don ’ t even care if the sweater will be used often or not. In fact, you don ’ t even know if your aunt will like it or not ! So what is the point ? "

" Hug, I can see where you are coming from now , but you don ’ t seem to get my point . You just made me feel bad and ashamed of myself for being so shallow . What do you think we should do instead ? Buy a sweater that we like, even if it means breaking the bank ? "

" Nope ! Buying stuff only because they look nice doesn ’ t make any sense. It might not be easy to find clothes that fit with your style and looks good on you but that s what you have to do . You can t buy a sweater that fits just because it s the right colour , or has a fancy label or costs too much money for you ! "

" That ’ s true. But how am I going to know if a sweater suits me or not ? The only way is to try it on and look at myself in the mirror . But what if we can t find clothes that suit us, what are we supposed to do ? "

" We could start by finding out our personal style ! You might like trendy clothes with bright colours and crazy patterns , but maybe you actually prefer sober, classic styles ? Or is it the other way around ? How about a test to see if your personality suits certain styles ? There are several tests on the internet . "

" I don ’ t know … I have never taken any test before. But I like your idea ! Let s find out our style and then we can start looking for clothes that fit with us . "

" Cool ! We should try this right away . Are you hungry ? "

" Don’t know how you can afford those sales . You always spend more than we do , no matter how many coupons or gift cards you use . "

" Easy — I work, while you sit on your duff and watch TV all day . "

" I have a real job ! "

" So does 90 percent of the population. "

" Fine ! If you don ’ t want to discuss my wardrobe choices , then why did you bother calling me ? "

" Because I thought it was nice that we had dinner together last night . "

" It wasn’t exactly a romantic evening ; it was just the two of us eating dinner at home. And now I have to do all this shopping for other people, and you don ’ t even want to help ! "

" Well , I guess that’s it then . You always know how to ruin Christmas — I hope you have a nice time with your parents . "

" Yeah, well you don ’ t even know who I ’ m rooting for ! "

" Well we can have a bet . "

" A bet ? What do you want to bet on ? "

" Who ’ s going to win the game , of course ! "

" What ’ s our wager if we ’ re wrong ? "

" Whatever you like . "

" Let me think . Well how about this – I get to choose what you wear for a week ? "

" And what could possibly motivate you to do something like that ? "

" You want me to wear your new clothes ! "

" Oh , no, I don ’ t want you to wear my new clothes . I just thought it would be funny if we had the same wardrobe for a week or so. "

" Well, alright then – what do you say ? "

" I guess that sounds kind of fun . What shall we bet on ? "

" Oh come on , it ’ s just a little game ! "

" OK , if that’s how you want to play . "

" It is just a little game, but one of the most important things in my life . You don ’ t understand me at all ! "

" No ? "

" I ’ ve never been so bored or annoyed in my entire life ! "

" Well what shall we bet on then ? "

" If you lose, you have to wear the clothes of my choosing for a week . "

" And if I win, you get to choose what I wear for a whole month ! "

" That ’ s not fair ! "

" But it ’ s my game . "

" OK , deal then . Who gets to pick first ? "

" You do. "

" Oh , well in that case, how about we both bet on the same team ? "

" What do you mean by that ? "

" Well we each pick our own favorite team and see who picks the team that wins . If it ’ s a tie, I win the game. "

" Oh . I guess that would work . "

" So what team are you rooting for ? "

" The Buffalo Bills ! "

" Well I picked the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and they lost 15-10 . Now it ’ s your turn. You pick first. "

" OK , well I don ’ t really know anything about football so I guess we should just flip a coin . "

" And what are you doing on New Year ’ S Day ? "

" Oh, nothing special . Why do you ask ? "

" Well my cousin is coming over and she wants to go for a hike. She says that it ’ s really pretty this time of year in our local park – I think she ’ s lying , but if I tag along it will be nice to have someone to talk to . And since we don ’ t see each other very often, I thought it would make things more interesting for me too. "

" Well what about you ? "

" I have nothing planned , so maybe I should go with you and your cousin. She sounds like she knows how to have fun ! "

" Sure . It ’ ll be great. So shall we meet up in front of the park entrance at 10 AM ? "

" That ’ s fine . But what are you doing on New Year ’ S Day anyway ? I thought that was your day off and everyone gets to sleep late or do whatever they want ! "

" Well , my plans aren ’ t very exciting . But I figured it would be nice if we went out for breakfast together. That way you can meet all of my family in one sitting instead of making several trips there throughout the year . And then we could maybe see a movie, or go to some other fun place after that ? "

" I don ’ t know , but it sounds like a nice idea ! What time do we want for breakfast ? "

" Well you can meet me at 9 AM if you would like. Then I guess we should spend the day together. Maybe we can go to this new museum that just opened up in town . "

" That does sound pretty cool . But what about after that ? You said something about a movie or another fun place ? "

" Well , there is this nice new restaurant where they serve food from all over the world – it ’ s really tasty ! So maybe we could go to dinner at 8 PM . Then, if you still want to come with me after that, I guess we can hang out together for a few hours and then call it a night ? "

" I don ’ t know . What time do they close the museum anyway ? And where is this restaurant located ? "

" Well , we can check it out once you get there. As far as the closing time of the museum, I think it closes at 9 PM on weekends and at 6 PM during the week, but maybe we could just go earlier . If you really want to see the place then that ’ s fine with me. And I don ’ t know where exactly this restaurant is located either , but it should be pretty easy to find – there are plenty of signs posted in the area ! "

" That sounds like fun, but maybe we could do all of that stuff together tomorrow instead ? "

" Well sure . I guess there ’ s no rush. It would just be nice if you were able to make it this year. And besides, now you know where everything is and what time they close, so next year won ’ t be such a surprise ! "

" Oh , I see. You want me to come to your New Year ’ S party ? "

" Well yeah . I guess that makes sense too – it wouldn ’ t really feel like a party if no one shows up! So anyway, you can meet me at 10 AM tomorrow morning. It should be fun ! "

" Alright . But what time will this all end ? "

" Well , it depends on how long we stay there or go somewhere else afterwards – but I guess around midnight would probably be the cutoff point for our party, unless you want to come back early from wherever we end up going after that ! And then we could have a few drinks and count down together . "

" Yeah , that sounds nice. Maybe next year we can even make it a whole weekend away somewhere . "

" Oh , I don ’ t know . That sounds pretty expensive for me right now, but maybe you could just come with me to some of my friends ’ parties instead ? You ’ ll have fun there too ! "

" Yeah , that sounds good. And if we go to more than one party together then it won ’ t cost as much money! "

" I guess so . But what time should we meet again tomorrow morning for the first part of our day? I don ’ t want you to be late or anything ! "

" Well , we can start at 10 AM like last time . Is that OK with you ? "

" Yeah , sure it is. See you then ! "

" OK , see you soon too ! "
