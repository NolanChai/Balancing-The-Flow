Well I can say that it's not my taste at all .  

 This is ok for me but what about you? 

 Yes, I like it.  

 What about this one then? It's great ! 

 The same for me , I love it .  

 But you think the whole thing is a bit too overdone ?  

 Maybe, but it's my favorite design.  

 What do you mean by "overdone" ? 

 Oh, I don't know what I meant exactly.  

 Well , I don't like this one either .

 And why is that?  

 It just isn't for me.  

 But why not? 

 Because it's too simple, not interesting enough.  

 And you prefer the first design ? 

 Yes, definitely yes!  

 I see... I'm sorry to hear that .

 I think it'll be better if we go out for a while and then talk about it later on, maybe after having discussed other things as well.   

 What do you say?

 Sounds like a good idea to me!

Yes . It is really horrible . 

 And these jeans ? What do you think of them ? 

 Not bad, but they are definitely worn out. 

 Is there anything else in the closet that I should get rid off ? 

 A lot ! How about all of it ? You are kidding ! I would never let you throw everything away . 

 Come on , just tell me what is ugly, and we ’ ll discard it.

 Well … 

 Just tell me. 

 Look at this shirt ? 

 Yep. 

 It ’ s horrible ! I don ’ t know why you ever bought this . 

 You never wear these clothes. 

 That’s true , but the way they hang makes them look like trash . 

 Okay … I will throw it away, if that ’ s what you want me to do . 

 What else ? This dress is hideous ! 

 It is ! 

 And these pants ? 

 Absolutely. 

 We can get rid of the rest . 

 Really ? 

 I am serious ! 

 Are you sure ? 

 Of course ! 

 Do you really want me to throw away all your clothes? 

 Yes ! All of them , if that’s what it takes to get rid off things you don ’ t like. 

 Do you want me to tell you what I think of them ? 

 No . It doesn ’ t matter anyway . 

 What ?! 

 Don ’ t waste your breath ! 

 You must have a really good memory to remember everything that you own. 

 But how can you forget? 

 We just don ’ t get rid of things we wear, because it makes us feel bad if we give them away. 

 It ’ s like throwing my life away . 

 I never felt the same since I got rid of these clothes . 

 That doesn ’ t make any sense ! You can’t throw your life away just by giving things to charity! 

 But they remind me of you, and when I look at them, I feel sad. 

 Really ? 

 Well … yeah . 

 There is nothing wrong with that feeling. 

 That ’ s how it works ! You don ’ t have to get rid everything we own just because there is something in the closet that makes us sad. 

 I do! 

 If you want, you can take whatever you like and donate the rest to charity. 

 Why would I give things away ? I can sell them ! That ’ s what everybody does . 

 Who cares about clothes we never wear? 

 Do you have a lot of clothes in your closet ? 

 Yes … a lot ! 

 What do you think ? 

 Eh , so-so. 

 And this one ? Too flashy ? 

 Nah, not too flashy. 

 Hug! And this sweater from my aunt? Isn’t it hideous? 

Yes. It is really horrible. 

And these jeans? What do you think of them? 

Not bad, but they are definitely worn out.

Sorry . What do you think of this one ? It ’ s too much. 

 No , it ’ s fine , but this one is better .

 Eh ! You are such an idiot!

 I'm just kidding . I 'm not mad . 

 I love you . 

 I love you . 

 I love you .

 You too.

Why do we always have to talk about the most boring things ever ? 

 I don ’ t know . You can choose to not wear that hideous sweater in front of me if you want, but there are plenty of other people around who like it . 

 And what are these questions doing here ? 

 Did I give them permission to ask this kind of question ? No . 

 Why do I even bother trying to have a normal conversation with you ? 

 Because we ’ re in love ? 

 I guess . 

 That ’ s not an answer . 

 So you don ’ t want to be in love anymore ? 

 Yeah , I did at first but now it ’ s boring . 

 And what do you mean by that ? 

 Oh nothing . 

 It’s not like we have a lot to talk about anyway . 

 So is this it then ? Is there no more love between us ? 

 Yeah, I guess so. 

 Well , don ’ t worry ! You can come over again next week and we will chat all night long.

 I didn ’ t ask for that . 

 And you are welcome to come by any day of the week if you want more .

 Why ? To talk about our relationship ? No thanks . 

 Don ’ t be mean ! You can even tell me you love me again, but it won ’ t change anything . 

 What do you mean ? It does not matter if you say it or not ? 

 Of course , I always knew that . 

 Do you know something I don ’ t ? Because you have been acting weird lately . 

 I am just trying to get a life without you .

 Well then why do we still spend so much time together ? You don ’ t even try to make an effort . 

 It’s because we are friends ! And because we love each other ! 

 Friends who love each other shouldn ’ t go out of their way to see one another for no reason , right ? We both have our own lives and things to do. 

 Okay, let me rephrase that . I want us to stay friends but I can ’ t be with you romantically anymore. 

 But why ? You haven ’ t given it a try yet !

 Well if I wanted to try anything then we would be in bed together right now .

 So what do you want from me ? What are the conditions of our friendship ? 

 It will probably take some time before we can talk about that . 

 Fine , whatever. But don ’ t expect me to answer any questions for you anymore . 

 You got it .

Well , we see what you can do this afternoon . I ’ ll be taking in some new movies with my friends, then later on maybe a dance or two. 

 Maybe ? Is that a yes ? Are you going to the New Year ’ s Eve party ? 

 Hmmm , maybe . 

 And what about you and your girlfriend ? Do you have any plans ? 

 I don ’ t know yet . We haven ’ t talked about it. 

 Really ? So you just hang out at home alone on New Year ’ s Eve, do ya ? 

 No , we go somewhere together ! And why not? She’s my girlfriend. 

 She ’ ll probably invite her whole family to spend New Year ’ s with us . I don’t know about you, but that is definitely going on the list of things that are overdone . 

 OK , you ’ re right . You win this time . But how do we avoid that ? 

 Well , we just have to make some plans ! So let ’ s get together with our friends tonight and then head out for something fun tomorrow morning. 

 I think that’s a great idea . Now can you stop talking about yourself so much and tell me how your day went yesterday?
