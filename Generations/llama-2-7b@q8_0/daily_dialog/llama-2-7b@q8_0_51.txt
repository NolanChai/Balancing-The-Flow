Sure , why not !

I do not have anything with me right now , but tomorrow I will bring some books .

What's the matter ? 

 Nothing.

 Would you like to have a cup of tea ? 

 Yes, please.

 Let us go in and sit down at once .

 We are having a family discussion right here !

 What about an invitation to your birthday party?

 Oh , thank you very much . I'd love to be there!

 Well then , see you in the evening.

 Yes, I will !

Thank you for your attention !

I guess so . It's too early for the sun to heat things up . 

 True. The clouds and fog make it look dreary outside . 

 Yes, they do . 

 It's kind of gloomy around here lately . 

 I guess I shouldn't complain though , eh ? 

 Oh well ... I'll just have to wait for the sun to warm things up . 

 What would you like to eat tonight ? 

 How about Chinese food? 

 I could go for that. Do you want some too? 

 Sure, I can share with you if it's OK with you. 

 Yeah, sure...

No ,I don't. 

 It seems that there is a lot of snow in London . 

 Is it ? When did they start to forecast this kind of weather ?  

 I guess a couple of days ago . 

 Well, if you ask me ,I would say we should pay more attention to the weather forecasts !

 What's wrong ? Have you been drinking too much coffee again ? You look tired. 

 No , It's nothing .

 Do you have anything to do tonight? 

 Yeah, I know. I really need a good night sleep ! 

 Do you think that will help? 

 Hmmmm , I don't know..

Oh ! 

 I didn't see that coming. 

 Don't tell me you don't like football ! 

 No , but I find it quite boring sometimes . 

 You mean you're not a fan ? 

 Not really . I used to be in high school and college. That was before the game became so violent . 

 Do you watch American football ? 

 Occasionally , when there is something important on TV . 

 Have you ever tried playing it ? 

 No . 

 I used to play for the university team in high school . 

 What position did you play ? 

 Wide receiver . 

 Really ! That's interesting . 

 Are you still in touch with anyone from your team? 

 Not really . We haven't been on speaking terms since I got drafted into the army . 

 Are you going to watch the Super Bowl ? 

 I doubt it , but I might tune in for the second half if there is a good game .
