" Indeed it is . Let me have the window open . "

" Yes, I agree with you . This weather is awful ! "

" I know what you mean . The rain is coming down in buckets. "

" It is really cold and damp today , isn't it ? "

" It certainly is . Shall we go somewhere warm to have a cup of coffee ? "

" That sounds good to me . "

" No . What's the weather like ? "

" Rather warm for this time of year. "

" How about tomorrow ? Will it be raining ? "

" Yes , I think so . "

" It would be nice if there were some sunshine. "

" You're right . But what do you want to read ? "

" Oh ! It's a poem written by our teacher about the weather in spring . "

" Well ! Have it and I'll find out some news for you ! "

" I didn't see it myself . "

" So I heard . "

" Oh ! I forgot to tell you that I have a dentist appointment this afternoon , so I won't be home for dinner tonight . Have a good day at work and don't forget the tickets we talked about last night . "

" See you later . "
