You know, if something happened to me , you would be the first person that I would want by my side.

 She's a good person .

 She's nice and she makes me feel special . 

But don't change how we are together because of her.

I need you more than ever before now. 

And this isn't anything about her but the two of us.

And I guess that if something happens to me , you would be the last person that I'd want by my side.

I think you liked her very much . 

 You can't deny it ! 

 Maybe because of the way she treated us at the beginning ? 

 She was my girlfriend for more than two years now . 

 So what's wrong with telling you ? 

 Not a word , just the truth . 

 The problem is I don't know why you are so surprised ! 

 It doesn't make any sense at all . 

 We should talk about it when we see each other next time .

But did I need to hear that from anyone else ? 

 Not exactly . 

 Why not? 

 It is none of my business if you are in love with someone or not .

 You can be in love without being in a relationship ! 

 So , what do we do now? 

 Nothing , I will continue to go out with her as before .

What is the matter with you ? 

 That was the idea of our secret engagement . 

 Secret ? I had no idea . 

 Why didn't you make it public ? 

 I did , but you weren't listening . 

 Now that you have told me , how can I help you ?
