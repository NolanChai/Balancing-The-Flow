" I'm sure I did ! "

" Don't make a fool of me by pretending to be in love with somebody else while you've got the girl of your dreams waiting for you at home."

"I don't think there is any harm in being friends with other girls ."

"Don't be so naive. Don't you know how easily a friendship can turn into a romance ?"

" I do , but this isn't my case ."

"So why didn't you tell me about her ? "

" Because I wasn't sure you would approve of my relationship with her ."

"I know how difficult it is to find a girl like you and you shouldn't have hesitated even for a second to give me the news."

"Why ? Am I so unacceptable?"

" No , but there are so many guys who would love to date you . And because you've waited so long before accepting my proposal it makes me wonder whether I could ever win your heart if I couldn't even manage to woo one of your friends."

"I know I can trust you more than anyone else and you should have told me that you were in love with her when you first started meeting her . "

"Yes, but what would you do about it ? I know how difficult it is for a man to accept the fact that his girlfriend is also best friends with another guy. Especially if he is as handsome and popular as me."

"I don't think that's the real reason why you didn't tell me ."

"Yes, I agree , but it made it even more difficult to approach her when we became best friends."

"Well , there are a lot of things between us that needs clarification . "

"Yes, and that is precisely why I have come over to talk with you in person. I hope you don't mind that I didn't tell you about my feelings before ?"

"No, because the truth is I was also waiting for an opportunity like this so we can finally settle everything between us . "

"Really? Then it means you want to be with me?"

"I have been thinking about this a lot and that's why I didn't come over earlier. It's not because of the rumors or anything else. I don't care what others say."

"I am glad you said that ."

"But, to be honest , it has been difficult for me to get rid of my fears about other people's opinions. But now I know I can trust myself and make a decision without any reservation."

"That's great because I have decided I want to marry you . "

" I thought you already knew . "

" When did you see her last time ? "

" Yesterday afternoon , she came to my house . "

" Why didn't you tell me about it ? "

" I don't know ... I was thinking that you were busy and didn't want to bother you with all those things. "

" I am not so busy . You should have told me about her visit . "

" But that is what we decided on . "

" What do you mean by us , you and who ? "

" You know well enough . "

" No I don't . "

" Well if it will make any difference, she is not much of a catch. She is a bit too tall for my taste and her nose is too big . "

" What is the matter with you ? "

" Nothing , really . You know how jealous I have been of all your other girlfriends . "

" Well, you can't be jealous now that I am getting married. "

" Of course not , it would look very silly . "

" Yes it would . But the question is, do you want me to marry this woman ? "

" What do you think I should say ? "

" Well, if you are going to be jealous of her now that she has my heart, then I will never speak to you again. "

" It isn't a question of being jealous . Of course , I want you to marry her . You two are well suited and it would make me very happy to think of the two of you together forever. "

" Then why don't you go talk to your mother about the wedding ? I am going to take her for a walk now, will you be back later ? "

" Yes , but don't expect me to come home with flowers and roses . "

" Flowers are fine , just as long as they aren't daffodils. "
