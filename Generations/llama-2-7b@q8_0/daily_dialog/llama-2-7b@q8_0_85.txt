There has been some pressure to use alternative materials from the government . We have had to increase our research efforts . It takes time to switch over and test the new material but it was done well in advance . The transition went well and there were no issues.

We have been fined quite heavily a couple of times for using too much pollutant 

 How often does it happen ? 

 It's happened at least twice last year , but it hasn’ t happened again this year . 

 I see . Is that because the government is enforcing its regulations better or because you are improving your business ? 

 Well , both actually , we ’ re being much more careful now than before . 

 Do you think these kinds of problems will be solved in the future? 

 Yes, I do . We’re learning from our mistakes and soon we'll get it right .
