" No ; he ’s over there by the fence . "

" He wants to talk with you about something . "

" All right . Tell him I ’ ll come. "

" All right . I will. "

" And bring me an apple , too ; Tim has one in his pocket . "

" Thank you . " ( Jane runs back into the house and shuts the door behind her )

Jane is called by name once again :

" Where ’ s Jane ? "

" She ’ s upstairs, Mom. Can I have another piece of bread please ? "

" Here you are ! " ( Jane runs upstairs to get more bread. The door to the upstairs closet is open and Jack comes out with a piece of paper )

" Look , Tim ! I can draw too ! "

" Yes . You can . Good job, Jack . "

" Thanks . But what ’ s Sally doing ? "

" She ’ s lying under the table. "

" Why is she there ? "

" I don ’ t know ; maybe because it ’ s shady under the table ? "

" Where ’ s Timmy going now ? " ( Jack runs downstairs to talk with Sally )

" I ’ m just going into the garden. "

( Jane comes in from upstairs and hands a piece of bread to Sally, who is lying under the table. Jack thanks Jane for his piece of bread and eats it while he talks with Sally about where he got his apple and why he can draw. )

" And now I ’ m going back outside again . " ( Jack goes into the garden once more )

( Sally goes out under the tree with Timmy, who is sitting on a chair under it. Jack takes off his cap to sit in the sunlight for a few minutes. Jane goes upstairs and shuts herself into her bedroom while she talks with Tim about what he has done that morning )

" I ’ m going downstairs now . " ( Jane goes downstairs and walks outside, where Jack is sitting under the tree and Timmy and Sally are in the garden )

" Do you want to talk to me , Sally ? " ( Jane sits on a chair near Timmy, who is lying by his mother. She pulls out her own notepad while Jack gets up from under the tree to stand by the door to the backyard )

" Yes . I saw an interesting bird last week . It was so red ! " ( Sally describes the bird she saw and Jane writes down all the information she can get. Timmy is still lying next to his mother but does not say anything. Jack stands at the door to the back yard and looks out )

" Where are you going now ? "

" I think I ’ m going outside again . " ( Jack goes into the garden )

( Jane gets up from her chair and walks over to Timmy, who is still lying on the ground. She picks him up and puts him on his feet )

" Oh , you must be hungry now ! " ( They walk over to the kitchen where Sally is standing in the doorway with a piece of bread in her hands. Jane takes the bread from Sally ’ s hands and puts it into Timmy ’ s mouth while Jack goes back under the tree )

" Where ’ s Mom ? "

( Jane gives the rest of the bread to Timmy, who is still eating when Jane walks over to Jack under the tree. They talk about what they did in the morning )

" What do you think you are doing now , Timmy ? "

" I ’ m going inside . I want another piece of bread ! " ( Jane takes him upstairs to get another piece of bread and Jane calls her daughter’s name, who is standing by the doorway between the kitchen and the garden )

" Yes , Mom ? "

" What are you doing now ? "

" I ’ m just watching Jack . " ( Jane walks over to Timmy, who is now eating his second piece of bread while he talks with Sally about what they did that morning and Jane hands another piece of bread to Tim )

( Timmy goes upstairs to eat another piece of bread. Jane starts talking with Jack under the tree once more )

" What are you looking at ? "

" I think there ’ s a squirrel in the tree over there . Do you want to see it, too ? " ( Jack points to where Tim and Sally are sitting while they eat their bread )

" Yes , that would be nice. " ( Jane walks over to Timmy, who is still eating his third piece of bread. Jack hands Jane a piece of bread as well )

( Timmy takes the last piece of bread from Jane ’ s hand and puts it into his mouth before he runs upstairs again while Jack stands under the tree. Jane goes outside to talk with him )

" There ’ s nothing here . " ( Jane turns around after she has been standing in front of the door to the back yard for a few seconds )

( Timmy comes down from his bedroom and runs into the garden, where Sally is playing on her swing. Jack stands under the tree while Jane walks over to him to talk about what they did that morning )

" What do you want ? "

" I thought we were going outside again . " ( Timmy comes back inside the house with Jack and sits down at the table in the kitchen )

( Sally is still playing on her swing when Jane walks over to where she stands. She asks what she wants and gives it to her while they talk about their day before they walk upstairs again )

" I ’ m going inside now . " ( Jack stands by the door to the backyard, waiting for his mother to come outside once more so he can tell her that he saw a butterfly flying around in the garden and where it flew off to. Jane walks over to Timmy who is lying on his bed while Sally gets up from underneath the table )

" What are you doing now ? " ( Jack stands next to his mother by the window, looking out into the backyard. He tells her that he wants some water and she hands him a cup with water before they walk over to where Timmy is standing on his bed, lying down and talking with Sally about what they did in the morning )

" What are you going to do now ? " ( Jane walks into Tim ’ s room and asks him what he wants. He says that he wants another piece of bread and she hands him one while Jack stands by the window again, looking out at the garden. Sally is still lying on her bed when she calls Jack’s name )

" Where are you going ? " ( Jane goes into Timmy ’ s room to give him some water as well. She tells him that she wants to talk with Jack while he walks into the kitchen and puts his hands in his pockets. He looks outside at Sally, who is lying on her bed )

" What are you doing now , Jane ? " ( Timmy comes out of his room and stands by his mother. They start talking about what they did today. Jack walks to the door while he asks where Sally is. He does not say anything as she follows him into the kitchen, where Jane is standing at the table with her head in her hands )

" I don ’ t know . Maybe we should call the police ? " ( Timmy stands next to his mother and looks out at Jack, who has taken a seat by the window. They talk about what they did today. Sally comes back into the kitchen and starts talking with Jack, asking him where he wants to go now )

" I don ’ t know . Maybe we should call the police ? " ( Jane walks over to Timmy, who is standing next to his mother and asks why he said that again. He answers her question before she talks about what they did in their morning routine )

" Do you want a piece of bread ? " ( Jack stands by the window looking outside at Sally, who is sitting on a chair next to Jane while Timmy comes into the kitchen and sits down at the table. They start talking about what they did that morning again )

" No ; thank you . " ( Jane walks over to where she stood before when Jack was sitting by the window looking out of it. She asks if he is hungry and then says that she wants to go outside to talk with Sally again, but Jack does not answer her question. He stands next to his mother who walks away from him )

" What are you doing now ? " ( Jane looks around the room while she talks about what happened today, before Jack comes into it and sits down at the table again. Timmy asks where he wants to go, but Sally does not answer her question. Instead, she stands by the window looking out of it )

" Maybe we should call the police ? " ( Jane walks back into the room and talks with Jack once more before they both walk over to where Tim is standing on his bed. She asks what he wants and then tells him that he can go outside again as soon as she has finished talking about what happened today )

" What do you want ? " ( Jane

" You see , I can ’ t tell you everything that happened in a minute , because there were so many things going on. But Tim was sitting under the tree, and he saw Sally sitting in the garden . Then Jack came running into the garden, calling for Sally , but she couldn’t hear him , because she had put her head down on the table . So she said " Jack , what ’ s happened to you ? Why are you crying so much ? " But he was just shouting and shouting. " Tim !" he shouted , and then he ran away .
So I went into the garden and asked Sally , where Jack had gone, but she couldn’t hear me either because her head was still down on the table. So I said " Jack!" very loudly , and that ’ s when he came back. " Oh !" he cried " It ’ s you! I thought it was Tim . But wait a minute !" he ran into the house and got his father’s trumpet, which made such a big sound that we could hear him anywhere in the garden.
Sally jumped up from her chair , and said " Oh my goodness me ! What ’ s happened to you , Jack ? Why are your eyes so red ? Are you crying ?" But he just ran round in circles with his trumpet, making such a noise that we couldn’t hear what he was saying .
Tim came running from the tree and said " Jack ! Jack !" and he picked him up and carried him off into the house. Then I went out of the garden to look for Sally , but she was gone."

" He ’ s lying on the grass by the garden fence . "

" And what are you doing , Jane ? "

" I am picking up flowers for Sally and Tim to give them in the morning . "

" Is there anybody else in the garden with us , then ? "

" There ’ s only Mother. She is sitting on the doorstep reading a book . "

" Where have they all gone ? "

" They have just been here for five minutes and then suddenly they were not here any more ! "

" What happened to them then ? "

" I don’t know exactly , but I think there is something very strange about it . "

" Do you mean to say that you really believe in magic ? "

" Of course. There is no other explanation for what we saw . "

" But we were only children then and now we are grown-up people ! We know better than that. "

" Perhaps . But if you could see the way those flowers moved it would convince you, too ! "

" Do you really mean to say that you can do magic ? "

" Yes , I do . Of course, I am not a real witch like Sally but I can make flowers grow and things like that . "

" Can you also turn into an animal and fly through the air as they did in _Aladdin_? "

"No , of course not. But there is a story about how I once turned myself into a dog ! "

" Really ? "

" Yes, really . It happened when I was seven years old . My father had bought me a new kite and we were flying it in the garden when my mother saw an animal looking at us from behind the hedge. She said that she didn’t think it was safe to have a child alone with such a big dog so close by, so I went into the house to telephone her and ask her for some advice. I wanted to go home , but I couldn’t find any other way to get there .

" The only thing I could do was wait until she came back and then try to take a bus to my father ’ s office. There are no buses in the city where we live, so if I took one it would have cost me more than five minutes , but that wouldn’t matter because I had plenty of time before our next meeting .

" It was already dark by then and the kite flew around without any help from us. Then we saw something moving behind a hedge on the other side of the road, just where the dog had been sitting down before, so my mother came over to watch what it was doing there—she thought I must have lost something else, too . But when she saw that all three cats were chasing after him with their tails curled up like snakes behind them , she ran out of the house again and came running back into our yard screaming: “Run ! Run ! The dogs are coming !”

" We both took off immediately, but before I could get through the gate at home there was another loud bark from one side, so I ran across to where my father was sitting on his balcony with a cup of coffee . He saw me running towards him and asked what had happened. “Nothing ” , I said quickly , trying not to look nervous because he wasn’t used to being told that things weren’t going well in our house . Then when I got up close enough for him to see my face clearly without being afraid of hitting anything with his coffee cup—which was probably full anyway since it was already dark outside and we had been sitting there drinking together for quite some time by then —I noticed that he wasn’t smiling anymore either. Instead, his eyes were wide open like they usually are whenever I start telling him something serious . “You said nothing had happened ,” he asked me again calmly as if this wasn't important at all .

" But you know better than anyone else what can happen when there aren’t any cats around . The dogs don’t care who they kill—they will just chase them down and rip their throats out until they’re dead ! And once those cats are gone , all the other animals come running too. There won’t be anything left in our garden for us to eat!
" This is what I told him, but he didn't seem impressed by my words at all . Instead, he just shrugged his shoulders as if everything was fine now that we knew where each other were standing when it mattered most—which wasn’t really true since there aren’t many places in this house where you can actually stand still without being stepped on or tripped over.
" Then my mother came back home again, and I ran into the living room to tell her what had happened . She was sitting on one of those chairs that have high backs , so when she saw me coming through the doorway behind my father’s armchair she jumped up quickly without saying anything except: “Huh !” which means something different from huh but is still very useful for showing surprise . And then we both went back outside again where my father had already gone into our garden. He was standing on a ladder , trying to pull down some branches that were growing over the fence and blocking our view of everything else except each other !
" “What are you doing ? ” I asked him . “Why don’t we just go out onto the street instead?” But he shook his head . "No , it would be better if we could see what was happening outside without having to leave our house. If there is anyone coming over here from anywhere else, then they can easily walk up behind us and kill us both before we know anything about them !
" I didn’t say anything for a moment because this seemed like a good idea . But then , just as my father finished climbing down off of the ladder , he suddenly jumped back up again onto it, so now he was standing on top of his head with one leg still on the ground. And when he started walking towards me I could see that he wasn’t really paying attention to where he was going at all . Instead, he kept looking straight ahead as if trying to find something in particular among those tall trees behind us—or maybe just some place where no one would ever see him again !
" As soon as we were both safely out of sight inside our house , however , everything changed completely . My father came over and started patting me on the back while saying something like: “Don’t worry , dear, you are not alone anymore ! I’ll take care of things now.” Then he went outside again to look for more cats or dogs or whatever was making so much noise in our neighbourhood.
" For about half an hour everything stayed quiet until suddenly there was another loud bang from behind us—only this time it wasn't a dog but a car! A big red one with black stripes going all around it , like something out of _Gone With The Wind_ . The next thing I knew my father had already jumped back up onto the ladder again and he was climbing down towards us quickly, holding his flashlight so that its beam could shine directly into our faces!
" At first we were both too shocked to move or talk , but then after a few seconds had passed without anything happening at all I managed somehow to find my voice. "W-what do you want ? " I asked him . But instead of answering me he just turned around and walked slowly back towards the house where he had been standing before—and while doing this he kept shouting something like: “We have got nothing here ! There isn’t a single thing left to eat , so please go home now .
" Then suddenly everything went dark again. This time I didn't need my eyes at all because even though there wasn't any light coming through the window, I still knew exactly what was happening inside our house: My father had disappeared ! All that remained behind him were two small piles of clothes lying on top of each other . The first one contained everything he had been wearing before; the second consisted only out-of-date underwear and socks.
" So I started crying because now it seemed like there wasn't any point in staying inside anymore—and then all at once something happened that was even worse than anything else ! The sound of sirens filled our street, followed closely by shouts coming from the other side . In no time flat , dozens upon hundreds upon thousands of cars had appeared around us; cars with blue lights flashing everywhere . It felt like an enormous wave was rising up to swallow us all , but just before it could reach us there came another noise even louder than anything else : A voice shouted: “Hey ! Look out ! ” And right then we were surrounded by men who wore uniforms with black helmets . They seemed so strong and powerful that they might have been able to destroy the world if they wanted to do so.
" After everything had stopped moving around us , my father finally came back into our house again —and as soon as he saw me standing in front of him he started laughing like crazy ! “How did I know you wouldn't come home sooner ? ” he said . "It was very easy ! There were lots of people waiting for me outside because they knew what would happen when I got there—they wanted to take my clothes off before giving them away again , so that nobody else could wear them later."
