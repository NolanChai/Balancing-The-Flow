Well , then maybe we should try something different ... 

 but I don't want to go back to the way things were before. 

 But if I don't feel like I can give everything I have to invoking , how will that help? 

 That's an excellent point . 

 But maybe we could try a little differently, you know ? 

 And what if we do try something different and it doesn't work out either? 

 Well then ... 

 It might not be exactly the way I envisioned, but ... 

 Maybe there is some other way that would make things work out . 

 I guess I just feel like giving everything to invoking hasn't worked yet. 

 So maybe it's time to try something different ? 

 Something besides trying to do it all yourself ? 

 What about someone else? Maybe someone who knows how to invoke you , but doesn't know you, like an angel or ... 

 Maybe someone you don't know ? 

 Someone who doesn't know me either ? 

 Well then, that would be different. 

 But I don't think it will work out . 

 That's what we have to find out, right? 

 If not, maybe there is something else we can do? 

 Maybe try something different? 

 What about someone who doesn't know either of us , like ... 

 I don't know. 

 We could always ask for help . 

 I guess I'm just a little nervous , you know ? 

 Well, maybe that's why it hasn't worked out yet . 

 And what if we try something different , like an angel or ... 

 But they don't know you either? 

 How would they invoke you? 

 They might not even be able to invite me at all, right ? 

 You can always ask someone else for help , right ? 

 Well , we can try . 

 I guess that sounds like a good idea. 

 All right, let's go find out if this will work or not . 

 Let's try something different and see what happens!

Well, when he started on his journey the first thing he did was call all the prophets. They were skeptical about his power and asked him for signs. The next day they saw the sky clearing , the waters calming , the lepers cleaned up , people cured of blindness . 

 And ? 

 It's over ! 

 It can't be done ? 

 Look, I'm not saying that it won't take a little time for me to make everything work right and get the software functioning as intended. But I've got one of those rare people who works his ass off till he gets it right . 

 How do you know ? 

 Well , because I know him ... He's my brother . 

 Yeah, that's exactly why I don't want to be in this meeting with you two. You guys are getting way too emotional about this stuff, and it isn't helping anyone. Look, just do what you have to do, I'm sure it will turn out all right . 

 OK , but if for whatever reason ... 

 You want me to tell you a secret ? 

 I'm the kind of person who does not believe in secrets ... 

 When I was in grade school, one day during recess some kids decided that they were going to have me be their "secret leader" . They had this idea about how they needed to find a good leader because they were afraid that the playground bully was going to hurt them. They asked if I'd like to be the secret leader , and I said yes, just for fun ... 

 And ? 

 Well, when we got back in after recess, some of these kids went straight up to the bully and told him that they had a "secret" . Then they pointed at me. 

 And what happened next ? 

 The bully asked if he could join the secret club ... 

 What do you mean by that? 

 I mean, he wanted to know all of our secrets ! He asked for everyone's birthday and their parents names , and then he told us that we were going to have to tell him everything too . It was the strangest thing. Here's this kid who just wants everybody to be his friend because he is such a nice guy. 

 So what did you do ? 

 I said no ... 

 And then? 

 Well, he looked at me and told me that he would never hurt us because we were all friends . So I went back and told the other kids not to tell him anything about the secret club. But when we got on the playground, there was a bunch of kids standing around the bully waiting for us to come over so they could show them how to join the "secret" . 

 What did you do? 

 I said that this whole idea was stupid , and it would only make things worse if we told anyone else about our secret club ... 

 You mean, there were other kids who didn't want to play with him ? 

 Well, a few of them started arguing over whether or not they should be allowed in the "secret" . It got pretty heated , and then somebody yelled out that I was trying to keep everyone from being friends. Next thing you knew there were kids fighting all over the place. Then we went home for lunch, but when we came back there was a mob of kids waiting to get in our "secret" . So we decided to tell them about it. 

 And ? 

 Well , this time the bully wanted everybody to be his friends too ! 

 How did you do it? 

 I told him that he had to agree not to hurt anybody ever again if he wanted in our club . He said ok, and then everyone else followed me around like a bunch of idiots for a whole year ... 

 So what happened ? 

 After about six months the bully started getting kinda edgy when someone would say something that he didn't like. Then one day he just hit some kid in the face with his fist . Everybody was mad at him, and they told me that I should be too , because I was their leader now. 

 How did you do it? 

 Well, this time I told them that if they ever hit anyone again then they would have to leave our "secret" . So after a few more months, there were some fights on the playground between other kids and the bully ... 

 But what happened then ? 

 He got really mad one day , and he yelled at everyone in our secret club . Then he said that if anyone ever told him to leave again then they would have to go too . After a while, nobody wanted anything to do with me any more. 

 How did you deal with it? 

 I just kept telling myself that I didn't care what happened ... 

 What ?! 

 Well, the kids were all mad at me for making them leave our club. They told me they were going to be my friends forever . But every time something went wrong , they would come to me and ask if we could still have a secret meeting someplace else . I said no ... 

 And ? 

 When I was in the third grade, one of these kids told me that his mother had just died. He asked me if there was anything he could do for me , but I didn't want him to feel like he needed to do something for me because we were still friends . So I told him "no" ... 

 What ?! 

 It wasn't till later that I realized how bad this was going to be. You see, when we were kids it was normal for us to tell each other about our parents dying , and so everybody knew what had happened before they came over to my house. They were all waiting outside on the sidewalk ... 

 What ?! 

 When I finally saw them all standing there by the door , I started crying . Everybody was really upset because nobody wanted me to feel bad alone, so they stayed with me until midnight before going home and telling their own parents that one of our friends had died. 

 How did you do it? 

 Well, it wasn't easy . But I managed to get through the rest of grade school without having anyone come over to my house again . And then when we all graduated from high school , nobody wanted anything to do with me either ...
