" Because I made up my mind that I wanted it . and then I got off of my lazy ass and did what I needed to do. And now , I'm living proof of what happens when you set your sights on something and you go for it. "

" So . ... "

" You need to get over yourself and let the magic happen. "

" OK . I guess that makes sense . but ... "

" No buts ! Just do it ! "

" Thank you , Samantha . "

" Anytime , darlin' "

I hang up and stand there for a moment. Then, I get to work. I turn on my computer , open my email program , and hit reply.

To: invoking@hotmail.com
From: djthorne@hotmail.com
Subject: Invocation

Thank you for your help . I will let you know how it works out.

I guess that's about it. The next day, I get a reply from Samantha. It doesn't come until after midnight , so there are no emails waiting in my inbox when I check. There aren't any more emails the following morning either . but at lunchtime , when I sit down to work on another chapter of "Fantastic Flesh" (I haven't forgotten about that book) , there is an email from Samantha waiting for me. The subject line reads:

Invocation

You got it ! You invocated the sexy into your life ! Way to go, dude ! "

Thank you , Samantha . I really appreciate it.

I guess I'd better get started on the next chapter of my book .

Until we talk again ...

Later that day , I check my email again and there is another message from Samantha waiting for me. The subject line reads:

Invocation Results ?

I want to hear how it went ! I'll bet you're getting a lot of action in your life these days . I hope so .

Until next time ...

Later that day , as promised, I get another email from Samantha. The subject line reads:

Invocation Results ?

Well , the results are mixed , to say the least.

I started getting some action on a regular basis . and then things got a little weird. There was this one guy that I met who seemed pretty cool. He was a DJ at some club downtown, so we had some things in common. We even went out for dinner once , but ... "

" But what ? "

I don't really know . he just sort of stopped calling and coming around after a few weeks. I tried to talk to him about it, but nothing really changed. He was nice enough on the outside, but inside he seemed sort of cold or distant. That feeling was even stronger when we went out for dinner. We sat down at our table , ordered drinks , and then just sort of stared at each other like two zombies for about five minutes before I finally said something to him . "

" You're awfully quiet tonight ... "

" Yeah . so what are you thinking ? "

" I was just wondering if everything is all right , that's all. Are there any problems with your job or anything else that might be bothering you ? "

" No . I don't think so. The job is great . and I love the nightclub scene, but ... "

" But what ? "

" I just don't feel right around him , somehow. It seems like every time we're together something happens to make me feel weird or creeped out . I guess it's kind of a strange feeling because nothing really seems to be happening , but at the same time there's this uncomfortable vibe that surrounds us whenever we get close."

" Well ... "

" So what am I supposed to do ? Just sit here and wait for him to ask me out again . I mean , it isn't like he has a girlfriend or anything. And even if he did , why wouldn't she want him around ? "

" It just seems like there should be some way to get past this ... "

" Well , maybe not with that guy , but you're right . There must be something I can do about it . So what do I need to do ? How do I invoke the sexy back into my life ? "

" OK . so we start with your thoughts. What are you thinking about when you meet him ? "

" Hmmm ... well , I guess I'm kind of comparing him to other guys that have come along lately . It's like there was this one guy who seemed really into me the last time we went out and now he's not calling or coming around anymore. And then there's another guy I met at work ... "

" All right , let's stop right there for a minute . The thing to remember is that you have no way of knowing how other guys are feeling about you when they meet you . If anything, you might be more likely to attract the kind of attention you want by focusing on yourself instead of thinking about what everyone else thinks."

" I guess it sounds crazy , but I don't really know what else to do. All this time I've been trying to think my way into getting more action and all it does is make me feel like there must be something wrong with me . "

" But how can you possibly know that ? It seems to me that the only thing we have to go on here is what other people tell us. We're not mind readers, after all."

" I guess you might be right ... "

" Well , then maybe it's time for a change . What if instead of trying to figure out how guys feel about you when they first meet you, what if you just start thinking differently ? Think like a guy thinks. When you meet him, don't focus on how he looks or what kind of car he drives . Just think about yourself and what you can do for him . "

" You mean I should be thinking more like ... "

" Like a sex-object ! That's it exactly ! And this goes right along with the whole invoking process. When we talk to someone else , we project our own thoughts onto them. We assume that they feel just like us and think about things in a similar way."

" But ... "

" It works both ways . If you want to attract a guy's attention, then the best thing you can do is to focus on yourself instead of comparing him to other guys he might be meeting or wondering what he thinks about when he meets you."

" I see where you're going with this , but ... "

" But nothing ! The key here is that once we understand how our thoughts affect our feelings and actions, then everything starts to make sense . We can start seeing the world as it really is instead of letting other people tell us what they think about things."

" I guess that's true enough ... "

I just stare at her for a moment. Then, I shake my head and laugh. I don't know if Samantha realizes how right she is or not , but somehow I can't help feeling like things are starting to change around here . Maybe it's just because everything seems so different now that I'm thinking differently about what goes on around me . maybe it's something else .

But whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure : from this point forward , invoking will never again feel like such a difficult or confusing task !
