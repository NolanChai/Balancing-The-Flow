Great . Let me show you how to set it up . 

 It is an easy process , but if you don't know what you are doing, it can take a little time . 

 First plug the printer into the wall , then find the correct cable for your computer and attach that as well. 

 If you want to use wireless , then you need to purchase a wireless router and set that up first. Then , you will be able to print from anywhere in your home on any device. 

 Do I have it ? 

 Yes, let me show you how it works . 

 Is there anything else you need help with today ? 

 No thanks for showing me what I needed and taking the time to explain how everything works!

Just make sure that it is pointing the right way. Then pull the lever in front of it all the way back . 

 Now put a sheet of paper in the input tray and slide it over to the left until you see the "paper" light switch on . 

 It is also important that this is not too close to the paper but just right here . 

 Then press the "feed" button all the way down and the paper should start moving through the printer. Do you see it ? 

 No , I don't think so . 

 It is a small lever on top of this little red thingy . 

 This one here . 

 Ah yes, now I do !

Yes , I just got some yesterday . 

 OK . But how do you get the printer to work ? 

 Just go back here , turn this switch on again and wait until the paper comes out. 

 So that was it ? You managed to print a sheet of paper in your office ? 

 Yep , but I also printed some emails , documents and photos . 

 Yes ! I know what you mean . Didn't you find these instructions complicated ?

 Of course not ! It wasn't easy at first , but now it's second nature to me.
