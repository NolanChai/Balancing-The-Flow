" It is my pleasure . "

" Yes sir , it certainly is a beautiful day . "

" I can say that again . "

" No doubt about it . "

" Sure . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if we had rain tonight and snow tomorrow . "

" We could do with some of each ! "

" I don ’ t know about you , but I intend to sleep with my window open tonight . "

" The air is cool enough to keep the mosquitoes away . "

" Well , I am off to see what they are doing at that circus . Do you want to come ? "

" Not if you were the only one who was going . "

" I wasn ’ t offering you a seat with me in my car . It is not such good luck as all that . "

" That was rather kind of her . "

" Oh yes , she was always like that . "

" It will be nice to see them again after all these years . "

" I suppose so . "

" I can ’ t say I look forward to it myself. "

" Really ! Why not ? "

" Well, you know how they were when we were children . "

" Oh yes , I remember now . But why did you come if you don’t want to see them ? "

"Well , I promised them I ’ d call on my way home. You will probably like them better after a while . "

" Well, as long as they are civil, it won ’ t make much difference, but I can ’ t say I like the idea of spending the afternoon with that old cat and those two babies ! "

" Well, it is only an hour or so , and after all, you can sit in your car if you want to. "

" Oh . I don ’ t know about that . I might as well just go back home, then. "

"If you feel that way , by all means do ! I am sure they will understand ! "

" What ? Do you mean that you are going to stay with them for an hour or so ? "

" Why not ? They won ’ t bite you . "

" Oh, come on . That is too much ! "

" No , really. "

" I suppose they want something . "

" Well, maybe. But after all it can do no harm to be nice to them . "

" What if the neighbors see you ? "

" Oh that would never do. Don ’ t worry about that . "

" Very well then , I guess I will have to put up with them for a while, but only as long as it takes ! "

" That is what I thought you would say . "

" I tell you, they don’t treat people like this in the states. People might think that we are not very well brought-up or something ! "

"Oh , now see here , my good man . You ’ re being silly ! "

"It seems to me that if a person is going around behaving in such an arrogant way, he should expect people to gossip about him. It wouldn ’ t be very nice for you to behave in this way with people you don’t even know. If I were you I would try to get along as well as possible with everyone you meet . "

"That is true , I suppose . But still I don ’ t want my wife and children to think that we are being rude or snobbish in any way, do you understand ? "

"Well, I don ’ t see how anyone could get the idea of rudeness from your behavior. You are as polite as can be with these people , aren’t you ? "

" Oh yes , that is true . But we have to be careful, haven ’ t we ? We wouldn ’ t want to give them any reason to speak badly about us. "

"Well then , I think your children should learn how to behave the same way with everyone they meet . "

"That is what I say ! And not only that : if you are going to be rude to someone, why should it matter who he or she is ? There may be a time when we might need some help from this person , and then it would be too late. You should treat everyone with kindness and respect , regardless of how much money they have, or what their family name is . "

"Well , I guess you are right ! It isn ’ t good to talk that way about people we don’t know very well . I just wish there were some way for us to meet them on a more equal footing . "

"What do you mean ? You can speak to these people as politely or rudely as they do, and if they are rude , it will be because of their own bad manners. "

" Yes , that is true too. It’s just that we don ’ t know them . I suppose we could have tea together sometime."

"That would be nice ! If you can manage to make yourself understood without seeming rude, then they will learn how to behave with us as well . "

"All right , we ’ ll see what happens. I don’t know why I should be so nervous about it though ; I’ve been invited there many times before."

"And that is exactly my point : you shouldn ’ t have to be asked. It would be better if you just went over and introduced yourself , without waiting for an invitation . "

"Yes, yes . But what would I say ? They might not understand me anyway. "

"That ’ s right ! If they don’t know your language , then they will have to learn it quickly in order for you to talk with them."

"Well . That sounds easy enough. And when we get there, how do we act ? What are the rules that we should follow? "

"That is simple too ! If someone walks up to you and says ‘ Excuse me , sir ’ or ‘ Madam ’ or whatever the appropriate term might be in your language – if he says this politely enough then you should answer him likewise : ‘ Yes ? ’ Then ask what he wants. If it doesn’t make sense, say so. Then try again until they understand what it is that you want them to do for you."

"Well , I think I know now ! "
