" Shall I wrap them up for you, madam ? "

" You can't be too careful in these days . "

" I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like it at all . "

" Well , what are we going to do about it ? "

" I don't know.I've never heard of anything as bad as this ! "

" What is there left for us to do ? "

" We can't give up ."

" Have you been to the dentist recently ? "

" No , but I must soon."

" You'd better.You know they're very good at my place."

"Oh , I know that very well.It was a long time ago though,wasn't it ? "

" A year and a half or so ."

" What's wrong with him now ? "

" Oh , nothing special.He's just going to have his teeth cleaned."

" Well,you see I've never been at all regular about that sort of thing before."

" So he says it was time you were ! "

" All right then ."

" Have you been to the dentist recently ? "

" Yes , but not for six months."

" Really ? "

" I've been so busy that I just haven't had time ."

" Well,I suppose they won't let anything go wrong, will they ? "

" Oh no ! They're always on the watch for things like this."
