 Thank you , Mr.Smith . And what would you like me to do for you ? 

 If my bags will be sent up immediately ,I'll thank you very much! 

 Certainly , sir . I shall have them sent up at once . Good day, sir !

Two pieces, sir. 

 Do they usually go up so late ? 

 I can only guess the time by looking at the bell . 

 Well, this is a little embarrassing . Let me make it up to you . Would you care for any flowers or anything ? 

 Why , thank you very much . It's very thoughtful of you. 

 If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know. Thank you again. Good-bye!

No , I don't think so . 

 If there's no name on them, we can't identify which ones yours are . I'm very sorry . 

 That's OK . You did your best . I guess they just got lost somewhere along the way . 

 Would you like to call security and have them checked out ? 

 Yes , please do that for me . Thank you.
