" Three suitcases and a duffle bag . "

" Is the duffle bag overstuffed , like this ? "

The bell captain's hands move quickly into the bag.

" Yes . But I've had it for years ! It belonged to my father and I always take it with me whenever I travel . "

" Oh, I see . And what about these three suitcases ? "

" They are overstuffed too . You know , we have so many things here in China that you can't buy there . "

The bell captain takes out three more items.

" Okay ! Now may I have your keys please ? "

He holds up the items he has taken from the bags.

" Oh, no! Not my jade bracelet and my pearl earrings . They are very valuable , you know . I always keep them in this small box that looks like a jewelry case ! "

The bell captain tries to open the case , but he can't. He tries again with great effort , but still nothing.

" And what about the other two items ? "

" They are my wife's favorite pieces of jewellery . Please don't lose them ! "

The bell captain is trying to open the case now, but he can't. He tries again and again with great effort , but still nothing. Finally he asks for help from the bellboy.

" Look , you need someone bigger . My hands are just too small . Could you please help me ? "

" Yes , please see it for yourself. " Yao Lan showed it to her with her back still facing the receptionist at first. She then turned around slowly.

" They were sent up quite a long time ago . "

" You're welcome . "

Yao Lan checked out, paid the bill and went upstairs.

At about 10 o'clock in the evening, she received a call from her cousin Yao Zhi Han to tell her that she was at the railway station. After they had exchanged a few words, Yao Lan told him that she was on her way there, which made Yao Zhi Han feel relieved .

The next day , the two got off the train together and started for Yao Lan's new home in B City.

It wasn't until the next morning when they arrived at their destination that Yao Zhi Han realized that Yao Lan had not packed any clothes apart from one or two sets of underwear, which he found rather strange . However , as she had a few shirts and jeans in her bag, he was able to put his mind at rest.

When the two arrived at Yao Lan's home, they discovered that it was not the type of house they had envisioned - no windows, just a plain wooden door; the entire building looked like it could collapse at any moment .

" This is my new home . "

Yao Zhi Han said in disbelief.

" Is there anything wrong ? " Yao Lan asked , looking quite hurt.

" No , no , nothing's wrong . You can move right in."

After Yao Lan finished unpacking, she went downstairs to wash up and found that the shower room didn't even have a curtain; it was a space of about ten square feet that had been divided into two sections by a door. She couldn't help but feel quite worried .

After lunch, Yao Zhi Han accompanied her to go shopping for some groceries and clothes, which took up the whole day . When they got back home at 7 o'clock that evening , she was exhausted ; she didn't even have enough energy to cook dinner, so they bought a couple of plates of noodles from a roadside stall.

The next few days passed in this way. Yao Zhi Han always went back home at about 10 o'clock every evening . He would arrive just as his cousin was putting on her make-up, then he would cook dinner for them both before going to bed himself. The two of them got up very early each morning, and they didn't even have time for a proper breakfast.

Yao Zhi Han felt sorry for Yao Lan every day . He knew that the only reason she had agreed to come with him was because he was her cousin; if it weren't for that , he would never have been able to persuade her to move over here.

One morning, when Yao Zhi Han got up at six o'clock as usual, he suddenly felt that something wasn't quite right and he opened his eyes wider . The room was full of black smoke ; it was only after he had put on a shirt and went outside to take a look around that he discovered the problem: the two-room house that he lived in with his cousin was on fire!

His heart filled with anxiety, he ran into their room. Yao Lan was lying on her bed sound asleep . He shook her awake and asked if she had eaten anything since yesterday evening; she said no and told him to leave quickly - it seemed that the fire hadn't spread very far yet.

Yao Zhi Han took a couple of plates down from their kitchen, filled them up with rice and vegetables, and then ran back into Yao Lan's room with them . When he reached her doorstep , she was sitting on her bed, still fast asleep; so he shook her again.

" Wake up ! "

" I just ate . What are you making such a fuss about ? "

When Yao Zhi Han saw the food he had brought over for her, he told her to get up and eat it with him . She refused and asked him why she should bother getting up when she was already awake; at that time, the fire didn't seem so urgent anymore.

" If you don't hurry, I might have to wake you again later . " He tried to persuade her , but Yao Lan wouldn't move . The fire had now spread all over the building and the smoke was filling the room; he couldn't even see what was going on outside.

" Hurry up ! " Yao Zhi Han said, picking up a pair of scissors to cut her hair . He knew that if she were to get burnt to death in this house because she was too lazy to move from her bed, it would be impossible for him ever to find another woman again.

" Why do you need to cut my hair ? " Yao Lan asked, covering herself with a blanket and getting ready to go out .

" You can't wear your hair like this . Hurry up ! "

Yao Zhi Han grabbed her head and started cutting off her long blond curls in one go - she suddenly felt dizzy. As soon as he had finished cutting them, he put his scissors down and held her shoulders; her face was so pale that he could hardly see it at all.

" I'll take you to my house for the time being . "

When Yao Lan woke up again , she discovered that they were already in a new place ; she didn't even recognize where they were. The room was about twice as big as their old one - and it had windows! Yao Zhi Han told her that he had arranged for the owner of this house to move into a small shop to allow them to live here until they could find another home to rent.

At this moment, Yao Lan felt incredibly happy . She thanked him again and again; she knew that without his help , she would have died in the fire. However , although she was very grateful for what he had done, it didn't mean that she could ignore everything else . She still couldn't understand why he wanted to move into a place as bad as this one .

" You can stay here for a few days until we find something better . " He told her.

She was speechless. Yao Zhi Han had moved all his clothes and some of hers over from their old house ; she didn't know what to say at that point , so she simply nodded in agreement.
