Yeah ! That would be great ! Where do we meet ? 

 We’ll play at the field in the park across from our house . I can get there after work every night this week , so can you ? 

 I sure can . The only problem is that my wife won ’ t let me join a team because she says that it will cost us too much money ! 

 Really ? Why not ? 

 She ’ s worried we ’ ll get hurt playing sports . We don’t have any insurance . What do you think about this idea ? 

 I ’ ve heard other people say the same thing . But I think it will be fine . I can take care of my own medical bills , and if one of us gets injured on the field , we should get a refund for our registration fees ! 

 OK . I guess you’re right . How much does it cost to join a team ? 

 It depends where you live and what type of sports you play , but around here , it ’ s about $50 per person. 

 $ 50 ?? That seems like a lot ! We should get together tonight so we can sign up right away . 

 Yeah , see you at the field .

Okay , but there are a few things that i need to talk to you. First of all, 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying was announced to be held on Saturday and we were thinking of going as a group.
Secondly, I found this place in which the soccer team will practice. Thirdly, we are considering what position we can play with each other. If you don't have anything else to do this Saturday, it would be great if you could come along. Also, there is an announcement that soccer players need to buy shin-guards before next week.
Last but not least, please make sure that the game will start at 10:30am because I have a class from 9 am till 2pm. So please don't be late for the first meeting. 

Oh, okay . I ' ll get ready soon , and i ’ ll see you tomorrow .

Sounds interesting . What do we need for the team ? 

 At least six players to start with, plus uniforms, balls, goals, field. We can probably get all of them from someone here if we start soon enough . 

 I guess we better get started then . When are you thinking about doing it ? 

 How ’ bout this week end ? 

 Okay , then I guess I should come by sometime on Friday to check things out . 

 Okay ! See ya later.
