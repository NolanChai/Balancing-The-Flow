" Is that so ? Good ! Do you mind if we play today ? It won’t take long, because the sun is coming up and we have to go home soon. "

250. Question: Hi Jim , can you give me some advice about my job?
Answer: Sure. What kind of work do you do now? I worked for a while at an insurance company, but found that it wasn ’ t what I was interested in. I decided to change jobs and get more experience in the field that I wanted to be in. The best way to find out about other jobs is to talk to people who already work in them. If you don’t know anybody at your school who has the kind of job you want, go to a classroom or an office where there are a lot of people and start asking questions. I met one of my friends by talking to him when he was working on his car.

I have also found that it helps to read about jobs in books like this one, so look around at the library until you find something interesting. You can also write letters or talk to people who know about a job that you are interested in. Don ’ t be afraid of trying new things! It’s a great way to learn and to get experience. Good luck!

- _Teacher's Note :_ The vocabulary word " field" (noun) means the area of study or work that is related to your job, such as insurance or sales.

251. Question: Jim , can I come in and talk with you?
Answer: Of course! Just knock on my door when I’m not busy.
- _Teacher's Note :_ "Just" (adv.) means "immediately," as in the previous sentence.

252. Question: Jim , what should I do about my job search?
Answer: It sounds like you could use some advice on that! Let me give you a few suggestions. First, keep your eyes open for jobs wherever you go; read the classified ads in the paper and talk to people. You might also want to check out employment agencies. Then, when you find something you’re interested in, apply for it and see what happens. If they call you back, show up on time for your interview — and be sure to dress neatly and carry a copy of your resume. Then sit down and relax while the interviewer asks questions about why you think you would fit into his company, how much experience you’ve had in related jobs and what kind of salary you expect. The last thing you want to do is give them reasons for turning you down!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words "applies for" (verb) means that someone sends an application to a company or school, usually by mail but sometimes in person.

253. Question: Jim , why does it take so long to get a job?
Answer: It depends on your situation, and there are many different things you can do to help the process along. For example, you might want to ask for suggestions from people you know who have found good jobs recently — or if they don ’ t work in your area of interest, maybe they can point you to someone who does. You could also check out the school placement office; many employers look there first when they need to fill vacancies. Finally, it might help to put together a list of all the places where you’ve worked or volunteered — including any details about your responsibilities and achievements — so that you can have ready references if someone calls them for a reference check. Good luck!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words "achievements" (noun) means the things you do well, such as getting good grades or helping people with problems. You might also see the word "accomplishments."

254. Question: Jim , what does “interview” mean? Answer: It’s an important part of applying for a job — it’s your chance to talk with the hiring manager and tell him why you should be chosen over all the other candidates who applied. During this interview, he or she will usually ask questions about your work experience and any training or schooling that you have had; then they may ask you to give examples of times when you made a difference at each place where you worked or studied. At the end of the interview, be sure to ask if there are any other steps in applying for this position before making up your mind about whether it’s right for you! Good luck with it.
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words "make a difference" (idiom) means that you have done something good at work or school and the person who hired you is happy about it. You might also say, "do well" or "get ahead."

255. Question: Jim , what does “salary” mean? Answer: It’s an amount of money given to someone for their job — usually in addition to any other benefits they receive like health insurance or vacation time off each year. The word comes from the French word "salaire", which means "wages," and it’s often used when talking about payments made by employers rather than employees themselves (like if someone were working as a consultant). If you’re considering taking a new job, be sure to ask what kind of salary they offer first — then compare this amount with other offers before making up your mind!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words "addition" (noun) and "benefit" are often used together in business English. When the word "addition" is followed by "to," it usually refers to more money that you earn on top of your regular pay, for example when working overtime or as a bonus for doing something well at work. You might also say, "extras."

256. Question: Jim , can you tell me what a job interview is like? Answer: Sure! An interview usually starts by introducing yourself to the person who will be conducting it; then they’ll ask about your past experience and qualifications for this position (or any other positions that may interest them). If everything goes well, at some point during or after the conversation, they might offer you a chance to make sure there isn't anything else they want from you before making their decision. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about what kind of training they provide for new employees and whether there are any benefits included with this position — especially if it’s more than one year long!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The word "offer" (verb) is used in two different ways. When it means to make an offer, you can use the simple form ("to give something away"). If you are not sure about making a promise or saying yes or no at this time, then use "propose": "I propose that we talk for half an hour." You might also say, "I suggest ..."

257. Question: Jim , can I speak to one of the managers here? Answer: Sure! Let me ask him if it's a good time right now... he's actually in the middle of something but maybe we could come back later today or tomorrow morning instead... ok, let’s go talk to him then.
- _Teacher's Note :_ When someone asks if it is "a good time" (idiom) they mean that you should wait until a better opportunity comes along in the future. In other words, this could be another chance for them to meet later on when things are less busy at work.

258. Question: Jim , what can I do if my boss doesn ’ t want me to work overtime? Answer: If you have any concerns or questions about what your job might entail — whether it’s how many hours per week they expect from an employee before paying them extra for working more than that amount — ask these things before accepting the position! In fact, even if there isn’t anything specific written down in contract form (which would make any kind of discussion about this subject easier), don ’ t hesitate to bring up this issue during your first meeting with him/her: "I was wondering what kind of schedule I should expect while working here..."
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words "expect" and "should" are very important in job interviews. When you use them, it means that you want to know more about the job before deciding whether or not it’s right for you. You might also say, "require."

259. Question: Jim , I need help with my resume! Answer: Sure thing! What kind of job are you looking at? Maybe we can look together and talk about what kind of things to include in yours... maybe even write some new ones down if needed (don ’ t worry, they won’t cost anything).
