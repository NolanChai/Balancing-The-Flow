" I don ’ t know !"

"What colors? "

"I don’t like any color!"

"How about some plain black clothes?"

"Well…yes , I guess so. "

"Then, we are almost out of time and you need to decide what to buy now ."

"But, I want the ones with red polka dots !"

"I can’t believe you just said that!"

" But I do!!"

" We’ll try one more store."

" No , I don’ t think so. "

" Well, here it is ! "

"Oh !It looks great . How much ? "

" I can’t believe you want to buy this !! "

"But, I love it!"

"Okay, okay …we have a deal."

"Thank goodness. Now let ’ s go home and get ready for the party ! "

This is just an example of how difficult shopping can be for women .
It’s not easy to buy clothes you like , clothes that are right for your body type,
clothes that fit your personality and style , and most importantly
it ’ s hard to find clothes at a reasonable price !
What do men have to say about the subject ?
"I just want jeans and t-shirts . It doesn’t really matter what color they are, or even what brand of jeans. And I don’t care if my shirt is designer, as long as it looks good on me."
So , shopping for clothes isn ’ t a big deal to men !
Well, there you go – that was the second part of our series on Women and Men .
This time we looked at some typical situations women may find themselves in during their daily lives.

" I like blue better than brown or black . "

" Hmm...you have good taste ...well, this is a new brand for us . We don ’ t know much about its quality . Do you want to try it on ? "

" Okay . "

" Take the small size , and one more sweater in medium size."

"What’s your phone number ? I will give you a call when we are back home. "

"Sure, thank you so much for helping us."

"No problem at all ! "

" What kind of sweater is suitable for you ?"

" Not too long sleeves . The one I saw looks good, but it ’ s very expensive.How much is that one? "

" You should buy what fits your style and budget.If you can’t afford the price,don ’ t buy them at all.You won ’ t look as beautiful in them as when they fit you. "

"I like this sweater a lot . What do you think ? "

"Well , it looks very nice on you.But I think that color is too bright for you to wear.It makes you seem older than you really are."

" That ’ s true . You should choose more quiet colors and darker ones . "

"Yes,I know . "

"What about the one with stripes ? It looks pretty good on you."

"Well , I think it suits me very well.The color is also nice,and the length of sleeves is suitable for me.How much is that sweater ? "

"It’s 68 dollars ."

"Wow! It ’ s too expensive.I can’t afford to spend so much money on one sweater.You see , I only have a part-time job and my budget is limited."

"Well , it ’ s all up to you if you want to buy that sweater or not . I just tell you what I think of the price . "

"That’s true,but if it suits me very well,I’m going to spend the money.Thank you for your help."

"You are welcome."
