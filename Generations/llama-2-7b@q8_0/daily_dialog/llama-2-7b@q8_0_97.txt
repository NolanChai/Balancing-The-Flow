 That ’ s great! Thanks a lot ! 

 Bye .

How about what color? 

 Well, maybe gray or blue . Or white is good too . 

 What do you mean by “too loud” ? 

 By “loud”, do you mean it’s very bright and shiny ? 

 I guess so. 

 Didn ’ t your mom tell you how to tie your shoelaces when you were little ? 

 That’s right.But sometimes she would forget to teach me.Then my dad would have to step in .

 I think they thought it was funny. 

 Do you mean your parents are still together ? 

 Yeah, we live with them. 

 Do you want some coffee or tea ? 

 Sure , coffee would be fine .
