" Then why don't you go and eat something, and then come back. "

" I shall eat nothing. "

"Then what are you waiting for? "

" For your love to come here. "

" What? Is that so ? Well, since you say you want my love, I will give it to you if you like. "

" If I have no money, how can you do anything for me?"

" Even without money I shall be able to give you the kind of love which only I know how to give, and that is the love a mother gives her child. "

" But I am not your child! You are my aunt. "

" Oh! my dear niece, you have no idea what I can do for you now. I will take care of all your needs. And you don't know how much better off we shall be once your husband joins us. He has been very ill lately and we are worried about his health. I am sure he must have forgotten you. "

" How did you come to know that? "

" Well, we are a little family. We all live together as one big happy family. We each look after our own business and then help out with other people's too. You see I make a living by selling my embroidered articles, which is how I was able to buy you this beautiful dress ."

" So it was you who bought me that dress ? "

"Yes, it was me. I bought it for you as soon as you got married and then gave it back again. Now do come with me at once! "

The young wife was still undecided whether to go with her aunt or not when the latter added:

"Oh my dear niece, how can you be so ungrateful? Your husband is dead, that I know. But if he were alive, what would he do without your help and support? You are his only relative and it is your duty to take care of him and provide for his needs."

The young woman could see the poor man in a bed surrounded by filth. She hesitated no longer but went with her aunt at once. It was really a most depressing sight. There she saw the dead body covered with flies and other insects. The smell of corruption filled the room and made her head swim.

"It's a real disgrace! "she thought to herself, as if for the first time. She sat down by the side of the bed and looked at him for some time; then she began to cry, as though she had no control over herself. The old woman came up to her and said:
"Oh, my niece, your tears are for naught! Your husband's body is already a corpse! There is nothing we can do now."

The young wife looked at the dead man with anger in her eyes, then she took hold of his hand and pulled him toward her.

She had come to save his life; so she thought that if she could give him a good blow on the head it might revive him, but it was not possible for a woman to hit anyone at all. She gave up in despair and fell down weeping on her husband's body. The old woman said to herself:
"Why should I help such a bad woman? What will I gain by it?" She sat down near the fire and began to work at her embroidery with great concentration, as though she had not seen anything. But she was listening carefully to every word which passed between her niece and the dead man. Presently they started talking about the kind of life a wife should lead with her husband, and how it is necessary for each one to be tolerant of his or her spouse. The woman said:
"You see, I am now alone in this world without anyone except my aunt. I have nothing left but my virtue." Then she burst into tears again and went on like that until the sun had set. When night came down, the old woman lit a lamp and began to embroider her dress. Presently the young wife fell asleep.

But no sooner did the dead man hear his wife's breathing than he opened his eyes. He took hold of her hands and pulled them towards him, then he began to talk to her. She had not understood what she was doing. For a while she continued sleeping peacefully; but soon she woke up with a start, terrified by the ghostly voice which seemed to be speaking from her husband's mouth.
"Oh! what are you doing?" she thought. "Who is it who is talking and how did he get back here? It must be my imagination." And as she said this out loud, he started talking again:

"Don't be afraid! I am your husband! I have come to tell you that we can no longer live together here. You know that the earth has been made for us by God to keep us company and help us live, but now it is useless for us. We are dead and gone! "

"What do you mean?" she replied. "I don't understand what you're talking about."

"Let me tell you that the earth is like a woman who gives birth to all creatures and brings them up to adulthood, but when they grow old and are no longer useful for her, she kills them. That is why we must die now because our work is finished! "

The young wife was frightened and tried to get away from him, but he would not let go of her. So she called out to the old woman:
"Auntie! Auntie!" she cried. "What are you doing there? Come here at once, I beg you." The aunt came over at once and began to look for something in one corner and another; but nothing was to be found. She took off her embroidered cloak and spread it out on the floor, so that they could sit down together.

The young wife got up and went over to where her husband was lying and began to talk with him again: "You see, I'm sorry about what has happened. But do you know how we can be rescued? There is a priest living in the village who is famous for his knowledge of all matters sacred and profane; he is very learned indeed and I am sure that if we went to consult him we could come out of this trouble. "

"So you think that the world will be saved by a priest ? You must not take me for a fool! It would have been better if you had never come here, because now there's nothing left for us except to go to hell!"

The woman was very distressed and continued to talk to him: "Why do you say that? Do you want to condemn me too?" She went on, "I am sorry for what I have done but it is not my fault. Now help me please to find the priest we were talking about."

"How can a man like that help us when there are so many people who need his help and he does not have enough time to see them all? "

"I don't care! We must try at least!" she replied.

The old woman was listening to their conversation attentively; then she asked:
"Auntie, what is it you are talking about?"

"Do you want to go out for a walk in the countryside with me and see if we can find anyone who will give us a place to stay ? "asked her niece.

"What? You mean I am going to sit by my husband's side for ever? Never, never! Do you think that I would like to be buried alive?" she cried out. The young wife could not understand what the old woman was saying; but soon she understood and said: "Oh well, if you are too scared of staying with your dead husband then you can come along."

So they went outside into the courtyard where there were so many pots full of water that it seemed as though all the rain which had fallen in the previous days was contained within them. The woman called out to her husband: "Now listen, my dear! I have just remembered what we were saying about our salvation and how you can help me ."

But the ghostly voice replied: "No, I cannot help you now!" And he said to himself : 'If only it had not been for this woman, all would be well. But she is so obstinate that nothing will do but she must have her own way." Then he added with a smile on his face: "There! You see what has happened? If we were still alive, then there might be hope for us ."

The young wife was very upset and said to her niece: "Oh Auntie! How can you be so cruel ? What did I do to deserve this treatment from you?" Then she added with a sigh :
'Well, that is the way it goes sometimes. If we are not careful about what we say or do, then the consequences may turn out badly for us.'

The old woman was very sad and went back into her room where she lay down on her mattress to have some rest. Then the young wife took hold of her husband's hand and began to talk to him as before. After a while he opened his eyes again and spoke: "Auntie! Auntie ! I
