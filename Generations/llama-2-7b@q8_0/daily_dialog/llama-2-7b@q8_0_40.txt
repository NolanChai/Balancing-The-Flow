" It better not ! The next time will be the last . "
\end{blockquote}

Comment: You are not missing any information, but this is just a sentence fragment. The OP asked for a complete sentence, and there isn't one here.

Answer: I think you have misunderstood the problem.  This phrase is not incorrect; it is simply incomplete.

The "sentence" is missing an object (usually understood) after the verb in the main clause ("it \em{better} not") and a complement of the preposition ("for"), both of which would come before the closing parenthesis, thus:

\begin{blockquote}
"I have a complaint to make. The bill you sent me was incorrect (what's more). It's not the first time. What's more, it isn't the first time."

"Well, I must apologize, madam. We have new computers here, you know."

"Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly?"

"I agree entirely.  I assure you, it won't happen again."

"It better not!" (here)

"The next time will be the last."
\end{blockquote}

Answer: This sentence is correct as it is but a bit informal and incomplete. Incomplete because of missing the closing parenthesis `).`

Informal because you can use that kind of sentences in writing letters or even to speak with friends, relatives or neighbors (depending on the context)
