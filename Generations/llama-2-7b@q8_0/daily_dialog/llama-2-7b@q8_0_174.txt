You are very kind to me . Thank you . 

 I have just arrived here from another city . It's my first time in this country and also the first time for me to live abroad . 

 Welcome ! Do you like your new job ? 

 Yes ,I do . I like working with computers because it is very interesting . Besides,I can use these things everyday. 

 What are you doing here ? 

 I am a trainee at this company . 

 How long have you been a trainee here ? 

 It has been one month now , and I like my work very much because it is fun to me . 

 Have you done many jobs before? 

 No ! I have only worked in the computer centre as an assistant for two years . Then I came here to learn more about computers. 

 Do you like your new job better ? 

 Yes ,I do .It's much easier than my past work. 

 Have you learned a lot since you came here ? 

 Yes ! My boss always tells me how to use the computer and gives me a lot of homework every day . I am glad that he is very patient with me . 

 What kind of job will you do after finishing your training here ? 

 I want to be an office manager , so I need more experience about business management . Then,I'll apply for a better position. 

 How can you learn those things? 

 My boss gives me some books and magazines related to business management every week . So, I read them all the time in my spare time . 

 Thank you very much . Have you any questions ? 

 Not really ,but thank you for your help. 

 Do you have any plans for holiday this year? 

 Yes! My boss told me to take a vacation on the 1st of August because I've worked here for more than 50 days. So, my friends and I are going to visit our hometown in the country where we used to live before . 

 You must have many memories there. 

 Yes ,but I am not a tourist so I don't need any guide books . It is fun just wandering around with no plans or itinerary. Besides,we will visit our friends and relatives who live near the city where we used to live. 

 What kind of vacation do you want ? 

 I think that a relaxing holiday will be good for me after working all day . 

 Have you ever been on a trip like this? 

 Yes ! In fact,I've done the same thing before . We visited our hometown as well . It was very fun but it is hard to find hotels near the city where we used to live. We had to spend a lot of time just looking for one hotel in which we can stay and we got tired every day because it was such a long trip from the airport or station to our friends' houses. 

 What kind of holiday would you recommend ? 

 I like trips that are not so stressful . If you have time,you should visit your friends and relatives in their hometowns. But if you don't want to stay for too long ,I suggest you go on a tour around the country where you used to live before. You can visit many places that are famous there with less money than other places. 

 What do you think about taking a trip ? 

 It is great ! I love travelling around the world because I get to meet new people and learn about different cultures . Besides,I can see things that are not seen in my hometown . For example ,the famous buildings in New York are very impressive. 

 Have you ever been there? 

 Yes ! It's my favourite city because of its exciting atmosphere . I've visited there many times with different purposes, such as for business or sightseeing and it is always interesting to me . 

 Which place do you prefer ? 

 New York is very busy and noisy but still people are friendly. So ,I think that travelling alone would be better than travelling in a group because I can make new friends easily. Besides,there are many kinds of activities for tourists like taking pictures or watching shows . 

 Do you have any plans to travel abroad this year ? 

 Yes ! Next month,my boss will send me to our company's office in the USA for a training program on computers . So ,I want to visit some famous places before going back home. I haven't decided where exactly I would go but it might be New York or California because those are very popular with tourists around the world. 

 Would you like travelling alone or with someone ? 

 If possible,I'd prefer travelling by myself . I have no friends here so it will be difficult for me to make new ones when I am abroad. Besides ,the expenses of travelling alone are much lower than those for a group tour because one person only needs one room and he or she doesn't need any food for the whole trip. 

 How about you ? Do you like travelling abroad? 

 Yes ! I love it . Travelling makes me feel free and excited , which are good things in my opinion. 

 Have you been anywhere recently ? 

 Yes! Last month,I went to New York with my boyfriend for a week's holiday because he had some work there too . It was great fun ! We visited many places such as the Statue of Liberty , Central Park and Times Square . Besides ,we stayed in one hotel near Broadway which is very famous among tourists. 

 How did you like travelling abroad? 

 I enjoyed it so much that I want to go there again next year ! 

 What do you think about the benefits of travelling ? 

 There are many advantages for us when we travel because we can learn more about different cultures and ways of life . Besides,it is good for our health too. For example ,when we meet new people who live in a different country or environment from us,we will know how to deal with difficult situations . 

 How often do you travel abroad ? 

 About once a month ! 

 Are there any differences between your life now and your life before you started travelling? 

 Yes! I used to think that it was impossible for me to make friends when I visited different countries because I couldn't understand their languages . But after going abroad,I know how important communication is in order to make new friends easily. Besides ,I found out that people everywhere have the same feelings like us so we should not worry about being accepted by them . 

 Would you like travelling anywhere else soon ? 

 Yes ! I want to go back to New York again because there are still many places for me to visit there . For example,Times Square is always crowded with lots of people walking around , shopping malls are full of goods from all over the world and Broadway shows are very popular among tourists who like watching musicals. Besides,there are a lot of good restaurants that serve delicious food at affordable prices so I can enjoy my meals while visiting there. 

 Do you want to do anything special this weekend ? 

 Yes ! My friend invited me to go shopping in his hometown on Sunday . So ,we'll spend the whole day together enjoying our favourite things - buying clothes, eating food and watching movies with each other. Besides ,he has promised me that we would have dinner at a good restaurant near his house after finishing our activities for the day . 

 Do you often go shopping ? 

 I like it but not very much because it takes too long to find things which suit my style or taste well enough ! However,I sometimes buy clothes on sale when they are really cheap . Besides ,I always visit new stores in different places whenever possible because some of them have good discounts and give me free gifts if I spend money there . 

 What kind of food do you like ? 

 All kinds ! I love eating fruits, meat , fish and vegetables especially those which are freshly picked up from fields . Besides ,I am also fond of different types of cakes such as chocolate, strawberry or vanilla. 

 Do you have any plans for this weekend? 

 Yes ! I want to visit my grandparents at their house in the city where they live . It's been a long time since we last met and it would be nice if we could spend some time together on Saturday afternoon after going shopping . Besides ,I promised them that I would cook dinner for them when they come back home from work so I will prepare everything needed beforehand. 

 What do you usually do on weekends? 

 I like to go out with my friends or family members who live nearby . For example, we might watch a movie together at the cinema , go shopping in town centre or visit an exhibition about art which takes place every year around this time of year. Besides ,I also enjoy playing computer games by myself when nobody else is there because it is relaxing and fun as well ! 

 Do you have any plans for tonight ? 

 Yes! My sister invited me to go out with her friends . We will eat dinner first in a restaurant before going

Well , it's your lucky day today! Because we have a meeting in this afternoon. 

 Oh ? That's great ! May I know what about? 

 About some company regulations . It will take about two hours, and then you can start to do something more meaningful after that. 

 Wow ! Thanks for the information! 

 Sure . See you later! 

 Good bye !

Have a nice day ! 

Have a good time in our office !
