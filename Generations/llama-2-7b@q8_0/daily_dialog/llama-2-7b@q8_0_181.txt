Well , look to your right at the next corner. It's the big brick building with a huge wooden sign hanging out front that says "Admiral Hotel". 

 Oh ! Thank you very much!

I arrived in Atlanta by plane and I took a taxi. The driver said to me :

 Excuse me sir , is it possible to get back to the airport ? 

Yes, of course. Do you want to go through Buckhead or Downtown?

 Well , Buckhead would be nice . 

 Okay then we're going to Buckhead. It should take about 15 minutes at least.

 I just hope that I can find it.

You are now in an English speaking country and you don't understand what people are talking about. You have a dictionary but you can not look up the words because of the time factor. Try to follow this conversation. The first question is "Excuse me, how do we get to downtown from here?", and then you should answer in English.

 Excuse me , I don't understand what you are talking about . 

 Do you want to go Downtown or Buckhead ? 

 No ! I just arrived and I need to find a hotel now.

Okay, that is possible too.

 Yes, but I can not find it.

I'll see you later. 

 Bye-bye.
