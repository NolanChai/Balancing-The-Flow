\end{blockquote}

I also found this in a book called "The Longman Student Grammar of Spoken English" (1986):

\begin{blockquote}
"Excuse me, sir. Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is?"

"That's over on Callaway Street, isn't it?"

"Yes, but I can't find Callaway Street."

"Walk that way for about four blocks. The hotel's about two blocks north of there."

"Thanks a lot!"
\end{blockquote}

In this example, the questioner doesn't know which direction is "north". Also, you could easily say "I can't find Callaway Street \strong{west}" or "Callaway Street is east of here."

Does it make any sense to answer an unspecified question about a street with an unspecified direction? I don't think so.

Comment: This is incorrect, and based on misinformation. The speaker does know in which direction Callaway St. is located relative to the listener. That fact was established by the first question (which is an essential component of the sentence).

Answer: You are assuming that if a person does not specify a direction then they don't have one in mind; but this is not always true. For example, I might say "Do you know where the admiral hotel is?" to someone who had told me that they were going there for dinner. Since I would already know in which direction they were facing (i.e. whether or not it was west of their current location), I wouldn't have to specify a direction when asking if they knew its name.

Answer: The question is really not well formed because the interlocutor does not know what kind of hotel you are looking for and if it exists at all. To answer this, you need to add more information about the context.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}
\end{itemize}

He might answer "Yes" and say the hotel is on the other side of the street, or he could just point in one direction and say something like:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Yes I know it's across the road.}
\end{itemize}

But he doesn't necessarily have to answer with a direction. The speaker has no idea where Callaway Street is or whether there even is an Admiral Hotel in that street, so just saying "yes" could mean any number of things and can be answered with any kind of answer. There might not be such a hotel at all!
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir. Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{"Yes, I know it's in Callaway Street."}
\end{itemize}

Now the speaker knows what kind of hotel you are asking for and where it is located in relation to the interlocutor. But the speaker doesn't know if he himself will be able to find such a hotel since he doesn't know if he knows which side of Callaway Street the admiral hotel is on, or where exactly it is in that street (which part?). He could answer with "I don't know" but that would mean nothing.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{"Yes I know it's somewhere near the intersection of Callaway and Dockside Street."}
\end{itemize}

The speaker now knows what kind of hotel, in which street and at what intersection. But he doesn't know if that means north or south of the intersection, so his answer might be wrong. In this case, you can ask him to describe it more precisely by asking him to tell you where exactly on Dockside Street and whether Admiral Hotel is north or south of that intersection.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{"Yes I know it's somewhere near the intersection of Callaway and Dockside Street."}

\em{"So, which side of that intersection is the hotel? Is it north or south?"}

\strong{"It's on the north side. In fact, the Admiral Hotel is a few blocks south of here but you can see the sign from here.}
\end{itemize}
