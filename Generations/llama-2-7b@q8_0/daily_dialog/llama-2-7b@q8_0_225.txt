This is a very common situation when a candidate meets with a recruiter. A recruiter may be looking for experienced candidates, but that doesn’t mean that your experience has to be exactly what they are looking for. There is always another way to convince them that you are the right one, if only you find it in yourself.

## How can I prove myself?
There are many ways you can use to convince a recruiter that you are able and qualified enough to get hired. They all rely on your own abilities, how confident you are, what you have done before, etc. Here is an example:
You just want to make a great first impression , but the employer is not willing to accept your application . You can show him that you can handle the accountant position by using examples of problems you encountered in real-life scenarios and how you solved them . 

### Be creative.
The recruiters may look for some specific experience, such as you have to know SAP , or you need to have experience in managing teams, etc., but if the experience is not exactly what they are looking for, do not despair! Try to find a way to present your own strengths and make yourself stand out from the crowd.

## How can I sell myself?
If you can’t provide evidence of past experiences, then you must prove that your skills are more valuable than the ones provided by other candidates.

### Talk about yourself . 
It is a great idea to talk about yourself and what makes you stand out from the crowd. When I was writing my resume for accountant position at an investment firm, I thought it would be easy for me because I had a degree in finance , but they were looking for people who had a minimum of 3 years experience . So how could I prove myself?

### Be confident and persuasive.
The most important thing to remember when you are applying for an accountant position is that you need to be confident in yourself and your abilities, while at the same time, make sure your skills are worth more than others'. If you don't think so, ask other people who know about it .
