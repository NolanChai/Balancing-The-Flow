I am not sure what's going on . All I know is that we were planning to offer you the position and now it is offered to someone else ! 

 You are one of our best workers. Why do you think I lost the opportunity for myself? 

 If I were you , I would be mad at this. I don't want to make any further discussion . I am leaving the company immediately. 

 Goodbye!

[Warning: Short generation] 

I will be honored to accept your offer . Let us meet in a week.
