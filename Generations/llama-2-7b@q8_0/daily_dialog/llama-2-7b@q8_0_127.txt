Do you like the job?It is hard for you to find a good job, isn't it? 

Not really . It’s all right for me and I enjoy myself.I am sure that your boss will be glad if you can finish this work for him before you go back tomorrow. 

Well, then, just tell him "thank you very much". 

 Sure thing ! 

Take care on the way home. 

 Bye. Have a nice day !

What's your schedule like during the day ?  

 Normally,I leave my office at around 6pm.But sometimes if I can't get all of my things done in time , I may have to stay back until about ten or so. 

 Is it a stressful job ? 

 Well,it depends .There are times when I feel really pressurized by deadlines but on the whole,it's not too bad . 

 How often do you go out with friends after work? 

 Sometimes ,depending on what kind of mood I am in.If my boss hasn't given me a particularly pressing assignment to deal with that evening,I may choose to just head straight home and relax instead. 

 What about weekends ? Do you usually go out during the weekend ? 

 Not really .I guess most of us in this department tend to hang around together on Saturday nights because we all live quite near each other .We all feel like a big family here. 

 What do you and your friends do in the evenings ? 

 Well,usually just go out for a quiet meal , watch movies or maybe just head down to the shopping center nearby.There are several small cafes there where we can sit outside and enjoy an ice-cream. 

 Is that something you do all the time on weekends? 

 No,not really .But it's fun when you're doing it with your friends,I guess ! 

 What about music ? Do you guys like listening to music ? 

 Yes ,we do ,but not very often.There are too many distractions in the evenings. 

 How about watching TV ? Is that something you like to do together? 

 Sometimes .It depends on what's being shown . 

 What's your favorite channel ? 

 It depends really on the time of day and who else is around .I don't have a specific one. 

 Are there any shows that you all like to watch together? 

 I think the only show we all tend to watch together is the news at ten o'clock ,but even then it's not that often . 

 You work quite hard,don't you ? 

 Yes,I guess.I try my best and I do love my job.I was never one of those people who would rather be out and about somewhere else having fun than at home working but it doesn't mean that I don't enjoy myself now and then . 

 I guess not .But what about your friends? Do they all work or go to university ? What do you guys talk about when you hang around together in the evenings? 

 Most of us are at school.We generally talk about our studies and exams and stuff like that .Sometimes we also just chat about girls and other things.It's fun ,especially if there is a girl with us,but it can be quite dangerous because people often see us together and start getting the wrong idea or even spreading rumors ! 

 I guess you can never tell what some of these people might think .Sometimes it can get pretty tense around here when things are going on in that way.What about you ? Have you ever experienced something like this before ? 

 Yes,I have ,but only once or twice and most of my friends don't really believe that any of the rumors could be true anyway .They think I'm too shy to go out with anyone ,which is probably why they keep asking me to introduce them to some girls so that they can try their luck. 

 Do you mind if I ask you something ? 

 Sure ! 

 Why don't you ever talk about your girlfriend?I mean,I know she must be around here somewhere because we all see her in the evenings but nobody talks to her .Why is that? 

 Well ,there isn't much to talk about.She doesn't like going out with me and my friends ,and I can understand why because they are always asking me stupid questions or trying to flirt with her while she looks at me as if I have two heads ! It's really embarrassing for all of us . 

 That's a shame.How long has this been going on ? 

 About three months now and it seems like it will continue like that until the end of time .My girlfriend is always complaining about how I don't treat her well enough ,but if anything,she doesn't really care for me either way!She never wants to spend any more time with me than she has too.I just wish we could get along better. 

 We all have problems like that .What do you guys talk about in your free time?Is there anything in particular which interests you the most? 

 Mostly,we talk about girls and what's going on at school ,which isn't really very interesting.Sometimes we also discuss music or movies but that doesn't last for long before someone starts complaining about something again . 

 You seem to have a lot of stress in your life.What would you like to do if you could choose between anything ? What are the things which make you feel happy? 

 Well,I don't think I can ever be truly happy as long as my girlfriend keeps on complaining all the time .I guess she just needs a good shake to wake her up ! As far as other interests go ,I like playing football and watching movies at home with my friends but I also enjoy listening to music occasionally. 

 What kind of music do you prefer? Do you play an instrument too ? 

 No,not really .My favorite type is rock and roll music although some people may not find it very interesting . 

 You have a great voice for singing too.You should consider joining the choir at school then ! 

 I don't think so .I was never good enough to be in any sort of competition anyway,but if there were any other kind of talent show where nobody knew who they were competing against ,I might consider it ! 

 That's a very interesting idea!I wish you all the best with your school and work life.Thanks for coming down here today .If I can help you in any way,let me know ok? 

 Sure thing .It was nice meeting you too ,Missy !

What is the worst thing in your job ? 

 Dealing with clients ' complaints and being interrupted while I try to focus on my work . 

 Do you have any plans for the future ? 

 I would like to change to a better paid position when there is an opening.But it's really hard because of the competition among the other job seekers.If I get the chance , I will definitely apply for it . 

 That sounds great .What about your life outside work? 

 It is really quiet and peaceful in this city where I live.I have no special hobbies but I often go to a nearby park with my friends for fun or just chill out alone there.I like reading books in my spare time as well as watching movies .But not always.

### 你在看的是一本什么书？

That is wonderful.I wish I can work with you here one day . But my work experience is limited to teaching . 

 But that's nothing compared to your English language skills.I believe that's your strong point ? 

 Yes , I think so . To tell the truth,it was actually quite easy for me to get a job in a foreign company as long as I spoke good English . 

 Really? 

 Well,let me tell you ,I was once offered a part time job by this company when I was still an undergraduate student at college.It was only then that my friend told me that they would give preference to those with good foreign language skills.But I didn't have any previous experience in the field . 

 And so how did you finally get here ? 

 Well ,the story is pretty interesting actually.I had just returned home from college and was preparing for an interview when my mom told me that a friend of hers happened to know someone working as a marketing assistant at this company in Shanghai.So I got a call asking me if I'd be interested in the job . 

 Did you have any doubts about your suitability ? 

 Yes,I was definitely concerned and didn't want to lose out on such an amazing opportunity.But my mom gave me lots of encouragement and I decided to apply for it . 

 It is great that everything turned out well in the end ,especially because you were given a job right after graduation without even having any relevant experience in the field . 

 I know,but I'm always worried about whether I can handle such responsibilities and keep up with work demands.That's why I would like to have some more training before working as a marketing assistant . 

 Training is essential for anyone who wants to do something well.I don't think it's unreasonable for you to ask for some time off from work to be trained and taught by experts. 

 That is right,but I doubt whether this company will pay for my training ,even though it promised to provide me with any necessary training after hiring me . 

 Well ,I'm not too sure about that either.But it's nothing we can do about it now. 

 The way things are going,I think I would like to look for another job or go back home after this one expires .

 Do you know if there are any other companies in the city offering training opportunities ? 

 Yes ,a number of them ,but I'm not sure whether they can offer me with such a chance. 

 But it seems to me that there is little point in trying for something when one doesn't even have an idea what it entails . 

 True,I don't know much about the opportunities available for marketing assistants ,but I definitely want to do well in my job and grow up to be a good professional. 

 Then we should go back to basics first.What exactly is your job as a trainee ? 

 It involves everything from answering phone calls to dealing with letters,faxes,etc.,and sending documents to other offices within the company ,so that they can be processed.It's not easy at all and I really need to keep up . 

 Is there anything else you do ? 

 Sometimes I have to prepare some business documents or help out with meetings in a temporary capacity . That is great,you seem like an experienced marketing assistant already.I feel quite happy that the company has given me such an amazing opportunity. 

 Yes,I'm really grateful for this chance and would do my very best to make use of it.So how about you?Do you have any plans for the future ? 

 To tell you the truth ,I am thinking of working in a foreign company in Beijing or Shanghai after I graduate . 

 Well,if you've got such ambition,you must be ready to work hard and prove yourself worthy.In addition,the more experienced you are with English and other foreign languages , the better off you would be when it comes to applying for a job. 

 That is right.I definitely need some time off from work and have enough language training before I can make progress in my career . 

 Why don't you apply for leave now ? 

 That is an excellent idea actually,and I should do so immediately.I really appreciate your encouragement.Thank you again !
