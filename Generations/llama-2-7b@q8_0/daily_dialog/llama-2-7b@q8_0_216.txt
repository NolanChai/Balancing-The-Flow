" I just can't do it . I promised the customer that we would meet on Monday , so I'm not going to cancel this meeting because of jetlag and a bad cold . It wouldn't be right ! "

" I think I'll go home and take it easy , but thanks for your concern . "

" Oh no ! Is it a rash ? "

" No , not quite yet . I just have some small cuts from my cat clawing me in the night while I was sleeping . But the cuts are getting bigger . "

" Don't you think you should see your doctor for this ? It could be an early sign of a disease . You know how dangerous skin problems can be ! "

" Yeah , maybe it is time to see my doctor again and get some medicine or something . I have had this problem for about 2 months now . Maybe the cat has spread rabies or something . "

" No, not really . My skin is just sensitive to the sun . "

" Do you think that maybe you should get some antihistamine cream and apply it before you go outside again? You don't want to burn . "

" I'll be careful . It probably will help if I take a few aspirins or something . "

" A rash is never good . I think that you should see the doctor soon . Maybe you have an infection that needs antibiotics , or maybe it's skin cancer. I don't want to alarm you, but better be safe than sorry ! "

" Yes, I know. You always seem to be worried about me . "

" But you are my boyfriend , and I love you . I don't want anything to happen to you. Besides , your health is important . "

" You're right . I do have good health insurance from work . Let's go see the doctor tomorrow. He can give me some medicine for the rash, and maybe a blood test to find out what exactly is wrong with me ! "



" You are looking pretty pale yourself ! Are you feeling ok ? "

" I don't know . My stomach hurts a little and my head feels like it's going to explode , but that could be from the jet lag too. "

" I think we should both go in together . It seems like it would be better than taking separate cars . "

" Ok . We can talk to our doctor at home about you and I will talk with my boss about myself . "
