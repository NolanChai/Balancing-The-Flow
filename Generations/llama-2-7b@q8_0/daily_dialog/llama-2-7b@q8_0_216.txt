No , my head feels like it's going to explode . I think I better just take some aspirin and lie down for a bit .

 Sure ! Let me get you something to help ease the pain .  

You know what would help me right now ? If you got this done . 

 I don't understand . 

 Well , we have to go on vacation and my car is broken . So if you could just do that for me . It will mean a lot ! 

 Well , of course . How much does it cost ? 

 You want to borrow my car ? 

 Not for free . I need the money back but I can lend it to you since we are both in this together . 

 Sure thing , I'll get some cash and drive over right now ! 

I'm just kidding . What about a loan of $250 ? 

 No , I don't have that much money on me . But maybe if you can wait until tomorrow for your car to be fixed we could arrange something then . 

That sounds like a plan ! Thanks so much for helping me out ! Now get back to work and relax !

But it would be a waste for my boss to come all this way , only to see me ill in bed ! I can't afford that , so no . I have to make it through the meeting today. 

Ok .  If you say so .  Maybe we should get some coffee ? That will help you relax and feel better before your meeting.

I think it would be best if you went to the emergency room . They will give you something for your symptoms , but they can also test you to make sure that there aren't any other problems causing your discomfort . If there are none, then you should just get some rest and come back in a couple of days with your secretary . 

 I think it would be best if you went home now and got some sleep , because we could do everything you suggested if I don't feel any better by tomorrow .

It's a mosquito bite , you know - the kind you get when you travel around the world and stop by places like Africa or South America . 

 Oh ! How does it feel ? 

 Well , actually it feels pretty good now that I've got the antiseptic ointment on it . 

 You should go to your doctor and have him look at this bite - you might have a rash from the mosquito bites or another tropical disease ! 

 Oh no ! That would be awful ! Maybe I'll do that tomorrow , when I feel better . 

 Yeah , maybe so . In the meantime , you should go to your doctor and get some antibiotics for this cold that you have - it could develop into something more serious if you don't treat it now . 

 What ? A fever , a rash and a mosquito bite ? It can't be that bad ! 

 Oh yeah , I forgot to tell you about the stomach upset too.

Not as far as I know . But maybe I should stop eating peanuts and chocolate before my next meeting in San Francisco , just to be on the safe side . 

 You'd better go to a doctor and make sure it isn't something serious . 

 I will . But for now, let me have some more Tylenol ! I don't want you to worry about me too much .

It'll be ok , I can handle it . 

 You don't need to worry about me . We'll take care of it ! 

 What do you think that was ? 

 It was a big fish , probably a shark . 

 There were no sharks in the ocean where we went swimming today . Maybe it's an octopus . They usually don't attack unless they are defending themselves from something . 

 I was attacked by that thing ! I can't go back into that water again , so let's just get out of here and find another place to spend our vacation ! 

 The fish might have been trying to tell you something . Maybe it didn't like the way we were behaving toward its family members. 

 Maybe . But I don't want to be near those dangerous sea creatures ever again . We should stay on land for the rest of our vacation , and then return home . 

 Let me make us some coffee . What do you want with your breakfast this morning ? 

 Oh , how about bacon and eggs ? And let's have some toast too . I'll be right back . 

 You know, those are my favorite things in the world ! Bacon and eggs every day is always a great idea for breakfast . But you really shouldn't eat bacon and eggs so often , because it makes you fat . 

 What? Are you kidding me?! I love eating bacon and eggs ! And how do you know that eating bacon and eggs makes you fat? You haven't even tried them once, have you ? 

 Yes , but I don't like them , so why should I eat something that I hate just because you like it ? 

 Well . if you hate bacon and eggs, then maybe you shouldn't be eating them in the first place !

I don't know about that . I think I feel a little better already . Maybe I can wait for the doctor tomorrow morning . 

 You look very pale to me . Do you have any pain ? 

 Yes , my right hand has been bothering me lately , and now it hurts when I raise it up over my head . 

 It looks like a sore shoulder ! Do you think maybe it was caused by sleeping in an uncomfortable position ? 

 Yeah , I've had this problem for quite some time , but it seems to be worse since we moved into our new house last month . 

 That could explain the soreness and stiffness . Did you tell your doctor about this before ? 

 No , because I thought it was a temporary condition . But now that we're talking about it , maybe I should make an appointment with my physician to get his opinion on it .
