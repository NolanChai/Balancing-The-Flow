In order to build up the network system we need some information systems specialists who are well familiar with the new technologies . 

 How much would you think about this ? 

 ________ 

 I do not know if it is appropriate or not but I'd like to start working on the project of the network system at our company immediately.  

 The issue is a very important one and we need to pay attention to it as soon as possible.  

 What's your opinion about this ? 

 ________ 

 This is great idea . But I am not sure whether or not all the offices and show rooms will be able to use our system at once .  

 We have already equipped some of them but we still need time to equip other offices.  

 This means that your plan would take long years for its completion . 

 And also I don't know if it is appropriate or not but I think it will be more reasonable if you started working on the project with a small group of people who are familiar with the new technologies at first and then gradually extend their activity .  

 What do you think about this idea ? 

 ________

Of course , it's a good idea ! 

 Well , I think that's all. Bye! Have fun this weekend !  



### Dialogue 2 : 

### (1) Dialogue 2 : 

You and your father went to an international air show last Saturday . You are sharing the details of it with a friend who couldn't go along with you.

What did you like best at the show ?

I loved the parachuting display . 

Yes , they were terrific . I felt as if they would be falling right into our laps . 

 Yes , they were spectacular . We didn't miss anything . But there was so much noise that we could hardly hear ourselves speak. 


### (2) Dialogue 3 : 

### You went to your college reunion last weekend and had a great time with your friends . Now you are talking about the event with your friend who wasn't able to attend it because of her work commitments . What did you enjoy most at the party ?  

I enjoyed meeting my former teachers , I haven't seen them for 20 years ! And the catering was excellent. 

 Yes , we had a wonderful evening . There were lots of interesting people to talk to , and the food was great . 


### (3) Dialogue 4 : 
You are writing an email to your boss about what you did on vacation last weekend . You want to know how he felt about it.

What do you think of my idea ?

I like the idea a lot , but I'm not sure if our company can afford it . 

 Well , let me think about it and get back to you as soon as possible . I must discuss this issue with my boss and his colleague as well . We have a big project due by the end of the month . I don't want to be late for this one. 


### (4) Dialogue 5 : 
You are talking about your recent trip abroad with another person in your office . The person is interested in traveling overseas, but is worried that he won't enjoy it as much as you did because of his poor health . What do you think ? 

 I don't see why not ! You should go on a trip before you lose all of your health. Traveling abroad is good for your body and soul. 

 I couldn't agree more ! A person needs to travel as much as he can before his health problems prevent him from going anywhere . You never know when your health may fail you completely . So I think it's best for everyone to explore the world while they still can. 


### (5) Dialogue 6 : 
You are talking about a friend who had an accident with his car recently. He is now going to have surgery at the hospital and he asks you how you feel about this . What do you say ? 

 I'm not sure that I should go for it , but on the other hand, if you really want me to come along , then of course ! I can always cancel later. But I'm sure your surgery will be fine without my help . 

 Well, I have to admit that I don't think this is such a great idea . They could easily do it by themselves and it would take much less time than going on holiday together . And it seems like they are in a hurry , because their flight leaves tomorrow morning ! 


### (6) Dialogue 7 : 
You were in a coffee shop when you saw your former boss . He is now running his own business and asks how you feel about it . What do you say ? 

 I've heard lots of good things about him since he left , so if anything happens to me on the job again , I won't mind going back to work for him! 

 Well, he really is quite a great guy . He knows what he wants and he goes after it. And besides , his new business seems like a lot of fun too !
