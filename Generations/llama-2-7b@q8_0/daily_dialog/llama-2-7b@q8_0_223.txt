" I like Norton , because they have all kinds of good things in their software . But McAfee also has some very nice programs too and so does Symantec and TrendMicro . I guess it depends on what your needs are as t "

" What about anti-spyware ? Is there a good one that works well ? "

" There is a special page on Microsoft ' s site where you can get their free anti-virus program . Here ’ s how you find it . Go to www dot microsoft dot com and click on the search box in the upper right hand corner of the screen . Type in “ anti virus ” . Click on the link for Windows Live Onecare . "

" Mostly emails and surfing the net . I also make documents and spreadsheets . I sometimes play games , but mostly it ’ s just emails and surfing the net . "

" What type of games ? "

" I like to play puzzle games . They are a great way to pass time when you can t think of anything else to do . "

" Which ones would you recommend ? "

" It ’ s hard to say which ones are the best because different people have different tastes . But there are quite a lot of good puzzle games on the net . One that I like is called Tetris . It ’ s simple and easy , but it takes time to master . There are also a couple of games based on logic where you try to find solutions for problems . They can be hard because they require you to think outside the box . "

" So, what do you think ? Do you have any questions about anti-virus programs that I didn ’ t answer in the tutorial ? "

" No , I don ’ t . You made everything very clear and easy to understand . It was a pleasure talking with you ! "
