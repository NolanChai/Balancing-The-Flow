Every week or two . I don't always remember until it tells me that there is a problem . But I usually go back and make sure it gets done right away . I know that it is good protection but only if I keep it updated with the latest virus definitions. 

 When you install new software , do you first check to see what kind of access rights the program needs ? 

 Usually not , but if I'm installing a new program for the first time then yes . If it is a program that comes with my computer or one I got from someone else then no because I don't know enough about the program. 

 Do you allow other people to use your computer ? 

 Yes , but only family members and close friends who also take care of their own computers . My kids play games on it all day long and sometimes leave them open for days at a time so I have to keep an eye out for viruses. 

 How often do you clean dust from inside your computer ? 

 Every two or three months , but my dad is the one who does this because he knows more about what parts need attention . He keeps our computers running like new.

That's hard to say , but I have found that Norton is good at finding viruses and not slowing my computer down like some of them do. 

 Do your children use computers at home ? 

 Yes they do . All of the kids have their own computers . The younger ones also have an i-pods and a video game system. We try to make sure that we only let our kids watch appropriate programs on TV and movies too . 

 How much time does your child spend online ? 

 Not nearly as much as they used to , but it's hard with them all having their own computers now . I don't know how parents ever managed before the internet ! I think that my kids spend about half an hour a day on-line, watching TV, playing games and reading. We try and make sure we do things together as a family too so they don't get lost in technology all of the time . 

 Do you allow your child to chat with other people ? 

 Not anymore ! That was really dangerous , but I let them use it for a long while and now my kids have learned not to talk to anyone who doesn't know them personally . The last thing that we need is more kidnappings of our children by some stranger they met on-line. 

 Do you allow your child to download music ? 

 No . I don't like how they take advantage of artists who work so hard to create their songs and then have them ripped off and distributed illegally for free. And when the artist makes no money from that , it takes away the incentive for them to continue making music, which would hurt all of us ! I think that if you like an artist's song or album, then you should buy it and support them . 

 Do you allow your child to download movies ? 

 Not anymore either . My kids are getting older now and don't want to watch the same movie over and over again , so they have their own DVD collection . I think that people who pay a lot of money for movies shouldn't be able to just steal them from someone else. I am really proud of my children for realizing how wrong piracy is . 

 Do you allow your child to play video games ? 

 Yes , but there are some restrictions . My oldest son has a PS3 and sometimes the game can get pretty violent, so we only allow him to play it on his own when no one else is in the house. We try not to let our children see movies or television shows that show violence either . 

 How much time does your child spend playing video games ? 

 I don't know for sure , but not nearly as long as they used to . They all have their own i-pods too so sometimes they listen to music instead of playing games. And we try and make sure that our kids are doing other things like playing sports or going outside with friends when it is nice out. 

 Are your children in touch with their friends through social networking ? 

 Yes , but not all the time . We limit how much they can use technology as a family so that we have more quality time together . I think this will help my kids to be better at communicating and interacting with real people later on, rather than just being online all of the time.

Just go to Google and type in “free anti-virus” . There are several sites that offer free versions of anti-virus programs , so you can check them out and see which one is best for your needs . 

 That sounds like a good idea . Thank you very much !

I like to check my e-mail and surf the internet on a daily basis . I also listen to music , watch videos or play games when I ’ m bored . 

 Do you have any advice for me about computers ? 

 Well , I always read the warnings that appear in the software I download from the internet because sometimes there are viruses attached to them and you can get a virus even if it is free . Also don ’ t open up e-mails or click on links that you don ’ t know about or that seem suspicious . 

 Thank you very much for your advice .
