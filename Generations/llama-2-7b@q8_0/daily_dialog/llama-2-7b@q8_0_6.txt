Maybe we can play a few games ? 

 You bet ! It would be nice! Let me show you my chessboard.

 We are sitting down at the table . I'm in front of the chessboard . He is sitting opposite to me. 

 How shall we start ? Shall I move first? 

 No , please, move second . I want to be the black pieces . 

 You will have a black king too ... 

 That's OK. Do you know what position to begin with? 

 Yes , I'll open in a King's gambit !

 Well ... Let us begin ! 

 We are beginning to play chess . 

 Shall we play one game or several ? 

 Just two games. 

 OK . We shall play two games .

 I move first . 

 He moves the black King's pawn two squares forward (i.e., from h2 to f3) . 

 And now your turn? 

 Now it is my turn. My pawn can go on the square d4. The king can also move there. 

 Let me think ... I don't want to lose... 

 He thinks about his further move . We see him thinking and moving his head from left to right a few times . 

 And? What are you going to do ? 

 Now the black King's pawn can go one square forward. Let me think, which square I should choose ... 

 He is still thinking and moves his head from left to right again . 

 The white pieces can move on any of three squares: e4 or d5 or f5 . It isn't clear what the black player would like to do with his King's pawn. 

 I think I should attack your knight. My pawn can go one square forward, so it will end up at e3. And then my king could move to d4 and attack your knight. It looks as if you want to lose your bishop on g6 . 

 Now the black King's pawn can take two steps backward or to f4. 

 Let us try with one step back, so it will go to f4. 

 And now? 

 The white knight could move to either of three squares: e2, d3 or c3 . I would like my pawn on f5, where he could take your bishop... 

 It is a very interesting game , let's continue ... 

 He makes the next move. His King's pawn goes one step backward and ends up at f4. Now it is white turn . 

 And now? 

 The black knight can go to any of three squares: c5, b5 or e6 . I want my king on d4... 

 He makes the next move. His King's pawn moves two steps backward and ends up at g3 . Now it is white turn . 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us take a rest ! 

 The black knight can go to any of three squares: e6, d7 or c6 . I want my pawn on f5... 

 He moves his King's pawn two steps backward and ends up at h3 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us take a rest! 

 The white knight can go to any of three squares: e2, d4 or c5 . I want my pawn on f5... 

 He moves his King's pawn one step backward and ends up at g2 . Now it is black turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us take a rest! 

 The white bishop can go to any of three squares: c4, b4 or d6 . I want my King's pawn on f5... 

 He moves his King's pawn two steps forward and ends up at e4 . Now it is black turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us take a rest! 

 The white bishop can go to any of three squares: b5, d7 or g8 . I want my King's pawn on f5... 

 He moves his king from d4 to e5 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us take a rest! 

 The black bishop can go to any of three squares: g7, c6 or h8 . I want my King's pawn on f5... 

 He moves his king from d4 to e5. Now it is white turn again and the game continues in this way for some time.

 We are playing chess . 

 It is interesting , but sometimes you make mistakes . 

 What mistakes? I don't think so... 

 We have a position . Let me see how we got here from where we were before. 

 Yes, let's look at the game again ! 

 The black pieces have lost their bishop. 

 That's right , it is a bad move ... 

 Can you explain why? 

 You took my bishop with your knight... 

 You are right . Let us analyse this position. The black King's pawn goes to f4 and the white King's pawn takes his bishop on g6. Now it is black turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 I don't want to take my pawn from its square, but let us see what happens if we move our knight from e2 to f5 . 

 The white pieces can go on any of three squares: d5 or c4 or g6. But it is not clear whether the black King's pawn can take it with his bishop or not. If he takes my knight, I will have a double attack against your king! 

 That's true . Let us play on and see what happens. The black King's pawn can go to any of three squares: b5, c6 or h7. Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us analyse this position. You took my bishop with your knight... 

 It was a bad move. 

 And then you lost your Queen on g8 . 

 That's true, but I didn't see that the white King could go to f5 and take our pawn there. 

 It is interesting ... Let us analyse this position. The black pieces can move to any of three squares: a6 or d2 or b7 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us see what happens if I move my queen from g3 to c4 , so that your king will be in danger. 

 The black King's pawn can go to any of three squares: a6 or d2 or b7 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us analyse this position. You took my bishop with your knight... 

 It was a bad move. 

 And then you lost your Queen on g8 . 

 That's true, but I didn't see that the white King could go to f5 and take our pawn there. 

 We have a position ! Let me look at it! 

 The black pieces can move to any of three squares: c3 or d7 or b6 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 I will move my queen from e1 to f4 and attack your king... 

 He moves the black King's pawn one step forward (i.e., from g3 to h4) and ends up at e2 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 I will take my knight off its square! 

 He takes his queen with the black King's pawn and ends up at c5. Now it is black turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 Let us see what happens if I move my bishop from d4 to f3 ... 

 The black Bishop can go to any of three squares: h4 or g2 or f1 . Now it is white turn again and the game continues in this way for some time.

 We are playing chess . 

 It was interesting ... I think we will play another game later? 

 Yes, sure! But let us not forget to analyse what happened... 

 We should start at the beginning, where we were before we analysed this position. Let me see how we got here from where we were before. 

 Right , let us have a look ... 

 The black pieces can move to any of three squares: d3 or g6 or f2 . Now it is white turn again. 

 What shall we do now? 

 I will try and take your king with my bishop... 

 He moves his Bishop from d4 to c5 and takes the white King with the black King's pa

! 

 Thank you. Would you like to play? 

 No , let's watch them . There'll be more people coming in soon . 

 You're right . Let me make myself comfortable on the sofa . I think they've finished . 

 Oh no , look! They're playing again ! It's a draw. They're not happy at all! 

 Why don't you play with me? 

 No , thank you, I don't feel like it . 

 That man seems to be very angry . Let me go and talk to him . You look bored . Want a cigarette ? 

 Well ... I think we'd better not smoke in here. It smells bad when you exhale. 

 How do you know? 

 Oh, I just feel it! 

 The man who has just come over looks very pleased . He is talking to the girl he played with . 

 Are they married ? 

 Yes , of course they are ! Look at them ! They're holding hands and smiling at each other . 

 I think you like playing chess too, don't you? 

 Well, not really. My mother used to play with me when I was little . That's why I started learning how to play . 

 I see. 

 There , they're leaving together . 

 They look happy ! 

 You'd better take a table for two and let's have some coffee. 

 Sure. Let me make sure there isn't someone sitting here.

But you won the first prize . You can play much better than me . 

 You haven't seen how well I play yet . 

 I bet you can . Let's start playing ! 

 I want to show that I'm really good at chess . 

 It doesn't matter if you don't win , but let's see whether you are a better player than me . 

 Let's play!
