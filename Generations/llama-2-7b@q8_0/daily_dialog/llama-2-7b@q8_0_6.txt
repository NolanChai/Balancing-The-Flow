said the man. "I've only been learning for six months."

" Let's play some more . "

The man smiled and said, " We will , I hope ." Then they started to play again. The woman made a lot of mistakes, but she won in the end. She was very happy because it was her first game. When they finished playing chess, the man invited her for tea at his house. They had a lovely time together.

The next day , the man's wife asked him who he had played with . The man said that he had met an interesting woman while walking in the park and that she was coming to have tea. His wife smiled and told him not to be late for dinner.

" I often go to the Chess Club . "

" Why don't you come too ? "

" I like chess very much . "

" I know that , but we mustn't talk about it now. It's not polite."

" How do you play chess? "

" Well, the first thing to do is put the pieces on the board . Then each player puts down a piece and makes his move according to the position of that piece. Each player takes turns in putting down or moving one piece at a time until he wins."
