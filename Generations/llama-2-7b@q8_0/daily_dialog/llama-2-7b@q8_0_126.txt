" wow ! that's fantastic ! "

" I know , right ? But here's the catch : he wants me to go to London and work there for three months . "

" london ? why is that a problem ? "

" well , it's not really that great of an opportunity if you're stuck overseas . "

" I know what you mean . "

" and besides, I can barely afford to live here in the first place , let alone in England ! "

" hey , don't worry about it : we can find a way to make this happen for both of us ! "

" how ? "

" well , there's someone who was really great at finding work overseas that I used to work with . let me give him a call . "

" hey , don't worry about it : we can find a way to make this happen for both of us ! "

" how ? "

" well , there's someone who was really great at finding work overseas that I used to work with . let me give him a call . "

" wow ! "

" yeah , so it looks like I'm going to get paid for doing my passion , which is writing . And it might even turn into a permanent position ! I think this job will change my life . "

" that's wonderful news ! That's great ! "

" I can't wait until Monday morning when I start work ! "

" that sounds like a lot of work . But what about your current job as a proof-reader ? Is it something you can still do ? "

" yes , I suppose so . But it won't be easy to juggle the two jobs at first . "

" well , if you get tired of either job , let me know ! I would love to work with you again. "

"Hi , Jim . It's been a while since we last talked ."

" hi, Tom . "

" How have you been ? "

" I've been doing fine . And yourself ? "

" myself ? Well, let me see. Last time I saw you, I was just leaving my job as the assistant editor of a major magazine. And now ? Well , it's kind of complicated... "

" complicated how ? "

" well, I can tell that you are trying to keep up with me and figure out what is going on . That's nice . But I'd rather just get right to the point. See if you can guess my occupation now. "

" OK , but first I should warn you that there is a very limited amount of information available for you to work with ... "

" What do you mean ? "

" Let me put it this way : what you are about to hear is strictly confidential . And you will only learn about my occupation after you have made as many deductions as possible from the information given to you. "

" OK , I'll try ... but I don't promise anything, since I am really terrible at this sort of thing ! "

" Let me start by asking you what job you think I held before working with the magazine ? "

" well , my first guess would be that you were a lawyer . "

" And why do you think so ? "

" because you used to work at an editorial position and now you are looking for some other kind of job. "

" Actually, I was an assistant editor before working as a proof-reader , not the other way around ! But that's another story . Now let me ask you what you think my occupation is right now ? "

" well , it sounds like you are looking for a job again . So my guess would be that you are a lawyer. "

" Nope . Not quite ... but close enough to get the prize ! As a matter of fact, I am looking for another job now because I quit the law several months ago ! My occupation right now is... A PROOF-READER. "
