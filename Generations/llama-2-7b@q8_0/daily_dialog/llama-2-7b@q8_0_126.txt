yes .

well , after a month of working there and being their best employee they gave me an offer to work for them full time as a senior editor ! 

 I can't believe it either !!! 

really ?? that's fantastic news .!

 thank you so much ! how come ? what happened exactly ? 

 well , we had this meeting on Thursday , and they were looking at my work there ... 

 oh wow , I can't wait to hear about it . 

 tell me everything that went on. 

 ok then, so they looked at my work and decided that i was the best editor out of all the other editors and offered me a full time position !!!!!! 

 amazing !!

 yeah , I'm still in shock ... it happened so fast , but this is great news .! I can't believe it .

 now tell me about your job as an editor ? how was that working out for you ? and what are you planning to do next year ? 

 well , my boss is very nice, and he said i did a great job as proof-reader ... and even though he had to let two other employees go because of budget cuts .. he still kept me on board !!!! 

 that's good news ! 

 yeah , I was so happy when i found out about it . 

and what are you planning to do next year ? 

 oh, well ... i think i want to go back home and try a new job as an editor for another publication. 

 okay then , i'll let you get back to your work ! have a good day ! 

 see ya . bye !

who is he ? 

 his name is Mark Thompson . 

 oh ! That sounds like a great opportunity ! 

 yeah , it really does . 

 he thinks I'm qualified to do the job so they offered me the position and I took it ! 

 congratulations !! 

 thanks :)

wow , how exciting is that ! 

 yes, I agree . But wait a minute here . What about your job as a proof-reader ? You've had it for years now. Is there any way you can keep both jobs at once ? 

 well , she said that the position wouldn't be full time and I could only work one day a week so i don't think there will be a problem . 

 but it's not enough to live on, is it ? 

 no , I know . That's why I have an extra job as an English tutor in the evenings . It's not very well paid but it helps out a little . 

 oh yes , I forgot about that . 

 but that still means you'll be working at least five days a week and spending almost all of your time on writing, right ? How can you find the energy to do so much ? 

 well , you know me. I love literature ! 

 you do ? Yes , it shows . 

 oh yes , I forgot about that too . 

 well , good for you . That's great news .

you mean every other week ? 

 yes , but I still have to proofread and edit all the other content . 

 are you happy about this ? You've been wanting a job at The Economist for ages . 

 I am very excited , but also worried - I want to do well because they seem like nice people in the office ! 

 it sounds as though that could be a little bit nerve-racking ! Are you going to tell me about your new job ? 

 well , yes . The first article is due at the end of next week and I'm going to go to the library today to start researching my topic !

what about me ? Will the editor-in-chief give me a chance to write for the magazine ? 

 no , because I only have experience writing academic essays and not enough professional writing experience yet . 

 but you're still really good at it though . I think they will let you do some articles in between my columns .

that would be great . thanks very much ! 

I'm not sure how long it will take me to write an article , but I do want the column to reflect my views so I probably won't have anything ready by next week .

sure , that sounds great ! Can we go to that new French bistro around the corner from here ? They say they have an amazing wine list . 

 that sounds perfect . I'll call a cab and meet you there in about half-an hour . Have you ever tried French cuisine before ? 

 not really , but I've been dying to try it ! I hope it will be good !
