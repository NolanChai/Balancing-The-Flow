How long did you practice ? 

 It looks like it .

 I didn't expect the font to be so small though. 

 The printer used a high quality paper and an original ink for printing, so we had to use a magnifying glass to see the lettering. 

 Well, it was definitely worth the wait .

I want to send this as an e-mail message . 

 The subject line says "A Song for My Son" .

 [  ] The words are pretty simple . It's more about the calligraphy .

 It is really beautiful ! 

 [  ] Thank you , my dear son. I hope you enjoy it!

Sorry , it's a gift for my daughter . 

 Oh ! That's good , then I can keep the picture ! 

 But wait a minute , there is still one thing that I want to ask you . 

 Yes ? 

 Do you have any more samples of your art work ? 

 Sure , but unfortunately it will cost about 100 RMB ( $15 ) for each piece . 

 That's ok , just send them to me by express mail ! 

 No , I can't do that . I only make this kind of calligraphy one by one . 

 What ? You mean you won't even send it to me if I pay the money ?! 

 I'm sorry. I don't want to be rude . But you have to understand : this is my hobby and passion . I can not afford to do something I dislike just for the sake of making some money ! 

 But then , why did you learn calligraphy ? You don't seem so passionate about it now. 

 Because calligraphy is a beautiful art . And that's what I want to teach my daughter someday . 

 Ok . Then let me tell you something ! I used to be an English major in the university , and now I'm working for a big company here as an accountant. I just hope one day I can become a good writer. So if you ever need help with your English or anything else, please don't hesitate to ask me . 

 Thank you so much ! 

 What is your name again ? 

 It's Linda . 

 Oh ! Sorry , I forgot to give it back to you . You can keep the pen if you like. 

 That's all right, but what is your calligraphy ? 

 It's just my name . 

 But that's beautiful ! 

 Thank you . And may you enjoy good health and have a happy life .

You know , I was thinking maybe we could frame and display it here on the wall in your house . 

 Would that be okay ? 

 Sure ! Please help yourself ! 

 Thank you for such a beautiful gift. It's exactly like yours .

 Oh, no , don't mention it . I love to share my work with others ! 

 我等待了近一个小时才到了前排的位置。你有很多耐心，这张书法非常漂亮，值得等待。

Thank you ! Enjoy your Chinese New Year !
