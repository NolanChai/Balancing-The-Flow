" It says : 'My heart is like a bird ; butterfly in flight . My spirit is like an ocean ; deep and calm at night . "

" Wow ! That sounds wonderful . How did you learn to write such beautiful calligraphy ? "

" Well, I learned from a wonderful old man called Zhang Yu . He was my teacher for over twenty years . "

" No. I will write something else if you like . "

" What's your name ? "

" Oh, I'm sorry ! My name is Gao Jianhua and my father was an artist too . "

" How nice ! I am very honored to meet someone in our same line of work . Can I call you Gao Laoshi ( Master ) ? "

" That would be wonderful ! "

" Hey ! The little girl is missing again. I saw her go up the stairs before , but she isn't there any more . "

" Oh no ! Did anyone see where she went ? "

" She was sitting in front of Master Gao . Now it looks like they are talking to each other . "

# 21
" Hey ! I just saw them coming out. What do you think they were talking about ? "

" Maybe he asked her why she likes his work so much and she said she doesn't know how to read Chinese and that's why it looks so beautiful . She probably just told him what was written on the calligraphy . "

# 22
" I think Gao Laoshi is going to give her a lesson right now. I saw them walk out together . They are talking to each other like old friends . "

# 23
" Wow ! I can't believe she's learning calligraphy from Master Gao himself ! He has so many students. How did it happen ? "

# 24
" Maybe her father is a famous artist too and they are both artists. They probably know each other already . "

# 25
" She looks very young to be studying art . I guess that's why she came here alone . It would have been scary for me if someone else was with her when she went up the stairs all by herself and nobody knew where she was going . "

# 26
" Oh ! I heard a really sad story about Master Gao's father. He fell off of a cliff while he was painting. The poor guy was only in his twenties, but he was killed instantly. It happened in the early days when the Red Guards were attacking all kinds of people. "

# 27
" That is really sad. I hope that won't happen to Master Gao too . But at least his father left him something important before he died . His work will live on forever ! "

# 28
" Oh ! They are sitting together now ! They must be talking about Master Gao's art . Maybe she has just asked what it all means . "

# 29
" I guess she is going to ask him for some advice, like how to make something beautiful. "

# 30
" She looks very happy now ! It looks like they are having a good time . Maybe he gave her some tips on drawing. He is so famous , and has been an artist for a long time . She's very lucky to be able to learn from him directly . "

# 31
" I saw them walking by together just now, but it looks like they are both alone . "

# 32
" Maybe he is teaching her how to hold the brush. He'll tell her what brushes to use and show her which direction to move them in . Then she will know how to do calligraphy properly by herself ! "

# 33
" I wonder if she knows anything about art, or how it is supposed to look. Maybe Master Gao will teach her the right way to hold a brush and show her what he wrote on the wall . That might help her understand why his calligraphy looks so nice ! "

# 34
" I guess she didn't like his lesson, because they are walking away from each other now. It seems like she got bored or something . Maybe Master Gao is teaching too fast for a beginner and he should slow down to be easier on her . "

# 35
" She probably isn't used to writing Chinese yet, so he can't give her a lesson right now. That's why they aren't together any more. "

# 36
" I saw them walking together just now! It looks like they are talking about something else . Maybe they were laughing when she was practicing writing Chinese and it didn't go well, so he is cheering her up by telling her a joke or something . "

# 37
" Oh no ! They stopped to talk again. I hope nothing bad is happening between them! Maybe Master Gao isn't happy about what she did during their lesson and now they are fighting . "

# 38
" That's so sad ! She's just a little girl, but something must have made her do that! Maybe it was because he told her to write the word 'happiness' and then she didn't like what came out. The calligraphy isn't supposed to look exactly like the words . "

# 39
" I heard there are a lot of people waiting for him right now, so maybe they want to leave her alone with Master Gao because it looks like something serious is happening between them . Maybe he thinks she stole his pen and that's why he won't talk to her any more ! "

# 40
" I think it has something to do with the painting on the wall. It looks like they are arguing about the art. She probably didn't like Master Gao's style because it isn't traditional . That must be why he is yelling at her and making such a scene ! "

# 41
" I hope Master Gao doesn't do anything bad to her, or she might get in trouble for fighting back. If you don't listen to someone who is bigger than you , they can hurt you . But if you try to fight them and it gets out of hand , then the other person will be arrested. It won't help your case at all ! "

# 42
" That is a very sad story about Master Gao's father, but he will never have any problems like that because he has such good art talent . His paintings are famous and people love them . So nobody would hurt him in the first place. He doesn't need to worry about being attacked by the Red Guards ! "

" Yes . You should put it on your door or window to attract happiness . And be careful not to lose it . Goodbye ! "

I. The Chinese Character

What does "character" mean in China? It doesn't mean just one person, as it might seem to the Western mind; instead it refers to the combination of all the forces and ideas that constitute a nation.

In the past there were no written characters and every nation had its own language system —the Mayas used pictures to communicate, for instance—but China was unique in developing a phonetic script that could be used by all her people. A Chinese character is a picture made up of strokes to indicate sounds. As time went on, the strokes became more and more curved and ornamental until now they are almost like calligraphy paintings themselves.

Chinese characters are divided into two groups: radicals and phonetic symbols. Radicals consist of basic shapes that can be combined with others to make different pictures or sounds, just as the letters _a_ , _b_ , and _c_ can be arranged in many different ways to form words like _apple_ and _abracadabra_. The radicals are themselves composed of simple strokes which have been made into pictographs.

The phonetic symbols, or sounds, are the more complex part of a character. There are sixteen different kinds; five are vowels — _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , and _u_ , the others are consonants — _p_ , _k_ , _t_ , _n_ , etc., which sound like the letters in our alphabet, but without the aspiration of the vowels. The vowel sounds may be represented by either one stroke or two strokes and the consonant sounds by one, three or four strokes depending upon how they are written. For example:

The radical for _tree_ ,   ( _shan_ ), is made up of three strokes; but when used as a phonetic symbol, it takes the form  . The symbol for _sun_ has only two strokes to indicate its sound, but when it is used as a radical it becomes  .

Since Chinese characters are read from left to right and top to bottom (from the point of view of the writer), the same character may appear different in the various parts. This is especially true for the phonetic symbols which have four possible ways of being written; two are more frequently used than the others, however, depending upon what sounds the characters have with other ones and how they are arranged when put together to make a word or phrase.

The Chinese character is so complex that even people who speak the same language may not be able to understand each other's writing unless they are using words which have become familiar to both of them, as we would say in America, "they use the same English." Even with those who write and read the same characters there will sometimes be differences because of their individual ways of writing; it is like two people speaking the same language but using different dialects.

II. The Artist

The Chinese character is a work of art. In China, calligraphy is an important part of education which children begin to learn early in life. Some calligraphers spend their lives perfecting and refining what they know and developing new ways of writing characters; the result can be as beautiful as any painting or sculpture.

To write a Chinese character, you first draw a vertical line with one stroke (called _yong_ ). This is called the "ruling pen" because it gives form to the horizontal lines that follow afterward. After drawing the ruling pen you make five horizontal strokes which are called the "radical strokes." Then you add two more horizontal strokes and finally a short vertical line at the top. The Chinese call this last stroke _xing_ , or spirit, because it is like a flame in its upward movement.

The Chinese character is written with either brush or pen and the artist can use either black or red ink to color his writing. If you go into an art store and look at their supplies for calligraphy, you will see that the inks are colored in a variety of different colors —blue, purple, green, etc.—and the paper is made from various materials too; rice paper, silk, bamboo, cotton, wood, metal, and even gold leaf. The coloring may be applied before or after the character is written on the paper but it should be applied with a brush rather than a pen because this gives you more control over what you are doing.

The tools used to write Chinese characters consist of: one ink stick; two ink sticks held together; five brushes and an ink stone. The ink stone is made from either quartz, agate or jade depending upon the coloring required. To make the ink, you put a little water on your paper with which to clean off the dust before you begin writing. Then you take your ink stick (or sticks) and rub it against the stone until it is moistened. You then use a brush to draw on top of this.

In the past there was no such thing as modern calligraphy paper, so artists made their own by adding water to rice, wheat or other flour and letting this harden before drawing on it with ink. Today the paper is available at most art stores but I prefer to use natural materials when possible because they make a better surface for writing than anything man can produce.

The ink is also made from different substances depending upon what you want your coloring to be —black, red or other colors—and this is why there are so many kinds of Chinese calligraphy paper available now. You might think that one kind would be better than another but I have found that using natural materials for both ink and paper gives me more control over what I am writing because the brush always seems to respond differently depending upon the type of surface on which it is being written.

The Chinese character is a work of art. It is like painting with words because you start by drawing one line after another until you have made an entire picture with its own special meaning that can only be understood if you are familiar with both the writing and the culture from which it comes. Calligraphy is a language which combines words, pictures and thoughts into something which has its own beauty no matter how simple or elaborate it may appear to others who do not understand what they see.

III. The Artist

"I would like to write a story for you . "

" Really ? That's very nice of you . "

" Yes . My name is Li Cheng-hua and I'm from Beijing in China . I came here two months ago with some friends who are also calligraphers. We live near each other but we don't know any English so we wanted to come over to your country for a while before returning home again. It was very difficult at first because none of us spoke any English except what we had learned in school, which wasn't much really . But now we have been here long enough that most people can understand some Chinese and we feel more comfortable with the language than when we first arrived."

" That is wonderful ! I have always wanted to know more about China. My mother was born there but she died when I was only two years old so I never had a chance to meet her . "

" Oh , I'm sorry about that . But maybe you will have another opportunity someday ? "

" Yes, perhaps I will . Tell me more about yourself. What do you like best about America ? "

" Well , the people are very friendly and there is no problem getting along with them because almost everyone speaks English so we don't feel as if we have to hide our feelings or worries when we meet someone new. The food here is also better than what I am used to back home; it tastes more like real vegetables instead of just being a mixture of dried beans and grains like they do in China where most people are poor enough that they can't afford fresh food every day."

" I think that's wonderful ! Where do you live ? "

" Oh , we've got an apartment not far from here . It's pretty small but at least it's close to the university where my friends are studying for their degrees so we can visit them there too."

" What do they study ? "

" Mostly English literature and history, as well as Chinese culture. They have some books about calligraphy in their library which is really helpful because I don't know any better than what I learned at home."

" That must be hard . Where did you learn to write Chinese characters ? "

" From my parents and grandparents, of course ! It seems strange to think that people here don't even know how to read the words they use every day; they just say them out loud without understanding what they mean or where they came from."
