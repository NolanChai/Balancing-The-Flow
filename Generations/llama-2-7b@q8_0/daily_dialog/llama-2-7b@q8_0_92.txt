He likes his employees to be at their desks by nine sharp . 

 You should probably give him a call and apologize for being late today . 

 I would like you to come over on Tuesday after work . 

 He has been very good about training me so far , but sometimes he's really hard on me. 

 You should really speak with the owner about the situation before you leave this afternoon.
