We have , however , to consider the amount of money that we are asking for . It's rather large and would require us to invest in the business as well. 

 Oh ! I see what you mean . Well, there is not much of a choice here . There just aren't any other options available at this point in time . We can't wait till we get more funding , either from loans or public offers . Our clients are still on hold and the longer they stay that way , the higher our losses will become. 

 That said, I still think we have to consider these factors before we make any final decision.
