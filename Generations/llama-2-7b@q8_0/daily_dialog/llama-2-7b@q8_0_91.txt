Well , yes , it does run around one hundred and five to one hundred and ten depending on where you buy it . But if you have Maxine's Card , you can get twenty percent off ! So it will only cost about seventy-three or seventy-four dollars 

 Ok, now I get it.  

 I'm glad that it looks good on me 

 Of course it does ! It is an Ava Minton , and you know that she always makes women look beautiful . Do you want to try anything else on ? 

 I don't think so. 

 Then we can go home now , unless you are hungry , because if you are , the place next door has great food ! They serve the best pizza in town! 

 Yeah , let's do that . 

 You are a wonderful friend . I am lucky to have you .

Well , if it makes you feel any better, that was actually the best price I have seen that dress sold for so far . It usually goes for $150 and up at other places around town. 

 Oh ? 

 Yeah . I think that's why Maxine is trying to sell it . She just bought a new line of clothes from Paris , and the designer she picked was really expensive . She thinks that people will still want to buy the dress even if it has been on sale for two weeks already. But in reality, the price would probably turn off a lot of customers. 

 I see what you mean . It might be too much money for some people , especially at this time of year . Do you think Maxine's is going to discount that dress anytime soon ?  

 Oh no ! She will never discount that kind of thing . Maybe it would be worth picking up a few things there, but the prices are always too high for my taste. 

 Okay , well thanks for telling me about Maxine's . I think I'll go in and check out their latest stuff .
