" Oh . I see . "

I knew she was trying to tell me that it was a ripoff , but how could I disagree with her ? She had gotten it for 40% less than the original price! In fact, I had been telling myself over and over again while shopping: Don't go over fifty dollars. So if I paid more than what she did, then she was right and I was wrong .

" You know , "she said, "I heard a rumor that this store will be closing down next week . It might still be worth looking for something to wear there before they close the doors . "

I thanked her for telling me and promised to check it out. The rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about how much money she had saved herself by buying a dress at Helen's Boutique instead of Maxine's. She probably spent less than three dollars on a pair of shoes! And they were even better than my shoes!

"Hey, Jenna ! " I called out when I got home .

Jenna was doing her math homework and she looked up with a smile.

"Did you have fun today ? "she asked.

I nodded in agreement.

"What's your favorite part about going shopping ? "

Her eyes lit up as she started to think of the answer. I could tell that this was something that she enjoyed doing. But what did I enjoy?

" What's yours ? "she asked again .

I thought about it for a moment and then said, "I don't really know."

Jenna smiled at me and then started to say something else when suddenly the phone rang . She got up and answered it while I stayed on my bed. When she was done talking , she said that her friend from school would be picking her up in a few minutes, and that we should have dinner at our place tonight.

"Okay,"I agreed. "Can I go with you?"

"Sure . Do you want to come over for dinner first ? "

"Yes , if it's okay."

She looked relieved and smiled as she put on her shoes, grabbed her jacket from the closet, and then ran downstairs to get ready.

I felt like I was walking on air when I walked into our apartment . The sun shone through my window and made it look so pretty outside that it seemed like a dream coming true! My mum had just finished cooking dinner when I opened the door, so I gave her a hug before saying hello to everyone else.

"Hey, Mom ! "I called out with excitement . She came over and gave me a big kiss on my cheek , while Dad smiled at us both from across the room . He was sitting there with his newspaper in one hand , drinking coffee with the other , looking like he had just woken up after being asleep for days .

"Hi, honey ! "she said warmly . "I'm glad you're here."

"I can feel it too,"I laughed softly . I knew exactly where she was coming from because even though Dad wasn't home when we left this morning , he had been so busy with work that I felt like he hadn't seen me in weeks ! He'd even asked me to pick up some takeout on my way over here!

"So how was your day ? "Mum asked .

I told her about going shopping, but she didn't seem too interested in the details. Instead, she just wanted to know if there was anything new happening with Jenna's school or her friends? Was everything okay at work for Dad? Did I have any fun plans for later on this weekend ?

"I guess that's all right then,"she said finally . "You know what else would make me happy ? If you would eat something other than ice cream before bedtime ! You need more protein in your body , Jenna."

"Mom, I really don't care about eating right now . It's not like it matters what happens next week or anything. "I shook my head with a smile and she laughed back at me .

After dinner we sat around the table talking about our plans for the upcoming weekend . I told them all that I wanted to spend time with Jenna , but also said that maybe we should go out some night as well ? They both agreed with this idea, but before leaving they reminded us again about how important it was to be more active when we were outside of school.

I promised not only myself but also my parents that I would make an effort to stay away from the computer and phone more often , so that I could spend time doing things I loved with people who mattered most .
