No , it’s just something I wanted to try this year since it ’ s been so dry . 

 Have you ever tried fly fishing ? 

 Sure , that’s what I plan on doing when I get there .

Oh wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun. 

 Do you have any plans for the weekend, Tom? 

 Yeah. I'm going hiking in the southern Rocky Mountains. 

 Oh! Do you go hiking often? 

 No, it's just something I wanted to try this year since it has been so dry. 

 Have you ever tried fly fishing? 

 Sure. That's what I plan on doing when I get there. 

 Oh wow! That sounds like a lot of fun.

Well, sure. I was just planning to do it on Saturday , but I can meet you early Saturday morning and go later on Sunday afternoon if that works better for you . 

 Cool . We should definitely plan another hike after this weekend too . See you on Saturday at 9 AM .

Wow ! Did the bear attack or anything ? 

 No , it didn ’ t . They were both really cool . But there was this guy who hiked up to the top of a cliff that had these two bears just kinda chillin’ on either side and he walked right between them and started taking pictures ! It was awesome ! 

 That sounds crazy . I bet you have some pretty good pictures . Where are they ? 

 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot to bring my camera . 

 No problem . But where are you going for the weekend? 

 Well, I'm going to stay in the city with friends. I think it's kind of a tradition by now!

Yeah, I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature. It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?

Sure. But, it will be a long hike. Thirty miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?

Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike. 

Wow! Did the bear attack or anything?

No, it didn't. They were both really cool. But there was this guy who hiked up to the top of a cliff that had these two bears just kinda chillin’ on either side and he walked right between them and started taking pictures! It was awesome! 

That sounds crazy. I bet you have some pretty good pictures. Where are they?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to bring my camera. 

No problem. But where are you going for the weekend?

Did you get any pictures ? 

 No , but we got some great stories . 

 It ’ s amazing how close humans can get to animals when they are away from cities. Have you ever been near bears or mountain lions?  

 Yes , I 've seen both . There was once a bear that followed me and my friends for over a mile . Then , just as he got close enough to touch us, we ran into the forest . 

 Really ? Did you have any weapons ? 

 Well , my friend had a can of spray paint that he was planning on using to draw on a rock or something , but it was very hard to use the can when you're running through the forest . 

 The bear caught up with us after about ten minutes . 

 I guess he was hungry ! 

 Yeah , he must have been because we had a full box of sandwiches with us and no one wanted them any more . 

 Did you get attacked or anything ? 

 No , he just walked by us really quickly and went back into the forest . He looked very angry though . 

 What about mountain lions? 

 I saw a mother and her cubs in the mountains once . We were up on top of this big rock when they came along. I didn’t know that they could climb so well until we saw them. 

 They kept coming closer to us , but then all of a sudden they ran away ! 

 Why did they run away? 

 They probably smelled us or something . They were pretty close though ! 

 I think mountain lions are the most dangerous animals in North America . They can attack people if they feel threatened. Are you going on any other hikes this weekend ?  

 No , just that one with Tom . It will be good to get out of town for a while .
