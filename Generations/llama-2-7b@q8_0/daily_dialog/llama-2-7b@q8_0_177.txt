You haven ’ T ?! Are you sure you 've read the document ?

 Well , what about the times we worked together on our project last semester? Or how about when we were on the basketball team freshman year ?!

 Yes . I was in a terrible mood then too . But still . 

 And what about that time you made me spend five hours at your grandparents ’ house on Christmas Eve?

 Well , Sally . You really had no idea who my Grandmother was back then . And she never let us leave until we sang carols to her and ate all of the food in her kitchen . 

 I ’ ve worked just as much on this project as you have ! And that is a fact.

 That is not what I said!

 Well , Sally . 

 Why are you getting so mad ? You don ’ T even know me anymore and yet you have the audacity to be angry with me?!

 All right . Enough already . Let ’ s just stop talking about this project !

 Okay . I guess. 

 We can talk about it later , if we want, but now let 's focus on something else .

 You know what ? Forget it !
