Four people . 

 That sounds very nice . We have one table that will be perfect for your group . It can seat up to six people . Will all four of the guests be dining with us ? 

 No , only three . Do you still have it available ? 

 Of course , we do . How many weeks from now would you like to make a reservation for ? 

 May I help you again ?

 Yes ! How long has your restaurant been in business ? 

 We've been open since early December of last year . 

 Do you have any live entertainment at the restaurant ? 

 We do not . Are you sure that you're still interested in reserving a table for dinner with us ? 

 I am , thank you ! 

 Very good . We will make it so. Now , let me ask you this question one more time : Is there anything else I can help you with today ? 

 No thanks ! I think that's all . Thank you again for your assistance .

No thank you . 

 Are there any other special requests ? 

 The food is always wonderful here and the service is good. 

 Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy your stay with us .

Certainly . My name is Tom Smith . 

 And what's yours , Madam ?

My name's Elizabeth Jones and these are my friends. 

 I see . Would you like a table in the main dining room or out on the terrace? 

 Out on the terrace would be nice because it looks over the lake.

All right then , we have two tables available outside . Is that all right with you ? 

Perfect! Thank you so much for reserving them for us, I'll see you in a few hours.

 Bye .
