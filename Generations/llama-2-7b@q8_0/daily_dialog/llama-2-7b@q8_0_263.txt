I don’t think you understand what I mean , there is no other place for me to go . 

 I ‘ m sure my landlord won ’ t be thrilled about this situation either , he ’ ll have to find someone to replace me .

 I ’ ve been looking at apartments all weekend and found one that I think you will like . 

 If there is anything else you need from me , let me know . 

 Bye for now .

I was thinking of taking my dog . 

 I think he needs a new home . 

 I can ’ t take him with me .

  I have to move on . 

 I’m not going back there . 

 This is ridiculous . 

 You should be able to do anything you want . 

 I don ’ t understand why you won ’ t let me stay here . 

 I can ’ t believe this . 

 I have to go . 

I’m going now.

I can get someone else 

 There ’ ll still be a gap between them 

 It is not enough time to find another one . 

 There are no places available right now 

 How do you expect me to get my deposit back from that ?

 You don ’ t have to move out just yet 

 I can hold it until the next month 

 That ’ s a week . 

 I am not going to have any problem with that . 

 Yes , there is something wrong here. 

 I would be happy if you stayed in your place longer . 

 But you know what ? It won ’ t work this time . 

 You are welcome to stay for a few more days but then we need to have someone in the apartment again . 

 If I want to get my deposit back from that 

 I will have to find another place and move out as fast as possible .

What am I supposed to do with all this stuff now ? 

 There’s nothing that we can do about it . 

 All of the rent has already been paid and if you don ’ t return my property in good condition … 

 But my property is fine 

 Well , what did you break ? 

 I didn ’ t break anything . 

 You are going to have to pay for it . 

 What do you mean by that ? 

 I ’ m going to put a hold on your security deposit . 

 So we will just take out all of the money . 

 It’s my money and I don ’ t want to give it to you. 

 You have no right to do this ! 

 Well , what are you going to do about it ? 

 I can sue you . 

 I could try . 

 Let me get this straight . 

 You’re refusing to pay for the damages that were caused by you and you expect me to give you your security deposit back ? 

 Well , I didn ’ t damage anything . 

 But you did ! 

 No , I didn ’ t 

 Yes , you did ! 

 You want to argue about it ? 

 Why should we get into an argument now ? 

 Because I think that what you are doing is unfair and unreasonable . 

 Well , maybe so but we can work this out. 

 All right . 

 If you don ’ t want to pay for the damages then you will have to leave your security deposit here with me because you don’t know what else you’re going to get hit with next time you go home . 

 Well , it wasn ’ t my fault … 

 Yes ! It was ! 

 Oh ! Yeah ? What do you mean that it was my fault ? 

 I said that you should not have had those parties here. 

 Why not? 

 Because they were loud and disruptive . 

 So what are you going to do about it now ? 

 Well , I’m going to report this incident to the police . 

 Are you serious ? 

 Yes ! 

 But that ’ s just crazy . 

 What about the parties we had here? 

 Yeah , but they weren ’ t loud and disruptive like yours was. 

 Well , I don ’ t care what the police say because I’m still going to leave my deposit with you because it’s mine . 

 You have no right ! 

 Oh yes ! I do ! 

 But you ’ re not getting out of this apartment without paying for all of your damages or I am calling the police. 

 Okay ! 

 Now , where is my deposit ? 

 I ’ m going to hold onto it . 

 You have no right … 

 What do you mean that I don’t have a right to this money? 

 Yes , I do ! It was all mine in the first place and now you won ’ t give it back to me because you think that I did something wrong ? 

 Well , I don ’ t care what you say . 

 That ’ s not true! You broke my property … 

 I didn ’ t break anything ! 

 Yes , you did ! 

 Okay ! Then go ahead and call the police because I am calling them too . 

 Oh ! Really ? 

 Yeah ! So we will have to see who gets there first . 

 What do you mean by that ? 

 If you are not going to give me back my security deposit then I ’ m going to sue you for the return of it. 

 Well , if you think that you can just get away with something like this … 

 But I didn ’ t . 

 Yes ! You did and now you have to pay for it . 

 Okay ! So who is first ? 

 If you want to see how serious I am about getting my deposit back then the police will be here in less than ten minutes. 

 Oh ! Well … 

 No , you can ’ t make me give up this money ! It’s mine . 

 Then we are going to have to settle it in court because you don ’ t care what I say and I don ’ t care what you say … 

 What do you mean by that? 

 Well , if the police aren’t here then I will go into court tomorrow morning. 

 Oh ! Great ! Then let ’ s get it over with so that we can all move on in our lives . 

 Okay ! I don ’ t want to do this but if you insist … 

 Yes , I do insist and that is because I think that you should have known better. 

 Oh ! Yeah ? Well , what are you going to do about it ? 

 If you can get out of here then go ahead and take your stuff . 

 But I don ’ t want to leave without paying for the damages … 

 No , but you won’t be able to stay here any longer so you might as well just leave now. 

 Well , what if the police are not here when I get there? 

 Then we can work something out afterward . 

 Yeah ! Let ’ s do that … 

 Okay ! 

 Thanks for being reasonable about this . 

 Oh ! You ’ re welcome and you ’ ll have to pay me back the amount that I am holding of your security deposit. 

 What are you talking about? 

 Well , I can’t just let go of someone else ’ s money … 

 Okay ! Then we will both have to wait until the police get here and then if they don’t show up within thirty minutes then you have to leave because that is when your lease ends anyway. 

 Oh ! Yeah ? What about my stuff? 

 I can keep it . 

 No ! You can ’ t … 

 Why not? 

 Because you are holding onto something that doesn’t belong to you and I will be taking it out of here with me when I leave. 

 But it was all mine in the first place ! 

 Yeah , well now it isn’t because you have to pay for what you did … 

 What do you mean by that? 

 We can ’ t talk anymore right now . 

 Okay ! Then we will finish this later. 

 Thanks again and see you around . 

 I don ’ t know if I want to be around you any longer . 

 Okay … 

 Goodbye.

It’s going to be a financial burden on me if you keep my money . 

 What do you mean ? 

 I don ’ t understand why you are so difficult about this . 

 I ’ ve told you everything that needs to be said about it . 

 You want the deposit back because I’m moving out before my lease is over ? 

 Right . 

 But I’ve already spoken with the other people who rent here . 

 They aren’t having any problem staying and they can pay me back the full amount of their deposit . 

 I’ll give you a letter stating that . 

 You said you weren ’ t going to get your deposit back , did you not ? 

 Yes . 

 I guess it will be up to you to make sure that I don ’ t keep your money . 

 The only problem is that the people who rent here are paying me more than you . 

 We ’ ll see about that . 

 But they will still have to pay their deposit back too ? 

 Well , that’s a little different because I ’ ve already been paid in full . 

 You aren ’ t going to try and charge them an extra fee for not staying longer than they should , are you ? 

 That would be stealing . 

 I was just wondering if you were planning on taking advantage of their situation by trying to get a little more money out of them . 

 What makes you think that I ’ m doing this for any other reason except the fact that you’re moving out ? 

 Because they are renting here . 

 I understand , but if they had paid in full and were staying longer than they signed a lease agreement for then it would be their problem . 

 What do you mean ? 

 When I get into my car and drive off and they can ’ t find me to pay me back because of some stupid law that they made up , don ’ t blame me . 

 There are thousands of people who rent here all around the country and I know that most of them will be happy to help you out with your deposit problem . 

 But it doesn’t matter how many other people rent there because if I was able to get into my car and drive off then they could just as easily do the same thing . 

 Maybe we should start with one person that I know ? 

 We can always look for more later . 

 All right , but you need to be careful about what type of people you pick . 

 What do you mean by careful ? 

 Don ’ t go picking some criminal who is going to take your money and run away with it . 

 I know that we both agree on this point , but the thing is that these other tenants are actually paying their rent in full every month so they ’ re not criminals or anything like that . 

 So we can have them sign a lease agreement and then give you the deposit back ? 

 That would be great ! 

 If we need to , I could even make a copy of your lease contract for them so that there will be no confusion about what they owe me . 

 They should only have to sign it once because if someone wants to stay longer than their lease agreement is then the landlord would just tell him or her that they need to pay another month ’ s rent in order for them to remain here , right ? 

 Right . 

 We could even set a date and time so that I know when everyone has signed on for their next rental period . 

 That way if there are any problems with anyone then we can fix it before it becomes a problem for you . 

 But what about the people who aren ’ t able to pay back their deposit ? 

 We would have to work that out between them and me because I don ’ t want you to be responsible for anything like that either . 

 It wouldn ’ t be fair if someone wasn ’ t able to make a payment , right ? 

 Right ! 

 And also how much are they paying per month in rent ? 

 The amount is based on what your lease agreement says . 

 So if someone doesn ’ t want to sign another rental period then I guess that means that we have a problem because they aren ’ t able to afford it anymore , right ? 

 Yes . 

 That wouldn ’ t be fair either ! 

 Well , if you are worried about the rent being too high or something like that then maybe you can talk with them and see what options there are . 

 What do you mean by options ? 

 Like if they wanted to move into a smaller apartment then I would be willing to reduce their monthly payment in order for them to stay here longer , right ? 

 Yes ! 

 That ’ s exactly what we need to do . 

 It will be up to you to figure out the best way for everyone involved . 

 We should also try and get all of our questions answered as soon as possible so that there are no misunderstandings later on down the road . 

 And I would like to know how much money they are willing to pay for their rent each month too ? 

 That ’ s another great idea because if you were able to find some people who could help out with the rent then it would really help me out ! 

 All right , we can do that . 

 But I have no control over how much they are willing to pay for their monthly rent each month either . 

 We ’ ll just need to wait and see what happens when everything is all said and done . 

 So , who was the first person you spoke with ? 

 The first one was a man named Paul Smith . 

 He sounded like he was interested in helping me out so we talked for about twenty minutes or so before I hung up with him . 

 He said that he would give me his information so that I could contact him if there were any questions later on down the road . 

 Great ! 

 Now how many other people have you spoken with ? 

 I spoke with a woman named Marcy Jones but she didn ’ t seem interested in helping out at all . 

 So far , Paul Smith is the only one who seems willing to help me . 

 You should really call back and try speaking with him again because it may turn out that he was just busy at work when you called earlier today . 

 I will do that ! 

 Okay , thank you for all of your help ! 

 Now we just need to wait and see what happens . 

 We can talk again later if there are any problems or questions about anything else . 

 Sure , whatever you say ! 

 All right then . 

 I guess that ’ s it !
