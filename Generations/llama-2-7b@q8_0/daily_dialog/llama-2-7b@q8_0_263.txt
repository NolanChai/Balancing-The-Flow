" How

" I am afraid that there is nothing that we can do. "

" Well , you were supposed to take care of this place ! "

" That does not make us responsible for everything . "

" But , why isn ’ t the landlord responsible ? "

" No one told me I had to pay rent for a room that is not even there . "

" We never said anything about having you move out now . "

" This place isn ’ t very safe anyway. "

" This building has been condemned. "

" I don ’ t understand what the problem is . "

" All right , here is your deposit back . "

" How can I do that if you ’ re moving out ? "

" The rent is not refundable "

" I don ’ t understand why the rent is not refundable. "

" Because you ’ re breaking your lease agreement. "

" I didn ’ t even break my lease agreement . "

" You signed a lease with us for six months and you only lived there for two . "

" But I haven ’ t broken the lease ! "

" How can I get my deposit back if you won ’ t give it to me ? "

" Because you are leaving before your lease is over. "

" You have to give it back to me because we signed a contract . "

" There was no written contract . "

" If there wasn ’ t one, then how do I prove that my deposit should be returned ? "

" That ’ s why you need a written lease. "

" But you didn ’ t give me a copy ! "

" If we don ’ t have an agreement in writing , then who gets to decide what is fair or not ? "

" I can ’ t answer that question because you are breaking your lease agreement . "

" You aren ’ t answering my question . "

" Well, if you don ’ t agree on something and there isn ’ t anything in writing , then the laws of the land decide for you. "

" That ’ s not fair ! "

" The law doesn ’ t care what is fair or not . "

" I think that you are lying to me because there is no way that we would have a problem if I had done something wrong and I thought it was only right that I give the deposit back to you. "

" Why do you think this ? "

" Because you want your money . "

" That ’ s not true ! "

" I don ’ t know what else could be going on here . "

" Do you really believe that there is some sort of conspiracy to keep my deposit from me ? "

" No . But it doesn ’ t seem like you care much about why you didn ’ t get your deposit back or what has happened during the last 10 years. "

" If I could give you a million dollars, would you be willing to help me keep my deposit and avoid further legal action ? "

" You have already asked for this before . "

" How much money do you want ? "

" At least $500,000. "

" I don ’ t have that much money . "

" Okay then, how about a new car ? "

" I would never sell my car to you. "

" You must be a really good lawyer if you can do something like that . "

" We all think that we are the best at what we do . "

" Do you want me to tell you what happened or don ’ t you care ? "

" I want to know everything. "

" You were in my apartment and didn ’ t take anything. "

" What about your dog ? He was really nice . "

" Well, he had to go outside because it got cold. "

" But you left him outside all night when I was sleeping ! "

" That wasn ’ t very nice of me. "

" You were gone for 8 hours and he was stuck in the cold . "

" Why don ’ t you ask your landlord about that ? He has the record on how much money is owed to him for rent from when you lived there. "

" I was going to talk with my lawyer before talking with yours because we both think that this conversation could go in a direction that neither of us want. "

" Maybe we can work things out . "

" We won ’ t be able to work anything out unless one or both of us agrees to give up our positions and start fresh. "

" I don ’ t know how much you would like me to tell you about your former roommate, but he was a bad person and I will not say any more than that. "

" You were his girlfriend for almost 2 years ! "

" He asked me not to say anything so I won ’ t. "

" Okay then . Let me tell you what happened at my apartment last night when you came to pick up your stuff. "

" So, now that we are finished with this conversation , do you want to work something out ? "

" You could still help us by telling me how much money is owed from the time I lived there until today and then you will get half of it . "

" Do you know where my landlord lives ? "

" He has an office downtown. "

" If you would give me his name, address and phone number , maybe he could help us find a solution to this problem so we can all move on. "

" You need to work out the problems with your landlord because I am not getting involved in this anymore . "

" I don ’ t want to talk about it any more either. Let ’ s just say that you were lucky enough to have someone as nice as me helping you get a new car, new clothes and food for 10 years and then leave me alone so we can both move on with our lives . "

" If I didn ’ t care about getting my deposit back , then maybe you wouldn ’ t be able to drive your car or eat any more food. "

" You are right, that is exactly how this situation works. It ’ s a very bad deal for both of us but there isn ’ t anything we can do except hope that it will work itself out in the end . "

" You’re not giving us any time "

" There isn ’ t a lot of time left on your lease . "

" Why aren ’ t you helping me ? "

" We can ’ t help you with that right now . "

" But I need to find somewhere else to live . "

" You have plenty of time "

" If I don ’ t pay rent now I am going to be out on the street ! "

" You’re not being evicted if you leave before your lease is up . "

" How long do I have to stay ? "

" Your lease says 6 months . "

" I ’ ll give it back when I move out . "

" I want it back right now ! "
