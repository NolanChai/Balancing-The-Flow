" Breakfast. Eggs and bacon, toast, coffee ... "

" Sorry, ma'am , but there isn't any food here except cereal, orange juice, a few bananas and some apple sauce . We don't have anything at all to cook with either . "

" Well , what am I going to do ? My husband is out of town on business for two weeks. If you can't feed me breakfast in my room, where else would you suggest I go?"

" Uh ... well... "

" Do you think I might go downtown and find something at one of the restaurants there? It will cost more than a hotel breakfast, but if there's nothing here, I can't stay in my room all day. "

" No ma'am . Not today . There are no restaurants open this early . The only other place is McDonald's , and that won't be open for another couple of hours . "

" Well ... what am I supposed to do ? Just sit here until 10 o'clock or so, then go downstairs and eat in the dining room? That doesn't seem reasonable. I should have some options , don't you think ? "

" Yes ma'am . We're very sorry for this inconvenience. There is one more alternative : You could always go back to bed . "

" Very well . "

" By the way , I'm in 109 . Would you kindly send up some bacon with my order ? "

" Certainly , madam. Thank you for calling. Good-bye . "

" Thank you . Good-bye . "

" Now that is good service ! "

" And the most interesting thing about it is that I don't have to speak English . "

" Not at all ? "

" No ; the maid and the waiter both understood my French . "

" Ah , yes . How did you learn them so quickly ? "

" Oh ! That was very simple. You see, when I first arrived here in Paris yesterday morning , I found that I had forgotten to bring some money with me . So I went out and bought a pocket dictionary of English words . And then I went into the hotel lobby and asked the maid for my room number. She said it was 109 . "

" Well ! How did you know what she was saying ? You don't speak any English at all ! "

" Oh , that wasn't very difficult . All I had to do was look up 'tennis racket' in the dictionary . That told me it was number ten . And then I just added nine and found out that 109 meant room 109 . "

" How simple ! But how did you know what she meant by saying, 'Room service,' when you didn't speak English ? "

" Well , as a matter of fact, I don't remember exactly what she said in French . But from the way she spoke to me and from my knowledge of that language, I knew what it meant . "

" And how did you know what 'good-bye' was in French ? "

" Well , when I wanted to go back to the room this morning , I asked her if the room service still had anything for me. She said yes ; and as she spoke, I noticed that there was something different about her voice . It seemed somehow friendlier than before . And then she used some French words I'd learned in school when I studied my language books back home in America . "

" Oh , I see ! Good-bye is the same in every country. When you want to say good-bye, you always use the same word . "

" That's right . And that's how I found out what it was . So I said, 'Good-bye' to her and she said 'Good-bye' back to me . "

" It was very simple . But now we come to our next question. How did you know your waiter would understand French if he didn't speak a word of that language ? "

" Well , it was rather difficult there, because I couldn't see how I could have found out what he meant when he said something like 'breakfast ready.' But then the situation reminded me of something else . One night back home in America, my wife and I were watching a television program about France. And they showed some people eating at breakfast. The waiter came to their table with a tray , and they began to talk. Afterwards, they explained that what he said was this : 'Good morning.' What the waiter actually said in French was 'Bonjour.' "

" Really ? That's very interesting . But how did you know it meant breakfast ready when you didn't speak any French yourself ? "

" I didn't , exactly . It just came to me somehow. And then I remembered that the words 'breakfast' in English and French are pronounced almost exactly the same. So I knew what he was trying to tell me . And then after breakfast, we went for a walk together. He asked if there was anything else I needed. I told him no , but I would like some bacon . He understood that part very well because of the dictionary I bought . "

" Good ! Now let's see how you learned French so quickly . How many words did you have in your pocket dictionary ? "

" About three hundred , I think . "

" Well, that isn't enough for a person to learn English as well as French . Besides, it would take too long to look up every word he heard . So how did you manage to understand what they were saying? "

" Oh ! That was very easy. All I had to do was listen carefully and use my common sense . You see , people don't talk in foreign languages the way they talk at home. They usually say one thing and mean another. For example, when you come into a restaurant, your waiter doesn't really ask you if you want something to eat. He asks whether or not you like something to eat ! So I just listened carefully and understood that 'room service' was something he did for me in the room . And then , whenever anyone spoke English at all, I knew it would be a good idea to ask him what they said . "

" Very good ! But I must say that this is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. You must be a very gifted man! "

" Oh ! Not at all ! It's no problem for me. After all, if you are going to speak a foreign language , it helps to know something about its people and their customs . And that is what we Americans do in our country when we come into contact with other cultures around the world. "

" Well ? Is there anything else I can tell my French friends? They might be very interested if they knew all this. "

" Oh ! There is just one thing left to say . And it's really quite simple. You see , when you are going to speak a foreign language, the first thing that you should do is study its alphabet carefully. But if you can't do that , you might try memorizing all of your vocabulary at once instead of learning one word at a time . "

" And what is it you want me to do ? "

" Well , I thought this morning when you came in that you should begin by studying the words for 'tennis racket,' 'ball,' and 'paddle.' Then you could learn more easily after that ! "

" But where can I find such a book ? "

" There is no need to go looking any further. Just take out your English-French dictionary . Look at the beginning of each word in French and you will find it's English equivalent right there underneath it . You see, it's very simple ! "

" Well , I guess that explains why I don't understand much French when I hear other people talk. But if this is true, then I must say it would make things easier for me here in Paris! "
