Yes , that's right . 

 What would you like? 

 Well , how about a cup of coffee and something light to eat , then? 

 All right .

 And while we're on the subject - I think there was another one last night . We left a jar of pickles underneath that bed ? 

 Yes . That's right . 

 Well , it wasn't there this morning. 

Oh , it isn't here now? 

No . It's gone . I'd like another one. 

I see . 

Yes - that was missing too. 

 Oh . Are you sure ? 

Well , we looked for it on the floor and didn't find it, so I think we can be pretty positive about it! 

Okay ... yes . Very well then - one pickle . 

 I'll bring that right up. 

 Thank you. Bye now .

Breakfast please , ma'am . Do you have any fruit or cereal ? 

 Yes , ma'am . We have both here on the menu , but we'll try to bring some fruit if that is what you want . 

 That would be great . Thanks . 

 Right . I'll get it right away . Have a good day .

 Goodbye .
