 Well, sometimes we talk about politics and economy and sometimes we just chat idly. 

 Are your parents foreigners or local people ? 

 My father is a Chinese , but my mother is an American . She came here to teach English in our university some years ago , so I can speak both Chinese and English now . 

 Have you any plans for the future ? 

 Yes , of course.I want to go abroad after graduation.I hope I can get a scholarship as soon as possible .

 I believe in the next few years , our country will have much more rapid economic growth.Moreover, our people will become more powerful economically and technologically .

 What's your favorite food in foreign countries ? 

 My favorite dish is hamburger , but now we can find it everywhere on our street. 

 Do you prefer western or Chinese food? 

 Well , sometimes I love to eat both of them, and then sometimes I just want to have a western meal . But for the last three days my mother has been teaching us how to cook some traditional Chinese dishes such as noodles, steamed fish, soup with crabs, etc. 

 What are your future plans? 

 To be honest , I have not decided yet . At present I am trying to make a good academic record and then enter a well-known university after graduation . 

 Do you think you will become an economist when you grow up ? 

 Maybe.But sometimes I also want to be a lawyer or a journalist . 

 How long do you usually spend on homework? 

 Well , every day I have to study at least two hours at home, and my major subjects like law and accountancy are more difficult than other classes so that I always need to put aside some time to study them.However, I'm not good at maths . Sometimes I spend one hour on it only if the problem is very hard for me. 

 Do you enjoy sports? 

 Oh , yes!I like all kinds of sports like basketball, volleyball and badminton . But since I began to learn economics , I can't find much time to do some exercises because my major requires me to spend a lot of time on reading books and writing papers.However, I still enjoy watching football matches on TV from time to time. 

 What are your hobbies ? 

 Well, as I said before , I like playing basketball or badminton with my friends.In my free time when the weather is nice, I often go fishing at sea and eat some fresh fish.Sometimes I even take a walk on the beach with my mother in the evening . Besides, I also like to play computer games now because they can help me develop both my brain and handwriting skills . 

 What are your interests? 

 Well , my favorite things to read is history books about China's foreign policy , especially the diplomatic relations between China and other countries.And since I am a student, of course ,I also like reading novels on campus because they can help me learn more from life.But as I said before, sometimes it's too noisy for me to study or concentrate on some serious work like math and accountancy . 

 What is your favorite subject ? 

 My favorite subject is economics , but sometimes I like commercial law as well because they are both useful for my future career development.However, in the past one year we have done much more business studies than economic researches.But now with the change of our school's teaching program,we will pay more attention to those advanced theories of economics and accountancy . 

 What kind of music do you like? 

 Well , I used to listen to some pop music in my free time, but sometimes when I am very boring and lonely ,I prefer listening to some soft music.However, for the last few days , I have been learning Chinese folk songs from my mother so that now I love folk music more . 

 Do you like singing? 

 Well , yes!My voice is not very good but I can sing quite well when it comes to folk and pop songs.But in China folk songs are mostly sung by women,so usually I just like listening to them. 

 What is your favorite movie ? 

 To tell you the truth , I don't have any favorite film . But sometimes I like to watch TV dramas on weekends . 

 What kind of TV programs do you like? 

 Well, I usually like watching news and educational programs about science and history . Also I like watching some sitcoms.However, the last few days I watched a lot of films on campus because many teachers have invited us to join the film festival in our school.It is really wonderful that we can learn much more from such events and improve both our language ability and knowledge. 

 What do you usually do after class ? 

 After classes ,I always try to get some rest because I am very tired during my study . Sometimes I go home for lunch but sometimes I just buy something in the school canteen as well.After that , it depends on my mood whether I want to play basketball or listen to music with friends . 

 What do you think of your teachers? 

 They are all very good at teaching Chinese and English , especially my Economic lecturer who is a very famous economist in our country, so he teaches us much more advanced theories.Moreover, his English is also quite good so we can learn how to speak English by listening to him . 

 What do you think of the course you are studying now? 

 I think the course I am studying now is very useful for me because it has helped me improve my language ability as well as knowledge about economics and accountancy.But sometimes we have too much homework or exams to attend so that we can't concentrate on serious work like math and legal studies . 

 What do you think of the future of China? 

 I believe in the next few years , our country will continue its rapid economic growth.Moreover, we are now making much more advanced scientific researches than before so that our people will become more powerful economically and technologically . But I don't know whether we can keep such a high rate of economic development forever. 

 Do you have any plans for the future? 

 Yes , of course,I want to get a scholarship as soon as possible so that I can study abroad after graduation . And in addition to my academic study,I also hope to learn some more advanced theories about business and economics from famous professors overseas. 

 What is the best part of your life? 

 The best time for me is the day when my parents came back to China from abroad because they usually take me to eat some delicious food like seafood , crabs, prawns and so on . And I love their cooking very much. 

 What do you think of your home life? 

 My parents are very busy at work every day ,so sometimes we can't spend much time together . But my father always comes back to China at the weekend , so that he can teach me Chinese and English.And I love spending time with him because he is a famous journalist in our country. 

 What do you think of your school life? 

 My university life is really wonderful!There are many new friends there.I also improve my English ability a lot.But sometimes it's too noisy for me to study or concentrate on some serious work like math and accountancy . 

 How has your English improved since you started learning it? 

 My English is still not good enough ,but I have made great progress in the past four years because our teachers often ask us to talk with foreign students during the semester breaks .Also, we have to spend a lot of time on our homework like essays and reports.So now my English ability has been improved quite well . 

 What is your favorite subject? 

 Well , I don't know if it's my favorite one or not.But economics , commercial law and accountancy are all useful for my future career development.

My English is pretty good because I have studied it for 4 years , but my computer skills need improving . 

 Are you familiar with the place where you're going to work ? 

 Yes , I am . But I think I can get more familiar with the company and its environment after working here for a while. 

 How long do you think it will take for you to be familiar enough with your job ? 

 Well , at least about a month . 

 That's very good .Well,I hope we can work together . I must admit that the position is not easy . You need to have a lot of energy and enthusiasm if you want to succeed in this company.
