The women’s team beat the men’s team , 3-1 . 

 How long is a volleyball match ? 

 An ordinary game takes an hour to play. 

 Have you been watching any sports on TV recently ? 

 Not really . I usually watch TV while eating lunch and dinner . But I'm not that interested in sports these days. 

 Why are you not interested in sports? 

 Well , there isn’t anything good to see . So I don’t even bother with it anymore .

 Have you ever watched any sporting events live ? 

 Yes, once I did. It was a professional baseball game . That was very interesting, and I will definitely go again in the future .

They were winning 3-0 until the very end . 

 Then they lost all of a sudden . 

 That's crazy ! 

 So why did they lose in the end ? 

 The Brazilian team just played really well . 

 Wow ! 

 They were able to win . 

 I wish I could have been there .

 Oh yeah , it would have been fun ! 

 

I went out last night with my friends and we had a really good time. We watched volleyball matches, then after that we went to the movie theatre and watched some movies. The next day, I woke up at about noon and slept until 3pm. I took a shower in the gym and then I came home.

I had a really great time yesterday . 

Yeah ! 

You went out with your friends ? 

We went to see some volleyball matches , after that we watched movies at the movie theatre . 

Then you stayed overnight there ? 

No . 

We came home and slept until 3pm the next day . 

I guess it was pretty late. 

It's okay , I just had fun ! 

That's all that matters . 

Well, I have to go now. See you later!
