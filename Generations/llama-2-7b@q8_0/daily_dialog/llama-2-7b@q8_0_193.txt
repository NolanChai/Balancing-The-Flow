Yes, I do ! There are some nice ones around here ! 

 Thanks ! Can you name one ? 

 Sure , just tell me what you want to pay. 

 How much can I afford ? 

 It depends on the size and location . 

 Ok, let's say $250 for a place that has three bedrooms or more 

 I don't like big houses 

 Why ? 

 Too many rooms to clean ! 

 LOL, you are funny. 

Thanks , my friend . Let's keep in touch.

[Warning: Short generation] 

 sure . 

 bye.

that sounds good. But is it possible for you to pay more than 1250 ?  

 maybe , but I would rather find something cheaper . 

 oh . okay then . Well, if you want I could ask around and see what I can do . 

 thanks again! That's very kind of you . 

 have a good day.

do you know of any place with Internet access ? I need one for my work . 

 well, that won't be much problem . almost all apartments have internet nowadays . 

 so , if you want , let me know what other things are important to you and I 'll try to see if anyone has a place with those features .

I also don't mind having a kitchen, but I'm willing to buy my own groceries . 

 what about laundry machines ? 

 they are fine too. 

 I only have one dog , he's not big so no problem at all . 

 is there anything else you need ? 

 well, a dining table would be nice and also a TV , but I don't really watch television that much . 

 good luck then !

yes . some of them are still students but many are working professionals in their own right . 

 yeah , they'll have all kinds of places for rent or sublet available . 

 ok . I will look at that too . thank you so much . 

 no problem . good luck !
