" you bet . Have you tried craigslist? "

" actually , no . I've just been busy with work and stuff . But I guess now is as good a time as any . "

" yeah . You should really have a look online . There are lots of places to go for that sort of thing . "

" wow ! that's hard to find in this city. There's not much choice for such low price . "

" well , if we get lucky enough , I might have my own room someday soon . "

" have you ever lived alone ? "

" no . I don't think so . but I think it'd be fun ! "

" wow ! you're going to love it ! it's the best time of your life ! "

" oh . I know a few places. You should go see them and decide yourself which one is best for you . "

" thanks . How about this weekend ? Can we get together then ? "

" well, it looks like next weekend will work better with my schedule ."

" ok , I'll see you at 10 o'clock on Saturday morning. "

" see ya! "

" how about air-conditioning ? "

" that would be nice but it isn't critical for me . "

" so you won't mind if your new place doesn't have AC ? "

" no , I don't need a fancy place with all the latest technology , as long as it's not too outdated and is close to some shops . "

" I think it's a good idea to have a place where your neighbors are students , so you can make friends with them and learn Chinese faster . "

" you could also try going out yourself and looking around the city on weekends . "

" OK . Let me go over what I have in mind . "

" well. good luck ! I'll be thinking of you . "

" ok. Have fun ! "
