" Are you sure ? I don't know many people who marry simply for love . "

" Don't be silly . We wanted to have kids . He said he wanted to have six children and I was okay with that . I wanted four children and I knew Tom wanted to make me happy so we agreed to compromise at six . "

" You don't mean you want a dozen ! "

" Well I do , but since I can only have six it was an easy choice for me . "

" What about you ? Will you settle for four or are you thinking of more ? "

" No more . "

" You can't be sure of that . "

" Oh yes I am ! My husband and I love each other very much and we have never thought of having children with any other person . "

" Very romantic again . "
