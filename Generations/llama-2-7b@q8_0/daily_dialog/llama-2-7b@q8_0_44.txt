When did you begin to grow tired of him ?  

 I don’t think I ever grew tired of him . It was more like I knew I had to leave him for a higher purpose . 

 So , why are you still talking about it all these years later ?  

 Because he was the best thing that had happened in my life ! And I miss him . 

 You were just together for six months. 

 We were together for eight years! 

 Eight whole years ?  

 Yeah . He was my college sweetheart. 

 It sounds like you have a crush on Tom right now. 

 I’m in love with him .
