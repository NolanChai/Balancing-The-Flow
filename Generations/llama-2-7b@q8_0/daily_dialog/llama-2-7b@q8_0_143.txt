But I am not sure what to do with all those dishes ...

Well , you could put them in the sink and rinse them under warm water . That should get rid of most of the food stains and make them easier to wash properly later ...

What ! You're going to put everything back where it was ? But I just told you what to do ! 

Yes , but I still think that it would be better if you cleaned the dishes first . 

But then you said that the mess is already clean ... and they don't need to be cleaned again ...

Oh no ! Not like this. Cleaning them now means that we can use them right away , without worrying about stains or other problems later on. And besides , if I leave them here as they are , then you will forget to take care of them and the whole mess will get worse . So ...

But what should I do with those ? 

Sorry ! But you're not listening to me . You told me that everything is already clean so it doesn't need to be cleaned again . If we don't clean anything , then there won't be any more mess and the whole kitchen will be much better than before. So ... 

You do realize that I am going to leave now ? 

Yes, but that is a problem because if you leave them here like this then they are not going to get cleaned until tomorrow morning or later . And if we leave them there for a day or two , then the whole kitchen will be messier than it was before we started. So ... 

But I just told you that everything is already clean ! So why do I have to clean anything ? 

Look at what I'm saying ! If you want me to stay here and clean this mess , then you need to start doing the things that I tell you to do . And besides , it won't take very long. I can even show you how if you like ...

But I just told you that everything is already clean ! 

Okay , okay ! But first we have to get rid of all these dishes from the table . Can't you see ? There are way too many of them and they cover almost all of the countertop space. So if we put some of them in the sink now then maybe we can put the rest away after we wash them later tonight ... 

But how do I know that everything is clean ? 

If you put a little water on it , does it turn black or brown like other things ? Do you have any cuts or scrapes anywhere else ? Maybe some of those dishes need to be washed too . Or maybe just the ones in your hand ...

But I told you that everything is already clean ! 

Okay , okay ! But it's getting late now so we should go ahead and start putting away all these plates right now . Do you understand ? Okay then, let's do this quickly before things get worse than they were before ...
