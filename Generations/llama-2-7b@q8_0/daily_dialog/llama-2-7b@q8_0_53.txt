How have things been going ? 

I think I should get you a cup of tea before we go on talking ! 

 It was good to see you after all this time , Mary . 

 We are back home from the beach and were just about to return when your friend called. 

It's great that you decided to stop by today.

 I can't believe it has taken me so long to see you after all this time .

- Mary and Josh are the main characters in this dialogue, so their names will be used as pronouns when referring to them. They will also be used as nouns at other times. The verb 'to see' is being used here as a phrase. This means that the speaker doesn't intend for it to have any meaning on its own and needs to be paired with an object.

Mary,  I am so glad you decided to stop by ! 

 Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?

- The speaker is talking about two people , but she uses the pronoun 'you'. This can be confusing because she doesn't mean one of them. However, using the singular form would be too formal in this case so instead we use 'you' as a plural (when it comes to 3+ persons).

No , thank you . 

How are things going at work for you ?  

 Great ! Everything is so much better now since we moved our department into this new building. The layout here is much more conducive to the type of work that we do and I can't wait until my next promotion . 

 Have a wonderful weekend , Mary ! 

Thanks . 

 You too!

They are doing great . 

 Josh and I have been pretty busy with school and work . 

 But it's been so nice to spend some time together these past few weeks before the semester ends . 

 Really ? That's great ! 

 Yup , we just got back from the beach a little while ago . It was really fun and relaxing. 

 I am glad that you were able to join us on our trip . 

 That was nice of you. 

 Yes, but it did rain quite a bit so we didn't get out too much. 

 Yeah , the weather wasn't very good , and we had to pack up early . 

 Oh , sorry about that . We should have checked the forecast before leaving ! 

 No , it was all Josh's fault because he forgot his umbrella at home ! 

 Oh , so you didn't get out on the beach after all ? 

 No , we just sat around our room and watched a movie . 

 Really ? That sounds fun. 

 It was really relaxing actually . 

 You should have seen this new movie that I just saw . Josh thought it was boring at first but he eventually fell asleep on the couch . 

 Yeah , it wasn't too bad once you got used to the plot . 

 But I don't think we would get along with our taste in movies. 

 Well , that is understandable because everyone has their own tastes . 

 Okay, so how have things been going at work for you ? 

 They are pretty busy since the holiday season is coming up , but I am trying to keep my mind off of it and enjoy what we do right now. 

 Yeah . There is a lot more going on in November and December than usual because so many people go out to buy presents for their loved ones . 

 So how long have you guys been dating ? 

 It has been almost three years now I think , but it feels like we've known each other forever. 

 Yeah , I agree . Time flies when your having fun ! 

 Josh and I are just happy that we met in college because everything else would have seemed a lot more difficult than it actually is right now. 

 Yes , I am sure of that. 

 And you ? 

 I was going to ask the same thing . How did the two of you meet ? 

 Well , Josh and I were living in the same dormitory during our first year at college together, so we would see each other often. 

 It wasn't until one night that we actually decided to hang out with each other on a date . We had been seeing each other for some time before then but never really spent any quality time together like we did that night. 

 You know , it was so romantic and everything ! 

 Well , I am glad you two are happy together after all this time . 

 Yes, we certainly have been through a lot as a couple but I am sure you would agree with me when I say it has made us stronger people . 

 That is for sure! 

 I was about to ask you how long your relationship has lasted , but I guess now that the two of you are in college together, it will be even longer than what we have been able to achieve. 

 Well , I am not quite sure how long our time here at school will be . I know for me it has gone by fast so far because my first year was filled with lots of studying and trying hard to get good grades in classes while also meeting new people who might become friends someday or just acquaintances. 

 Oh , sorry . My mind got lost there ! 

 It's okay . You were doing great before that ! 

 Thank you very much for saying so . I am sure we are going to have a lot of fun together as well during this next year at college . 

 Well, let us not keep you from getting back home . We will be heading out now too . 

 Sure , thank you Mary ! 

 See ya soon then ? 

 Of course we will . Bye everyone ! 

 Goodbye !
