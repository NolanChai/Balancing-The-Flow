You can stay here or travel all over the country and visit different companies if you wish . 

 You will get paid only during the working period . After you leave this company , your salary is not guaranteed ! So take care of yourself . 

 Do you have any questions ?

How much do you pay ? 

 You will receive 1500 dollars per month during the internship . After that your salary will increase to $ 2000. 

 This is a good offer ! 

 Yes , I think so too . 

 Is everything clear? If not, just ask me.

The salary is $20 per hour and you are paid every Friday . Your office is on the second floor of our company building in the town center , but there's no parking lot . If you don't want to use a public transportation , you can park your car at a nearby hotel , which will charge $15 for one day . 

 Okay , that sounds good . How do I get to your office ? 

 You can take buses No.3 and No.4 from the terminal in front of the post office . They're very frequent and you can use their public-intercom system . There is also a taxi stand at the town center , which will charge around $5 for the trip to my company . 

 Thank you very much . I hope we work together .

Excellent ! 

 We have many employees from many countries , including India, Pakistan, Nigeria and China . I think this is a good place for your first job in America . 

 Okay . Thanks very much for telling me all these important things . I will sign the contract and be here on time tomorrow morning . 

 Thank you . Welcome to our company , Jack ! 

 Bye .

I don't think so . 

 Are you ready to sign it? 

 Yes , please give me a pen ! 

 Good morning , Mrs. Smith . I'm Mr. White . 

 I'm very glad that you could come for the interview . The company is looking forward to your joining us . 

 Thank you for coming all the way from London . 

 No problem at all . As you know , I was born in England and I've been living abroad since I left school . But this time , I want to return to my homeland to work as a lawyer . 

 OK . So how about your experience ? You worked as an attorney for several years or so? 

 Yes . For three years . 

 That's not very long , but it was good enough . 

 I'm sure you are able to cope with this work . How do you feel about our company ? 

 Very well ! I want to find a company which is going ahead of others in the field and has more opportunities for development . Your company has an excellent reputation in Britain , so I think it will be very good for me if I can join you . 

 Thank you . Now , let's talk about our contract terms . Firstly , there are four kinds of insurances , which include medical insurance and accident insurance . You don't have to pay anything when you use them . Secondly , you will get legal holidays , which are the same as those given by the British government. Finally, we will give you an annual bonus on your birthday . 

 That sounds good . I think it is worth working here ! 

 But you must work overtime , because the law firm's clients need service at any time of the day or night . If you can't do that , I'm afraid you won't have a job in our company . 

 OK . I understand. 

 By the way, we hope you will stay with us for a long time and become an important member of our legal team. We have confidence in you ! 

 Thank you very much , sir . I would be pleased if this opportunity turned into a long-term job for me .

Will I receive any certificate after finishing internship , so that I can prove that I've completed my internship ? 

 Of course ! You will get a certificate which shows your achievements and tasks during the internship period . 

 But how much time will it take to prepare the certificate ? 

 About two weeks . 

 OK , Jack . 

 Do you have anything else in mind ? 

 No , I'm fine . 

 I'll go downstairs and get your signatures on the contracts after you pay for my lunch .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Sign it ! 

 OK. See you later .
