" Ok . Is it possible to arrange my vacation ? "

" It's a possibility if you work for six months or more . But I can not give you a written statement , because you are a student . You have to wait until you become an employee . "

" But what happens with the holiday pay and annual leave , when I am on vacation ? "

" Your holidays will be calculated from one year to the next . And it's important that you fill in your personal details properly ; otherwise there are problems when we need to arrange a medical examination or make insurances for you . "

" Wow ! "

" We are in a financial crisis nowadays . Our company is looking for some talented people who can help us get over this crisis . So we have made a very high standard of compensation package to attract you . "

" But , what if I don't work well here ? "

" No problem ! You can resign at any time before the end of three-month internship period . You will have no severance pay . "

" That's not a big deal for me . The thing that is most important to me is what I am going to earn here . So , how much will I get ? "

" In your first year you are not qualified for the stock options and year-end bonus . But , we will give you monthly pay as follows :"

The numbers were in the contract . The details about them was written on a piece of paper that he gave to John .

John signed the contract and then sat down in front of his computer. He began to use Excel to prepare the spreadsheet to calculate how much money he would earn every month .

" Wow ! That's a lot of money . "

" You also have a monthly allowance for your transportation expenses and meals . "

" How much is it ? "

" I believe you are already satisfied with the conditions , but there are still some rules to follow . Your working hours start from 9:30 am in the morning until 6 pm at night on weekdays . You can have a half-day off on Friday and a full day off on Saturday . "

" That's okay . "

" Do you know where our office is ? "

" No , I don't . "

" Our office is in a big building near the Central Park , but it takes about three hours to get there by bus because of rush hour . So, we can offer you the company car . You may also be interested in the free parking space on-site at your work place . "

" Wow ! It sounds like my own private driver and garage. That's great ! I'm sold . How do I sign ? "

" Yes . I'd like to know what happens when an employee resigns or is dismissed from work for reasons attributable to him/her ? "

" We will pay a bonus based on how much time the employee has spent with us . The employee must have two months notice period , otherwise we will deduct his/her bonus by half. In addition , employees who are laid off due to business circumstances or are forced to resign for reasons attributable to them will not be paid any compensation and can only keep their belongings on the spot . "

" I understand all of your terms . I hope to work with you in the future . "

" Can I get a loan from the company? "

" Yes , if you need to pay tuition fees or buy equipment for your work at home . The loans are interest-free and you can get 80 percent of the actual expenses as long as they are not higher than 5,000 dollars. You only have to repay them in two years . "
