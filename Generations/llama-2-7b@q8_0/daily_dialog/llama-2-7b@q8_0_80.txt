" OK , good point . Now , I know that you want to invite your employees ' families , but how many people do you expect ? "

" About 125 . "

" Ok , let's go with a buffet then . How much are you planning on spending for food and beverage ? "

" I have an accounting department here who will take care of that part. "

" Well, you need to budget for the food and beverage. Do you want something formal or informal for the entertainment ? "

" Let's do something casual . "

" Ok , great ! Do we have a good sense of how many people are coming so far ? "

" I think so , but we should confirm that with the invitation. "

" Sure, that makes sense . It'll help to clarify some of those numbers. How about decorations and any special activities for the party ? "

" Nothing specific yet. We want to leave things a little open ended on purpose . "

" Ok , do you have an idea when you want this office party to be held ? "

" It would make sense for us to hold it around December or January since we work so hard all year and that's usually slow season for us anyway . "

" Great ! Let me make some notes. Do you want the party in a special area or do you prefer an outside venue ? "

" I'd like to have it at the company headquarters if possible . "

" Ok , good idea . How about music, then? "

" We could use a DJ and have karaoke as well . "

" Good call . Now, what time of day do you think would be best for the party ? "

" I'd say mid afternoon or early evening. "

" Ok , good . It will help to determine how much food we need . Do you have any special considerations that should be addressed before we finalize details? "

" I was thinking about having it after work so that people don 't have to take a lot of time off to attend. "

" That sounds great! We can go with the early evening then . Now, how about activities for the party ? "

" The main thing is just food and beverage and some games to keep things interesting . "

" Gotcha , let 's make a list of everything we need to prepare. "

" So what kind of food are you thinking? "

" I'll leave that up to the accounting department and if they want any suggestions for drinks, I have some ideas to share . "

" Great ! Well , how do you want the guests to know when it is time for the party ? "

" We could use a big announcement or maybe send out an email blast . "

" That sounds like a plan. "

" I'll have our HR department reach out and get some input from them too . "

" I guess so too, since you are from china. OK , next , what about drinks . Do you want something light and refreshing like champagne , beer or wine? Or do you want a sweet dessert ?"

" Beer is good."

" Beer it is then ! "

" You are right about it . The next question is on decoration . What kind of decorations do you like ? "

" How about balloons and streamers ? "

" Perfect choice , the only thing left to decide is the time . We have two options 8 PM or 9:30 PM. Which one would suit you better ? "

" I think we should start at 8 Pm . "

" Fine ! This was a team exercise and everyone who participated got a prize. Teamwork is important in any company . Doing things together , working together always pays off ! Now let me see the list of winners . "
