Yes, I need to print a document from your printer on your computer, but I can't seem to find it on there...

 I thought my printer was connected through this port here. 

 It is ! But that doesn't mean you can use it with your computer.

 OK, so what do I need to do ? 

 Well you either have to get a USB cable and plug the printer in, or you can take out the old one and put the new one back in (or vice versa). You're welcome!

Why not ? 

 There are some maintenance work going on . 

 That’s a pity. 

 Yes. 

 I see. 

 Well, when is it available again ? 

 It will probably be available after two days. 

 How can I find out if the maintenance is completed and the flat becomes available for viewing ?

 You may come to our office at 8:00 AM in the morning . 

 Ok , I will see you there . Thank you .

Yes , I know that , but when can I see it ? 

 Let me check on the calendar for you and get back to you in a moment . 

 ( Waiting ) Okay , so how about next Tuesday afternoon at three o ’ clock ?

 Sure . Thank you very much ! 

 You 're welcome . 

 See you then ! 

 Bye-bye !
