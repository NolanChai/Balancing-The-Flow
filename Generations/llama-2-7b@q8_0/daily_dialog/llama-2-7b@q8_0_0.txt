" Why? Are you scared of the dark?"

" Well, I guess. It would be nice if we had a light though . "

" Yeah. And maybe even some more wood . "

" Hmmm. If it was up to me, I'd use this for a fire."

"Hmmph! That's what I thought !!"

"Okay. Enough with the jokes. It's getting dark. We should head back now while there's still light . "
