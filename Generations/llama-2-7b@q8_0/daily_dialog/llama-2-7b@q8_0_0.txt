What happened? How did we get lost? 

 We took that trail going up the mountain and it went off somewhere in the woods. 

 Great . It looks like we have two options now . Either back track or find another way out. 

 I think we should try to go back down . If we can't , then let's continue walking . 

 Alright . Let's get going .
