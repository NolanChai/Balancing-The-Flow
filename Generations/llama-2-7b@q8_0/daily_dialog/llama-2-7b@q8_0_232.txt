" Oh, what about an independence day or something like that ? "

" Yes, we celebrate our independence from Spain on December 10th. The people march through the city singing songs and there are also military parades. What do you do when you have a holiday in your country ? "

" Well , when there’s a holiday I don ’ t go to work . How many days off do you get for Christmas ? "

" Only four , but my family often goes to visit relatives on Christmas Day so it’s not such fun. "

" Oh, what about New Year’s Eve ? "

" The whole family usually stays at home and eats lots of food . I think Americans have more days off than British people."

" I don ’ t think so , we still have a day off for Christmas Day. And there are some other days like Boxing Day .  "

" Oh, yes . But what do you do on national day in your country ? "

" We always go to the beach or swim in the sea."

" Do people celebrate it anyway ? "

" Of course they do , and sometimes there are parades too . "

" What do you wear on national day in your country ? "

" We always dress in the national flag colours , red and white . There is a tradition of wearing that colour clothing to celebrate our nation ’ s freedom and independence . It ’ s usually only for women, but some men wear it too sometimes. What do you eat on national day in your country ? "

" I don ’ t know . We never have any special food or drink . "

" That is very strange , isn ’ t it ? The most popular foods and drinks are often made for those celebrations. So what do you usually eat on national day in your country ? "

" I guess it ’ s just cakes . "

" Really ? Just cake ? What kind of cakes ? "

" Oh , I don ’ t know, they ’ re very sweet and people put flags on top. That’s about all I can remember."

"I see , well thanks for telling me . It was nice to talk with you today . Goodbye!"
