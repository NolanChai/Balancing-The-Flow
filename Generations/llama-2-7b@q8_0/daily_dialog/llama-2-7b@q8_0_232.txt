Some parades have military bands , floats with dancers and clowns , giant puppets , sports teams , horses , drones etc. There may be a parade in your city on national day too .

 I've heard that in Russia on the Day of Remembrance there is a "parade of the dead" when people lay flowers at their parents or grandparents graves and walk around the cemeteries with candles. 

 Do you celebrate this holiday ? Have you ever participated in a parade for it?

What is the purpose of having a national day ? 

 I think it would be nice to celebrate our history and culture together as one nation , but we are so different that no one could agree on how we should do it . How many national days does your country have? 

 We don’t have any . Our republic was formed not very long ago . But now there ’ s a lot of people who want to celebrate our independence day together . There aren’t even many countries in the world that don’t have their own national days , so why are we different ? What is your opinion on this matter? 

 I think it would be great if we could have something like that too – maybe just one big party where all kinds of people can come together and share their culture . Do you know any other countries without a national day ? 

 I don’t , but I do know some countries with two or more national days : one on the day they declared independence from another country and another on the day when they became a republic . But we have nothing like that because our history is too short to be able to celebrate anything . Do you think having a national holiday would make people happier?

Why don ’ t you have one ? 

 Well, if there are some parades in your country , that means you do have a national day.

 I don ’ t know anything about them . We only celebrate the New Year and other important holidays . But we do fly flags from public buildings . 

 And what kind of music do you like ?

 The same as yours , classical music . 

 So, what kinds of dances can people learn in your country?

 There are many styles of dancing. Some of them are really ancient and I think they are really interesting to see and experience. 

 What kind of foods do people usually eat in your country ?

 We mostly eat meat . There is a lot of fish and seafood too , but we eat more meat than anything else .

 Are there many restaurants in your country?

 Yes, there are a lot of different kinds of restaurants . The most popular type of restaurant is a pizzeria. 

 How often do you go to the cinema ?

 I never go because I prefer watching movies at home , on television . It ’ s cheaper and more comfortable to do it this way . 

 What kinds of music do you like?

 The same as yours , classical music . 

 Which is your favorite place to travel in the world? Why?

 I don ’ t have a particular one, but I love going to big cities with a lot of museums and art galleries. It ’ s interesting to see how other people live. 

 What kind of sports do you like ?
