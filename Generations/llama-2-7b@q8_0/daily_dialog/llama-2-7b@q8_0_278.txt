well, actually, i wanted to get one of those cheesecakes , but they didn't have any left on the display case . 

 oh dear ! that sounds like a real bummer. I don't know what we're going to do without dessert now !  

 we can go with something else ---maybe an omelet ? 

 nope, i tried one before and it just tastes awful to me . 

 well , you did try only one before. I think you should give the omelets another chance before making up your mind . 

i'm sorry i don't know what else we can get for dessert . Maybe we could have a milkshake ? 

 ok, let me ask the waitress about that !

I love it ! It's like a potato-filled dough-bread , isn't it ? 

 yeah , it's sooo good! We should definitely try another one for dessert later. What about you? 

 I don't know yet . Can we have the same thing as last time ? 

I like the samosas , but my favourite is still their chocolate-raspberry cheesecake. 

let me think a little more. I will check with you later .

hmmm , I've never had chicken tandoori before . It looks so delicious ! I think that's what I'm going to order . 

 the chicken tandoori is my favorite dish here too . Do you want some naan with your dinner ? 

 yes please ! And a mango lassi would be great for me right now . 

 okay , we'll have that also. We can go to the bar and get our drinks there while we wait for everything . 

 sounds good ! What are you going to order ? I think I've had a bangabhirani lassi here before . 

 oh yeah? That sounds really nice . Do you want to have it too ? We can share the mango lassis . 

 sounds like fun! Now let's go to our table and see what we ordered. I hope that they remembered all of it for us ! 

 well , look at this ! They brought a whole platter of food over here and it looks delicious ! And there are two glasses of mango lassi on the side too . 

 wow ! Thanks ! This is really great ! 

 let's dig right in then ! What are you going to have first , samosas or poppadoms ? 

 I'll go ahead and take those. Do you want a samosa? You might enjoy one . 

 no thanks . I'm good for now . Just give me some chicken tandoori and naan bread with my lassi please !

it's like a thick soup with lentils , spices and vegetables . 

 well , that doesn't sound bad . What do you recommend for me? 

 let me see the menu . oh yes ! I really like this one here . It says "chicken vindaloo" . 

 that sounds good to me too. The menu says it contains "tomatoes, onions and peppers in a spicy sauce". 

 is there anything you don't like ? 

 I think the only thing that bothers me is their prices . They are a little bit on the expensive side . 

 well , I guess we have to be careful with our budget then . But maybe they make up for it by giving good food. 

 Let's try to find out ! I'll have the chicken vindaloo and you have the samosas please ? 

 okay . and what about drinks? 

 oh , yes ! We should order a bottle of wine . 

 I know one that would go well with both dishes . It is called "Rose Muller". Do you like it ? 

 yeah . That's actually the brand i was thinking about too. 

 great choice ! What else do we need ? 

 let me see if they have a dessert menu. They actually don't , but I noticed that there are some fruit plates on the menu. How does that sound? 

 let's take one of those . Maybe with a scoop of ice cream. Do you want to share it ? 

 okay . And what about drinks again? 

 do we still have to order water or tea ? 

 nah , I guess we can just go for coffee now. 

 and our bill please! We will pay with the credit card that you are carrying in your wallet . 

 thanks !

yeah , let's order the lamb kebabs. I don't think there are many choices for meat eaters around here . 

 well then we might have to make our own meal plan . What do you think about having chicken tikka instead of the kebabs ? 

 I'm game . Let's order a couple of things for us and one for my little brother. He can eat more than most people !

let me see what they have ... oh , this looks good ! 

 I agree . A pint of lager would go down really well now . 

 let's ask the waitress when she comes over . 

 OK . 

 ok. Do you want to split a dessert ? 

 yeah . Do you have anything with ice cream ? 

 I don't know . You tell me ! 

 there is ice cream in the gulab jamun , but it also has some raisins and nuts that aren't so nice for people like us who are on a diet . 

 then let's skip dessert this time . What do you think ? 

 that sounds great !

 ok, thanks !

that's so sweet of you to say . So , do you want to have some wine or beer ? 

 i think beer is fine for now . What about you ? 

 no thanks , I prefer water. I like it really cold, but they don't seem to offer it in this restaurant ! 

 what a shame! I guess we just won't be having any wine then. So , let's get some water and order our food .
