" yeah , but my dad always says that we should try something different and order something from a different country . "

" ok then . Let's split the pita bread between us to start . "

" i see you are reading a book about your trip in India. Are you planning on visiting there? "

" I love Indian food and I think it would be so much fun to travel around India for two months eating curries, samosas , naan breads , vindaloo curry and chicken tikka masala . The book I'm reading is about a guy who spent three months there after he graduated from college. He said it was one of the best trips of his life."

" really ? That sounds like fun ! "

" yeah , my uncle lives in Canada and he told me that he worked at an Indian restaurant when he first moved to Canada . It would be so much fun to work there and get free food! "

" I don't know if you want to go for two months or not. But you should definitely try the food that you are learning about. The Indian curry looks really good."

" it does look delicious. I wish that i could order some right now . "

" maybe you can give me some advice here, please. I'm not sure if I want meat or vegetarian ."

" why don't you try one of each and see what you think ? "

" that sounds like a good plan ! What about dessert ? Do they serve ice cream here ? "

" unfortunately , no. The dessert menu just has cakes, fruit crumbles and the like ."

" well then I guess we better go straight to the bar after we pay our bill."

" sounds good ! Let's sit back and relax with a drink or two while we wait for our food . "

" it's a kind of soup that has lentils and chickpeas , and some other things like pepper, onion and coriander . "

" oooh , that sounds yummy ! I might have one too . What are you going to drink ? "

" do they serve alcohol here ? "

" not in the dining area but there's a bar just next door . "

" cool ! Let me check the wine list then . "

" how was everything ? Did you enjoy your dinner ? "

" it was great , thank you ! We had so many choices of food from the menu that it was hard to decide what we wanted . What about you ? Did you have a good time ? "

" yeah , I think I would like to have something like that too . "

" what flavours do they come in ? "

" the lamb is my favourite . It's served with rice and a spicy sauce . "

" what other side dish should we have ? "

" let's get some naan bread to go along with it . "

" I think that would be perfect ! What kind of tea should we order ? "

" do they have a special brew or is it just regular tea ? "

" yes , I'm sure they have something really good ! Let me look at the menu again . "

" I think we should drink water for now , since it's so hot outside and there are lots of other things on the menu that look good . How about you ? "

" yeah, I guess so as well."

" alright then . You can order two glasses of water each to share with our food . Do you want to see how long it's going to take for your dishes to arrive , or are you happy waiting for them ? "

" we'll wait . We've got plenty of time."

" good idea ! "
