" I carry all kinds of products but the one I like best is from Paul Mitchell called Awapuhi Wild Ginger Shampoo and Conditioner. They are really good for controlling curls. It's $38 a bottle at Sally Beauty Supply . You can get it cheaper if you buy online . "

" That's perfect . I'm going to take a picture of the label so that I know what to ask for next time . Do you want me to start washing your hair ? "

" Sure go ahead . "

Jane begins to pour water into the basin and runs it over the top of her head. She washes her hair for five minutes. When she is done rinsing her hair, she hands the bowl to Lisa.

Lisa takes it from Jane and empties the remaining water out of it. Then she puts on a plastic apron that Jane bought for her. "Are you going to do anything with my hair ? "

" Not yet . I need to put some warm water in this bowl and mix up your products before we can start. How long did you leave the conditioner on when you washed it last time ? "

" About three minutes . "

" Okay, that's fine. I don't want you to use much product today because I need to put a perm in it and the perm will make your hair feel thicker. Are you ready to start now ? "

" Yes ! "

Lisa adds warm water to the bowl of shampoo that she used on Jane's head . Then she puts her hands under the faucet so they are covered in water. Next, Lisa mixes up the shampoo and the conditioner until it is a thin foamy lather. She dips her hands into the bowl of lathered shampoo and then rubs it onto Jane's scalp.
"Do you want me to comb your hair ? " asks Lisa. "It would help if I could put some product on it."

"Yes please . Go ahead . "

Lisa goes back under the faucet and washes her hands again. Then she combs Jane's hair with a large plastic wide-toothed comb that Jane bought for her at Sally Beauty Supply . When Lisa is done, she takes a bottle of Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Shampoo from the shelf above the sink and pours some onto her hands. She rubs it between her fingers to get a thick lather.
"How do you want your hair ? " asks Lisa. "I can either straighten or curl it."

"Do whatever you think looks best . "

Lisa begins to apply the shampoo on the top and sides of Jane's head. She combs her fingers through Jane's hair, spreading the shampoo evenly across all areas of her scalp. Next, Lisa takes the wide-toothed plastic comb out from underneath the sink and uses it to smooth down Jane's hairline . When she is done with that, she goes back under the faucet and washes her hands again before combing through Jane's hair once more.
"It looks good so far , " says Lisa as she takes a look at herself in the mirror. "You want me to continue ? "

" Yes . Go ahead . "

Jane grabs hold of both sides of the chair and begins to lean back into it until her head is almost completely upside down. Then, Jane looks up at Lisa with wide eyes as she sees what's happening in the mirror behind her. It seems like an eternity before Lisa finally finishes combing through her hair again.
"You want me to wash my hands again ? " asks Lisa, who has been holding onto a large plastic cup underneath the faucet all this time.
"Yes please . I'm ready for the next step now."
Lisa rinses her hands under the water and then takes another bottle of shampoo out from underneath the sink . When Lisa has finished applying it, she holds Jane's head in place with one hand while using a small plastic brush with the other. The next step is to apply Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Conditioner to every part of her scalp where there was shampoo earlier on.
"I can feel it working already ! " exclaims Lisa, who has been waiting for this moment since they first met at Starbucks last weekend . "I want you to keep still while I comb your hair again." After that, she begins to smooth down Jane's bangs and then takes hold of a wide-toothed plastic comb from underneath the sink. She goes over every inch of Jane's scalp with it until all traces of product are gone .
"How do you want your hair ? " asks Lisa, who has been holding onto one end of the chair while leaning against the other for support throughout this whole process.
"You decide ! I trust you , " says Jane.

Lisa looks over at herself in a mirror behind her before answering . Then she takes hold of Jane's hair with one hand and uses another wide-toothed plastic comb to smooth down every part of it. When Lisa is done, she takes out a large bottle from underneath the sink and begins to apply shampoo onto her hands again. She rubs both hands together until they are completely covered in foamy lather before using them on Jane's head one more time .
"Are you ready ? " asks Lisa as she puts down her combs and grabs hold of a large plastic bowl underneath the sink with one hand .
"Yes ! I'm ready , " says Jane, who is already leaning back into her chair. Then, Lisa begins to work on the top half of Jane's hair while holding it in place with one hand. She uses her fingers and thumbs to spread out any remaining product before taking a wide-toothed plastic comb out from underneath the sink . When she has finished doing that, she goes back under the faucet once more so that she can rinse off her hands again. Then, Lisa begins working on Jane's hairline with one hand while holding onto the bowl of water in another.
"Are you ready to go straight now ? " asks Lisa .

Jane nods and leans back into her chair even more as Lisa begins to work on every part of her scalp where there was product earlier on . Finally, after about twenty minutes worth of work , Jane has a perfect hairstyle ! It's the same one she had last time except for the fact that it is straight now instead of curly .
"How do you like it ? " asks Lisa.

"I love it ! It looks really good." Then, both women smile at each other while looking into a mirror behind Jane.

Comment: What is the first phrase, before ***Do you have any...***? And does it start with ***Do***, or *Do you have*?

Comment: @Lambie Do.

Answer: The dialogue in bold shows that there's a \strong{cut and blow-dry} salon involved (though I'm not sure what the speaker means by 'curly' hair).  In addition, the woman is clearly having her hair cut at some point during or after the appointment.

You could say "Do you have any product that controls frizz?", but this would be an odd question to ask someone who has just had a haircut and blow-dry.  A more likely question for the context in bold is "Do you have any conditioner/shampoo?" which is a way of asking if she would like some product from the salon's shelves.

Answer: The only sentence that makes sense to me is this:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{"Do you have any products that control frizz ?"}
\end{itemize}

This is a common phrase in beauty parlours and hair salons, meaning 'do you want some conditioner or shampoo?'

You could replace it with:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{"Do you have any products I can buy here?"}
\end{itemize}
