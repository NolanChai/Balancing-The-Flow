" no ! They both liked our celebrations very much, even the small registry office ceremony . I think it was a surprise for them too , because we hadn't told anyone about that part of our wedding . "

" how did they find out ? "

" do you mean they felt that your marriage was more special because of all that ? "

" yes , I think so ! "
