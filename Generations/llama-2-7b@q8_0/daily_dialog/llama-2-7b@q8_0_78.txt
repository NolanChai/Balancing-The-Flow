yes it was expensive but everyone loved the food at the party so I thought it would be nice for them and us to come to our wedding day with an empty stomach , we served a three course meal at all three parties . 

 wow, you really do like to go all out on things ! Do you have any more ideas like this that you'd like to try ? 

 yes I would like to try another party with no food involved , I was thinking of having just some music playing and candles lit for atmosphere .

yes. My mum was really angry because she said I had become an adult and should make my own decisions about my life , but dad didn't mind much because he is very laid back . 

 so your dad was the easier one of them to convince ? 

 yes , at first anyway . I told him that we were going to do it in a registry office and he said , "OK, then if you want to ." But when he heard about all the parties he got angry .

yes , my family came over for the second wedding party. My in-laws were there too . We had a great time ! 

 why didn ’ t you have the weddings all together ? Wouldn't that have been cheaper? 

 we thought it was more fun to have them separately . Our friends could travel from one country to another with us and celebrate twice instead of once . I think they had a great time too !

yeah , after the ceremony and the parties , we went on a two-week cruise around the Caribbean Islands together , which was nice . 

 what did you do for your honeymoon, Michael ? 

 well , I didn't have one because my wife had to go back home early . We made up for it later by taking a long holiday in Italy. 

 were you planning on going abroad before she left ? 

 no , but we decided to use her absence as an opportunity to make the most of our holidays . I'll probably never have a better chance than that to do what I want while she can't interfere ! 

 sounds like your wife is very strict with you. Did she complain about all that freedom? 

 not at all . She was glad to get away from me for a few days , so we both got exactly what we wanted out of it .

I don’ t know about "traditional" , but it was more than enough for me ! 

 how about you ? How was your wedding ceremony ? 

 we went to a registry office like Abigail and I did . Then we had just one party with our closest friends. 

 how nice . That sounds perfect ! 

 I'm glad you agree , because my fiance is pretty set on that . We’re both pretty laid back about the whole thing . 

 if there are any other questions you have for Abigail and me , we can answer them now ? 

 not really . Just one more question , please .
