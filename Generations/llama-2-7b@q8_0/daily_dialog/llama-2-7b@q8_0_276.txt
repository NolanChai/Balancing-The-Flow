" Well, you had better hurry up and go there if you want to catch him. He has gone so far that he is almost sure to get away from them this time , for he knows every hole in the ground, every hiding place about the mountains. The police never had a chance with him before . "

" I am going as fast as I can walk . " said the old man. He hurried on , and presently turned a corner that led to his house. There were three or four of the cops in front waiting for him , and he began to tremble as he saw them. They seized him at once, and dragged him away to jail ; but they let him take with him this bundle which was tied up in a piece of red flannel :

" Let me have that bundle . " said the old man . " There is something inside it that will make you all happy when I tell you what it is. "

So they took it from him and carried it away, but did not open it ; and as soon as he was locked up in a room by himself , where there were four big policemen who would see that nobody should disturb or bother him, John Smith got out of bed and sat down by the window. The moon had come up then , and shone upon the great mountain which loomed over the town like a huge black wall. He felt tired, and sad, but happy too ; for he was sure now that he was going to get away from them this time .

" What is it ? " asked one of the policemen who was standing by him .

" This bundle . " said John Smith. " It contains a pair of trousers , a shirt, a jacket and a hat ; all made of red flannel. The man whom you have put in jail has been so poor that he has never had any new clothes before in his life , and now I am going to give him these which will be enough for a year or two , I guess . "

So John Smith was sent away with the policemen who were taking care of him, but they did not know where they were sending him. They kept him locked up in different places every night , so that he would have no chance to escape ; and at last when his trousers began to wear out, he bought a new pair.

" I want you all to be very careful of this red flannel bundle now , " said John Smith one day . " It contains the clothes which I am going to give my wife as soon as I get away from here and back home again , so it is worth more than anything that you have got in your possession. I would rather have a hundred thousand dollars than these trousers, but if they are not safe , neither I nor any other man can be happy. "

When John Smith was released at last he took his bundle with him and hid it on the mountain ; but one day when he was gone his wife discovered it there and opened it up to see what was inside of it . There were those new clothes that had been made for her husband by an old man who could not afford to buy them.

" I am going back to see John Smith , " said the old woman ; so she ran down into town and met him on a street corner where he stood talking with some other men. She took hold of his hand then, and told him how much she loved him. He could not say anything at first; but as soon as he saw her face all covered with tears and heard what she said , he burst out crying too .

" You must be careful now , " said John Smith to the man who was holding on to his hand , while they stood together looking up at the moon which had come up again. " This red flannel bundle is worth more than anything you can buy in any store or anywhere else in the world. I have told my wife where it is hidden and if she should find out that I am here with you then I would rather die than to go back home . So, if we are going to be happy always together after this , don't let her know what you have got there . "

" All right . " answered the man. He did not want John Smith to leave him at any price .

The next morning when they parted again , John Smith went away with his bundle hidden under some leaves in a tree where nobody could see it ; but after he had walked along for several miles without stopping, the other man caught up with him and began running by his side. He was carrying an empty sack which he intended to fill with straw when they got there , so that no one would be able to tell what he had found under those leaves .

" I will put it in your hand now , " said John Smith as soon as the other man had reached him .

Then together they began running along the mountain road until they came to a small house that stood alone in front of them. It was dark inside when they knocked upon the door, but presently there appeared at one side of it an old woman who peeped out to see what was happening; and then she opened up without any fear or hesitation.

" Good evening , " said John Smith . " This is my wife . " And he held out his hand to her as if he had been a stranger who had met her for the first time .
