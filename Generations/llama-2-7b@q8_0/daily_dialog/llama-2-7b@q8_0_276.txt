Was he with his wife ? 

 Yes , she was with him . They were walking down the street and he went into a bank while she waited for him at the corner . He returned quickly and they walked away . I never saw them before . 

 What time of day is it now ? 

 It's after seven o'clock .

He's the one that I saw last night in my dream 

 It must have been a dream , for his face seems so strange 

 Do you remember me , dear ? I'm your loving wife . 

 What is it all about ? Why are you here? 

 How long have we known each other , do you remember? 

 So sad and so glad - a time of despair 

 A time of hope 

 And then when the time comes to part , there's tears in our eyes . 

 He's in love with my sister ! Oh no! 

 But we are not related as far as I know 

 It was a dream.
