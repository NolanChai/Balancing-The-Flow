I would like to know your reasons why you don't think so ? 

 Well , the novelist 's creative power is not limited by time and space . That means he/she can write about anything. So , I believe the best novelists have no boundaries of time or place in their writings . It's a matter of opinion that D.H. Laurence is better than Charles Dickens. But his novels are limited to time and space . He lived in 19th century England . That means his characters are also living there . He couldn ' t write about modern times like computers or airplanes because he didn't know anything about them . So , I think we can say that Charles Dickens is better than D.H.Laurence as a novelist .
