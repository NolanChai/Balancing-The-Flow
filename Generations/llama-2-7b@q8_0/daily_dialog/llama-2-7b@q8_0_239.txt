I guess you ’ Re right there . A lot of people have no interest in history because they think it isn’t relevant to their lives now and they just want to know about what’s going on today . 

 And don ’ T you find that a bit boring ? You mean the news , for example ? 

 Sure ! It ’ S easy enough to understand why people are interested in things like politics and current affairs , but I think history is more important than most people realise . 

 You ’ Ve just told me why ! And why you enjoy reading books about the past . 

 But I don’t see that there ’ s much point in knowing what happened before you were born or even when you were at school . 

 That might be true if we didn ’ t have any connection to our forefathers and ancestors . 

 Well , do we ? You mean because they look a bit like us ? 

 Maybe more than that . 

 Well what do you think , then ? I don ’ T really know how to answer . It seems to me that modern people have no connection with the past at all . 

 Apart from the fact that we share our genes and DNA , of course . 

 Yeah , sure . 

 But that ’ S just science , not history . 

 Oh I don ’ T know ! We know more about what people were like in the past than ever before thanks to things like DNA analysis . And isn ’ t that a bit like history ? 

 History is when people write books and tell stories , so it must be more than just knowing what our ancestors looked like or what they did for a living . I don ’ T know how we can find out anything about them at all if they didn ’ T have mobile phones and computers to record their lives with ! 

 I guess you’re right there. But there are lots of other ways that people write history too, and often the most important ones involve things like art , poetry and music . 

 You mean like when musicians or artists use ideas from the past in their work ? 

 That ’ s a great way to see how our culture has evolved over time , but I think it ’ S even more interesting to learn about people who lived hundreds of years ago just by looking at things they made . 

 Like paintings and statues ? 

 Exactly ! There are so many stories in those works of art . A lot of them don ’ T have any words , but the artists still manage to tell us all sorts of things about their worlds through their pictures and sculptures . 

 That makes sense . I remember my Art teacher explaining that there were different ways to read paintings . You had to look at the colours as well as the subjects they depicted . 

 Well , it ’ S not just painting or music either ! The way people dress tells you a lot about history too . For example, how many women today wear high-necked Victorian blouses ? Not very many I don’t think ! 

 Or what about architecture ? People design buildings to look a certain way for particular reasons . If there are columns outside the entrance of your office building , it probably means that it ’ s an old building because if you put them there nowadays everyone would wonder why they were there in the first place ! 

 It does sound like history can tell us a lot about our lives today ! But isn’t that what science is for ? To explain how things work and make predictions about the future based on what we know already ? 

 I guess so . If you ask me , though , it seems more interesting to learn about people in the past from their art and literature rather than just studying facts like dates or numbers ! 

 The thing is , there ’ S nothing wrong with science as well ; if you want to study history through science then you can do that too . It ’ s just a matter of choosing what interests you most . 

 Yeah I suppose so . But when I think about it now , knowing more about the past seems really important because we need to understand where we come from before we can truly move forward into tomorrow !

Yes , it does . It ’ s said that some of the worst crimes in human history have already happened . 

 You can also see how many events are still going on in the world today that started years ago. 

 I think there was a time when things weren’t like they are now , but we don’t really know what it was like then . 

 Yes , we can ’ t , because most of the people who lived at that time have died and left no written accounts . 

 Well , some historians argue that there were good times as well as bad . 

 That may be true. I don’t know. But I think they will always find something in history to criticise . 

 The important thing is that it gives us an understanding of the past , so we can make better decisions for the future . 

 But what are we going to do about the current world crisis ? 

 I don’t know yet. 

 It depends on the outcome of these peace talks between Russia and Ukraine .

But sometimes it seems to me as if history doesn ’ t repeat itself at all . 

 Well , I guess you know the expression about “ Those who don’t learn from history ” ? It sounds a little too much like an excuse for people to keep making the same mistakes over and over again ! 

 I suppose we have different opinions on the subject . 

 Do you think there are any other subjects that require more than just memorisation ? 

 How about art , music , science or maths ? 

 All these subjects require a lot of memorisation in the early stages , but eventually they can be mastered by learning new ways to express yourself . 

 Well , I suppose you’re right . There are some subjects that do require more than just memorization ! 

 In history , it’s important for students to learn how to analyse an event and determine the cause behind it . 

 But I don ’ t think there ’ s anything wrong with memorizing dates or other facts either . It can be helpful in the long run , especially when taking a test ! 

 I agree that memorization is essential for learning history . 

 However , I still think we should focus more on how events happened rather than when they took place . 

 Well , it’s nice chatting with you but I must go now . We have to meet up again next weekend !
