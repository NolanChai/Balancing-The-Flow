" Yes , and some of them are right ! But we can only hope that it won ’ t happen again . "

" It seems that the present is more interesting than history . "

" Not to me ! I find the past more exciting . "

" It looks as if you have a very good memory for dates . "

" Yes , but not for anything else ! "

" Do you like museums ? "

" I don ’ t know . I only go to them because my parents take me there . They think it ’ s interesting to see things from the past. "

" Have you ever been inside a palace? "

" Yes , but not for long . The rooms were crowded and noisy. There were too many people looking at the same thing as I was ! "

" What about castles ? "

" Never been in one either . They looked nice from outside . But I don ’ t think it’s worth going inside a castle because all you can see is ruins , and they are not very interesting. "

" I suppose there must be other places to go . "

" Oh, yes ! There ’ s a beautiful cathedral in my home town. You should visit it if you ever come here again . It was built many centuries ago . "

" That sounds lovely . "

" Well , the inside is nice but the outside isn ’ t . The walls are covered with pigeon droppings ! "

" Pigeons ! "

" Yes . They like to build their nests there, and when they make a hole in the wall , the rain gets in too. "

" That sounds terrible ! "

" Well , that ’ s what I say every time I walk past it! The rest of my town is very clean . "

" So you think history is boring? "

" Not at all, but some places are better than others . "

" What do you like to learn about in history ? "

" Anything really . But I don ’ t like reading long lists of names and dates. It ’ s too hard for me to remember them ! "

" Well , what other subjects would you prefer? "

" English is my favourite subject at school because we always read stories about the past. And in Maths I learn how people worked out things in olden times . "

" Do you have any history books in your library ? "

" Yes , but they don ’ t help me to remember dates and names ! They are more like pictures than a book, so they don ’t tell the story properly. "

" What about films? Have you ever seen one that was about history? "

" Not really . I haven ’ t watched many yet . Some of them look as if they could be interesting though . "

" Oh , I saw a film about the French Revolution once . It had lots of bloodshed and violence, but it wasn ’ t very educational. "

" My father likes films like that because he thinks they are more true to life than others. But I think we should learn about the past in school rather than at home or on television ! "

" What do you think about books then? "

" Oh, I don ’ t know . Some of them are interesting but they often have too many dates and names. The films sometimes show some scenes from a book which would help me remember it better . "

" What are some examples of this happening ? "

" There are lots ! I’ve heard that Julius Caesar was murdered by his own friends in a senate meeting, just like how John F. Kennedy died in an ambush at Dallas. It is also said that Alexander the Great , who conquered so many lands and peoples, had a weakness for women and drank too much wine ! "

" What about you ? Do you have any examples of history repeating itself ? "

" Not offhand . I’ll have to think about it . "
