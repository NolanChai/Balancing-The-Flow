" Wow ! Great . See you in two hours then ! "

The other students nodded and smiled. They were about to begin their field trip to the famous city of Tokyo, Japan's capital. They were going to visit the world-famous Tsukiji Market for its fresh seafood and many delicious cuisines. After that, they would head on to an observation deck at one of Tokyo's highest buildings to have a bird's eye view of the whole city below them.

They were all very excited and couldn't wait to get there.

After class was over, they went to the bus that was going to take them to their destination. A teacher helped them get on the right bus before getting off himself. After about half an hour, the students saw that they had already arrived at Tokyo. The teacher was waiting for them at the entrance of the Tsukiji Market.

The market had many food stalls with delicious foods. But since it was early in the morning , only a few stalls were open. They went to one and ordered some sushi, which is famous all around the world. The teacher told them that they could take as much as they wanted but not more than ten pieces each.

They then went to the observation deck at the top of a skyscraper with an amazing view. At first glance , they saw that Tokyo was surrounded by water on three sides and mountains on the other side . It was incredibly beautiful from up there ! After taking in this magnificent view, they headed back down to get ready for their next activity: shopping at the biggest mall ever built.

The students walked around looking at all kinds of things until it started getting late. They decided that they had seen enough and went out again to have dinner before going back home .
