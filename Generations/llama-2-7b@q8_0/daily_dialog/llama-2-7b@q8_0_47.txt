She was gone for three days . 

 That was in a hospital far away from here . 

 Now she is back home with her parents and we are all happy. 

 Are you going to give us the details about what happened ? 

 Oh, I don't want to . It's too painful for me now , 

 Yes, I agree that it would be better not to remember those terrible moments .

I didn’t . 

 I thought you did 

 I've known for a long time but she just told me last night. 

 How long? 

 Weeks. 

 And how is the baby ? 

 Fine . 

 I heard that it was born prematurely and the mother suffered from an infection , did she die or not?

 She didn’t . 

 Oh, good!

It is very large for a first-time mommy ! 

 What did she look like ? 

 She looks wonderful ! 

 So what's new ? 

 We've been very busy with the wedding arrangements . 

 We are going to have it on August 16 . 

 Is that soon ? 

 Yes, we don't want our family members to find out about it from newspaper articles ! 

 How is your father these days ? 

 He seems to be in a good mood lately . 

 I didn't know he was depressed before ? 

 Oh yes , but now that he has found a job, everything looks great for him . 

 That's wonderful ! 

 Do you think they will move back to the city soon ? 

 They just bought a house there . 

 I guess so then .

Yes , I should . 

 What time are they at home ? 

 Usually in the afternoon , from 3-4pm . 

 I could call before that and see if she is there alone or with other people. 

 Yeah, do that .

I will drop by later .

You heard about the new computer too . 

 Yeah, it was really cool . 

 Have you been on the Internet yet ? 

 Yes ! 

 Do you like it? 

 It's ok ... not bad.

 It's pretty hard to learn . 

 Well that's a shame . 

 I'm still trying to learn all of its functions . 

 Are they making more computers now ? 

 Yep, we have new ones in the store , but they are so expensive .
