" No, no, I was going to tell you. "

" Well then, tell me now . "

" She went out last night and got drunk . "

" Deborah ?! Drunk?!"

" Yeah , she's always getting drunk . "

" Last night, it was too much . I think the alcohol damaged her baby . "

" Really ? You think so ? How do you know ? "

" The father told me. "

" Oh . "

" And then she fainted . "

" She fainted ? Deborah fainted? "

" Yeah . She was lying down with her baby and she just fell asleep . I found her in the hallway, still holding onto the baby. "

" Did you wake her up ? "

" No, why should I have done that? If it wasn't for me, she'd be dead . "

" So, what happened to the baby then?"

" Her brother took him off my hands . I don't even want to look at him. "

" But he is your nephew too !"

" Yeah , but I think we'll get rid of him . "

" What?! Rid of him? You mean, get rid of the baby?"

" It's not a problem for me. "

" But it is a problem for Deborah. And your brother too, he must be distressed. They won't do anything to you if they don't have anyone else to turn to."

" You think so? Well I can't say that it makes me feel any better . "

" But it would help Deborah a lot if someone stood up for her and helped her raise the baby. That way, she won't lose both him and herself. She'll have some hope."

" Why? Why does she need to keep the baby then?"

" Well, I don't know. But people who don't want babies have them too . "

" Yeah , they do but that doesn't mean we should all do it! Besides, the father of the baby was already there and he could easily take over."

"But you think otherwise? You would rather Deborah keep having abortions until she dies?"

" Well , I don't know. Maybe if she had a good reason to stop getting drunk . "

" Whoa ! What a baby ! "

" Yes , and Deborah is doing great . "

" What hospital did she have the baby in ? "

" I think it was somewhere in L.A. . "

" In Los Angeles ? "

" Yeah , but you know how L.A. hospitals are . "

" Oh, so I guess we won't get to see Deborah and her new baby for a while then . "

" Nah , not like that at all ! The whole thing was totally natural . There were no drugs involved or anything . They even had the baby in their own home . "

" What ??! You mean they just went to the hospital and came right back with a baby ? "

" Yeah ! Isn't that unbelievable ? I heard the whole thing was pretty quick too . Just 4 hours from start to finish . "

" That is incredible ! They didn't even need any drugs or anything . "

" Not at all ! It must be some kind of natural birth control they have in that family . I guess if you know what you are doing , it can happen pretty easily . "

" Of course . "

" When are you going? "

" I haven't decided yet . "

" Are you thinking about buying a new car? "

"I think so . "

" Have you thought about any other brands of cars besides Buick? "

"Yes, I have . "

" I think that you should buy the Chevy Impala instead of the Buick. The Buick is much more expensive than the Chevy Impala and it's not worth twice as much! "

" Are you sure ? "

" I am certain of it. You have been driving a Buick for 10 years now, so why change? There are plenty of other cars that are just as nice as the Buick. The Chevy Impala is a good car and it's cheaper than a Buick. "

"I see your point . I don't think you should buy a new car because I like my old car and I'm sure I will enjoy it for years to come. "

"That's great! So when do we leave? We'll go tonight, right? "

"Well, tomorrow would be better . "

"But why wait until tomorrow if you can leave tonight?"

"I have a lot of work to do at home before I leave. It will take me all night to get everything ready."

"Are there any other places in the world that we should see? Maybe we should visit France, Italy, or Spain . "

"How much time do you have?"

"I've got two weeks off work and my boss is fine with it. I can take as long as I like. "

"OK, so we should go to Paris then?"

"Are there any other cities in France that we could see?"

"Yes! We can visit the city of Nice , too. "

"That sounds good . Let's go to Paris first and then stop at Nice on our way back home."

"I think I will take my laptop with me to Europe so I can check my emails from all over the world when I am in Paris and Nice, and maybe we can even see London while we are there. "

"OK, but be careful not to lose your laptop while you're away . "

"I won't forget it!"

" Thanks so much for letting me know . "

" It's my pleasure . "

" The baby is a boy ! "

" Really ? That's exciting. "

" Yes . "

" They named him Daniel . "

" How did they pick that name ? "

" Well, I guess because it was the first name that came to mind when Deborah saw her newborn baby boy for the first time. "

" Is she happy with their decision ? "

" Of course ! She's in love with him . "

" They say he looks like his father . "

" Really ? "

" Well, that is very nice to hear . "

" He has dark hair and eyes just like his dad. "

" That's awesome . "

" I thought they were going to give him a name with an Irish background . "

" They considered it but decided on Daniel instead . "

" Well, they obviously have good taste . "

" I guess that's true . "

" Do you want to hear about my day ? "

" Sure ! "

" I went and saw Deborah this morning. "

" Did she seem okay ? "

" She was doing great . "

" That is very nice . "

" Yes, it is . "

" She looked a little tired but that's expected after having the baby. "

" That must be hard to deal with. "

" I know . "

" Well, Deborah was glad that you stopped by and said she would really like it if you stopped by again soon. "

" I will definitely do that . "

" Thanks for letting me know the good news . "

" No problem . "
