It has been a long time since I met someone who spoke English so well . 

 It ' s very difficult for me to be fluent in English as my first language is Japanese . 

 Oh ! Well, that's why I have always admired people whose mother tongue is not their native language , but can speak it just the same fluently as those who are born and brought up with the language.
