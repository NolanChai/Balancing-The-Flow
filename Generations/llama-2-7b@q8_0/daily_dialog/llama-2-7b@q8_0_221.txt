No ,she is free to answer my questions .

 Why don't you invite her for lunch today?

She doesn't live with me but she lives near here and I will visit her. She usually cooks dinner for us as we are hungry after our work . 

You know , my mom is a good cook and we like to eat her food very much . We usually donâ€™t buy food at home because the quality of products in supermarkets is not so high .
