Yes,I am !

 Oh,I have heard a lot about you from my husband ! How is he doing ?

 He's fine.

 We've been married for six years and we love each other very much.It was just last week that I had the honour of meeting him at your home . 

Yes , I know.

 He told me you were a kind man with a good sense of humour . You do have both of them, don't you ?

Well, I don't want to boast about myself but yes,I am very much aware of that fact.
