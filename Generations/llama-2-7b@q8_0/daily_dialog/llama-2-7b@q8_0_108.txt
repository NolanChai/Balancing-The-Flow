The man stepped toward him, and the detective stepped back.

" What can I do for you,Mr.Jones ? " he said with a smile.

" You've got me,Stevenson , " the other returned,grinning widely." I know it . But if I didn't know that before,I found out by getting your car over in front of my house last night and following you here this morning. It's a beautiful car--you must be doing well to have so much money--and I just thought I'd like to drive it around for an hour or two."

" Oh ! " exclaimed the detective,with a startled look on his face, and drawing back to the window. " Why,I didn't know you could drive. "

" Not very well--not at all," said Jones, grinning broadly again. "But I can take care of myself pretty well in an automobile,and I think that's what you'd be interested to learn."

" Well,come along and see," Stevenson went on quickly, recovering from his surprise a little. "I'm going out to my house this afternoon and will give you a chance then. But don't do anything to make the car go too fast. That's all I ask of any one who drives it."

" Don't worry about that," returned Jones. And he turned away, walking toward the door which had opened when Stevenson came in and shutting behind him as he stepped outside into the hallway. "I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your car,Mr.Stevenson . I shall be careful."

" That will be all right," laughed Stevenson. And a little later he added with a laugh: " I guess that's the limit of my ability to talk like an innocent,young country boy!" and he went back into his private office to attend to some business matters before he left the store for his home.

"That was rather a good imitation," remarked Fred as Stevenson came out from behind the counter. " But I don't understand just how you expect me to help."

"Why,don't you see?" exclaimed his uncle in surprise. "I'll have to go down there after he's run it for an hour or so and see if I can pick up any clews as to who he is."

"Oh! " Fred ejaculated. "That's different.Well,you might try. But the first thing I thought of was that you could make out what sort of man Mr.Jones is by finding out his nationality and if he is a stranger in New York."

"But it doesn't seem to me as if we could learn anything more about him from his talk," Stevenson went on. "He must be very clever,I think,to have imitated my voice so well--I didn't recognize that at all."

"Well,it would be a good thing for you to do anyhow," Fred replied. "You might be able to find out how he happened to know that you had such a valuable automobile--and what sort of work he does besides driving it around."

"I can't imagine why he should want to talk like a country boy," Stevenson went on after a moment, as the two went into his office. "He must be trying to get my confidence."

"Perhaps that is it," Fred agreed. "Anyhow,I suppose we had better find out what sort of man he is--if he's any different from Mr.Stevenson. I'll tell you what you can do: You ask him if he wants to come and have some supper with us."

"That would be a good plan," Stevenson agreed. "But how will I know that it isn't one of your chums who is playing the part?"

"Oh,that wouldn't bother me so much," Fred returned. "And then if we are going to have supper together I guess there's no reason for his pretending not to be a stranger in New York." And soon afterward Mr.Stevenson went back down into the store and asked Jones whether or not he would like to come home with him and spend an evening at the house.

"Yes,please," was the reply, "and if I can't drive your car any better when we get back I'll never go out in one again."

The two were soon on their way and driving along through Harlem they came to a long line of automobiles waiting at a garage. As Jones slowed up his machine, several men who had been sitting in the store began talking about it.

"That's my car," Stevenson said to Mr.Jones as he leaned forward toward the other. "Why don't you join us?"

"I guess I won't," was the answer. "I've got some business at the garage,and I must be getting along." And a moment later he had disappeared into the shop and Stevenson went on to his home.

Inside there were several things for the detective to do before supper--among other matters he wrote out a statement that he was going to make in connection with the death of Mr.Lee, which would appear in the newspapers later--so that Fred and his chums had to wait until nearly eight o'clock for their dinner.

"I suppose you wouldn't like it if I went over and invited one or two other fellows to supper?" asked Ned as he looked around at the table, where three boys were waiting for the food that was being prepared. "You know Fred has been pretty particular about the number of fellows who come here."

"That's all right," laughed Jack. "We can go over if you want to--though I don't know but we might get into trouble by having too many boys staying at our house."

Ned made some arrangements with two other lads of about his age, and then the four went over to Ned's home. The meal was a good one, and afterward Fred asked Mr.Jones if he would like to come back with him for a game of billiards--a favorite amusement in that house.

"I don't know whether I can or not," was the reply. "You see,I have promised my mother that I would call on her at half-past eight and she may be out if you should come before then."

"Oh! Is there anything special going on?" asked Fred.

"Well,it's a sort of a play party," was the reply. "But don't tell your mother I said so--she doesn't like me to say much about these things,and she never has any such affairs herself."

The detective had no objection to this secrecy, and Fred suggested that Mr.Jones might as well go over and see if his mother would care to have him come later. So he started off alone toward the other house, while the two young men remained in the billiard room of Ned's home.

"That is rather a strange person," remarked Jack to Fred after a few moments of silence had followed the departure of Mr.Jones from the room. "He doesn't seem like any one I ever saw."

"Why not?" asked his chum quickly, and with some curiosity in his voice.

"Well,he seems very queer--in a way," Jack went on. "I wonder what sort of work he does? He certainly didn't strike me as being able to get much money at his trade."

"Oh,we don't know anything about him yet," Fred said. "But I think if we keep an eye out for that fellow it won't be long before we find out all there is to be learned about him." And a few minutes later, the two boys left Ned's house and walked back home with Jack proposing a game of checkers on the way.

They had not gone far when they heard some one shout: "Stop! I want to see you!"

CHAPTER XV

AN EXPLOSIVE DISCOVERY

"That was Mr.Jones," Fred exclaimed as he and Jack came to a sudden stop and turned toward where the voice seemed to come from. And there,some distance off, but coming slowly toward them, was the man whom they had met in the automobile store. "We must have lost him,I guess," went on Jack.
"How could we?" Fred wanted to know with some curiosity. "Do you see any one else about? There doesn't seem to be anybody near." And then he added: "Maybe he wants to tell us something about himself that he didn't want our folks to hear. I wonder what it is!"

"Let him come up and talk,then," said Jack with a laugh, and as Mr.Jones came closer the two boys walked on until they were not far off from where their mysterious visitor was standing. And now they saw that he had stopped in front of them and was looking down at Fred's shoes.

"What is it?" demanded the detective boy. "Do you want to tell us something about yourself,Mr.Jones ?"

The other made no answer for a few seconds, but continued to stare down at the shoes
