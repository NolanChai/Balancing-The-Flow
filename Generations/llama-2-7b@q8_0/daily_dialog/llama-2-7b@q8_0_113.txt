The deposit is two months' rent , so it will be $3000 

 Now can you sign on this agreement ? 

I am afraid that I do not have enough money to pay for your flat. 

Why ?

Because I can only afford the amount of the first month's rent . 

What about next month and every month thereafter ? 

I will be working at a restaurant as waiter , so I will earn some money by then. 

How much do you expect to earn per month ? 

About $1500 

And what are your other expenses ? 

For food and transportation , about $400 . 

That makes your total monthly income less than your total expense , does it not? 

I'm afraid you will have to make some changes in your budget.
