What days of the week are available? I’m free on Thursdays and Fridays.

 What day and time works for you ? I’ve been meaning to look at a new house, but I’d rather see it with someone who knows what they’re looking for !

If the houses don't look good we could try to set something up for next week.

### 3. The following is an email you received from a business associate.

**From:** Cathy Smith <cathysmith@company.com>

**Sent:** Wednesday, March 15, 2017 4:16 PM

**To:** Sam Wong <samwong@company.com>

I've been working on the document you sent me and I'm nearly done . I'll have it ready to share with you by tomorrow. 

 I just wanted to give you a heads up that my boss asked me to go out of town for a couple of days starting next Monday so I won’t be able to get back to you until the following week .

I can set aside time in my schedule to work on this after I return , and will send it over as soon as possible. 

The boss is planning on flying into our office Friday, and wants me there then. So if that's not a problem for you , we could meet at the office next Wednesday or Thursday .

I have a question about one of your clients . I was working with her before you were assigned to this account . She gave me some information to pass along to you, and then said she would follow up when she heard from you. 

Do you want me to put that in an email for her , or do you just want me to get back to her ? 

 If I send the email , will it be okay with you if you forward this email on to her?

I wanted to update you on the new system that we are planning for our company . I know this has been a big change for some people , and will continue to be a challenge for everyone as we go through the process of moving our data over . 

 I’ll be out of town next week at a meeting so can't be available during work hours . If you need to reach me you could send an email or text me .I’ll try to check in with any questions that you have on Wednesday afternoon when I return.

Otherwise , if there is anything I can do to help out before then I would be happy to assist however possible. 

If we have time next week I'd like us to meet to discuss the project timeline for the new system . It’s a big undertaking , and will require our full attention moving forward . 

I also wanted you to know that your performance review is coming up soon so you should be thinking about what kind of goals you want to set . 

The deadline for submitting recommendations is Monday , so I need any suggestions you have by then.

### 5. The following is an email from a student .

**From:** Samantha Wong <samwong@company.com>

**To:** Marketing Department <marketing@company.com>

Subject : New Hire

My name is Samantha Wong, and I am writing to apply for a position as a student intern at your company this summer . 

I will graduate from the University of California next May with a degree in business . I have experience in marketing , and am interested in pursuing a career in that field.

I found out about this opportunity through my professor . He is also on staff here, and suggested I contact you as there may be a position available for me to do some work during the summer break. 

The reason I would like to work at your company is because I am interested in how companies market themselves to customers , and it would give me an opportunity to learn about that first hand . My background has prepared me well for this kind of experience . 

I’d be available most days after school , on the weekends, or during breaks such as summer vacation. 

The reason I am sending this email is to let you know that I am interested in applying for a job here. 

 I wanted to be sure that I would be able to work at your office , and wasn't sure how to go about it . The website only listed jobs for the current employees. 

I can also come to the office next Monday around lunch time if you want me to fill out an application . If there is anything else I need to do first please let me know.

We can spend as long as it takes in each place to see what we want , and then decide on another one to view . 

 The houses that are open now are listed below . I would appreciate knowing which of these places interest you ? 

 I have made an appointment to view the house at 12:30 p.m., and there will be a number of other people looking at this one as well , so we should get there early ! 

 What about today , can we go through all of those houses that are open from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. ? 

 We could start with the house on the corner that is listed at $230,000 , or maybe you prefer another one ? 

 The other thing we can do is meet me in my car and we can look through each of them as they are available to us . 

 Do you think either of these options would work for you ? 

 Can I give you a call tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. to see if you have made up your mind on the houses that you prefer ? 

 That way , we can meet and view each one . Then I will make an appointment with the real estate agent for the house that you want to look at ! 

 I can pick you up at 10:30 a.m., and we can have lunch afterwards before you go back to work ? 

 Do you think any of those times would be okay ?

 Can we choose a time to look at houses together? 

Yes

Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best? 

 Either way is good for me.

There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you? 

 Yes

I can take a little time off of work, or I can go on a weekend, also. 

We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your home.

The first one is on Sunday afternoon, then Monday evening , and Tuesday morning before lunch . 

 Wednesday evening we can go over some documents , and I will find out when we need to sign something by.

 That should be enough for now. If you have any other questions , just let me know.
