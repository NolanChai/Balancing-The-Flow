" Ahhhhh ! " says the patient.

" Good ! Now, if I can get it open any wider, will you please say'ahhhh ' again ? "

" All right , doctor , but my throat hurts so badly that I don’t think I can do it . "

" Well, we have no time to argue about it . Just open your mouth and say’ ah ’ one more time . Now swallow. Good ! Your nose is stuffed up again ? "

" Yes , doctor . My head feels like a rock , my throat aches , I feel dizzy , and my temperature has gone up to 102.7° F. I can’t see straight , my stomach hurts, and there is a ringing in both ears ! "

" Just sit down over there . And don't move until I tell you what to do next . Now, just sit here quietly . Don't move your head at all . I want to look into your right ear . Let me have a mirror , please. Good ! " says the doctor as he turns away from the patient who has sat there motionless while being examined.
" Your right eye is twitching . We ' ll give it an injection and then you can go home and lie down. Now, let's get you up to my office. "

The patient, meanwhile, had been thinking about the doctor's words : I must be a terrible case. If he thinks I'm all right, I'd better stay away from him. He knows more about the human body than anybody else in the world . Maybe I'm dying , or at least my mind is affected and I can’t think straight . I ' d better get to bed as soon as possible .

The doctor puts a thermometer into the patient's mouth. After that he tells him : Now, put this handkerchief over your nose and breathe through it while we go downstairs. I want you to lie down on the examining table. Take off your hat and coat, please . "

The patient is not really able to follow what is going on. He has only one thought in his mind : It’s all over ! My life is finished . The doctor and his assistant take my pulse , blood pressure and temperature. Then they examine me with a stethoscope, listen with their ears to the heartbeat, the breathing, and the sounds coming from the chest . They lift up one leg and press on it in different places, to see whether or not there is any pain there. Next they pull on my arm so that I can't move at all. Then they shine a light into each eye, one after another, with a little instrument . After that , the doctor turns me over onto my stomach and lifts up my head. He takes the thermometer out of my mouth, puts it in his pocket, and then gets out a sponge and begins to wipe my face clean with water. The patient is beginning to lose his senses now . But he does not complain because he feels that this treatment must be necessary .

Then comes the injection . And soon after that, I'm allowed to go home again. The doctor says: " You won't have any more trouble from your cold for several days . Now, here is a little bottle of pills which you can take twice every day for ten or twelve days if necessary . But it shouldn’t be necessary because we ' ll give you another injection next week."

The doctor and his assistant are now looking at the patient with friendly eyes as they say good-bye. He is not sure whether or not this visit was necessary ; but he knows that he is no longer ill , and so he walks out of the office feeling better than he has for several days . But when he gets home, his wife tells him that she hasn't seen a single person since she got up early in the morning. She didn't have time to finish her housework before he came home from the doctor . So now it is too late ; and everything must be put away immediately if she wants to go out with their friends at seven o ' clock , as has been planned for several weeks.

" Oh ! " says the patient to himself, " I think it would have been better for me not to have seen this doctor . Maybe he really did make my headache worse and gave me a temperature ? But then what would be the matter with me if I didn't see him again? " So he decides that since his wife is busy cleaning up the house , he will go back to sleep for an hour or so until she has finished .

A few days later, however, the patient has a very bad headache. He can’ t get out of bed . His temperature is 103° F again, and there are spots before his eyes when he tries to read or watch television . " What's wrong with me ? " says the patient to himself as he lies in bed feeling miserable .
" I've had a runny nose , my throat hurts, and now this headache . Maybe it’ s just nerves . " So he gets out of bed and goes downstairs. The first person who comes into the room is his wife . She sees that her husband looks bad and asks him what's wrong ?
" Well, I don't know , " says the patient. But when she begins to talk about all the things that need doing around the house before they can go out with friends next week, he feels very angry . Soon his temper rises even more because of her constant complaining while she is cleaning up their bedroom and kitchen . Then comes breakfast : eggs , bacon , juice , toast and coffee . " That's enough ! " shouts the patient when his wife brings him another glass of orange juice. And it isn’t long before he has had a fit of rage and starts to scream at her about all she does wrong .

" Oh, don't talk like that! You sound just like my mother-in-law ! " cries the patient as he begins to cry and beg for mercy . But his wife can’ t stop yelling back until finally she slams down a plate of scrambled eggs onto the table in front of him. Then she takes off her apron, throws it into the sink with everything else that has been dirtying up their house for weeks, and walks out of the room .

" Oh , Lord ! " says the patient as he lies on his bed again feeling very sorry for himself because he knows what will happen next : His wife will come back in a few minutes to ask him where she should find some clean clothes so that they can go out with friends at seven o ' clock this evening .

Now, it is eleven o ’clock and the patient has been lying on his bed for nearly three hours without moving or even thinking about getting up. Suddenly he remembers something : If I had seen a doctor yesterday morning , then maybe my headache would have gone away by now ? He gets out of bed , goes into another room where there is no one else around, opens the telephone book and looks for the name of an eye-ear specialist in this town . There isn't one listed under Eye , Ear or Nose; so he closes it again without finding anything useful . Now what am I going to do ?

" Well, if you ask me , " says a voice behind him, " It sounds like it would be a good idea for you to go see the doctor before this week is over."

The patient turns around quickly because he doesn’t know where the sound came from . But then he recognizes his wife's face smiling at him through tears as she stands in the doorway holding her apron in one hand while with the other she pulls a bottle of pills out of an old shirt pocket which is hanging over her shoulder .
" I didn't know you were awake , " says his wife, who has been waiting outside to see if he was going to get up before coming into this room. Then they both laugh because it seems so funny that the patient should have such bad headaches and be afraid of seeing a doctor at the same time .

So now all of our patients are sitting in their beds, or lying on the floor next to them thinking about what happened yesterday . Maybe they will remember something else too : That there is an eye-ear specialist in this town who can treat any kind of illness that you have ? And then perhaps they will get up and go see him before tomorrow morning.

" I thought so . Well , what can you do for me ? "

" I can prescribe something that will help you . But first let me see your pulse and blood pressure . Stand up on one foot and close your eyes . "

" All right , doc'tor . Here goes. 'One, two-three-four . One, two-three - four . ' Now , open your eyes . "

" You have a good strong pulse , but you are running a high fever . I'm going to give you an injection and some pills that will help you sleep . In a day or so the fever will be gone . But in the meantime, you ' lIe have to stay home . "

" Well, doctor , can I go back to work ? "

" Not yet . You're not well enough . Don't do any heavy lifting or manual work for at least two days. "

" OK, doc'tor . But when can I go back? "

" When you feel like it . I wouldn't say anything to your boss, though. He might get angry and fire you if he thought you were trying to trick him into keeping a sick man on the payroll. And that would not be good for you.

" No , doc'tor . I don't want to lose my job. "

" I understand. "

15. The doctor came in, looked at me and said, "I have something very serious to tell you."

"What is it?"

"You are going to die within the next year."

I was shocked, but tried not to show that he had upset me.

"How can you be so sure? You don't know anything about my health," I said.

"I am a doctor and have seen many people before like this who are now dead," the doctor answered calmly. "It is too late for you."

"If it's too late, then why should I worry?" I asked.

"Because I can save your life if you follow my instructions carefully." He looked around the room as though he was checking something and said, "Have you got any cigarettes, tea or coffee in this room?"

I shook my head no.

"Then leave immediately," he ordered.

I thought about what had just happened to me but I didn't want to believe it.

"Why can't I stay here? What will happen if I smoke a cigarette or drink coffee or tea in this room?" I asked. "You said you could save my life, so tell me."

The doctor sighed. He looked at his watch and then answered, "If you do any of the three things that I have just mentioned, it will be fatal to you. Your body will die immediately."

I thought for a minute about what he had said and decided I wasn't going to take any chances. I left the room immediately.

"Hey, wait a second! Where are you going?" I heard him call as he came out of his office after me. "Come back here!" But it was too late for me because I was already gone.

I went into another building on the hospital grounds and told them what had just happened to me. The doctor looked at my face, checked my pulse and asked me some questions about my health history before he could believe what I said. He decided that I was not lying or imagining things because I seemed sincere.

After hearing my story, the hospital staff decided it would be best if we told someone else about what happened to me in case something similar happened to them in their homes or offices later on. They didn't want anyone else going through such an experience unless they were sure that everything was safe for them first time around!

16. The doctor said, "It is too late for you." I was shocked and tried not to show that he had upset me.

"How can you be so sure? You don't know anything about my health," I said.

The doctor looked at me coldly and said:

"I am a doctor. I have seen many people before like this who are now dead."

I was shocked, but tried not to show that he had upset me.

"If it's too late, then why should I worry?" I asked.

He shook his head no and said: "Because I can save your life if you follow my instructions carefully." He looked around the room as though checking something and continued speaking in a calm voice: "Have you got any cigarettes, tea or coffee in this room? If not then leave immediately!"

I thought about what had just happened to me but didn't want to believe it.

"Why can't I stay here? What will happen if I smoke a cigarette or drink coffee or tea in this room?" I asked. "You said you could save my life, so tell me."

17. It is very important to understand that the doctor's advice can only be given on the basis of certain facts and not feelings or emotions. In other words, if you are not sure about something then do not ask him. Also, never ask questions like "Can I take this medicine?" If someone has prescribed it for you already then there is no point in asking again as they would probably have already told you everything that needs to be known before they gave it out.

18. In case of an emergency please make sure that everyone involved knows what their job description entails so that things don't get confusing during stressful times like this one!

19. When talking about something serious like medical issues always keep your voice calm and controlled even if it seems hard at first because people tend to listen more closely when someone speaks softly rather than shouting which makes them think that there could be something wrong with their ears (which isn't true).

" Thank you , doctor . "

" Now, if only this cold were as contagious as the one he had last winter . He could spread it around the office in no time. "

" Good morning . "

" Morning . "

" Can I see you for a minute , doctor ? "

" Surely . Just be quick about it . There are lots of other patients waiting . "

" Well, here's the thing . You know my wife had two children . I don’ t want any more . But she says that if there are any tests in birth control that will make sure we never have any more, she wants to try them. She’ s afraid of having another baby because she says they give her headaches and she has a hard time feeding the one she had already. What do you think ? "

"Well, it's not all that simple, Mr . . . "

" I'm Bill Roberts . "

"I know who you are , but what was your question about birth control again ? "

" Well . You see my wife is afraid of having another baby because she says they give her headaches and she has a hard time feeding the one she had already. What do you think ? "

"Well, Mr Roberts, I think your wife should take some aspirin or something. Now , let's get to the point . Have you been taking any birth control measures ? "

" No, we haven't really done much of anything yet. We have tried using a condom but it doesn’ t seem to do very well for us. And she says she hates using birth pills because they make her so tired all the time . She wants something else , something different that will work better without giving her headaches and making her so tired. "

" Well, Mr Roberts, I don't think it is such a good idea for your wife to use anything until you find out what really happened in the past with her children. A woman can have two babies without having them close together , or even at all . And she may not know it yet, but maybe that's what has been happening with your wife. Have you ever discussed this matter with her ? "

" No, not really . I know we should do more about it. She seems to think it might help if I went and saw a counselor or something. I told her I would come in here and talk with you , but she doesn't seem too happy about that either . "

" Mr Roberts, I think your wife is right. Your problem should be discussed with someone who can help both of you understand it better. You will have to do a lot more than just say that you want her not to have any more children. And before anything else is done, she needs to see a specialist who can tell us what happened in the past and what kind of treatment she would need now if there are any problems at all. I'm sure we can find someone here or through your insurance company . "

" Well, thank you very much , doctor . "

" Now, Mrs Roberts, please try to do something about this problem while you are waiting for us to get some answers for both of you . You don't want to keep having headaches and being tired all the time if there is a way you can avoid it. Is that right ? "

" Well, I guess so . "

" All right , then . You can come back in about two weeks when we have more information for you. Meanwhile, take some aspirin or something. Don't worry too much now if the pain is bothering your sleep at night . Just try to rest and relax as much as possible during the day, especially between 10 a.m. and noon when you are hungry. I have written down all of this information for you here on a little card so that you will remember it when you get home . "

"Thank you very much , doctor . "

# 11.
" Good morning, doctor . What do you think ? "

"Good morning, Mrs Thompson . I can't tell from what you have told me, but I am quite sure your son is deaf . "

"But how did you know that , doctor ? I don't understand."

"Well, for one thing he has never complained of a sore throat. And his headaches are in the back of his neck and not behind his eyes. And he never uses his hands to speak . "

"But why is that ? "

"Because he can't hear when you talk with your mouth, but he can see what you do with your hands so he knows how to understand what you want him to say or write for you."

"Oh , I never thought of it like that . But if you are sure he is deaf, why did you tell me last week that he had a cold ? "

"Because he has been coughing and sneezing just like most other kids his age with colds. And I am afraid your son may have a heart condition also . "

# 12.
"Good morning , doctor . I’m feeling better now, but my throat is still really sore . What can I do ? "

"All right then, young man , you can start by going to the rest room and washing your face with cold water from a faucet, not running hot tap water over it."

"But why is that , doctor ? "

"Because if you run hot water over your throat, all of the germs will be transferred right back to where they started. So put some ice cubes in a glass and pour some cold water on them until the water starts to steam. Then rub this mixture over your throat for five minutes."

"Okay . I'll try it . Thank you , doctor . "

# 13.
"Good morning, doctor . It seems that my mother is having a hard time understanding some of what you told her last week . So could you give me another copy of the instructions and maybe we can both read them together ? "

"Certainly , young lady. I'll write it all out again."

# 14.
"Good morning, doctor . What can I do about my cold ? "

"Well, you may find that if you take a shower with lots of hot water instead of cold or warm water, you will probably feel better in just a few minutes. Then go and see your mother before you go to school."

# 15.
"Good morning , doctor . What can I do about my throat ? "

"Well, young man, why don’ t you try gargling with some warm water instead of cold or hot water, like most people have been doing for years? "

# 16.
" Good morning , doctor . My grandfather is very sick and has a terrible cough . What should I do ? "

"Well, young lady, the best thing you can do is to bring him to see me as soon as possible so that we can find out what kind of an illness he might have."

# 17.
"Good morning , doctor . My mother has a cold and doesn't feel good at all . What should I tell her ? "

"Well, young lady, I think the best thing you can do is to get her some aspirin or something that she can take in the morning before breakfast for a couple of days. Then bring her back here so we can see what else might be wrong."

# 18.
" Good morning , doctor . My mother has been taking my father's medicine for the past few weeks, and I think it is time she went to the hospital . "

"Well, young lady, you should do something about that right away. And in fact, it might not be a bad idea if your mother came here today so we could get her admitted into the hospital and give her some tests."

# 19.
" Good morning , doctor . My father is very sick and has been taking medicine for a long time . I think it would be good for him to go to the hospital . "

"Well, young man, you might have something there. You should see that your mother comes with her father so that we can discuss this matter before they go on home."

# 20.
"Good morning , doctor . My sister has been taking my father's medicine for the past few weeks and I think it is time she went to the hospital too . "

"Well, young man, you are probably right about your sister needing some tests as well. If you have her here in a little while with your mother, we can start her treatment as soon as possible."
