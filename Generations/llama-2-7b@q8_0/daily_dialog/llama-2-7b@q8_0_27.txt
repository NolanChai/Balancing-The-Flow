I had to work late last night and then I came home and had some wine . After that my head started hurting , but it got really bad after I went to sleep . 

Well, drinking and wine can affect your health . Did you eat anything with the wine ? 
Yes , there was a sandwich too . 

 What kind of bread did you use ? 
White , I think . 

 Well, white wheat bread is good for you but red wheat is not so good . Now we'll see if there's anything else wrong with the way your body works . Have you been sick lately or taken any medicines? 
I've had a little flu , I think . And some aspirin too . 

 Well, that can be bad for you. You need to take aspirin with caution, if at all . It's good medicine but it can hurt your stomach . Now tell me what else is wrong with you? Are there any other ailments ? 
No , I don't think so . 

 Well , I hope not . Now, young man, you have to be very careful about everything in life. You have to eat the right kind of foods and drink enough water . The more exercise you get , the better your body will feel . And when you go to bed at night, try to stay away from alcohol. 
Yes sir ! I'm sorry about that wine . But thanks for telling me how important it is to be careful with what I eat and what I drink . 
Good boy , now take this medicine and go home to sleep off the headache . You'll feel better in no time . Now, have a good day. Good bye!

Aaaaaaah . 

 Now I need to examine your ears . Can you turn your head to the right ? Turn it back again . 

 Can you hear what I'm saying ? 

 Yes , sir . 

 Well , let me take a look in your nose . Open up and say'ah ' . 

 Aaaaah . 

 All right , now get off the bed . Take these clothes off and come back here with nothing on but that robe I gave you . Come here . Now turn around slowly and put your hands behind your neck . 

 Now take a step forward . A little farther . A little more . A lot more . That’s it ! Look in the mirror . Can you see anything wrong ? 

 Yes , sir . There's something sticking out of my nose . It looks like a big sore . 

 Oh , that's nothing . It's just a cold . You’ll be fine when you leave here tomorrow morning . Now let me take your temperature . Put this thing under your tongue and hold it there . Hold on to the other end so I can read it later . Okay ? 

 Okay , doctor . 

 Now I want to check your pulse. Are you afraid of blood ? 

 No , sir . Why do you ask ? 

 Well , some young men are scared when a doctor sticks his finger in their arm or leg and gets some blood on it . What's the matter with you ? 

 I'm not afraid . I just hate to see blood . It makes me sick . 

 Okay then . Now let’s check your temperature. Put this thermometer in your mouth for a few minutes . Good boy ! Take it out and blow gently on the bulb . That's right , blow hard and hold it there for a minute or two . I’ll read it when you come back tomorrow morning . Okay ? 

 Yes , sir . 

 Now put this rubber sheet over your head . It's warm . Close your eyes tightly and breathe deeply . You should be all right in half an hour . Go on to sleep now . I’m going to leave the room for awhile. 

 Good night , doctor .

I thought so . It must be that nasty flu going around . What can I take ? 

 Well , if it were only a cold , I ' d give you something to help you sweat out the disease . But this is serious enough to warrant a trip to the hospital for IV therapy and perhaps an operation . 

 No ! No ! I can’t go into hospital . The flu's got me down so hard that I ’ ve lost my appetite . If they put me in bed , I'll get thinner . And if I lose any weight, I won 't be able to fight it off . 

 Look , young man ! You’re already sick enough as it is . A few days rest and some good food will help you. Just give your body the chance it needs to get well . Now here's something that should do you a lot of good . Try this spoonful three times a day until it runs out . 

 All right , doctor . I'll try it . 

 Good! It contains vitamin C in large quantities . In fact, this is a special preparation of vitamin C containing 750 milligrams per pill . And the directions say to take only one tablet every three hours . Don’t overdo it or you may get a stomachache . Good luck! 

 Thank you , doctor . 

 Thank you for coming in . I'm sorry we had to see each other this way . But at least there is no doubt that you are sick with the flu. And what’s more, you seem to know exactly how serious it can be if untreated . Do you think I should have done anything else ? 

 No , doctor . It's good enough as it is . 

 Well then ! Goodbye and get well soon .

Thank you doctor ! 

 Goodbye . And take care!
