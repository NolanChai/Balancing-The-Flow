" The last three years , there have been many droughts and floods . "

### Exercise 12

There is not much difference in my daily life and that of my peers. My parents also do the same things as them to make a living.

I get up every morning, go to school, do homework after school, play with friends, do housework at night, watch TV or go to bed early. There is nothing special in this daily life.

### Exercise 13

"He's not the same as me."
"His character is different from mine."
"My personality is quite different from hers."
"His way of thinking and his methods are quite different."

### Exercise 14

I think I am a calm kind of person. When I get angry, my parents will give me some advice about calming down. They always say that anger isn't the answer to any problem. So I know that if you can stay cool and calm in times of trouble, then everything will turn out fine eventually.

I am not a shy person but sometimes I get too excited over something that others don't seem to be bothered by at all. This is probably because my hobby is dancing. When I see people dance well on stage or in films, I feel like running out and performing myself! If you ask me what kind of personality I have, then I would say "quiet".

### Exercise 15

It's not that hard for me to find friends. We go to the same school so it isn't difficult at all.

I think my friends like me because they know that I am a good person who does what she says and helps other people whenever she can. They also know that if you need anything, just ask me!

### Exercise 16

There is nothing special in my daily life . My parents have the same routine as mine: get up early , go to work , come back home late at night , eat dinner then watch TV until they fall asleep. They are not very busy people so we don't spend much time together during weekdays .

On Sundays, however , my father always goes fishing with his friends while my mother stays home and cooks dishes for us all day long ! When I grow up ,I want to be more like her than him !!!
