" Do you read newspapers ? "

" Well, I just look at them when there are no traffic jams and I can get down from the car. It's difficult to read papers in a moving vehicle."

" But if there is no road news , it'll be very difficult for you to know what's happening ! "

" So ? "

" Suppose there was a fire or an accident somewhere . You have to go back and then reach the spot where something happened. If there were no road reports , how would you know about the accidents ? "

" That's true ! I hadn't thought of it that way ! "

" Then, what do you think about the road news broadcasts ? "

" Well, I should be happy if they don't stop. After all , it saves me a lot of time . "

- You have been late for work again. What made you so careless this morning?
- Sorry, sir! There was a traffic jam on the way to the office and I couldn't get in. I tried to find another route but there were so many cars waiting at every corner that it took me an hour.

- Well, we can't expect you to be always late for work because of traffic jams. Next time you have such a problem, come here and talk with me first. We will try to solve the problem together!

- What do you think about people who live in small towns?
- Well, I think they are very happy. They don't worry much because their lives are simple. But I am sure that those people living in big cities have more advantages.

- How could that be?
- You know, if a person lives in a big city, he or she can choose the most suitable job for himself/herself. He/she has many opportunities to meet and learn from talented people. It is easy to start your own business and expand it because there are more customers living in such an area.

- I see. Thank you!
