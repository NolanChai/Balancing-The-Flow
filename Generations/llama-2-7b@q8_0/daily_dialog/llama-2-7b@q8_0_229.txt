We will stay at the Eden Hotel in New York City and at the Ramada in Philadelphia. These are very good hotels for this price. 

 How long can we be on our own in these cities ?

 We have a full day in each city, plus two more days of sightseeing . 

 Where do the other passengers come from? 

 Most of them come from the United States and Canada , but there are some Europeans too.

 How many people will be on the tour? 

 We expect about eighty people to participate in this package, including our guide. 

 Do you think I'd like it? 

 Yes . I think it would be a wonderful experience for you. You have never been to either New York City or Philadelphia and you should really enjoy the trip.

First , you'll visit the falls on horseback for an hour . Then , you'll have lunch in one of the local cafes . After that , I suggest we take a short swim and then rent some kayaks to paddle around the island at sunset . 

 Does that sound like a good plan ? 

 Definitely ! Where can I get a ticket for the tour ?

 You can purchase your tickets from our office between noon and 5:00 p. m . on weekdays only . We don't sell tickets at night or on the weekends . 

 OK . 

 Thank you . See you tomorrow !
