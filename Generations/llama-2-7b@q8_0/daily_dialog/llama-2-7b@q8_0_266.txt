[Warning: Short generation] 

  that sounds like a great idea to me .

it's $46 . 

 that's not bad . 

 that's a pretty cheap meal. It's about what I thought it would be . 

 I think we should tip them generously . 

 yeah , I guess you are right . 

 how much do you want to give them ?  

 let's each put in $20 and that will leave us with a nice tip for the waiters . 

great idea. Let's go . 

 goodnight , Gordan . 

 see you later . bye .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 okay , I'll pay half . 

 thanks Gordon . You really are a nice guy .

well , since it is your first time eating here , let me treat you . You can come back another time and I will treat you again . 

 okay . If I have to choose one between you and the bill, then I guess it would be you. 

 that was a really good dinner . Thank you !

you really don't know me very well . If I had enough money in my pocket right now I would insist on taking the cab to your house and walking home by myself . 

 okay then , let's go get our coats . We should leave immediately so we can avoid having a hard time finding a taxi at this hour .

by the way , I can't believe how much those foods are . It must be an expensive restaurant. 

 yes , it is one of my favorite restaurants and that is why it is so expensive . 

 well , if you say so , Gordon . 

 oh , no problem . It will just take me a few weeks to earn the money to pay for dinner again . 

 well , good night , Gordon . I guess we'll talk about this tomorrow at work. 

 that sounds great . See you then .
