" oh , wow ! I had no idea we spent so much money on dinner . "

" yeah , we had a really good time and we got to try lots of new things . "

" yeah . I can't wait to come back here again . "

" no , I can afford it . "

" you shouldn't feel like you have to pay for everything all of the time . "

" thanks anyway , but I don't want to cause any trouble . "

" ok , well let me just run in and get my wallet . "



" yeah , I know what you mean . You should see me after dinner , all full and stuffed ! I wouldn't even make it two blocks . "

" I guess so . Well , let's get the bill and split the check , then we can head home. "
