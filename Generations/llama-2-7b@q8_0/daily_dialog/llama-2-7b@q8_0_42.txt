You may laugh if you like , but it is true . 

 He doesn’t say much to me any more – and I think that is a good thing . 

 He will get his chance soon enough ! 

  And he has done well for himself in the mean time . 

 Well, I can only wish him luck , but it ’ s all he gets from me ! 

 Now I don ’ t know why you are so anxious to help that young man . 

 But I think his sister should have given us warning before she sent for her brother like this . 

 It seems a great responsibility and I am sure she will never be happy again as long as he is here . 

 We would all do anything to save them both from trouble – but it ’ s not easy now ! 

 He has made himself very unpopular , so of course he can hardly blame us for feeling a little sorry for ourselves . 

 I never thought he was so bad when we were young ! 

 But the truth is that he did make enemies even then – and it ’ s much worse now ! 

 I think you ’ ll find that people will not like his sister very well , either – but I don ’ t know what they can do . 

 It ’ s no use trying to explain anything to them when they have already made up their minds . 

 He is a clever young man and he knows all about it , so why should you be surprised ? 

 All the same, it is very disappointing – I thought him a different kind of boy. 

 If we do what he asks , nobody will ever know the difference ! 

 I don’t suppose there ’ s any danger . 

 What have you got against him ? You sound as if you were speaking to an enemy ! 

 There is nothing more to say . 

 I think your sister should take her brother home again and let us all forget what has happened ! 

  We are not a bad family – we don’t hate everyone who comes here ! 

 Now , please listen for one moment . Don ’ t you understand how things really are ? 

 It is not just the question of whether or not he should stay with us . 

 What do I know about him ? If only she would have written and told us more about his brother before we invited him here ! 

 But I am afraid that even now it may be too late – I can’t help thinking what people will say if they find out ! 

 You have to admit he has been a disappointment . 

 He is not so young as you think , and he could still go home at any time ! 

 You mean that we should turn our backs on him now ? 

 I know what it ’ s like – there are lots of things in my life that I would give anything to change . But they are not worth the bother.
