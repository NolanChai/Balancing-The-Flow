" Then why did you ask me to wait for him here ? "

" That’s another thing . You know , we always say that our brother should be with us in happiness and in adversity . "

" Yes, I do know what it means , but I think the thing has been already done . It is time for you to go home . "

" All right, I will wait a little longer . "

At this moment a car drove up.

A man stepped out of the car and approached us .

" May I come in ? " he said .

" Please do , sir . "

The new comer was very tall with dark hair and a long beard that reached his waist. He seemed to be about fifty years old .

He walked slowly toward us and sat down on the chair beside my mother . I knew him immediately . It was the man who had helped me when I was lost in the street three days ago .

" This is Mr. Ming, a new acquaintance of mine , " said my mother .

Mr. Ming smiled at us and raised his hand to wave his greetings .

" I am very glad that you can make it this afternoon . I have asked your sister to come home and she will be here in about two hours, " he said with a smile .

I looked at my mother eagerly. But her expression was not happy at all. She did not even nod her head in answer .

Mr. Ming saw that there was something wrong.

" What happened ? Did you have any trouble ? You don ’ t look well , " he asked me in a kind voice .

I didn’t know what to say , so I shook my head and did not reply .

" How long will your sister be away ? " said Mr. Ming .

" Not for more than two hours , " replied my mother .

" It ’ s too long, isn ’ t it ? You are getting tired of waiting here . We can go home now if you like . I ’ ll send someone to pick up your sister and she will come back with us in about an hour . "

My mother shook her head again. Then she said that we would wait a little longer. It was too late for me to leave my mother alone. So we stayed there waiting for some time .

But I couldn ’ t keep still any more and asked Mr. Ming if he could tell us what had happened in the past two hours .

" I will tell you , " said Mr. Ming with a smile . " Your father is very busy today . He has been looking for you since morning . "

I was very surprised .

" How ? What does he want me for ? " asked I .

Mr. Ming looked at my mother and smiled again . Then he said that my father wanted me to come home because there would be a big party in the evening.

" Why didn ’ t you tell him where I was going , or what happened this afternoon ? " I asked angrily .

" Your father thinks your brother has been with you since morning and therefore he is not worried about you . He thought that if I had seen you, I should have told him already . " replied my mother . She didn ’ t know how to answer me.

I knew that I was wrong for being angry at them . After all, it was their first time of having such a trouble and they had done the best they could do in order to find me out . But still I couldn ’ t help feeling annoyed with them because of my father’s carelessness.

I was just about to apologize when another car drove up and stopped beside us. A woman got down from it and came toward us . She looked like a lady, but her face was wrinkled . When she stepped on the ground, I felt as if there were stones under my feet . The wrinkles seemed to cover all over her face and made it look very ugly .

Mr. Ming got up from his chair and went toward them with a smile.

" Come here , " said Mr. Ming cheerfully .

The lady bowed slightly at him when she came near him, but there was no smile on her face at all. She just looked at us in silence .

Mr. Ming introduced us to her as my grandmother and we also did the same to her. Then Mr. Ming asked me if I were very tired after being lost for so long time. But I didn ’ t answer him . Instead, I turned around and went to sit by my mother on a chair behind me.

" Grandma ! " called out Mr. Ming in surprise. He couldn ’ t believe his eyes . Then he laughed .

" Now you are ready for dinner , " said the old woman coldly without looking at him, but she had a smile on her face .

Mr. Ming looked puzzled and turned to me with an apologetic look on his face. He told my mother that it was not the time for us to leave yet and they should wait here until my sister came back. And then he would go away with them, but I must stay behind . My grandmother said nothing when Mr. Ming was talking to her ; she just looked at him coldly.

My mother nodded in agreement . Then we were all silent for a while. The sun had already set and the sky was getting darker . There weren ’ t many cars on the street now and the traffic was very quiet.

" Is that my father ’ s car ? " asked I suddenly, pointing to a car standing near us.

Mr. Ming looked at me with surprise . Then he nodded his head yes. My mother knew what had happened when she heard Mr. Ming answer me. She looked down and didn ’ t say anything for a long time .

At last I understood why my father was worried about me . He thought that something terrible might have happened to me, so that he did not come back home on the time which he said he would . But what made him worry more than usual ? The answer came soon after.

" That ’ s it ! " said Mr. Ming in a low voice. Then he turned toward my mother and said :

" It ’ s true that your husband is not very happy about something today, isn’t it ? "

I couldn ’ t help looking at him with surprise . He seemed to know everything that happened to me and had even guessed what had made my father worried. I felt as if I had been put on the wrong way of thinking all the time. I thought that Mr. Ming was an ordinary man who knew nothing about my family .

" What makes him worry so much ? " asked I.

Mr. Ming looked at me again with a smile and said :

" You mean your mother doesn ’ t tell you about it yet , do you ? "

I shook my head no in answer without saying anything more to him .

My mother stood up from her chair and came over toward us quickly . She was pale now and I could see that she had been crying. When she reached our side, she said that they must go home at once because it would soon get dark . Mr. Ming agreed with my mother’s suggestion and then he asked me to come back home with him so that my father wouldn ’ t worry too much about me.

My mother didn ’ t want us to stay there any longer, but she was still anxious for us to go home as soon as possible . So I walked with Mr. Ming toward a car standing beside the road while my mother went in the direction of her house together with my grandmother and left me behind by myself in this strange place where I didn ’ t know anybody at all .

" Your father is waiting for you home, " said Mr. Ming as we walked into his car .

I nodded to show that I understood what he had told me . Then he drove away quickly and soon reached my house which was only several blocks from here . My mother ran toward us when she saw the car coming closer and then embraced me with tears in her eyes . She kept apologizing for not telling me about all these things before because it would have been better if I had known about them myself instead of waiting alone by the road side.

But there wasn ’ t any time left for me to answer my mother’s questions and we went into our house together quickly in order not to be late for the party which was supposed to begin at seven o’clock . My grandmother said nothing when she saw us go in, but I could hear her crying softly from outside.

I didn ’ t have any chance to ask Mr. Ming about what he meant by saying that something terrible might happen to my father and therefore it made him worry more than usual . But it seemed as if he already knew what would happen later on that night when we went out for dinner .

We went upstairs directly after reaching home. My mother told me to take a bath while she was talking with Mr. Ming who had come along with us . He asked her about my father ’ s illness again and how much he suffered from it each day . But my mother just smiled without saying anything in response . She seemed to be very tired after the long time waiting for me at home .

" Your sister should be here soon , " said Mr. Ming in a low voice as we went into our bedroom
