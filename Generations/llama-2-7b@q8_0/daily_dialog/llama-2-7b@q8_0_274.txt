Qingdao is very beautiful , but it's a bit far from here . How about Haiyang? It's close to here. 

I don't think so. I want to travel abroad this time. I want to visit Europe and America . 

 That's a good idea, too . You can visit the most beautiful places in those countries, such as the Eiffel Tower of France, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey of England, etc. 

We should do more than that , it would be better if we could see the Great Wall or the Forbidden City in Beijing . We have never been there before. 

 You're right. It will be great to visit those famous historical places and experience Chinese traditional culture . Let me check whether my parents agree with our travel plan . 

All right , you'd better contact your parents as soon as possible. They may give some suggestions or comments . 

I will do that . Thank you very much. Goodbye. 

Bye bye! Have a nice summer vacation!

By the way, what about you ? Where do you plan to go ? 

 I want to visit Tibet and Yunnan. 

 Those are both very beautiful places. But it is not easy for us to get to them. The road is terrible in Tibet , especially the Qinghai-Tibet Highway . It's difficult to travel by car or even by bus . As for Yunnan, the best way to get there from here is to take a plane and fly to Kunming . 

 Then you should go there right away! By the way, what about me? I haven't made any plans yet . Let's think about it.
