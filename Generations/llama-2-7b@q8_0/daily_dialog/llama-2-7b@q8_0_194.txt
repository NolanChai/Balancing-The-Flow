Well then I failed .  

 But don't worry about it because we'll just take another one next week .

 I can't wait !

 I think I deserved to pass though , 

 It was pretty bad luck that the examiner couldn't find an empty road .

 He had to test me on a busy road with people all over it .

 Well I really failed but if you ask me the truth, 

 I think that my driving has improved since then and I am quite confident now.  

 Well I hope so ! I'm going to be doing a lot more driving with you now because I got my license back this week !

You were late by about a half hour 

 I was only about twenty minutes early !  

 Well , what happened after the test ? 

 I took it again and passed. 

 It must have been a very close call .

 Yes , you were right on the border line between passing and failing . 

 Can we talk about something else now ?

You got three demerit points for speeding and two more for not stopping at the stop sign. 

 Oh my God ! 

 Don't panic . 

 I'm sure we can get them reduced to one or two , which will make you eligible for your license . 

 That's good news, right ? 

 Well , it isn't so bad . 

 If anything goes wrong, then it means that you are not going to be driving on your own for a while. 

 It's better that way .

 Why ? 

 I can't explain my reasons . 

 Let me try to put things into perspective . 

 Think about the dangers of being in charge of an automobile without any experience . 

 You might crash and get hurt or kill someone else. 

 You are lucky you didn't do either . 

 That is why I insisted that you take driving lessons before attempting to drive on your own , but you ignored me, didn't you ? 

 Yes , I did ! 

 How dare you ? 

 Don't worry , we will talk about it later. 

 Now let's focus on what happened today . 

 It was an interesting experience . 

 How so? 

 First of all , the instructor said that I should be a better driver by now because I had taken so many driving lessons with him and I knew everything about the car. 

 He also criticized my maneuvers when I did them wrong, but it was okay because he taught me what to do instead . 

 The next thing that impressed me was his sense of humor . 

 After giving me a demerit point for speeding , he said "It's better than getting one more or you might kill someone " . 

 You know, I like the way you think ! 

 When did you realize what had happened ? 

 About halfway through my test , when I was being taught how to parallel park. 

 When that was over , I realized that it would be difficult to do all of those things without any prior experience . 

 You are right . 

 What made the situation worse for me was that I didn't listen to you and that I took a few risks with my driving . 

 The only thing that kept me going is knowing that if everything goes wrong , then it means that we will have to take the test again. 

 You are right about that. 

 So how did you feel when he told you that you had failed your test ? 

 I was extremely disappointed . 

 I didn't want to fail ! 

 That is why I said "how bad did I do " instead of asking the question directly. 

 You did very well , especially considering how nervous you were when we talked about taking your test . 

 Really ? 

 Yes, really ! 

 You are a great driver and I am proud to say that I have taught you everything that there is to know about driving . 

 Don't forget what I said before , which is that the best way to become an excellent driver is through experience. 

 Do you think it will be easier to learn next time ? 

 Yes, but not by much . 

 You can ask me for help if anything goes wrong again and I promise that we won't have this conversation again for a long while .

First off , you weren't able to parallel park correctly. Secondly , you made an illegal turn . Thirdly , when you went through the intersection , you didn't stop at the red light. I'm sure that if you go for another test in a week or so, then I know that you will pass.
