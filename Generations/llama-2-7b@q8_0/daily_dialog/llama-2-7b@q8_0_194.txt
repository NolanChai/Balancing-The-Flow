" You have to take a drivers refresher course before you can get your permit. "

" That is what you call a driving school? "

" Yeah, and if you don't pass the test , they will take away all that money we paid for the lessons . "

" Is there no way out ? "

" I think so, but it is going to cost us extra."

" Your driving was just awful , you were weaving around the road , and you kept on hitting the curb when going round corners . "

" Didn't I pass my test once before ? "

" Yes , but that was a long time ago . "

" Oh ! I see. Thanks for telling me the truth . "

" Well for starters, you didn't know how to use your indicators properly . "

" Really ? "

" Yes , and you also kept on bumping into things because you weren't paying attention . "

" I see . "

" You were also rather rough with the steering wheel . "

" What do you mean by that ? "

" Well you twisted it around a lot and made this horrible noise as well . "

" Oh ! "

" So yeah , you failed your test but don't worry there is still time for you to learn . "

" Really ? "

" Yes , I think the best thing to do now would be if we could go over some of those things you need to improve on before you next take the test . "

" I guess so , but only if I pass this time around ! "
