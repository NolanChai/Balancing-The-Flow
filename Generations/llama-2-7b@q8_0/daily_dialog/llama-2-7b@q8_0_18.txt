# Chapter Three : The Patient

### Background Information

In this chapter the patient will be a man named Mr. Johnson. He has had diarrhea for 2 days and is unable to keep anything down, including water. His family called an ambulance and he was brought to the hospital.

Mr. Johnson's condition is not improving despite his visiting doctors on staff at the emergency room.

The EMS crew took a history of Mr. Johnson before they started their trip to the hospital. They also observed his signs and symptoms as they were en-route.

On arrival, he was wheeled into an examination room where a doctor assessed him immediately. He then performed further tests to try and diagnose what the problem may be. 

Mr. Johnson was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. His condition is still not improving.
