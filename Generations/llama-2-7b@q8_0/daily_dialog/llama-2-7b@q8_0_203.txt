" It really does look beautiful, dear ; don’t you think so ? "

" It does? It looks like a bunch of branches tied together. "

" But that ’ s part of its beauty . "

" Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and in my eyes it doesn ’ t look pretty at all ! You are being way too sentimental about this thing . I hate to throw it away, but the time has come. "

" Oh no, wait a minute . The kids still need to see Santa Claus coming down our chimney . Let me take care of that for you while you go put all the ornaments into storage . I can do this easily ! "

" All right , just make sure they ’ re in boxes when I get back. "

" No one likes that thing anyway , do they ? "

" No . Everyone loves the tree . "

" They do ? I thought everyone hated the tree . "

" Nah , not really , it ’ s just that they don ’ t like it as much as me. "

The above is a classic exchange between a husband and wife on New Years morning, with her nagging him to take down the Christmas decorations. They have had this debate every year since they first met! He hates it and wants it gone – she loves it and would like to keep it forever. The issue of decoration is a classic one in many marriages. Many people go out of their way to make sure that their home looks the best, with all sorts of beautiful furniture and accessories, but when Christmas comes along they bring out an old box of decorations which have been gathering dust for months or years – the tree may not even be in good condition as it may have been left standing throughout most of winter.

In this article, we will look at some of the key issues that arise with having decorations up during December and how they can affect you and your family. We will also look at the positives of keeping them up as long as possible. The following are the key topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Christmas Decorations in the House - Keeping Them Up
\item Effects on Children
\item Impact on Relationships
\end{itemize}

The main reasons that people put up decorations is because they love to do it. However, they are often under pressure from their partners or family members who may feel the need to conform with society’s expectations of having a beautifully adorned home at Christmas time. Some parents also complain about their children nagging them for days on end until they put up the decorations and then when they have been taken down again, there is often a period of discontent from them as well.

\section{Christmas Decorations in the House - Keeping Them Up}

One of the most common arguments that couples have over Christmas decorations is whether or not to take them up at all and how long they should stay up for once they are up. There is no right answer to this question; it depends on what kind of couple you are. For some people, they feel very strongly about having their home decorated in a certain way throughout December as part of the Christmas experience but others do not care so much and will happily put them away for January when all the fun has gone out of things anyway.

\subsection{Advantages}

There are several advantages to keeping your house full of festive cheer during the holiday season, including:

* It creates a great atmosphere in your home which can make family and friends feel welcome

* It helps you get into the mood for Christmas when you first walk through the door after work on December 25th! This means that you do not have to spend all day thinking about what presents you should buy or whether or not you’ve done enough decorating – these thoughts will take care of themselves.
* It makes it easier for guests who may not know where things are kept during this time because everything is clearly labelled and in its proper place, making them feel more at home when they arrive on Christmas day (and every other day).

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of keeping your house full of decorations throughout December include:

* It can be expensive, especially if you have children who want to add their own touches to the decoration. This may lead them to break or ruin some items which could result in disappointment all round when they come home from school after playing with their new toys on Christmas day!

* There is no real end point for having so many things out as soon as they come into use because everything looks great when it’s first put up but after a few weeks this starts looking more and more tacky – unless you have an eye for interior design that is. If you do, then go right ahead; otherwise maybe consider taking some of the decorations away before New Year's Day!

\section{Effects on Children}

It can be hard to determine how much impact keeping your house full of Christmas decorations has on children and their behaviour. One of the most common complaints that parents have when it comes to Christmas is that they are constantly nagged by their kids about why there isn't enough decoration in their home or where all the presents went, etc. However, this may not necessarily be true – for example: if you were thinking about taking down your tree earlier than usual because of some other reason then maybe this might affect them too.

\subsection{Advantages}

The advantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It gives children the opportunity to get involved with their families, which is often something that they want but cannot do when everything gets taken away after just one day! This can be especially helpful if your child has special needs or any type of disability.

* They have something interesting happening around them all year round which helps keep them interested in what’s going on at school instead of just waiting until summer holidays start so they don't know where else they should go when they get bored (and let's face it: everyone gets bored sometimes).
* They feel like part of something special because they helped make things look nice inside your home which makes them feel proud about themselves and what they can do.

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It’s expensive! If you have children who are always asking for new toys or accessories, then this could add up quickly so make sure that everything else stays put until after the holidays.
* They may get bored of seeing these same things over and over again throughout the year which means they won't be able to enjoy them fully when it comes time for Christmas dinner either (which is probably not what you want).

\section{Impact on Relationships}

It can be hard to determine how much impact having a festive period in your home has on relationships. If one partner is more into decorating and the other isn't, it may cause some tension as they both try to get their way; this could result in an argument that will need sorting out afterward (if possible). However, if there are no arguments at all then everything should go smoothly and without incident!

\subsection{Advantages}

The advantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It gives you something to look forward to each day which can help make the season more enjoyable for everyone involved, including children if they’re included in this process too (which would be ideal).

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It costs money! If you are not careful then your budget may soon run out and before long it will be time for New Year's Eve again...

* They can be quite stressful sometimes, especially if they aren't put away properly when they’re no longer needed. This could lead to arguments between people who should know better than to leave things lying around like this but don’t care enough about each other or themselves not to do it anyway (which sounds a little bit harsh).

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, there are many pros and cons when it comes to having Christmas decorations up during December. On one hand, they can make the holiday season more enjoyable for everyone involved by giving you something to look forward to each day; on the other hand though, they cost money which could otherwise be spent elsewhere or they may end up becoming stressful if they’re not put away properly when no longer needed (which sounds a little bit harsh). It’s really up to each family member whether these advantages outweigh any potential disadvantages though because everyone's priorities are different.

\section{Tips for Decorating Your Home}

If you decide

" Well, that’s why we keep the lights on it all the time — so he can see where he is . "

" Maybe it would be a better idea to buy another tree ? I know a lot of people who still have their trees up right now . "

" But we already put away our presents , and we don ’ t need an extra tree for decorating anyway . "

" I just hate throwing things away , especially when they still have so much use left in them ! "

" It looks like a lot of people around here are keeping their Christmas trees up all the way to Valentine ’ s Day . "

" So what ? We don ’ t need a tree for every holiday — and I think it looks nice this late . "

" But we don ’ t have any lights on it , and the branches look bare ! It just looks sad without any decorations at all. "

" Well, maybe you can find some new ornaments somewhere ? They can always be used again next year . "

" I think you should take the tree down now before we lose more needles from it . We don ’ t want to wake up one morning and realize we have an empty corner of our living room ! "

" It ’ s just not fair that Christmas is over already ! Everyone else gets to keep their trees up until after New Year’s Day . "

" That ’ s because they put them out in April . "

" I can’t believe you actually want to leave the tree up all year long ! It seems like a waste of space, and it just looks so strange ! "

" But Christmas is my favorite holiday ! I don’t mind if our tree stays up until next December. "

" What about all that stuff we bought for you this year ? You’re not going to keep putting it under the tree , are you ? "

" Why not? It ’ s a beautiful piece of furniture . "

" But what will your friends think if they come over and see that huge pile of presents beneath your Christmas tree ? They won’t know where to look ! "

" That’s all right. I’m sure it’ll be fine. "

" But you know how many other people have been coming around looking for some place to put their extra gifts ? It’s crazy! People will stop bringing things here if we keep the tree up until next year ! "

" Well, at least they can still give me my presents . I think it would be a shame to throw out all those beautiful gifts just because someone forgot to take down their Christmas decorations. "

"I’d really hate to see the tree go , too, but we have a lot of other things that need to be put away first — and you know how much I don ’ t like to do that . Besides , now it doesn’t even look very good anymore ! The lights are all burned out , and there aren ’ t any presents underneath. "

" I think the tree looks nice without the presents underneath, if we just keep some of the ornaments on it for a while longer . "

" But they need to be stored properly before we get them mixed up with all our other Christmas decorations ! You know how hard it is to find any of those old things when you want them . Besides, I think it looks better without any ornaments underneath — it just seems more natural that way. "

" Well , if you say so . "

" And we really need to get ready for New Year ’ s Eve ! It ’ ll be here before we know it . "

" I don’t like going out on New Year ’ s Eve — especially when it ’ s snowing. "

" But I thought you liked snow ? What are you scared of? It’s not as if we ’ re going to drive in the storm, or anything ! Besides , with all that new snow outside , maybe we could make some pretty good snowmen for Christmas this year ! "

" Maybe . "

" And once they ’ re finished , I think it would be nice to leave them up until after New Year ’ s Day — don ’ t you ? "

" Maybe . "

" But they wouldn’t look very good under the tree all by themselves . Besides , we ’ ll have to keep our old Christmas lights on so that people can see where they are ! It seems like a waste of electricity just to leave them on in the middle of winter. "

" I think it would be nice if we kept some decorations up until Valentine ’ s Day . Maybe we could make some new ones for next year , too ? That way, we wouldn’t have to throw any of this stuff away . "

" But that ’ d still take a lot of space ! It doesn’t make much sense to keep all this stuff around just because there isn ’ t enough room in the attic. And it seems like such a waste to buy new things every year, when we already have so many old ones lying around. "

" I think you should take the tree down now — before more people start coming over and asking why it ’ s still up . "

" But it doesn’t look that bad , does it ? And you know how much time I put into decorating this year ! It would be a shame to waste all my hard work like that ! "

" If everyone else is keeping their trees until next December, why shouldn ’ t we do the same thing? We don ’ t have enough space in our house as it is. "

" I think you should take the tree down now before someone gets hurt walking on top of the branches . They might not even be able to see where they are going when it starts snowing ! And what if some of those needles fall off and get lost under the blankets ? It would be terrible if one of your friends found them there after we ’ ve been sleeping in that bed for a while! "

" I think you should take the tree down now before someone else gets hurt walking on top of it ! They might not even be able to see where they are going when it starts snowing !

"I think you

" But I don’t want to take it down yet ! If we leave it up until after New Years , the decorations will still be there . "

" Yeah , and then what ? Then when Christmas comes around again next year you say, “ Oh , no ! We can ’ t put that up now because it ’ s been here so long ! ” You have to start putting things away when they get old and broken ; otherwise you won ’ t be able to put anything away at all . "

" Yeah , but the Christmas decorations are different from other stuff . I mean, we never throw them out after one year . We use the same stuff over and over again ! "

" But if we start leaving things up too long, they ’ ll get old before you know it - - then what ? You can’t put something away when it gets old ; you have to put it away when it is still new . If we start saving things for next year , that means they will never be new again . "

" Yeah , but the tree and everything else was so much fun this year . I don ’ t want to give it up already ! It seems like such a shame ! "

" Maybe you should come over here . See what kind of things are falling apart around me ? I ’ d say that’s a good example of leaving things too long ! "

" Yeah , but at least yours aren ’ t decorations. Besides, the only thing falling apart on your side is that old chair ! You need to get rid of that too . "

" It ’ s not falling apart ! It just needs a little work . "

" But it’s falling apart! All you have to do is take out one or two screws and pull off the seat cover ! I can fix it for you if you want. You don ’ t even have to bother taking it home . "

" Really ? Thanks , but no thanks . "

" Okay, then . "

" I guess I should get going ; my wife wants me to take down the tree and put it in the trash can . I told her we could save it for next year if you want . "

" Yeah , yeah ! That ’ s what I said too ! "

" Well ? Is she still angry about the whole thing or are you ready to give up now? "

" She ’ ll never give up on anything ! But if she doesn’t want it , then we don ’ t have any choice . "
