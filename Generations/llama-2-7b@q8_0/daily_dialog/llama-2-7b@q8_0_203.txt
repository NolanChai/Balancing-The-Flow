I know but we don’t have room for it in the garage . 

 We can put it in the basement if you like . 

 It ’ ll get moldy down there . 

 Ok , just so long as we take care of it . 

 We gotta do something with the decorations too . 

 I guess we could throw them out. 

 Do you want to keep some ? 

 The kids will probably like having one or two things around the house for Christmas Eve . 

 Well, let ’ s see what we can find and take down now . 

 The children are already here and waiting for us . 

 I know , but let’s not rush this , let ’ s have a nice family time with them taking it all down together . 

 I think that would be fun too .

Well, we have to take down the tree now . 

 What? Why? I don't know why . 

 Okay then , it ' s coming down ! 

 No way! It’s not coming down . 

 Well , it is going in the garage tomorrow morning . 

 No , we are not taking it down yet . 

 Fine ! I will take it down and put it in the garage myself if you don ' t want to ! 

 What ?! You can ’ t do that ! 

 Why not? You can't just tell me what to do and how to live my life! 

 Okay , now you are going to be sorry ! 

 Oh , I guess so . 

 Don’t guess – just sit down because your butt is about to be spanked ! 

 Well, it won ’ t be a hard one since we both know how to behave . 

 Yes , that's right , you do know how to behave . Now, take off your panties and go over my lap! 

 I don’t think so. 

 Then come over here ! 

 No way, I won ’ t get spanked because of an argument about the Christmas tree! 

 Oh , you don ’ t want to be spanked? You don ’ t know how to behave ? Well , then let me tell you – a little bit of pain will teach you very quickly! 

 All right, I guess . 

 All right? Fine. That’s all you had to say. Now get over here ! 

 No way! I won ’ t get spanked because of an argument about the Christmas tree!

Ok , you win ! 

 But now don ’ t come crying when a branch breaks and the tree crashes to the floor ! 

 Fine! I won’t come crying for help if a branch breaks, but please take it down yourself . 

 It would be better if we did it together. 

 You want me to help ? You ’ re kidding , right? 

 Yes . 

 No way ! This is what I have been waiting for ever since you decided to put up that thing — the opportunity to tear it down and get rid of it forever! Now get busy and take it down before we have company over tonight.

I don ’ t understand how you can be so sentimental about an old Christmas tree. 

 I don ’ t see what ’ s so sentimental about it . It was just a few days ago when you were complaining that we still had it up and that we hadn ’ t gotten rid of the decorations yet . 

 I can ’ t understand why we have to take down everything all at once. Can ’ t we leave some of the lights on? They look so nice in the night time , and it seems a shame to waste them just because Christmas is over. 

But that’s exactly what you said two weeks ago ! 

But it was before Christmas, then I didn’t mind. 

 But you insisted that we take everything down . It doesn ’ t seem right to me . 

We don ’ t have time to argue about this. The cat is climbing up the tree and dragging all the ornaments out onto the floor. 

Oh , come on ! That ’ s no reason to take it down now. I ’ m sure we can get the ornaments put back up without too much trouble, even though you always say that it’s such a hassle . Let ’ s just leave them there until next Christmas, and then we can take everything out of the tree again. 

No , no , that wouldn ’ t be right ! You said yourself that this is the last year for us to have all those old ornaments on our tree! Now I want to get rid of them before next Christmas . We need more space anyway . 

But you said we didn ’ t need any more room. And anyway , if we don ’ t like them, why keep them? They are just taking up space in the closet now. You could throw them away for all I care! 

Okay , okay ! Don ’ t get so upset . We can take down this year’s decorations , and you can store them until next Christmas , when we ’ ll have more room to put up new ones. That way, at least our tree will always look festive in the winter time.

No , I guess you ’ re right. But it ’ s still hard for me to take down the tree. I really like it . 

 Ok, well , let ’ s go take care of it then. We got a lot more things that need to be done before we can start thinking about Christmas next year .
