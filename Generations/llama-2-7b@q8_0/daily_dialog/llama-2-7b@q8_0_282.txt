Here are some more . 

 Oh , yes I'm from Europe. 

 I don't want any credit card either. 

 It will be a pleasure to assist you ! 

 Could you please show me this screen ? 

 Yes sir . 

 Let's go through it step by step. 

 I need some euro , just for some shopping . 

 That's good because we have special rates on cash transactions too. 

 Then why don't you take one of our credit cards ? We offer very advantageous interest rates and rewards as well . 

 What kind of a service do I need to register for an account ? 

 I am not interested in any of them actually , I want cash only. 

 So here we go ! 

 You have seen the rate ? 

 The transaction will be approved automatically within seconds . 

 That's very convenient , but do you know the exchange rates for other currencies like Canadian dollars or Mexican pesos ? 

 Sir , I'm sorry to say that you don't get the best rate here. You can see it on your screen there. 

 Oh ! . 

 What a pity ... 

 The rate is actually the same as if you were to buy in Europe. 

 So where exactly are you from ? 

 I am from Brazil , but now I live in Canada. 

 Yes sir, so here it's for you then . 

 Now we have to complete some personal information just once and that will allow us to perform the transaction instantly in the future as well . 

 What about an international credit card ? 

 Here is our business card . You can see it on your screen there. 

 Well , I'm not interested in any of these . 

 If you have other questions or concerns , please ask me directly ! 

 Couldn't we do the transaction online instead of having to come here personally ? 

 Oh sir , if it's cash that you need then unfortunately, this is the only way . 

 Thank you for your time and assistance ! I hope I can find a better exchange rate elsewhere ... 

 I am so sorry that we couldn't help you today. Maybe next time we will be able to provide you with a more favorable exchange rate. Please have a nice day ! 

 Bye , bye .

About a thousand Euros . 

 All right , I will help you . 

 Can you show me how to enter the amount for this cash purchase into the system ? 

 I can tell you how , but I think it's better to see it once . 

 Yes, please . 

 Here is a list of what has been done so far : 

 - You have entered the destination bank in the country code field and selected RIB as your method of payment for this cash purchase transaction. 

 - Then you have typed in "Euro" into the currency field, which will allow you to choose "EUR" from the list . 

 - Afterwards , you have entered "1000" into the amount field . 

 - Finally , you have selected the date of your transaction on the calendar. 

 All right , here is how you would enter this cash purchase in to the system : 

 Clicking the destination bank will open a new window . 

 This window can be closed with the "X" button in the top left corner or by clicking anywhere outside of it . 

 In the country code field, type "G", which is the first two letters of " Germany ". 

 Select "RIB" as your payment method. 

 Click on "Euro" to select it from a list , then enter "1000" in the amount field . 

 Choose a date and press enter . 

 All right, now that you have done it correctly , I will close this window . 

 Could you tell me what is happening with my cash purchase ? 

 I will help you there as well . 

 Click on your name in the top menu bar to open the "My Account" window . 

 Here , you can find all of your transactions. 

 On this page , your last transaction should be listed. 

 As soon as you confirm it by pressing enter or clicking the "Confirm Transaction" button , the system will send an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) instruction to RIB in Frankfurt. 

 The "My Account" window also provides information about your account balance . 

 Could I see my last transaction ? 

 This is what it looks like : 

 Entered Amount: EUR 1000 

 Expected Amount: EUR 997,64832 (including commission fee of EUR 2.51) 

 Paid Date: Nov. 09 , 2012 

 RIB Transfer : 1ZB87276052325619278  

 Your account balance is now EUR 17,356.40 . 

 All right , I think you have it all now . 

 Can you confirm your last cash purchase transaction ? 

 Yes , I can do that . 

 I will press enter to confirm this cash purchase and close the "My Account" window . 

 Thank you very much for using our services . 

 Bye !

1000 , 500 , 100 and 50 . 

 You can give me 100 bills for each denomination if you like so . 

 What is the maximum amount I could have in cash here at one time ? 

 No more than 20,000 RIB . 

 Why that much only ? 

 Well , that is our limit for security reasons and regulation from central bank here . 

 How much would I get after conversion ? 

 7.84610 EUR . 

 And how much would you like to pay me ? 

 In what form of payment ? 

 Cash , please ! 

 Very well . Here are the bills , take them and have a nice day here .

 Bye.

2,000 US dollars ? But what will happen if I leave these dollars in Euro in this bank for some time? Can it be possible that they are not changed into Euro by themselves and are kept in Dollars? 

 It is impossible , we change them all automatically , you see there are a lot of accounts with different currencies here . 

 Could I get the cash ? 

 Sure, here it is . 

 Thank you very much . 

 Bye bye.
