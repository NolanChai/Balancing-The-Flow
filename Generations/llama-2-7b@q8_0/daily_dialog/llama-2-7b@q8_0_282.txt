" Ten thousand Euro will do . "

" Do you have anything else with you ? "

" No , just this . "

" Okay, sir. What's the amount in Pounds Sterling that you want to change into Euros ? "

" I am sorry , but it is only 10K Euros . The rest of my money will remain in pound sterling for now. "

" Oh , okay . I can do Euro with £10K then . It's a good day for me today, because you have brought the money that I want . "

" What did you say ? "

" £10,000 Euros is what I am selling at £1.50 to 1 . So your £10K will get you €15,000 . You can't lose on that deal. "

" No , I don't want the money in pound sterling any more. That was just an example of what my needs are going to be in pounds. Now I am taking only Euros because I will stay here for long and there is no point in taking back with me such a large amount . "

" Yes , sir, but £10K in pound sterling gets you €15K in Euro . It's good to know that . "

" No , thank you. I will go to another bank if I need money in pounds . "

" Five hundred and one thousand . "

" What do you need that amount for ? "

" To pay rent of a room in the city . "

" You mean for this month ? "

" Yes , I think so . "

" Let me take your passport please . "

" Thank you . "
