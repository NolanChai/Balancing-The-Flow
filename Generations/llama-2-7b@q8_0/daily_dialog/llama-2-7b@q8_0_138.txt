--------------------------

I could do nothing but look at her and she did not stop until finally I spoke.

"That is the best thing that has happened in years," I said.

-------------------------------

It would be a good idea to send invitations out on this coming Thursday evening . 

 We need to get them sent before the weekend so we can plan accordingly for next Wednesday's party . 

 ---------------------------

"Are you going with me?" I asked.

I was thinking of the wonderful things that could happen if two young people were together .

 -----------------------------

 I decided to go in and see her again a few days later . 

 I found myself looking for an excuse to go over there again. 

 I kept telling myself how happy she had made me feel just by being with her . 

 ----------------------------

 It would be great if you could get the invitations done on time . 

 I have been thinking about all of the fun we're going to have at this party.

-------------------------------

The evening of the party , I arrived there first and I waited for her outside in the garden .

 My heart was pounding . 

 I could hardly wait to see what she looked like . 

 ---------------------------

 I have always been very shy around people that I don't know well . 

 It took me a long time before I dared speak to her. 

 The party was wonderful and the invitations had arrived right on time!

-------------------------------

 We were surrounded by so many new friends that day it was impossible to speak with her . 

 She was always in a hurry as she tried to find out about everyone attending our party. 

 -----------------------

"How are you going to invite him?" I asked myself. 

"What if he doesn't accept?" I thought of how wonderful it would be if he came . 

 I imagined that I would look at him as his friends talked to me and perhaps he might smile! 

 ------------------------

 She had a funny little habit of smoothing her hair back with the palm of one hand after she was done doing it.

She didn't know I noticed this . 

 And yet I always felt that if we were ever alone together for any length of time, she would be more comfortable if I knew how to do these things!

 --------------------

 "I can think of nothing better than to go out with him" was the only thing I could think. 

"What if he says no?" I said to myself . 

 As soon as we had finished talking she smiled at me and nodded her head towards a bench nearby. 

 -----------------------

 I don't know why , but I suddenly felt shy again when our eyes met and I couldn't help smiling in return . 

 But then it occurred to me that this was the perfect time to say something if we were ever going to have a real conversation. 

 "Would you like to go somewhere where there aren't so many people around?" I asked.

 ------------------------

 As soon as she had gone upstairs, I rushed down and ran my hand through her hair.

I stood back to admire the way it lay on her shoulders and then went inside the house again . 

I smiled because it seemed like she was smiling at me from across the room.

 ------------------------

 "What if he doesn't say yes?" I thought to myself as I waited for her to come downstairs . 

 When she did, we were both so nervous that neither of us could speak. 

--------------------------------

 My heart beat rapidly when I saw him at our party the other night! 

 But how can you get someone to notice you if they don't know who you are?

 -----------------------

 "Do you think he will say yes?" was all that came out of my mouth as we walked over towards where she had left her friends. 

 I felt so happy that finally after being together for such a long time ,we were alone at last!

 ----------------------------

"I guess there is no reason why you shouldn't come along with us," I said to him as we walked back into the house . 

 "I don't know what my family will think about this but if they do object , then it won't change anything anyway."

 --------------------

"Wouldn't you like to go out with me?" he asked.

I had always hoped that some day I might be able to take her somewhere special, so we agreed on Friday night . 

 But the first time she was a little shy about it and said she wasn't sure if her family would let us have dinner together! 

 ---------------------

"We are going out for dinner," I said. 

 "I hope you don't mind."

She didn't say anything so we went upstairs to find out what she wanted . 

 She looked at me and smiled again. 

 But this time the smile was even more beautiful because it came from her heart!

 -------------------

 I think he is really nice . 

 "Would you like to go with me?" He asked . 

 But there wasn't any reason for him not wanting to come along . 

 ------------------------

She didn't say anything but she kept smiling and then suddenly her eyes met mine. 

I knew right away that we were going somewhere special together because I saw how happy he looked when she said yes! 

 ----------------------------

 "It will be nice to spend the evening with you" , was all she could think of saying . 

 I couldn't believe it and then he smiled at me again as if we had been friends for years. 

---------------------

"I am sure your family will like us together," I said . 

 "And they won't mind our going to dinner tomorrow night?"

I was sure she wouldn't say no but still I couldn't help smiling at him when he asked. 

 ----------------------

 He stood there and smiled again until finally I gave in because it seemed like he had been waiting for me all day!

He didn't know how hard it was to be alone with her . 

 But now that we were together , nothing else mattered anymore. 

 ----------------------------

"You are really a nice person," I said as I looked at him for the first time since she had agreed to go out with me tonight! 

 He was smiling again when I saw how happy he felt that we were going somewhere special together . 

 But even though this was my first real date , it didn't make any difference because our eyes met as soon as we came face to face !

That sounds like a lot of guests. Will you make an announcement at all of your other branches?  

 Yes, of course ! We want everyone to come celebrate with us . 

 I know that it will be great ! 

 How should we publicize this event ? 

 Let's begin by talking about the food. We need something that can feed a large number of people and is easy for our staff to serve . 

 What do you have in mind?  

 I am thinking of hamburgers with all the trimmings, chili, hotdogs , chips and some fruit or veggies. 

 That sounds good to me too. We will need a lot of drinks as well . 

 Certainly ! We also want to have some finger foods for those who prefer something light to eat . 

 Great idea! I'll work on the menu . 

 It is nice of you to do that. 

 We should decide where we will hold the party then pick a date and start making plans for decorations, entertainment, etc .  

 Let's set up a time to meet next week. I am thinking it might be best if we met during our lunch break? 

 I think that would work out fine. 

 That sounds good. I will see you then and bring some ideas with me .

That's fantastic . What a wonderful venue . 

 I agree . The park is perfect for an outdoor celebration of our first 100 years . 

 Do you have a theme in mind ? 

 Yes , I was thinking maybe "Back to the Future" or a throwback event to the library's founding . 

 That would be fun ! And nostalgic at the same time . 

 Excellent choice . I really like that idea . 

 So let me get this straight , we are having an outdoor party on our grounds and it is a throwback celebration ? 

 Yup, that's it!
