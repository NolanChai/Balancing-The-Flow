"That sounds like a wonderful time . Are you going to have an open house ?"

"Yes, we are planning on inviting all the people who have contributed to the library over the years. We will also have food for sale so that everybody can buy some refreshments."

"Sounds good to me . How do I get in touch with you ? "

"My cellphone number is (615) 792-2843 and my email address is (615) 640-2007."

" I see . What's the theme for this party? "

" Well , since it's our 100th anniversary , I think it should be a historical theme . "

" Great idea ! You know, the first thing that came to mind was a historical reenactment . But that would be very expensive and time consuming . "

" Yes . We couldn't do that but maybe something much simpler . "

" Do you think a historical exhibit would work ? "

" Well, it is hard to imagine a more cost effective way of doing this . "

" Good ! Then let me ask you about the location of the exhibit. What area are we using for our historic exhibit? "

" Well , I'm thinking in the main lobby area by the front doors of the library would be most appropriate . But I am open to suggestions, if there is a better place. "

" It should definitely be placed in an easily accessible area so that people can see it from their cars as they drive up or walk into the building. In fact , I think the more publicly visible this exhibit is the better. "

" Yes . I think you're right . "

" That makes sense because it is also important to let everyone know about what will be going on in the library that day . So, the bigger and brighter the better. "

" Thank you for your input . Now , do you want to get a cup of coffee or tea? "

" Sure . I'll have a hot cup of cappuccino. "
