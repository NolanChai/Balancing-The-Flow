Do you want me to ask our personnel department for an official invitation letter ? 

 I have not yet received any specific date of the interview. But I think it's not so difficult to get a reply. 

 Is it okay if we can provide you with a formal invitation letter?

 I agree . You must ask them , and let me know when they answer me back ! 

 Okay, thank you very much for your help! 

 See you!
