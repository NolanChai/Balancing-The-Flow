Oh , so you are doing well at work? 

 Yeah , I am working in my own office now. 

 Wow! how did that happen ? 

 Actually, it was my boss who promoted me to this position. I really appreciate the support he gives me . 

 What about your boyfriend ? He's still working overseas? 

 Yes , we talked last night and he said that his business in New York is going pretty well. 

 So what are you doing today ? 

 Oh , I am going to the gym with some friends tonight . We usually go there once a week . It's really good for our body, isn't it? 

 Yeah, absolutely ! By the way , where are we having dinner tonight? 

 Oh , let's have dinner at that Italian restaurant down the road . You know , that one on the corner. 

 Sounds great . I can't wait for us to have our next chat! 

 Yep ! you too. Take it easy . Have a nice day !

Yeah , and it is better to do regular exercises . But you have to find a way of doing that .

 Oh , I know what I will do . Let's meet at the club together sometime .

There is a saying that a sound body builds a sound mind . If you keep fit , you can be more confident in life .

 Bye . Take care!

 Goodbye

Yeah, you're right , but sometimes I still get hungry for junk food when I am tired after a long day at work . 

 It's okay . You can have the junk food on special occasions like once in a while or twice a week . Just don't overeat them . 

 That's right . But I will be careful about what and how much to eat . I should not lose my appetite because of junk food . 

 That's smart ! 

 Thanks , I think I have learned enough today.

Sure , he gave us some tips on how to improve our health and keep fit . 

 What kind of exercises do they usually perform in the club? 

 We start with stretching exercises in the morning . It warms up your muscles for the next activities . 

 You mean yoga ? 

 Yeah , we practise some yoga moves every day . After that , we train our limbs and do various kinds of aerobics . 

 I think it is pretty boring to go to a club to exercise every morning . 

 We also run several laps around the running track in the park next door . And then we have a resting time . After lunch , we usually play some ball games . It's so much fun ! 

 I am sure it is . What about you ? Do you regularly go to the club or exercise at home ? 

I don't do any exercises. It seems that you are really healthy and energetic . 

 Well , I try my best to maintain a healthy lifestyle . And you ? 

 I also believe it is necessary for people who lead an active life , such as athletes or sports coaches . 

 What about people who don't exercise at all ? Are they unhealthy too ? 

 If someone does not do regular exercises , he is likely to fall sick . His muscles will get stiff and his blood circulation will be weakened . He may suffer from headaches , joint pain or even heart attacks if he doesn't take proper care of himself . 

 Is there any scientific evidence to back this claim up ? 

 Of course . Science has proven that it is essential for human body to exercise on a daily basis in order to stay fit and healthy . It can prevent you from various diseases as well . 

 So , people who don't do regular exercises are likely to be unhealthy ? I am not sure about this . 

 We should all have an active lifestyle so that our bodies remain in good condition . 

 OK. Well, thank you for your time . Have a nice day !
