" Yeah , it will. "

" Yeah , but the most important is that you should have a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet . If you eat more veggies than meat, then your body can be kept in good shape. "

" I know how to do it right . Thanks ! "

" You are right . How about you ? how is the situation with you ? "

" I am fine but I feel like eating something sweet now . What about you ? "

" That's true . But if you are not careful with the quantity , it can still cause weight gain . "

" I know what you mean . So much for healthy diet . "

" Not so fast . A healthy and balanced diet also includes avoiding too much alcohol or smoking . "

" Yeah, that's true . It's not good for your body . "

" And it is better to avoid drinking alcohol in the evening after exercise . You know, you can have a good night sleep . "

" That's right . "

" I don't think it is such an easy task to keep fit and healthy . "

" No way ! It requires commitment . If you really want to achieve your goal , you should be persistent and consistent with your exercise routines . "

" You are right . "

" There are different types of exercise for people at different age groups . The main thing is to keep fit no matter how old you are ! "

" Yeah . I'll try my best to follow your advice and I hope I can achieve my goal soon . "

" No , not really . "

" Then you should have a word with him or her . "

" Yeah , it might be a good idea . "

" Do you do yoga ? "

" I wish I could ! I've been practising for months but I just can't get into the swing of things . It's not easy for me to keep up with all those postures and poses . "

" Well , at least you tried hard . Have you tried pilates ? "

" Never heard about that before . What does it look like ? "

" I have no idea . I just know it is a form of exercise which can help the whole body become more flexible and fit . "

" Then let's do some research on that ! "

" You know what ? My wife is always nagging at me for not working out regularly . She keeps telling me that if I am in a good shape , she'll treat me to some luxury items . "

" That sounds like an ultimatum . "

" I guess so . Now let's have something to eat . We can talk more about this over dinner ! "
