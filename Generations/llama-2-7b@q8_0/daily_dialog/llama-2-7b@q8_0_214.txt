The multiple choice and free response . 

 Is there a lot of reading on the test ? 

 Yes. It's pretty dense too . I need to re-read it all tonight . 

 Yeah , well good luck ! You will do great ! 

 Thanks . I will see you tomorrow morning . Good night ! 

 Bye !

No , not really . The question I got asked most was what political party was he affiliated with? 

 Which one is that again ? 

 He was a republican . That was the easiest one to answer . 

 Really ! Well , you better start studying your history books tonight because there are probably more questions on that topic .

Is your history teacher a good teacher ? 

 He isnt bad but I dont think hes great either . 

 Why not ? 

 Well , he lectures every single lecture about the same thing over and over again . I mean there are so many things to cover in American history that I dont think we should be spending more than half our class time on it . 

 Do you have a good relationship with your teacher ? 

 Yeah I guess . He doesnt make me stay after class and stuff like other teachers do . 

 Any other subjects are you taking next semester ? 

 No , just history . Ill be in this class the whole time . It isnt a very hard class though . You will pass it without any problem as long as you study for the exams . 

 Do you think they will have extra credit for this class ? 

 I dont know . It depends on how well you do during the semester but you might be able to get some points back if your exam is bad . 

 You should look over those notes that he gives out in class because there are a lot of them and they will help you pass the exams . 

 Do you have any idea what the next history class is going to be about ? 

 No , I dont think so . The first semester was about the civil war and this one has been mostly about the Reconstruction era . So maybe we will start with something new in January . 

 Can you tell me when exactly this class meets on Tuesdays ? 

 Yeah it is at 10 AM . That should be easy for you to remember if it doesnt conflict with your other classes . I am not sure where the classroom is though . 

 Do you know your history teacherâ€™s name ? 

 His name is Mr . James Smith . He isnt very old and he has short brown hair . Have you met him before ? 

 Yeah , we had a lecture together last semester on Abraham Lincoln . I dont think hes married or anything like that though . Im not sure if he has any kids either . But anyway, are you taking the history exam tomorrow morning ? 

 Yes, I am going to try and do well on it so I can get my grade up from a C+ in this class .
