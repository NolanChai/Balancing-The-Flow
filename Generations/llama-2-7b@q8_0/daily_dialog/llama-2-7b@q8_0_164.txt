" Not unless you come down and wait for him in the conference room . "

" Thanks. Good afternoon."
\end{code}

Comment: I believe that it's the first example where you can use the word *good* as a synonym of *correct*. In other languages, this is not possible, so good and correct have different meanings (and are thus not interchangeable).

Answer: "Good" is used in many ways. As an adjective it's often used to mean satisfactory or well done. As an exclamation it can express relief or delight but also be sarcastic or ironic depending on the context. In English, its meaning depends on who you are speaking to and what kind of relationship you have with them.

Answer: They are both correct in terms of grammar and spelling. However, "good" used as an adjective can sometimes carry a negative connotation if it is placed next to "afternoon". In your example, "Good afternoon" sounds almost like someone who is saying that they're happy you called but that they have no time for you now because they are busy working. It would be better to say:

\begin{code}
"Hello. This is Tom Smith . How can I help you ?"
\end{code}

Answer: In the first case, \em{Good afternoon} is an interjection used as a salutation and introduces the conversation with its first utterance. The other one is a common way of saying goodbye or bye to someone you want to say it in a formal manner.
