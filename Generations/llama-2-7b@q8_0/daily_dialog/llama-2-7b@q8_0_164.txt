No . I don't have a time for him .

 May I leave my name and number? 

Sure . But can I ask how urgent it is ? 

Oh , it's pretty urgent . 

Okay . You do know that his secretary has a very good memory, don't you ?

Oh , yes!

You could leave him a message but that may not be the best approach because of the lengthy time it will take for him to return your call . If you prefer, you may email him at tom.smith@company.com . He'll see it as soon as he gets back on Wednesday . 

 How long has Tom Smith worked with company ? 

 I believe it is approximately two years now . 

 Where does Tom Smith work exactly? 

 He works in the finance department but if you want to ask him anything about a specific area, he's definitely the person to speak with . 

 I'm sure we can arrange something for you and Tom Smith to meet up at some point during the next week . Would tomorrow be convenient ? 

 I don't believe that would work because we have a lot of client appointments scheduled tomorrow so it would probably be best if he was available after 3 pm . How about Tuesday? 

 That sounds great to me . What time is good for you on Tuesday ? 

 Well, I'm quite flexible . If you want to meet earlier in the day, I believe we have some free hours at around noon or if it would be better to arrange something after work that's fine too. 

 Would a lunch meeting be ok then? 

 Noon is great . Thank you . Do you know what Tom Smith does for fun ? 

 He loves traveling and cooking . 

 We're having dinner with his family on Sunday and he told me he's going to try out a new recipe that evening. It should be fun! 

 How long have you known Tom Smith? 

 I first met him when we were in high school together and we've been friends ever since . We're both very close to our families so we always make an effort to get together with them as often as possible. 

 I'm sure it will be a great night . Have fun!

 It will be better for him if he gets your e-mail first . That way, he can decide when to call you back.

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Yes, he does . 

 Great ! I'll be in touch with him as soon as possible ! Bye now .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 Bye bye !
