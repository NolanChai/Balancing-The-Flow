" Sorry , we have no more seat on this plane . And it's an international flight with limited number of seats ."

" Can you check again if there is another one ? "

" You can come to the airport later . Maybe then we still have some seat."

" But I must get out today . Well , how about a different flight tomorrow ? "

" Sorry . We don't operate this flight any more now . It's not available at all anymore . "

" Can you recommend me another flight company then ? I want to go home."

" But it'll cost you much higher and much longer time if you need to take the train or car , but the only way is by airplane ."

" You can also book a ticket online at our website . We provide free of charge 24 hours customer services on it . "

" Thanks . I have to hang up now . Bye ! "
