" I am going to tell you something which is important . "

" What? . "

" Be careful of whom you marry . The person you love , love can destroy you. "

" And so? . "

" If they don't destroy each other,they will break up and divorce . "

" I agree with your opinion , but the divorced people who get married again have a lot of happiness . "

" Happiness? How do you know that? Maybe she is happier without him. "

" They say they are happier without him, but in truth, they aren't happy because their love has died and so has their passion . "

" What I don't understand is what's the problem? If it doesn't work out for them , there will be another girl waiting to replace her . "

" So you think that when one fails, he should immediately start a new relationship. That shows that you don't know much about love . "

" You're right . Love is a great thing but also the worst feeling in the world for those who are left . "

" What if they don't love each other? . "

" That's another story. I hope to never be in that situation because that would mean that there was something wrong with me. "

" Not necessarily, sometimes it can happen accidentally or by chance . "

" How is that possible ? . "

" We have a lot of things in common , we are similar , our values are the same and so on . But if one day , we realize that we don't love each other anymore, then I guess it would be better for us to break up . "

" I agree with you . If they can't love each other,they have no reason to be together . "

" What matters the most is whether you are in love or not , that's what counts because love makes the marriage. Love is the only thing that really connects a married couple . "

" Love makes people stay together but it also makes them leave each other . "

" You don't know how to be in love and I hope you never have to learn . "

" Why? What will happen to me if I am not lucky enough to find that special person who is supposed to make my life happy ? . "

" We all deserve happiness . If you find the one , it won't matter what else you don't get because your heart and soul are already taken care of. You can have anything in this world as long as you have the right person by your side. "

" That is true, but if we really love someone, why would they break our hearts? . "

" Because people change, that's all there is to it . "

" People are not like cars or houses . They can't be sold because they don't have an expiration date. You have a lot of years ahead of you , and I hope you find the perfect person to spend them with. "

" There will come a day when we will all understand that love is more than just a feeling or words, but it also has another dimension in which our heart is what really counts. The other thing is not important because even if it breaks up , there will always be a next time . I hope you can find happiness sometime soon and believe me when I say this: I have been waiting for mine and she's worth every minute of the pain I endured before meeting her. "

" Thanks, I hope to meet hers as well because what matters is that we both love each other . "

" That is true but if it doesn't work out for us, at least we will have tried and lived happily ever after. "
