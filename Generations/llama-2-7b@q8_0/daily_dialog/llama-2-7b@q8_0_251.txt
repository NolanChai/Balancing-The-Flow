" What did you do at nights ? "

" We went to a restaurant that offered all you can eat food, and drinks. I had the roast beef, potatoes and vegetables, my wife had the fish and chips."

" Did you have dessert? "

" Yes we did ! "

" What did you have ? "

" She had apple pie and ice cream, and I had cheesecake . "

" Did you enjoy it ? "

" They were out of apples so she only had a slice of pie. When I saw the baked Alaska being served at the dessert table I just had to have some , so I gave her the rest of my pie You would not believe how much food was on that place setting . There was pies, vegetables, meats, fish and chips, breads"

" It sounds as if you enjoyed yourself "

"It sure did. They wouldn't let us leave until we cleaned our plates "
