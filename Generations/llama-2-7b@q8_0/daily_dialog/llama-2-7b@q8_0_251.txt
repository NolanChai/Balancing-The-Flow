It was okay, but I hate flying ! 

I would have liked to see more of New York City , but we didn't have time for that. 

We stayed in a great hotel and went out every night. 

What did you learn from the course ?

It helped me understand what makes a company successful . 

It was difficult because I had to travel so much, but it was worth it. 

It was very good , except for one thing ... 

I don't remember that part of the lesson at all !

Have you ever been on a business trip ?

Yes, twice . 

No - my company doesn't send us anywhere . 

Yes , I went to New York City last year for a week. 

I live in New York City .
