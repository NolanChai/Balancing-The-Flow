" Good morning, sir. Here is your new project assignment . I've sent you the details , along with an outline on how to proceed . If you have any questions or need assistance, please let me know . "

" What do you want ? "

" What if I told you that there were some people in here right now who would be happy to help you ? "

" You're wasting your time with him. He won't listen . "

" Sir, if we don't make an effort to change things , nothing will improve. We must always keep trying . "

" Thank you for the compliment, sir."

" How can I help ? "

" Is there anything I can do to be of assistance ? "

" How much does this weigh ? "

" Oh my goodness! It is twice as heavy as it looks ! "

" That's OK. You are only a few minutes away from our next destination . "

" Thank you for pointing that out to me."

" That's quite all right , sir. I've got this under control."
