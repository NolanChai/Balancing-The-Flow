Could we switch off on that one ?  

 Can I ask what time it is ? 

 You're the only person who doesn't know how to use your phone. 

 So you think it will rain this afternoon ?

 Yes, my prediction is based on the latest weather report . 

 There are many reports predicting that there will be a hurricane in Florida this weekend . 

 Do you want me to cancel our dinner plans ?

 I'm sorry , but I have a date with someone else. 

 It's not fair . We agreed on Wednesday ! 

 I can't make it for tomorrow, how about Sunday afternoon instead? 

 Yeah , that will work fine . See you then! 

 Is everything okay ? You seem distracted this morning . 

 Sure thing . Sorry if I came off as rude before. 

 Don't worry about it ! 

 Do you want me to reschedule your next meeting with the boss?

 No , it's fine for now. 

 Okay, we will keep it at this time then .  

 Good night. 

 What are you doing tomorrow ? 

 I'm free until two o'clock in the afternoon. After that I have to take my kids to soccer practice. 

 I would like to go out with some friends tonight, if it is not too late. 

 Okay . We can meet at ten tomorrow morning ?  

 Yes , sounds good!

 Have a nice evening ! 

 See you then ! 

 Have a nice day ! 

 Bye-bye !
