" If I might express myself at this moment  , and without any desire to be impertinent, there are some things which one does not think or even dare say when with a lady . But it is my opinion that life is composed of a series of changes in the structure of matter  . And when these changes come to an end, we become nothing more than what our eyes see. "

" Really ? "

" Yes , madame ! and I shall not give up this theory for anything in the world . If I were to speak out of turn it would be because I cannot help seeing that my young lady  has a beautiful soul , a soul capable of feeling and understanding everything. And I cannot conceal from myself the fact that this is precisely what makes life so interesting  "

" Thank you ! thank you for your compliment . But you have said something quite true . For there are some things which one does not say when with a man ."

" What things ? "

" I cannot say everything. But tell me, sir , what is death ? "

" Death ! Death  ! How can we talk about it  . It is a question to which I am sure that you will be able to give a better answer than me . You see all things are changing . And the great mystery of life and of death lies in that fact. "

" Really ? "

" Yes, my young lady ! when we talk about death we must always remember one thing  : that no change can ever bring about any new form of matter. Thus nothing dies except that which has no longer anything to live upon . So death is nothing but the cessation of all life . If you knew how beautiful a thought this is, you would never be unhappy again . "

" But we are happy , sir ! "

" Yes, my young lady ; and perhaps you may find it so even when I am dead  "

" You will not die like an animal. You are too great to die like that . "

" Thank you for your beautiful words ! but I really do believe in my soul that I shall be dead in a few days, and I think also that all men must die . Life is only the sum of a number of changes , and these changes bring about death. When we have no longer anything to live upon, when nothing remains to us of what our eyes see, then it is death  "

" And do you know why ? "

" Yes, my young lady ! because everything that exists must come to an end . You may perhaps remember the story of a man who, having been lost at sea for many months, came ashore on an island, where he lived happily and peacefully for some time. But after a few years had elapsed he became melancholy ; his heart was no longer contented with the simple pleasures of life ; and one day , when he had forgotten himself , he leaped from a cliff into the sea . "

" And you believe that we shall come to an end like that ? "

" Yes, madame . It is only by changes in our own being that we become what we are  "

" Well ! I am quite willing. But please do not talk about death . I should rather not hear it . "

" You wish me to be silent  "

" No sir ; you must be silent because you cannot say anything else . But please go away now . If I were to ask you to stay here, my eyes would weep ! "

" Madame , I am only too happy to obey your wishes . Perhaps some day you will remember me  "

" Yes, sir ; but never think that you have been very kind to me or that you have done me any service . "

" As if it were necessary for me to be paid for doing what I did ! "

" But as we are speaking of payment and services , allow me to pay a small debt of gratitude which I owe you  "

He took his hat off, bowed low, and left the room. The girl went back to her reading ; but soon afterwards she threw down the book and began crying . Then she leaped from her chair, tore her dress as if it were made of paper , ran with wild haste into a room near by, and locked herself in for fear of being seen .

XII.

" If one could only be alone ! "

The girl spent the whole day weeping and crying so violently that she could hardly breathe. At length her mother came to see if she were ill. She found her lying on her bed, still as a statue, with her eyes fixed upon the wall. It seemed as though she had been stricken dumb .

" My daughter ! " said the mother, who was quite upset ; " my poor child  ! I am afraid that you are not well . "

The girl started up quickly and began to laugh wildly . Then she spoke .

" Mother , I have seen death . "

XIII.

" My dear daughter ! " said the mother. " Is there anything in all this strange behaviour ? Do tell me what it is that you are talking about  "

" Mother ; if you knew what had happened to-day, and how the whole world has been turned upside down , and everything changed round again . Oh ! I cannot say it  "

" But why should your heart be so troubled ? What have you seen or heard  ? "

" Ah ! mother ! if you knew ! if you only knew . And yet, perhaps, no one could explain it better than myself. It is very difficult to tell all that I feel and what passes through my mind , but I must do what I can . I shall begin from the beginning . The first time that I ever saw anything was when I had just been born . At least , I think so ; because as a rule people cannot see things at once. But perhaps I may be mistaken . Perhaps it all began with the moon  . And now listen, mother ! Listen to my story . "

" Well ! tell me your story . I am listening . "

XIV.

The girl was silent for some time , as if she were thinking of what she should say ; then she began :

" Mother, when I first opened my eyes I saw nothing but darkness and mist; and all this made me cry very much . Then my mother came into the room where I lay  and put her arms round me. But at that moment a terrible storm burst in upon us with such violence that we were afraid it would blow away the roof of our house. My father, who was a sailor , took up his arms and ran out into the night . Then I heard him crying bitterly; and I had never seen him so sad before. He called me by name several times as if he knew that I could hear him ; but all my tears were useless . As soon as the storm passed away, I was still lying on my bed and seemed to be looking up into the sky. But there was no moon  and nothing else above me except a dark cloud which covered the whole of heaven . My mother had been in great trouble about my father ; and at length she fell into an anxious sleep, with her head resting upon her arms . As soon as she woke I asked her where my father was , and what it was that made him cry so much. But when I asked these questions it seemed to me as if all the world had fallen on my head, and I began to feel dreadfully frightened  "

" What ! how dreadful . "

" Yes ; for at first my mother could not tell me anything , but after a time she told me that she did not know where my father was ; and this made me very unhappy indeed. At length, when I had been in the world for several days, one evening it seemed to me as if all my little teeth fell out of my head; but though I felt so ill that I could hardly breathe , my mother did not seem at all alarmed . However, soon after she gave me some wine mixed with sugar and honey ; which made me feel a good deal better. In the middle of the night I began to see things around me in quite a strange way, but when I tried to tell my mother about them they disappeared as if by magic . She began to cry bitterly , and I think that she would have gone out of her mind if it had not been for an old woman who lived near us. When morning came , I began to feel much better ; and after a little time, when the sun was high in the heavens, I saw my father returning home. He came in with his arms full of beautiful things which he held out towards me . But as soon as I took them from him my mother became angry and cried bitterly again because they had been given to me ; so I thought no more about these things until another time  "

" This is very strange ! " said the mother. " Go on with your story , however."

XV.

" After a while , when I was able to look around me , I began to notice all kinds of strange objects in my room . The first thing that struck me was an image of our Lord, and after it came two great lamps made out of gold . Whenever I looked at them the sun seemed to be rising ; but when they were removed from my sight they disappeared as if by enchantment. Then there were some very large bags which contained all kinds of food that we
