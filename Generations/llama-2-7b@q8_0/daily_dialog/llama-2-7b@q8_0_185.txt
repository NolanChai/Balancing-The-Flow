What are your next plans after finishing that project ? 

 I hope to go on a vacation trip. Maybe to Europe or Asia. I would like to see how people live there . How they do business, etc... 

 Are you going alone or with somebody ? 

 Yes , I think I will be traveling solo. My wife doesn't have enough time for such a long trip . 

 Do you know what you are planning on doing in Europe ? 

 Well , first of all, I am going to visit Italy and France, the most beautiful countries there. Then maybe I will go further to Spain or Germany ... Who knows !? 

 Did you enjoy your previous vacations ? 

 Yes . It was always fun traveling and seeing new places and meeting new people ! 

 What is your favorite place that you have been to so far ? 

 Oh , there are many ! But I think I had the best time in Italy, especially in Venice ... The water canals are incredible. 

 How was the trip organized ? 

 Well , we arrived first in Rome and then we continued by car to Florence . Then we went up north again, to Venice. That is a very beautiful town, and I will never forget how we walked all over it... 

 Was there any other tourists around you? 

 Yes , lots of them ! Tour groups are the worst thing when traveling abroad ! The guide always has his hands full, so people often run into eachother in narrow streets. That is just plain dangerous! 

What was your most interesting experience while travelling ?

I have seen a lot of things during my many journeys ... One of the best experiences I had , however , was when I travelled around China with some friends . It is a very interesting country, full of contrasts. We stayed in several big cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but we also spent some days in small villages where people still use bamboo instead of cars ! 

What are your plans after retirement? Do you want to travel again ?

Well , I don't know yet . At the moment I am concentrated on finishing my last project. After that it will be time for a real vacation ... And maybe some travelling too! Who knows...
