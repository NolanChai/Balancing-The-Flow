I don’ t know what that service guide is but it sounds like a book with lots of information.

It took him forever to finish writing this book because he had to spend so much time working on it, even though he worked overtime, and sometimes worked all night long. But now, at last, he can put the book down. He has finished! No more work for him !

He tells me he’ s happy that he can finish this writing job and move on to something else. He offers me a cup of coffee. It is very kind of him but I don’ t want any right now because it would make my mouth too dry, especially after all the water I drank while jogging earlier today.
