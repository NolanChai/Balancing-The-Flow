Yes, it may be so. They are young and very restless now . 

 I have been teaching them all by myself since their birth . 

 Yes , but still you must have a tutor for them to teach them what they need in life . 

 My wife has been taking care of our children all the while . 

 But she may not be able to provide them with good education as she is very busy now . 

 I am sorry for her , but still you are right that my children must have a tutor for their studies . 

 Who will it be? 

 We shall look around in this week and hire the best tutor for our children's studies . 

 What do you think of it ? 

 I am sure they would benefit from his teaching . 

 Do you agree to that ? 

 Yes , but we should not spend a lot on him as he is just a teacher and there are other expenses too . 

 That's right, but if the tutor is good, then I am sure our children would benefit from his teaching. 

 What do you say? 

 I agree to your viewpoint . 

 Yes, let's hire him now and start their studies .
