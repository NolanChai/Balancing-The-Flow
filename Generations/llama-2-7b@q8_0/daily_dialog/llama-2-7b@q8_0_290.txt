This was a good suggestion. And the next day, after school , I did it in front of all my children . It worked well ; they were quiet and obedient when I talked to them or scolded them . Even if they had some difficulties , they were patient and listened to me carefully . Soon they began to be interested in what I said. I never shouted at them. Whenever a child did something wrong, I would use my hands as if clapping in order to draw attention ; then I said, “Look here! ” and pointed out the child ’ s mistake.
I have been practicing this way for some time . My children are very much interested in what I say, even though they don’t understand everything ; they will ask me questions. So we can communicate with each other easily. They are becoming more and more patient when listening to me . Sometimes we even talk together about the things that interest them .
I have a habit of clapping my hands when something good happens . It is also important for the children to know what is going on . If I am not there, they will do it by themselves. As time goes by , they are getting better and better at it ; even when no one claps, they keep doing it .
When you speak with your child about something he or she likes, try using this method : 1 ) Use your hands to attract the child ’ s attention. (This is not the same as shouting.) 2 ) Point out what you want your child to notice by using a particular gesture or expression of voice .
If you follow these steps, I think you will find it easy to teach and learn from each other.
