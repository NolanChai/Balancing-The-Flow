Well . I think you need to be able to write well , have good English knowledge as well as computer skills . You must know how to work with Microsoft Office and other applications . 

 How much does the salary vary ? 

 Well , there are different positions that require different levels of education and experience . So it varies from position to position but I can tell you for example a secretary's job starts at £7.50 per hour and it can go up to about £20 depending on your skills and knowledge . 

 Thank you for the information ! Have a nice day ! Bye !
