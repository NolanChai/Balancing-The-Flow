It ’ s Sally Jones . 

 Thank you . 

 Sally. How long have you been planning this trip ? 

 Since April . 

 Thank you, that helps me understand why you might prefer the August departure date . I see here in your record that you paid a $50 change fee on July 2 to change your reservation from July 19 to July 23 . That ’ s nonrefundable , so it will not be credited toward the new reservation . Your credit card number is on file and I have charged the difference in fare .

 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 

 No . Thank you. I appreciate your help .

W - a-n-g . 

 Is that w – a- n – g or w-a-n-g ? 

 Well , I ’ m sorry . But it looks like the system can ’ t recognize this name because there is no record for this person on our reservation system. And the system requires me to know your exact spelling of your first and last name before I can cancel a flight for you . So please spell it again with the correct English pronunciation . 

 OK , my name is Judy Wang . 

 Please spell it . 

 W – a-n -d-y . W-A-N-D-Y. 

 And what ’ s your last name ? 

 W-a-g-n-e-r . 

 Thank you , Ms Wang . You just confirmed your reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . This will be a non -stop flight and is scheduled to arrive in Minneapolis at 2 pm local time on July 19. 

 OK , thank you . 

 Bye .

Do I understand that correctly, Mr Wang ? 

 Yes , you do . 

 You ’ re sure there won ’ t be an additional charge to cancel the trip and re-book it on another date ? 

 No . There would not be . 

 Great ! Thank you very much for your help . I will call back if I have any further questions .

Thank you very much for your help.
