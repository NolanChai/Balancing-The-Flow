1 day less , because Tokyo is east of London. 

Which country has the biggest population in Europe?

It's a small town and a big town ?

8 hours earlier , it means at what time ? 

 At 20:00 local time in Japan it is 6:00 am (local) in England. 

 When I went to London two years ago , I got there early in the morning on May 31 and returned to Tokyo late at night on June 1 . How many hours apart are they ? 

 They were separated by one day. It means that you arrived in London at around 8:00 am on May 31, and left for home at about 9:00 pm of the same day. 

 But I did not leave Tokyo until June 1 . How can there be a day difference if I was not gone yet ? 

 In this case , you were in England from one day to another day because it was morning on May 31 and evening on June 1 when you arrived and left.
