Yeah , sounds like fun . I can't wait to eat some good Chinese ! What kind of place do you like ? 

I dunno. They always seem the same, don't they? 

You know, I like them all different and I find it hard to choose. How about you ? 

I just like a really big plate of chow mein with egg-rolls . My favorite restaurant is in Flushing , but they're pretty far away from here , so we don't go too often. What do you like ? 

Honestly, I don't care if it's good or bad as long as the food tastes good . They're all the same to me . I guess that means I just like Chinese food in general , not any particular restaurant . You know what else I love? The egg-rolls at this place. They're so crispy and have a spicy filling inside . 

Yeah, they do look pretty good ! And the chow mein is always cooked right too . We need to go sometime , before winter hits ! It'll be hard to enjoy take-out food then because of the cold weather . What time were you thinking ? 

How about six o'clock? That sounds like a great idea for a dinner date . I really want some egg-rolls , and that place has good soup too . So what are we having afterward ? 

I don't know if I feel up to watching the news tonight. Let me check with you tomorrow night . Bye !

Sounds good . What about a movie ? There are some good movies playing today . 

 I don't know . How much is it ? 

 It isn't that bad , but still ... Well , let me take a look at my calendar and call for tickets. Do you have any other plans for the weekend ? I mean , do you want to go anywhere special on Sunday ? 

 Well, I was hoping to spend time with my family , maybe go out on Saturday night . What about you ? Any plans ? 

 Not really . But if you can't decide what to do ... How about a picnic at the park ? There are several places around here that are pretty good . Do you want to get your camera ? I know they have some nice scenery in the mountains nearby . Maybe we could take a long walk and go swimming .

Let ' s go there today . It might be fun to see how much food we can eat at one time . 

 Okay . I want to try it myself . 

 Alright then , let us decide later ... Do you need anything else ? 

 No thank-you . 

 That's okay ! You're welcome back anytime !!
