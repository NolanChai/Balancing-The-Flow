" That sounds good . Do you think we should order an appetizer ? We're going to get so full that it might be difficult for us to eat again tonight . "

" Maybe not . But I don't really want to go back home , and I do need a snack before bedtime ! "

" Well, I'd rather not try something so big tonight ... Maybe we could go to that Italian restaurant across town . They serve the best food in this area , and they always have a lot of customers. It's also very cheap . "

" But isn't it rather noisy there ? We won't be able to hear ourselves talk . "

" I like it loud . If you can't hear what's going on around you, then you won't know if anything is happening to the people in the next room ... Let's go ! "
