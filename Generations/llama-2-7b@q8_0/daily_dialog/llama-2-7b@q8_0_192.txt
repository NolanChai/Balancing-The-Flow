We could look at their home page and see if they have anything cool or interesting going on there. 

 I would have thought that we could learn something from all those new technologies out there that they're using in their marketing materials ... 

 Maybe we can find out who designed the site , and then we can look at some of his other work . 

 They could even be our competitor ; I don't see anything wrong with that. 

 Maybe a fresh perspective on how they approach design would inspire us to come up with something great ! 

 Let me know when you find someone. I'll do the same thing.
