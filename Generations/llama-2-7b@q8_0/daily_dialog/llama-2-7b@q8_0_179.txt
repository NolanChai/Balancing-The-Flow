It closes at 8:00 PM . 

 Why do you go so late ? 

 Well , because there is no other time for shopping . 

 What time is your meeting with Ms. Jones ?  

 I'm not sure . She said it was around lunchtime . 

 But we can't leave the office before 2:00 PM . 

 We will be late if we go there at that time . 

 Ok , let me tell her about your problem . 

 The meeting has already taken place. 

 How did it go ?  

 Well , I think she's going to give us a discount on the goods. 

 Thank you, Jeff . 

 You are welcome . 

 Have a nice day !

[Warning: Short generation] 

 I don't have time tonight . 

 All right then . 

 See you tomorrow.

I don't know . I haven't decided yet . Let's sit on the couch for a while . Do you mind watching TV ? 

 Not at all . I enjoy watching TV with you , Jeff !

### Dialogue 2:

It's so cold outside.I don't know what to do.Can we go for a walk?

Sure,let’s go!How about Starbucks?

Okay.I really need a cup of coffee now.

Me too.It has been freezing all day.

You want hot chocolate instead?

Nope.I hate hot chocolate.

Hey,why don't we watch movies at home instead?

Great idea!Let's rent one!

Great choice!Do you prefer DVD or Blu-ray disc?

I think it’s better to go with the latest technology.Blu-ray all the way!

You're right,Blu-ray is more advanced.

She lives in Boston but she has business here so she flies over on Friday afternoon . It's nice to see her . 

 Do you like living alone? 

 Actually, I prefer it . I like my privacy and quiet . But there are also days when I really want to have someone to talk to . 

 Oh , do you ? 

 Yes , I'd rather not be talking about myself all the time . 

 Do you have any plans for tonight ? 

 No, not really . We could go out for a drink if you want ? 

 Ok . Sounds good . See you soon then. 

 Bye!

Since July of this year . 

 Is she married ? 

 No , she's single . 

 I see . Do you like her ? 

 Yes . She is my favorite sister . 

 Why ? 

 She is very nice to me and funny too . 

 What does she do for a living ? 

 She has been a lawyer at a big law firm in San Francisco since June . 

 What kind of cases did she work on there ? 

 Criminal , civil, immigration and bankruptcy cases . 

 Has she ever worked with any famous people ? 

 Yes . I have met quite a few of them . 

 How many times has she been married ? 

 Three . The last one was very bad . She lost all her money in the divorce settlement and had to move back home to live with my parents . 

 That's too bad ! 

 Yeah , it is too bad . But she will be able to take care of herself soon . I think she has a good job now . 

 How long does her new job last ? 

 It looks like it will go on for a few years at least . 

 Where does she live in San Francisco ? 

 In an expensive area . 

 I see . Well , we have talked enough about my sister . What do you want to talk about now ?

She lived in Dallas Texas but we don't get to see her very often because the air fare is so expensive and it takes us a lot of time to drive to California . We like our time together better when we can just fly there for a visit . 

 Do you think she will come here this summer ? 

 Maybe , I hope so . I haven't been out West since last spring . It's such an interesting area with lots of different kinds of people and places to go . 

 Yes, it is . Whenever you visit California we are always busy . There is so much to do there that the days just fly by.

I guess I'll see you tomorrow then ?

Yes , See you then . Good night .
