" Yes. I'm really sorry . I was in a hurry to meet you before . And, I just forgot."

"That's okay . I understand how busy you are . "

" Really ?"

"Yes . You know , I think about that day everyday . It'll be soon now. "

" Oh , That's so exciting !"

" I think we should have a picnic in the park . It will be fun . "

" Okay, let's go ! "

" She lives in the city of New York . "

" I don't know anything about New York . What kind of place is it like ? "

" I think you will like it . It has lots of shops and a lot of tall buildings , but it isn't very clean . "

" Where do you live in this city ? "

" In the town of Chatham . "

" Oh, that's pretty close to me . I live in Madison . Do you like living there ? "

" Yes, I like it a lot . It's a very small community and the people are really friendly . "

" How many years have you lived in Chatham ? "

" Oh , 8 years or so . "

" Are you going to stay here for a while longer ? "

" Yes, I think so . At least until my sister goes back to her home town in Florida . "

" Well , I think it's been more than two years now . We used to live in the same house together when we were little, but she moved out five or six years ago . "

" How does she support herself ? "

" She works as a secretary . Her boss is an Italian who lives here in the neighborhood , so they go out quite often for dinner and stuff like that . He's single too . "

" What did you say her name was again ? "

" Her name is Jane . "

" Oh , yeah, I think I remember . "

" You know what else I think about your sister ? I'm not sure if it's because she lives in San Francisco , but she has the most beautiful legs ! I bet that guy who's her boss would love to get his hands on them ! "

" Yeah, maybe . She hasn't been back here for a long time though . I don't think he knows about it yet . "

" You mean she's never told him ? "

" I don't know , but she doesn't want to see any of our other relatives either . "

" Oh well, I hope you guys get married someday and live happily ever after ! "

" I don't remember . "

" Doesn't it seem strange to you that your sister has been living in San Francisco for 10 years and you don't know where she lived before that ? "

" That is strange . But she wasn't here when we were kids so I never talked with her about anything then . We moved away from home and went to college together . She was born in California but our parents moved us all around the United States during her childhood . So she spent most of her life in other states . "

" I see what you mean . Do your friends ever ask you why you don't know more about your sister ? "

" No , they never do that . "
