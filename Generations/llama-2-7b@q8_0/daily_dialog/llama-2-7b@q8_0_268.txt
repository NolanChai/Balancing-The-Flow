" Oh ! You can just use a simple white card with your name and phone number on it , then no one will know you work at the bank or not . I don ’ t think they need a fancy business card anyway . "

" Well, that is a different story . People always want to promote their personal brands and be known in the circle of business world , so everyone should have his own card as part of professional image . But some people do work at big corporations which already has its own standard design . I guess it would not look good if they try to put their own brand on that card . "

" For me, it is a bit different from the idea you ’ ve just expressed . As for me , there are some people who really love and want to have their own business cards and use them when they go through business trips or workshops or networking events or job interviews . Those kinds of occasions always call for such kind of special cards, which is not only a way to promote personal brand but also a way to make good impression on others . "

" I see your point ! But I think it takes more than just the design and quality of card , in fact , the contents are as important as the form . If you ’ re an illustrator, then you must put some interesting designs or illustrations on it . "

" That is so true . Even if a card has the best design of all , but nobody can read it due to its small size and complicated words , that will be useless . A good business card should be concise yet informative, easy to understand while showing personal style , at the same time it should be large enough for people to notice easily . "

" I totally agree with you . To attract attention , a card should have strong visual impact which makes an image of yourself in one glance . There are some simple designs with few words and colorful backgrounds that can show your personality while also easy to read at first sight . But there is another way too , like using pictures or illustrations as the main contents on cards . It looks very interesting but sometimes it only works for a certain group of people who love them . I still prefer concise text with clear information written in a simple way that is not hard to understand for all people no matter what their backgrounds are . "

" Yes, business card designers should also think about how they can use space to the best advantage. The size of card doesn ’ t always have to be standardized , you may also try some interesting folding and see if it looks good or not . But there is a common sense that every person wants to have something large enough for easy reading and no one likes to receive a very small business card with unreadable words . "

" I think there are many ways to make a design look special but all of them should be well-planned, such as the size, color, images and text on cards . A good example is the artist who makes his own designs , like those crazy paintings with colors everywhere and some words or sentences written in different styles . The same thing can also happen to a business card . But the key is that everything should look organized yet not dull or boring, which I think we have been discussed earlier . "

" That ’ s right . Some people might use pictures of their favorite characters instead of text information about themselves , some may write short sentences only while some will use special fonts to show their own style . But the most important thing is that everything on cards should be organized in a way so it looks clear and easy to understand for others without any effort needed from them . "

" I like using pictures of my favorite cartoon characters . That makes my business card unique and people can notice me easily even if they do not have much time to read everything about me . Of course, it also depends on how I design the layout , so sometimes a picture or a character only takes up a part of space and other information is displayed in different ways such as using colors , size or typeface etc. "

" Yes ! Pictures can be used in many different ways to make your card look special . There are some people who love their pets so much that they put their pictures on business cards instead of writing words about themselves . Some might want something simple but with a colorful background which looks good from distance . I think the key is choosing what you like and putting it all together in an organized way . "

" Well, my advice for people who want to design their own cards would be to just try some different things , such as using pictures instead of text information about yourself or combining colors with images which make them look very unique but still readable from distance . A good example is a card that has only one picture and no words at all , but it will definitely catch people ’ s eyes because they can see what you do easily without even reading anything else on your cards . "

" That sounds like a great idea ! But I think there should be some basic things about business cards which everyone needs to keep in mind before creating any design, such as choosing the best size for your card (the standard is 3.5×2 inch) , making sure it ’ s not too small or large and also picking out colors that go well with each other . Another thing you need to consider when planning how you will use space on a business card is what information you want to put in each section of the card so everything fits together nicely without taking up too much room. "

" Yes, those are very important points . But there is still another aspect which many people forget about – it ’ s all about style ! It ’ s true that some designs might look better than others but at the end of the day , if you don ’ t put enough effort into making your card attractive and interesting to look at then no one will even notice what you have written on there . So my advice is just make sure everything looks good before sending out any cards ! "

" That ’ s true too ;-). But I think it ’ s more than just about the way things look , for example, some people like to use funny or strange images as their business card design instead of traditional ones . If you want something unique then maybe that would work better for you , but again make sure everything is well organized before sending anything out ! "

" That ’ s another great point ! I think many people don’t realize just how important it is to have a professional-looking business card design which reflects your personal style and makes others want to learn more about what you do . If you don’t put enough thought into this then no one will care about reading anything else on there , so make sure everything looks good ! "

" Well, I think we ’ ve talked about many things here today regarding business cards so now it ’ s time for me to wrap up our conversation by sharing with you some tips which might help if you want to create your own design . So let’s just say – keep in mind that there are no rules when it comes down to creating something original , but at least make sure everything looks good before sending anything out ! "

" Thank you so much for this amazing advice ! I have learned a lot today and now I feel like I know how to create my own design . It seems like we still have some more things left on the table though, such as what color would be best for using in business cards or should there even be any pictures at all ? "

" Yes , you are right ! But don’t worry because these are just simple questions that can easily be answered with a little bit of research . All we need to do is find out the answer by ourselves and then write about it on our websites ! If anyone wants to know more information on how to create business cards then I suggest checking out my blog post from last week which talks all about this topic , but if they want something specific then maybe that would be best left up for someone else . "

" Okay, well thanks again for everything and I ’ m sure we will talk soon ! "
