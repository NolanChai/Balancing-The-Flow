I am sure many people would like to get such cards for themselves . I may have one , but unfortunately, my name is not written in Japanese.

 You should make one too , then . We can exchange each other's business cards . 

 That is true ! The design of it is very beautiful and unique . It looks like the designer has much experience in graphic design . I think he is a talented person . He may have even taught art lessons at schools or universities , or worked as an illustrator for magazines .

 Yes, I think so too . His name is written in his own handwriting . The way of writing the name is very unique and distinctive , just like his work. 

 I am not sure if it is a calligraphy style used by many Japanese people or something else that he made up himself . It seems to be a mixture between those two . If you ask me, I would say this is an original one of a kind .

 Yes , it is not hard for him to make an illustration like that . But why is his name written in such a different way ? He could have just used any other type of font and calligraphy styles from the book or on the internet . 

 I think he wants his name to be more special and distinctive than those plain fonts we can find anywhere . I also believe it will be easier for him to draw such a unique design when writing down his name , than using the same style as others use.
