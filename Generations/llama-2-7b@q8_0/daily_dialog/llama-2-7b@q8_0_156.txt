What is it ? 

 The L / C number . 

 Right . Are you sure this is the right name and address ? 

 We do have an inbound receipt of proceeds under Felix Wasserman Associates , but they are listed as 'Felix Wasserman Associates , Inc .' . It might be the same company ; I just don't know for certain . If you could check your records . 

 Yes , I can do that . Are you there ? 

 Yes , it is definitely the right name and address . 

 Thanks very much . 

 Good day ! Have a good afternoon.
