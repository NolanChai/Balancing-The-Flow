Well , your idea sounds good . However , I think we should start by forming a blues group . What do you say ? 

 Uh … Sorry ! 

 Well , in my opinion , the guitar is not the right instrument for a drummer. It ’ s better to play the bass . 

 Ok, but there are no musicians to form a blues band around here ... So I have to search for one. 

 Sure, you can try to find someone who plays guitar and drums at the same time … That would be perfect ! But , I ’ m not sure that they exist in your neighborhood .

 Maybe it’s better to look for a bass player ? 

 And , what about the piano ? Don’t you think we should have a good keyboardist ? 

 We could also sing and write our own songs ! 

 I don ’ t know much about singing. But if I can play drums ... I could be a good drummer .

 You need to practice more with your band . Otherwise, it won’t sound good .

 It looks like you have all the necessary instruments to make music together … 

 But , before forming our group , let ’ s decide on our name !

 Ok ! I ’ ll leave this decision to you … 

 But don ’ t forget that we should practice every day.

I did ! And it was exactly because I like rock music that I want to play the drums in your band . I think you need a drummer so that I could join the group . 

 What do you know about bands? Do you already have one idea for the name of your band ? 

 No , nothing yet . Aside from myself and the guitar player , no one else has an instrument to play. Besides, we still need a bassist and a singer. We would have more options if at least one of us was able to sing . 

 So , you don ’ t know what kind of music you ’ ll be making ? What are your thoughts for the name? 

 Well ... The guitar player came up with this name : " Guns and Roses " . I guess it ’ s a bit long for a band name , but it fits perfectly because we have some heavy metal influences. 

 What is your favorite kind of music? Do you listen to any bands right now ? 

 I like a lot of kinds of music, from classic rock to punk and grunge . For the time being, my favorites are the Red Hot Chili Peppers , System Of A Down , and Mötley Crüe. 

 Can ’ t you come up with something better than Guns and Roses ? 

 I don ’ t know ! It was just an idea that came to mind . I really don ’ t care about the name as long as it sounds good when we play together for the first time .

[Warning: Short generation] 

 It ’ S already arranged for us to meet up there next Sunday . See you then !
