" I can sing as well ... But I don’t know if I ’ d really fit in. It would be much better for you if a real rock singer came along . "

" Aaah ! That ’ s where the problem is. We still haven ’ t found anyone to sing . You are young and pretty ; perhaps, you could do it ? "

" But I don ’ t know anything about music . "

" Don ’ t worry. With your personality , you won ’ t have any problems. Just learn the songs that we ’ ll write together in a few months . It ’ s an opportunity for you to become famous ! "

" Uh ... Surely, I will give it my best shot ! But do me a favour ; tell me if I really suck or not. If you don’t like what you hear , then we can always get someone else to replace me. How ’ s that ? "

" Wait ! I don ’ t know the words yet . How will I sing them ? "

" That doesn ’ t matter ; we just need to practice together and get to know each other better , okay ? "

" Okay … "

You are talking with your new neighbor. She wants to form a band. You have never heard of her before, but she is very nice. You want to help her out, so you agree to hold an audition at your house this weekend. Your neighbor seems excited about the idea and can ’ t wait to get started .

Read the following sentences aloud:

" I ' m forming a music band." " Do you already know how to play an instrument?" " Uh ... Yeah ! I ' ve told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band." 

" Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?" " We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right?" " Yes, I'm a singer." " Perfect ! So you can audition this weekend here at my house." " Wait! I don ' t know the words yet. How will I sing them ?" " That doesn ' t matter; we just need to practice together and get to know each other better, okay?"

" Okay ... "
