I borrowed it from a friend of mine who read it twice before he decided to give it back to me . 

 Are you interested in reading it ? 

 Sure. 

 Then let's go to our favorite coffeehouse for a nice cup of coffee and spend an hour or two discussing the book together .

Yes . If you liked the _Grapes Of Wrath_, you'll love this book . 

 And what is the name of it ? 

 The _Maltese Falcon_ . 

 Really ? I thought that was just a movie . 

 Well , it's a real story too . It's been around since before the war . 

 So where does the falcon fit in ? 

 In this book , the falcon is an old Spanish statue that has some secret markings on it . The plot revolves around finding it . 

 But isn't the story rather obscure ? I thought you were supposed to read this kind of fiction for the plot and not the characterizations . 

 It's more complicated than that. There are four characters , each with a different agenda . They're all very well drawn . 

 So you enjoyed it ? 

 Absolutely . It's really an intriguing tale of greed, mystery and murder in San Francisco during the twenties . 

 Did you like it better than _The Great Gatsby_ , which everyone seemed to be talking about last week ? 

 No way. Gatsby is a great novel but _The Maltese Falcon_ is even better. 

 I see . Well , thanks for telling me about this book . Maybe I'll get it out of the library after all .
