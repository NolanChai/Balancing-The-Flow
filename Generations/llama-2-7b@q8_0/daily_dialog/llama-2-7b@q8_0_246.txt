" Sir ? "

" It just looks like a lot of it has been used . "

" Okay . I'll come with you to the bathroom and see what's wrong. "

" You don't have to go that far ! Just bring me some more . "

" Sorry , sir. There are only two bottles left in the house. One for yourself and one for the maid. We're out of soap. "

" For God's sake, this is a hotel ! I need soap ! "

" I apologize , sir . But our contract with Proctor & Gamble to provide the amenities has lapsed. I understand that you have not been billed for your last several months of amenities, but we are no longer in a position to provide them at this time. We do however offer a wide variety of luxury shampoos and conditioners. "

" They don't wash . "

" I don't know what you mean by souvenir . "

" Well , this is silly . You just came up to me and said 'How do I get more amenities?'"

" That's right !"

" So, if you have plenty left of those, why are you asking how to get more?"

" I don't know ! Maybe it's because they look really cheap . "

" Oh , so they're too expensive ? "

" No , no , not at all . They're fine . But my family can buy them anywhere for $12.00 each."

" So, what would you like to do about this situation ? "

" I don't know ! I think there should be a minimum amount of amenities allowed per person , so that everybody gets enough ! "

" I see . Are you sure your family doesn't have enough?"

" Of course they don't have enough. Do you expect us to just use the same things every day ? "

" No, but why do you need more ? If you run out of amenities in the morning , what happens then? "

" Well , I suppose we could wash our hair with water ."

" I see . But surely you can't mean that . "

" It works ! Don't knock it till you try it. We just don't know how to do it properly."

" And what makes you think you haven't tried it properly ? "

" Because it takes me an hour to get ready in the morning , and I still don't look great . "

" So, that's your problem? You want more amenities because you can't do your hair properly?"

" Exactly ! "

" I see. And what about the rest of us ? What makes you think we would even want to go through all that trouble? Why do you think that everybody else on this ship doesn't just wash their hair with water like everyone else does in your family?"

" Well, because it's not nice."

" Not nice? I think the problem is more fundamental than that. Have you ever asked yourself why you and your family have so much extra money to spend on souvenirs and amenities ? "

" No . We just have a lot of money, that's all ! "

" Well , I see. It seems like there are a few misunderstandings here."

" What do you mean? "

" For instance , I think maybe we should talk about what 'enough' means."

" Enough is enough . "

" How do you know when something is 'enough'?"

" It's simple. If it costs a lot of money, then it must be a lot."

" Why do you think that ?"

" I don't have to explain why ! You just have to know what 'enough' means . "

" And how much is enough?"

" That depends on the situation."

" What does it depend on? "

" Well , for example , when I'm in New York City, it would take a lot of money to get me through the day. But if you took me to someplace like Mississippi or Indiana , then I wouldn't need any money at all."

" Okay , so maybe 'enough' is not exactly the right word . "

" Of course it is ! Enough means having enough for your needs."

" And what are your needs?"

" Well, first of all there's food. If you don't have enough food , then you die."

" Right . "

" But I need more than just food to live a full life. I also need shelter and clothing."

" I see . So do I ."

" So, why does anybody want to spend money on souvenirs and amenities?"

" Because they're fun ! "

" What is the difference between fun and survival ?"

" Well , one is fun , and the other is not."

" You see . The problem here has nothing to do with money. It all comes down to what we really need to have in our lives, versus what we think we want to have . "

" There is a solution to that problem . We have these nice little bottles of shampoo and shower gel. Would you like one ? "

" That would be great ! "

" All right , here we go ! "

( The voice fades out as the man opens the door to his room . )

" Okay . We're not giving away free souvenirs . But if I give you a $25.00 voucher will that be sufficient ? "

" No , it won't . If I can't take back my soap and shampoo to use as souvenir soap and shampoo , then there's no point in giving me the vouchers . "

" But if you want free amenities , why didn't you just say so ? "

" Because I don't like getting what I ask for ! "
