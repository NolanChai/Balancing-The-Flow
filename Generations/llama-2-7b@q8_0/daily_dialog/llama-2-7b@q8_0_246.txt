Oh yeah ! We have some extra packs of those things in the closet . 

 Good 

 The next thing I need to know is where can I get my mail ? 

 You mean you don't receive it here ? 

 No , sir . Not anymore. I used to but now they no longer send anything to me at this address. 

 Okay , so that's easy . We have a box outside for your mail and packages . 

 Good ! That was very helpful, thank you . 

 It is my pleasure 

 Hello . What can I help you with ? 

 Hi there ! How much does this room cost per week ? 

 $150.00 , including taxes 

 Oh okay . 

 My second question is about how many towels and wash cloths we have here . 

 There are six towels in the bathroom . Six wash clothes as well 

 Okay . 

 Last question ! Can you tell me what time breakfast starts ?  

 Breakfast is served from 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM 

 Thank you very much for your help and I hope to see you again soon !

How long do they last ? 

 Oh , at least a year ! You can use them as much as you like . 

 Well , you see sir , there are more people here now than when I first checked in . 

 Yes , that's true . 

 So , where did all these people come from ? 

 There are a lot of tourists traveling right now and this is their vacation time so they're using the amenities as well . 

 Can you get some more ? 

 I suppose we could . But , it will take a few weeks to get them here . 

 Why can't you send more ? 

 You see sir , I don't know how much soap or shampoo is in each amenity because there are so many of these little bottles . 

 They come in one big box and then we break down the box into smaller boxes that fit in a box with all our other toiletry stuff . 

 I don't know what else you want me to say ! 

 Okay , how long will it be ? 

 Maybe ten days or so ? 

 That long ?! I can't wait that long ! I need my amenities now ! You have to get them here right now .

 Well , we can't make any promises like that but I do see your point . 

 Fine ! Send them and then you call me back when they arrive ! 

 Sure thing !

You mean souvenirs from this hotel ? 

 I'm talking about stuff like that . 

 Like what ? 

 Like these pictures. They are very good, but they cost $40 each ! 

 Sir , can you please wait a minute ? Let me find out what we can do for you . 

 Sorry to keep you waiting, sir . Can I help you now ? 

 Yes . Do you have any more of those pictures in the room ? 

 No , sir . We've sold all that we had. 

 You mean they're already gone?! 

 No , no ! I said "already" ! 

 I see what you meant . Sorry, go on. 

 They were in the room when I checked in yesterday , but now there are none left . 

 Can we get any more ? 

 Well , that depends . 

 What does it depend on?! 

 On whether or not we can obtain them. 

 I see . And if you do find some more pictures, will the price be $40 each too?! 

 Sir , this is a gift shop. We have to make money on what we sell. 

 So , when and where exactly did these pictures come from ? 

 They were made right here at our hotel . 

 I see . And now, who was responsible for making these pictures?! 

 This is really none of your business, sir ! 

 Well then, can we buy more or not , madam?! 

 Sorry ?! 

 Did you say "madam"?! What kind of place is this anyway?? 

 Sir , please keep your voice down . 

 No one else will hear me if I speak quietly. 

 Maybe that's a good idea . 

 I'm sorry , sir . Can we help you in any other way ? 

 I guess not ! Bye !

How much did you bring with you from home ?  

 Just a few bars . Now they are all gone . 

 I see . What would you like to do about it ? 

 Buy more soap ! 

 That's not the problem . The problem is that you used your soap without asking for permission , and that violates hotel policy ! You must pay a fine before you can buy any additional amenities ! 

 I can't believe this ! First, they took my car when I tried to drive away with it after leaving their parking lot. Now they are going to take away my soap ? ! 

 Look , if you want to keep the soap , there is a fine . It will cost you $50 . 

 What kind of scam is this ? You took my car for no reason and now you're charging me $50 for something I already paid for when I checked in ! This is ridiculous ! 

 Well , that's your opinion. But the policy states that the use of amenities without permission is a violation . Now we must collect the fine . 

 FINE ? You want to charge me $50 because they stole my car and now you are trying to steal more stuff from me ? 

 I don't know how many times I have to tell you that this is not theft ! The amenities were already yours when you checked in . They were yours before the hotel even owned them . 

 Then what about my car ? You stole it and now you want $50 from me too ? This is outrageous ! 

 That's where you're wrong . It was not your car at that time , but later when we recovered it after you left our lot. 

 What recovery ? I never parked my car in your lot ! 

 You did park there . You just didn't remember . 

 Are you accusing me of stealing something from myself ? This is insane ! Now get out of here before I call the police ! 

 We will not have a problem if you pay your fine , Mr . Adams . The policy states that amenities are not transferable and we cannot permit them to be used without permission . You must follow the rules or else you may find yourself in trouble with the law ! Goodbye!

Soap is one thing . I want to take home some t-shirts or coffee mugs . 

 Mr. Chang , our guest amenities department has a policy that we cannot give away free items as gifts . 

 You can always buy the souvenirs here at the hotel shop for discounted rates ! 

 You don't understand me ! I need to take home some real souvenirs to my country ! 

 Mr. Chang , I assure you that we have plenty of souvenir items here . And if they aren't enough , we can order more from our warehouse in Seoul . 

 You just don't get it ! Free souvenirs are the real souvenirs . 

 Mr. Chang , please try to understand me . I don't want any more soap for my bathroom use . 

 Soap is one thing . But now I want t-shirts and coffee mugs . I want to take them home as souvenirs . 

 I think that you still have a lot of questions regarding our amenities policy . And the only way for me to clear things up for you is if we talk in person . Would you mind having a face-to-face discussion with me ? 

 Yes ! Of course I'm interested ! We can talk tomorrow , right after my morning meeting ! 

 Great , Mr. Chang ! I will wait until then !
