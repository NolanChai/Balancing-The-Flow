Oh, I'm good as well . Well , what did you think of that film yesterday ? It was quite funny . 

 Yeah , it was pretty hilarious , wasn't it? 

 So, where should we go for dinner ? I'm not too hungry yet , so I think a coffee would be good . 

 Why don't you come to my place ? It's more central and convenient . 

 OK then - I'll see you there in about fifteen minutes. 

 Bye.

Sure ! That would be great . Do you have any plans yet for dinner ? 

 No , not yet, but I have some time between now and then. What do you think about Italian ? 

 Sounds good ! Are you sure that the restaurant is OK with us coming in late?

 Yes , because there are no reservations . You can make them anytime . We'll call tomorrow to confirm .

That's fine . I have a friend that we could bring along too. He can give us a ride home afterwards if you want . 

 OK !  That would be great , but why don't you ask him now ? I don't know when I will get off work, and it may take longer than we expect to reach the restaurant. We can decide later how many people we should have in our party . See you on Friday!

 Bye !

[Warning: Short generation] 

 You can call me sometime next week after you are settled in . 

 Mike , I would love that ! Well , I've gotta run now so I'll talk to you soon. Take care! Bye !
