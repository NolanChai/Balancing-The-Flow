Oh ! Why? Do you think the film is bad ? 

 It's not just because it's bad . It's so terrible and dark! I almost had a panic attack during the entire movie. I don't understand why people call this a horror movie . I'm scared to go out in the evening now after watching that film . 

 Well , I still think you overreacted a little bit . That's just my opinion . 

 Hey , May, may I ask for your help ? There's some homework due next Monday and I haven't started yet.  

 Sure thing. What do we need to finish? 

 Well, first of all, I need to learn how to solve quadratic equations. It's not that I can't do it , but my teacher taught me a very bad way to solve them . The professor who's teaching this subject right now is new and doesn't know as many ways to solve these types of problems as she should. 

Okay, I'll try my best to help you if there are any questions about quadratic equations or other math topics. But , the most important thing in learning is that you have to make a lot of efforts . You can learn everything by yourself in our website.  

Thanks for your advice . I'm going to follow it right now !

It's okay . I am sure it will be fun to watch in the future when we get older . 

 How do you know ? 

 May , I don't know what is going on with my mind. But I just feel that way . I am certain that The Witch is not a boring film at all. 

 It is just because we are young and naive to understand the deeper meaning of it right now. That's why . 

 That makes perfect sense . So , do you want to watch it again ? 

 Let me think about it !

They really weren't that scary . And that story is just so outdated . 

 You don't think it's true , do you ? That's crazy . 

 Why ? I read about it in school and they say those ghosts are real . 

 Really ? What else did you read? 

 The same thing every other child does . 

 Well, I don't know . Let's just stop talking about this movie , it's creepy me out . 

 What , do you believe in ghosts too? 

 You believe that story is true ? 

 Maybe there are ghosts , I don't know . But I don't think there was a witch either . 

 No , there were witches and they did bad things . Like put people into torture devices . 

 They didn't really put you into the torture device , though . You were just watching it in that movie . 

 I guess I don't have to believe this story either . 

 Don't be so silly . 

 You know, those people believed in ghosts and witches back then because they didn't know anything else about science. 

 Maybe it was the same with you . 

 What ? No , I have a very good scientific education . 

 Oh yeah? How is that going for you?

Sci-fi ? 

 Yeah . You know , they are about the future and alien worlds. They have lots of action . 

 Oh , I see . 

 Sci-fi is a good genre for action films , but sometimes it's hard to understand what is happening in sci-fi movies . 

 It depends on the plot . 

 Well , we should talk about this another time . Let's go home .

 Good idea ! I'll give you a lift. My car is outside . 

 Hey , May , where are your friends ? They were supposed to pick us up. 

 Oh ! Yes, they are in the restaurant next door waiting for us. I was chatting with them until we got hungry and wanted to go home. So don't worry !

I know you're not a kid any more , but you are still very immature in many ways . 

 What ? Why would you say something so rude to your friend ? 

 That is how I speak to my friends ! 

 So it means we aren't friends then ! 

 We are friends but sometimes we disagree ! 

 Look , there's our coffee table . Come on and have a seat . 

 Oh , I got to go back to work . I don't want to be late today again ! Bye ! 

 Bye .

Well , let's go then ! 

 Great idea !

I have something to tell you about a movie we saw yesterday.
The Witch was the name of it, and I think that poster is from there, right?
Yeah, that's The Witch. It's on my list of movies to see this weekend.
Sorry, but did that scare you at all?
No. Not at all.
I thought the movie was...boring.
Boring! Come on! You were clutching my arm like crazy during it!
Well, I'm just a wuss when it comes to horror movies. The ghosts in that one freaked me out!
I love science fiction movies! Of course you do. They are silly stories for little kids like you.
Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight?
Of course I'll go, but don't call me a kid. I'm an adult.
Well then let's go!
