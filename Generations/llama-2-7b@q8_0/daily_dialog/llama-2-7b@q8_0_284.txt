"May , Do you know what's the name of that girl with green eyes ? "

" Do you think it's true that Jessica Alba and Brad Pitt dated ? "

" I don't know ... Maybe . "

" I heard they were engaged in 2005 but broke up a year later . "

" Oh , yeah ? Why ? Wasn't it the right decision for them to be together ? "

" Well .. I don't think so . But anyway ... "

" Brad Pitt was still with Angelina Jolie when they met Jessica Alba , you know . He just couldn't break up with her . It was like he didn't love his current girlfriend . "

" Oh, May . I heard you were in a play last weekend . Did it go well ? "

" Yeah , actually it went really well . We had over 20 people attend our play at the end of the night . I think it's a good number for a theatre class . "

" Do you plan to do any plays in the future ? "

" Of course ! But maybe not this summer , since it's very hot here in L.A . "

" You must have done many plays before you moved to L.A , right ? "

" Yes . I did lots of plays when I was a child , but I also did a few adult plays as well . "

" I think you should take some acting classes in L.A . You're so good at acting . "

" Thanks , but I don't know if it's a good idea for me to join an acting class right now . "

" Why ? Is there anything wrong with taking acting classes ? " 

" Well, I have this job at the movie theatre and that takes up most of my time. Besides, I have many other things to do besides working on myself in an acting class . "

" You don't want to be famous one day , huh ? "

" No, not really ... Anyway ... "

" No , May . "

" What ? "

" It's not that I don't like horror movies or anything. But they are just so much more interesting than Sci-Fi flicks . "

" Are you saying Star Wars is boring ? "

" Well , it's kinda hard to follow , May . "

" It's not a movie for everyone , May . Maybe you need some training before watching it. "

" Ha ha ! I will definitely watch the next one in the series. "

" Why do you want to watch Sci-Fi movies ? "

" Oh , it doesn't matter if you don't like them . They are not for everyone, after all . And as long as we are together ... "

" Really , that doesn't mean you have to watch boring movies with me . "

" May ... you should learn how to watch scary movie . You are so scared and even cry at the end ! "

" Maybe I'm too sensitive . I need to toughen up. "

" You can get stronger . Just take some more vitamin C for your immune system and drink some green tea every morning . "

" Is that your grandma's secret recipe ? "

" Not exactly . I just read on the internet how they help people stay healthy . "

" Well , you should be careful what you believe in ... on the internet . "

" What are you talking about ? You can even buy medicine there ! "

" Yes , but not good one . Most of them are fakes or expired . "

" Oh my god ! May , I've been reading a lot of online pharmacy sites and they all say their products are genuine . "

" Of course they do . It's part of the advertisements to make you buy it . "

" But I need that ... vitamin C ... my doctor said so ! "

" Hey , how about we watch another scary movie together ? You should be stronger by then . "

" No way , it might be too much for me . "

" It's ok , I will hold your hand and won't let go . "
