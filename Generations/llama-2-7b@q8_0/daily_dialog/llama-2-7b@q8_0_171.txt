Of course not, madam , but you can pick them up on Thursday . 

 But why ? What's wrong with this place? 

 We have a new machine and we are unable to process all of the films right now. 

 Well what about the old one? 

 The film that was exposed last week had a processing error, so we will not be able to provide you service at all for some time . 

 I'm sorry .
