" No, but I have copies of the receipts. "

" When was this done ? "

" Last week when I went to buy some books . "

" Are you sure that it wasn ’ t a mistake ? "

" Yes, because it says here that the man charged my card in the store and gave me back only part of the money. He said he couldn’t give me any more change . "

" Well, we will look into this right away. Could you come back to the bank within a week ? "

" Yes, I will be happy to. Thank you for your help. "

Situation 17 : A customer is looking for someone who can provide him or her with information about where a famous artist was born .

" How may I help you ? "

" Are you the one that knows where ___ ___ , the famous artist, was born ? "

" Who told you to come here for this information? "

" A friend of mine . "

" But why did your friend want to know where he or she was born? "

" I don ’ t know. It was a surprise birthday party that my friends wanted to do and they said that it would be a great idea if we went there on Saturday. We are going to get a book about him and we can go together, too. "

" I am sorry but the library isn ’ t open until Monday . "

" Could you please tell me where he or she was born? "

" No, that information is not available here, but I can help you with other sources of information . "

" The charge says ‘ Ms. Watts ’ . "

" That’s my wife ’ s name. "

" How do I know that these charges were not made by you ? "

" I can assure you, they weren ’ t . "

" If it was me who used your card , why would I use your wife ’ s name ? "

" I don ’ t know. "

" Do you see anything on the charges that would indicate how these were made ? "

" Nope, just ‘ Ms. Watts ’ . "

" And where did this card come from ? "

" From my wallet . "

" I don ’ t understand – your wife didn ’ t steal your debit card and make these charges? "

" I guess not. "

" Ok, sir, thanks for calling back. We’ll have someone reach out to you soon about this situation. Have a nice day . "

" Why ? "

" We need to determine if these are legitimate transactions or fraudulent. "

" Who made the purchase ? "

" The cardholder , my husband . "

" Can you verify that the purchases were authorized by him ? "

" I can ’ t remember where we kept our receipts . "

" Do you have the card in question here with you ? "

" No . "

" Can you obtain one for us ? "

" Yes. "

" Excellent. Thank you. "

" You’re welcome . "

" Can I ask a few more questions now about the purchases, or is there anything else you need from me right now ? "

" I believe that ’ s all we have for today. Thank you again and please let us know if we can be of any further assistance to you."

" Can I use this card till the investigation is complete ? "

" I’m afraid not, sir. "

" What about a replacement card for now ? "

" Well sir , there may be some delay in issuing a new one, but if it ’ s imperative that you get a new card then we will need to see you at the branch to process this . "

" I ’ ll have to call my boss and explain why I ’ m going out of town tomorrow ? "

" Yes sir , I understand. "

" Is there anything else you can do for me right now ? "

" No, thank you . Have a nice day . "

" Thank you ! "
