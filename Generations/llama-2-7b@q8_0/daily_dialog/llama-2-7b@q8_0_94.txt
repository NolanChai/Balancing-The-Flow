I can’t use your app because it is not compatible with my Android version (4.2). 

 But what about your API? Can’t I still integrate it in my app if the API itself runs on older versions of Android? 

 We only recommend integrating our API for projects that have access to devices running at least Android 8 or iOS 10 . 

 What are you going to do with the old apps using your API ? 

 You will be forced to migrate them.

Yes , and the charges were made at various times and different locations in Europe . 

 Would it be possible to look up these transactions ? 

 Yes, but can I ask why you are interested in this matter ? 

 As I said before there were some unauthorised use of my card and I want to get the company that made those charges to refund me . 

 And if they don ’ t then what do you intend doing about it ? 

 I ’ ll take the matter further up the line . 

 We ’ d like to avoid all this fuss , but if there is no alternative then we will have to look into it.

 Would you mind telling me your full name and address so that I can look up the transactions in our computer ? 

 My name is Susan Smith . 

 And your address ? 

 It ’ s 189 Elm Street , Woburn . 

 Can I have your account number ? 

 Yes, it ’ s 207456.

 What would you like me to do ? 

 May I ask how much money there was on the card when these charges were made ? 

 There was about $1000 .

 And can you tell me if those charges were made in your name or someone else ’ s ? 

 They were made in my name and that of my husband , who is an executive with the company . 

 I understand . 

 Now these are the charges: 

 The first one was a taxi fare to the airport at Frankfurt . 

 The second one was the cost of a hire car for two days in Brussels . 

 And there were five restaurant bills , all on different days. 

 I don ’ t remember where they were but I think that they were in France and Italy . 

 They were definitely not in England or Ireland . 

 Can you tell me what the company was that made those charges ?

 It wasn ’ t any of our regular companies . 

 Would it be possible to get a list of them , so that I can pass this information on to my supervisor ? 

 If it would help in your enquiries then yes, we ’ ll do that. 

 Thank you very much for all the trouble you have taken. 

 That is most kind of you . 

 Goodbye !

 Bye .

They were for a hotel in Rome , Italy . 

 Let me get my manager .

 Hold please .

 Okay Ms. Jones, I have reviewed the charge and noticed that this was made by an unknown person and there is no record of you being at this location . 

 We will investigate further and call you back with the outcome . 

 Thank you for your patience .

 Hold please .

 Hello Ms. Jones, I have reviewed your account and located an inquiry from my team on the transaction in question. The hotel has stated that they don ’ t recognize this charge because it is not a confirmed reservation and no one with that credit card number has stayed at their facility . 

 We are trying to get more information from them, but will let you know when we have an update . 

 Thank you for your patience .

 Hold please .

 Hello Ms. Jones, I have spoken to the hotel and they confirmed that no one with that credit card number stayed there . They say that they don ’ t recognize these charges at all because of the unusual amount of transactions for just one person . 

 We are checking into this further, but in the meantime would you please cancel your debit card ?

 Okay thank you I will do so right now. 

 Thank you Ms. Jones.

Can you tell me what time the charges were made ? 

 The first one was at 12:05 in the afternoon . 

 And when did this happen ? 

 On Friday , March 3rd . 

 Who made the charge ? 

 I have no idea . 

 OK , let ’ s check on a few things for you to see if we can resolve any of these issues. First , what kind of card is it ? 

 It ’ s a Visa . 

 Was your PIN number entered ? 

 Yes , but that wasn ’ t the issue . I never authorized the charges and they were made at stores in Canada . 

 OK, let me see what we can do. If you have any more questions please give us a call back within five business days as our records are updated every evening. Thank you for calling Visa Card Services , this has been Sam . 

 End of transcript.

Do you need anything from me ? 

 Yes . 

 We ’ ll be sending a form in the mail for you to fill out and return . 

 What happens after that ? 

 Our fraud department will call or write to you within five days to let you know their findings .
