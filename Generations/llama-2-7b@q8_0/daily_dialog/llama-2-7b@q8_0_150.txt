What do you mean ? 

 Well, our current project manager , Martha , is overwhelmed and can't keep up with the details for that one anymore . She's just too busy . 

 That's true . We all are . 

 I guess we should consider adding another person to the team. What do you think? 

 Yeah, I agree . We need somebody new and fresh.
