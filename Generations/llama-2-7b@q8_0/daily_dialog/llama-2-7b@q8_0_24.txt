"Well , the poor thing can't stand him any longer . "

" Why not ? He is very fond of her . "

"But she don't like his ways . She told me that he spends too much time with those fellows at the club . "

" But what can a man do ? We are always together , day and night . I think it's quite natural that we should be together when we go out , or when there is anything going on that interests us both. Susan must make up her mind to that . "

" But she don't like the way he looks at other women in public places , and how he smiles and talks to them . I saw him do it once myself . And she says they are not so good looking as his wife . "

"What do you want me to say ? If Susan wants a divorce she will get one . Peter can't prevent her from having one if she asks for it. But don't let the subject drop, or I shall tell them that we have been talking about it. You are such an innocent fool."

" Well , you needn't look so cross at me when I see that Susan is going to get a divorce . "

"I'm not cross . It's just that I don't want my husband to know we have been talking about it. You are a little fool, anyway."

" What ? Do you think that Peter knows more than I do ? He can talk of nothing but his wife all day long , and how handsome she is , and what a good dancer . And he says that Susan isn't a bit like other women ; she never goes out to theatres with her girl friends ; she stays at home alone and plays the piano while Peter sits in the other room and smokes. But I know better than you do how much women talk about their husbands when they are together . "

"That's a silly thing to say."

" Well , if Susan wants a divorce she will get it , won't she ? And what does Peter think of that ? If he is so fond of her why doesn't he make things right and stop all the talk ? I guess he is as much to blame for this as she is . "

"Well, you can go and tell Peter how angry I am with him. Let him say what he wants about Susan's conduct . He knows better than anybody else if it is true or not. I'm going home now."

" All right , but I think it's very funny that you are so cross because Susan wants a divorce ; you must be in love with her yourself, or else you would not care about it . "

"Oh ! Now you are talking like a little fool. You don't know what I feel for Peter."

"I don't care what you say , or what you do. Susan is going to get a divorce. And if she wants my advice, let her go and see me and I will tell her all about it. Good-by . "
