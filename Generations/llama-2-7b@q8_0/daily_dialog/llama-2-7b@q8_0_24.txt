Is Peter here ?

 Yes he's in the hall , but he won't talk to me . I hate him ! 

 You should try and get over your anger , it doesn't solve anything . 

 No , you don't understand . He ruined my life ! 

 I can't believe that ! 

 Why not ? It's true ! 

 How do you know ? 

 Because he told me . 

 You can't trust him , he's a liar ! 

 He's lying to himself as much as anyone else , and it'll make him unhappy if he doesn't stop ! 

 I don't care about that ! I just want my divorce . 

 Don't you think it would be better if you two could talk things over ? 

 We did , but there was no point . He still wants to stay together ! 

 Well , at least now you know the truth . 

 Yes , I know too much ! But I don't care what he says any more . He's a liar and a hypocrite . 

 Is that why he left ? 

 Because of me , yes , because I found out about his affair with Julia . 

 How do you know all this ? 

 He told me , last night ! 

 What did you say to him when you saw him in the hall ? 

 I called him a liar and a hypocrite and said he was going to lose everything he had because of his own weakness . 

 But wasn't that what you wanted all along ? 

 Yes , but I didn't know the truth until last night. 

 And now you do ! 

Yes , and Peter knows it too . I don't care if he ever sees me again !
