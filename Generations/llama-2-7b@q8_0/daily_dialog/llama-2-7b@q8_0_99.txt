Yeah sure I want to come , but can not find my new dress , the old one is too short . But if this happens , then I have an idea . The party should start at 6 o'clock , so it would be a good idea if you could take me home and help me to choose something 

 OK no problem let ' s meet at seven in front of my house . See ya !

Okay see you there ! Bye .

I would say that my weekend is going well. The first day was pretty boring since it rained the whole time. But on Friday I went out and met some friends for dinner at this restaurant, "La Maison du Poisson". It was really good, especially because one of the guys in our group ordered a special fish dish that was absolutely delicious!

This Saturday I am planning to go to the movies with a few of my friends. We are going to see some French film called "Premiers Matins du Monde", which is about a blind man who wants to commit suicide but then decides he might as well have one last meal, since there is nothing left to do in life. Sounds pretty depressing, huh?

This Sunday I think I'll go for another walk by myself and read some more of "L'Arl√©sienne" which I started the other day. This book is really interesting because it talks about how a woman falls in love with her childhood friend who happens to be married. But he is always making excuses as to why they can't meet each other, which she doesn't understand and starts to think that maybe he is not the same man anymore.

 See you then . Bye.
