Oh . I was hoping to make an appointment for next week . 

 Certainly , Ms. Jackson . When would you like her to see you ? 

 Well, on Monday morning . 

 OK . I ’ ll set up a 9:00 AM appointment with Lily on Monday and have her call you in the afternoon with some specific details for your visit . Do you want me to put down that you would rather not speak directly with Ms. Jackson ? 

 No , that’s fine . Thanks . 

 Bye .
