" You should come and see her off , dear. Frank will be there to meet us at the station , you know . "

" Well , I don't know about that , but I must say goodbye to him , "

" Yes , you must do so , he is not going very far after all , is he ? "

The time was now near for the departure of our party . It would soon be time to say goodbye.

Frank had just come down and I was waiting in my room to see him before leaving London. I took a last look round the room before I went out. On the table stood several photographs , and one particular picture caught my eye. The figure of a girl in white satin dress lay on the floor.

" Ah ! " said Frank , when he came into the room , " that is my favourite photograph . It was taken at my cousin's wedding."

He picked it up, and handed it to me to see. I took it from him and looked at the face of the girl on the floor. The figure in white satin dress , who had been lying there so long , was dead ! I was horror-struck . Frank gave a sudden gasp and said :
