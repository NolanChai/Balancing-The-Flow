Have you seen them together ? 

 No , I have not seen them . 

 Will it be a surprise if we attend the wedding ceremony ? 

 I don’t think so . 

 Is he planning to stay with his wife or he will return to his parents ’ home after marriage ? 

 He is going to stay with her , since she has got a very good job . 

 What kind of work does the girl do? 

 She works in an office as an accountant. 

 You know that Frank had worked at the same place for about one year when he fell in love with this woman . 

 How did they meet ? 

 They met each other at a party given by his friends. 

 What are your plans after marriage? 

 I am going to settle down here and start my own business , since I think I can do that better than in my country . 

 I hope everything goes well for you Frank ! 

 Thank you . 

 Have a nice evening!

Really ? She’s from Spain ? 

 No , she is British but her family lives in Spain. 

 Are they going to live together or not?

 I don’t know , maybe ! 

What do you mean by that ?  

 You have no idea what they plan for their future .

 Are you sure about it ?  

 Yes, because Frank told me he will spend the next summer in Spain with her.
