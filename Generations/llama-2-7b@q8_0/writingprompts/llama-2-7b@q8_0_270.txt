 out into the water and started sweeping it across the sand. She soon found something. She picked it up with the net, but the object was too heavy for it, so she held onto a corner of it with her bare hands. It was metal, and it had once been round, but now it was bent. The sun was setting, and Lilly's fingers were freezing. When she returned to the shore, she ran inside.
She called out: "Mum? Mum!"
There was no answer. She went into her mother's bedroom; there was nobody there either. Then she remembered that they were in the kitchen.
"Mum! Dad!"
The sound of a mug being set down on the table reached Lilly. Her parents did not look up from the book they were reading to each other, and went on reading until Lilly said: "What is it?"
Her father put down his glasses, her mother closed her book. They looked at what Lilly was holding out to them. It was a shell-casing that had once been part of an ammunition belt. In its centre were three holes; the shells must have exploded from within, and not from outside.
"Well done," said her mother. "You're very good at this!"
Lilly's father took a magnifying glass out of his jacket pocket, which made him look like an old man, with long white hair that was plastered across his forehead by sweat and sunshine. The magnifier was a gift from the king of Denmark to the town council as a token of gratitude for having supplied him with all the necessary men during World War II. He had found it in one of the cupboards, along with a pile of old books on marine biology.
"See," said her father, "it's a munition shell that was fired from a tank at our very own shore."
Lilly held up her hand to shield her eyes against the setting sun as she looked out over the sea. Her mother smiled and shook her head at Lilly, as if to say that all this talk of tanks and explosions wasn't suitable for young ears.
"It was a very powerful shell," said her father, "because it had been fired from an Allied tank. It's also interesting to note that this particular casing has the maker's mark: C 37A 1946."
He then read out what these letters meant, and Lilly was about to ask him if the shell could be made into a necklace or earrings for her when she noticed that he had picked up his magnifying glass again. He held it so close to the casing that it looked as if he wanted to read it from within.
"It says: 'Property of the Danish army, the Royal Artillery Corps,'" said Lilly's father, reading out each letter with extreme care. "And then underneath there are some letters which I can't quite make out."
Lilly's mother went to take a closer look at her husband's find. She squinted and shone the magnifying glass at it for a while, but she was still unable to decipher the markings. Lilly stood in front of them. There were things that only she could see when she looked at this shell: a turtle with its mouth open; a swimming seal; a fish that had been cut into two pieces and turned inside out by a knife, like how an artist would prepare his palette to make some paintings. Lilly's eyes began to water, but when she rubbed her eyes, the shell was gone.
Her mother's voice came from far away: "Let me have a look."
Lilly put on her glasses and went outside into the sunlight. A breeze had sprung up, making it seem as if they were on the deck of a ship that was sailing across a stormy sea. The wind took Lilly's hair straight off her forehead; it seemed to be blowing away everything she held dearest in life – just like the wind that blew down the shack that belonged to the old man, which meant he no longer had anywhere to live and had to move in with his daughter.
The shell was lying on a rock by the water's edge. Lilly took it into her hand once more; this time she felt that it was only half of what it once was, but there were two holes where there ought to have been three. She closed one eye and tried to see through the shell with just the one hole, so that all she could see in front of her was a small piece of sky.
"Did you find it?" asked her mother from far away. "Oh! Good work!"
Lilly's father was standing over by the car with his jacket on and a cane in his hand. He looked like an old man, with white hair that was plastered across his forehead by sweat and sunshine. Lilly ran up to him, wanting to tell him about what she had seen through her own eye, but then she heard the car door slam shut. The old man was getting in; it was their neighbour's son who had come to take his father back to his daughter.
Lilly felt as if someone was sitting on a rock beside her and reading from her book, and although she could not see him or even hear him, she knew that the person with the sun-browned face would turn to page 391 at exactly this moment in time; she knew that he would read about a man who had lost his daughter. He might have thought that he was alone, but he was actually sitting next to Lilly. She felt him leaning over and kissing her forehead. Then the old man closed the car door on the other side, and they were gone.
The wind picked up once more, making it seem as if they were sailing across a stormy sea. The shell lay in Lilly's hand. The wind blew it straight into the water; the waves splashed against her legs. She closed one eye, and everything turned to black – just like when she had seen through the shell.
She looked out over the sea; it was as if the old man were still sitting beside her on a rock, reading from her book. Lilly stood in the wind and let it blow away whatever it wanted: the turtle with its mouth open; the swimming seal; the fish that had been cut into two pieces and turned inside out by a knife – just like how an artist would prepare his palette to make some paintings, which only Lilly could see.

The old man's house
The following autumn, when the leaves were still green and it was not yet dark at eight o'clock in the evening, the old man and his daughter went for a walk down to the sea. They took a small boat that belonged to one of the fishermen; they got into it and rowed out until their arms ached with the effort.
"Have you never seen this side before?" he asked her, nodding at the rocks in the water that were covered in green slime and full of shells and sea anemones. She shook her head: she had spent most of her life on the other side of the beach. Her parents owned a shop where they sold ice cream, and it was here that the old man went every day when he wanted to buy his ice cream for free; he would say "thank you" in an extra polite way, but she knew exactly what he meant: I'll give you something from my pension if you let me have one.
The beach was deserted that night as they rowed out to sea with the old man sitting between them in the stern. He had put on a pair of green rubber dinghies and had tied up his shoes so tightly around his ankles that Lilly thought they might snap off at any moment, but he seemed not to notice; instead he was busy rowing and talking about what it meant for something to be round.
"It's a good thing that most of the world is round," said the old man. "It means that it doesn't collapse or fly into space." He gave Lilly a smile, but she did not know whether this was because he wanted her to understand what he had just said, or because it made him happy to be sitting in his boat with an eighteen-year-old girl and the sea breeze blowing through her hair.
Lilly's father did not say a word; instead he looked at them both with curiosity, as if they were two people who had just met and were trying to work out how they knew each other – perhaps they used to be married? "Dad?" asked Lilly. He shook his head: it was nothing like that; her mother never liked him, she said.
"We're going a bit too far," the old man pointed out when he saw the boat was approaching an island with tall trees on top of which sat birds who looked as if they wanted to fly into space. He rowed back towards Lilly and her father in the distance, but they could not hear anything from where they were; only later did they learn that the old man's voice had sounded like thunder on that night, making it impossible for anyone else to get near enough to the beach to see them.
"Dad?!" Lilly said once more when
