 `What are you doing?'' I asked, and then it replied with something that sounded familiar `` We can do whatever we want now ''

The game began, and the screen was filled with numbers `` 4 '' ``,`` 5 '',``,`` 6 '`. I've never seen a game like this before. But I knew that this game has no end. If you can't get out of it by yourself, then you will die.
### [**Easy mode**](https://github.com/Hexi-01/Technique-2048-Project-2/blob/main/2048%20-%20Chapter%203.md)

In the beginning, I thought it would be easy to play this game, so I played on an easy mode. This is the easiest way to play the game. Whenever two adjacent numbers are added, they will change to a number equal to their sum, and when they reach 2048, they will disappear, and the other ones will move upwards. But after playing for a while, I found that this was actually not easy at all. If you play on this mode, you have to be careful, because whenever two numbers are adjacent, if you click them, then those numbers will merge together and become one number, so you should use your finger only when it is necessary. Otherwise, they would become 2048 and disappear forever.
### [**Hard mode**](https://github.com/Hexi-01/Technique-2048-Project-2/blob/main/2048%20-%20Chapter%203.md)

I thought I was playing this game for a long time, so I could be really good at it. But after playing on the hard mode, I found out that I still wasn't able to win it! The main difference between an easy and a hard mode is the numbers. In the easy mode, if two numbers are adjacent, they will change into another one, but in the hard mode, whenever you click two adjacent numbers, those numbers will not disappear, so they will change into 2048 after you clicked them, which means that these numbers can never become 2048. I was thinking how could it be possible to have a number bigger than 2048 in the game? But there's no need for me to worry about that because I had already thought of an easy solution for this problem: you should use your finger only when it is necessary and try not to click on numbers that are very far away from each other.
### [**Medium mode**](https://github.com/Hexi-01/Technique-2048-Project-2/blob/main/2048%20-%20Chapter%203.md)

The medium mode is the one that I like to play with most, and it's also the hardest of all three modes. In this mode, whenever two adjacent numbers are clicked, they will change into a number equal to their sum. This means that if you want to reach 2048, then you need to click on as many numbers as possible so that the total number is 2048. I tried playing it with my friends, and we found out that this mode was actually not easy at all because there are too many numbers in each row, so it's very hard for us to reach 2048 without making any mistakes!
### [**Difficulty level**](https://github.com/Hexi-01/Technique-2048-Project-2/blob/main/2048%20-%20Chapter%203.md)

The difficulty level of this game is one of the most important things that you need to understand before playing it, because if your fingers are too slow or they have no control over them then there's no way for you to win this game! In order to make sure that your fingers don't get tired while playing 2048, we recommend using one hand when playing with another person so as not only can both people enjoy themselves but also save time by playing at once instead of taking turns between them (or vice versa).

The game 2048 is a very fun and addictive game that has become popular on the App Store, Google Play, and Facebook Messenger. The goal of this game is to get as high numbers as possible before time runs out. This means you'll have to move around your squares quickly in order for them to stay together without hitting each other or getting stuck under another one (which happens when they overlap).

I've been playing this game for a while, and it is my favorite because of its simplicity. There are only two buttons on the screen: one to move up and one down. It doesn't matter what number you start with; all that matters is how many moves it takes before reaching 2048 or higher! So far I have reached over 2 million points in just under six minutes by using my skills as an expert at this game (and maybe some luck).
