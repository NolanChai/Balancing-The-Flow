h?And it's 10,000!Wasn't this supposed to happen sometime after Christmas or New Year when all those people have gone back home and I would feel safe here?But no, it happened today itself.I am going to have a lot of explaining to do.
I felt the eyes of my wife on me.I looked up from the newspaper I was reading.She was sitting at the dining table having her breakfast.This is what happens every morning - she looks at me and I look back and then go back to whatever it is that interests me - in this case the newspaper.
'Where have you been last night?' Her voice was sharp, accusing, demanding answers. She had no idea how difficult it would be for me to answer her.
'At a party,' I said, hoping to leave it at that. But she wanted more. 'Who with? What time did you come home?'
I looked away from her eyes and back at the newspaper. 'It was late - after one.' This is not what I wanted to tell her but I couldn't avoid it now. There had been too many people there, all asking me questions. It was like they knew about this and were waiting for an explanation.
I could sense that she was angry. 'And you left without telling anyone?' She sounded hurt. I didn't want to tell her that the party was a birthday celebration; I was scared what she would think of me now. If only the numbers hadn't started, this wouldn't have happened.
She came towards me and touched my hand lightly. 'I am sorry,' she whispered into my ear as if she knew how much pain her anger had caused me. Then she turned around to go back to her breakfast and left the room. The door slammed shut behind her. I looked at the newspaper again but there was nothing on the front page that could occupy my mind.
It had been a long night, starting with me leaving home at 9.15 p.m. I had gone out for dinner with a friend of mine and then we decided to go somewhere else before coming back here. There were too many people at his place so he suggested the party at my place. He knew what I would do once the numbers reached 10,000.
I couldn't think about anything other than the birthday celebration for my friend. The party had been organized by another friend of mine - he was turning twenty-one and we wanted to make it a memorable night. So at around eight in the evening, I got myself some beer and left home. I didn't want to tell anyone where I was going because they would keep asking me questions and that would spoil my mood for the celebration.
The party started well but then someone suggested we get more drinks. The host had ordered a few cases of whiskey but there wasn't enough for all of us. So I got up to go outside to buy some more. And that's when I met her - a beautiful woman with long blonde hair.
I was talking to another friend at the time and hadn't noticed her until she started staring at me from across the room. She had been sitting on one of those little sofas near the door when we came in, but now she was standing by my side. I knew how it would be - if someone is interested in you, then they will come towards you and start talking to you.
As soon as she walked up to me, I could feel myself getting nervous. It wasn't just her beauty that made me shake inside; there was something about her eyes too - a certain look of interest that made me wonder if we were going to get along well or not. She was wearing a short black dress and I noticed how she moved with ease as if nothing could make her uncomfortable or nervous in front of others.
After exchanging pleasantries for about five minutes, she asked me if I wanted another drink with her because they were out again. The party hadn't even started yet but already people were leaving to go home and the music wasn't as loud anymore. So we decided to join them at their place instead of going back where all our friends were waiting for us.
We walked downstairs together and I noticed her grip on my hand tightening every step that she took until we reached a room with a big bed in it. She closed the door behind us and then turned towards me with an inviting smile on her lips. Her eyes were looking straight into mine - no longer shy or timid but full of lust instead.
'Do you want to come over here?' she asked me softly as she took off her dress, revealing a pair of black panties underneath that made my heart race faster than ever before in my life. I nodded quickly and walked towards her before pulling up the zipper on my own jeans and taking them off too - leaving nothing but an erection between us as we both lay down on top of each other's bodies.
I had never felt this way about any woman before, but I knew right then that there was something special about her which made me want to stay with her forever even if it meant giving up everything else in life just for her happiness and satisfaction alone. She kissed me deeply as we lay on top of each other's bodies until both our clothes were off completely, leaving nothing but two naked bodies entwined together in perfect harmony beneath a blanket full of warmth and love that had been missing from my own life ever since I was born into this world so long ago.
My name is John Smith and I am the one who has to face my wife's wrath now - all because of what happened last night when I couldn't control myself around a beautiful woman and lost my virginity instead! But even if she hates me forever, it will be worth every second that we spent together just for how happy she made me feel inside...

 'What the hell is wrong with you?You look like you've been hit by a truck.' I looked at him in surprise. 'I have been through a lot of things today, it seems.'
He nodded and poured himself another shot of whiskey from his glass on the table. 'You know, you should have told me about this sooner. What happened last night was completely unexpected - I mean we all knew something would happen sometime in the future but not so soon.'
I sat back in my chair and sighed deeply. 'It was just a stupid mistake that happened spontaneously,' I said softly, almost to myself. It felt strange to be talking about such intimate details with someone who wasn't even related to me by blood or marriage. But he was different from the others - we had known each other for over ten years now and it seemed like more than just a friendship between two men who happened to live in the same neighbourhood.
He was right though: I shouldn't have kept this secret from him until today, especially since he has been my only friend throughout all these years that I have lived alone here on Mars.
I stared into his eyes for several minutes before finally speaking again. 'I am sorry,' I whispered as tears welled up in their corners. 'I just couldn't help it.' He smiled and patted me lightly on the shoulder.
'It is all right, John,' he said softly, trying to reassure me that everything would be fine again soon enough.
That was when I told him about what happened last night - how I had lost control over myself after seeing her for the first time in a long while and how it felt like an eternity until she finally agreed to spend some time with me alone, away from everyone else's watchful eyes.
He listened patiently as I explained everything that transpired between us during our first night together - right up until this morning when we said goodbye forever because of what happened earlier today at work...
