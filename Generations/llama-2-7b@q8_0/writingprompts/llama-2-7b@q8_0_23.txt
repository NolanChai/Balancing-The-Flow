 one would mourn her, not like they did when her parents died. Her mother, who died giving birth to her, Eve had never known, but she knew her father. He was a kind man; he had taught his daughter how to cook and garden. And he was always there for her. She had loved him, and he had loved her back. But the moment she turned sixteen years old, he was gone. Her mother had died giving birth to her, and when the illnesses attacked her heart, Eve's father didn't stay by her bedside. He just left without a word of goodbye, leaving his little daughter alone in the world with nothing but a few letters from him telling her how much he loved her before he died.
Eve had never been very happy growing up. She had tried to please everyone around her, even when they were unpleasant people who hurt her feelings by not being nice back or acting as if she wasn't there at all. Eve had always wondered what it would feel like to be loved, but when the illnesses attacked her heart and forced her from this Earth before any man had ever told her that he wanted her in his arms forever.
Even now, though she knew death was close at hand, Eve felt no fear. The last few days of her life were filled with pain and agony, but as soon as they left behind the world of illness and pain, she felt a calm settle over her soul that had never been there before. For the first time in her life, she knew what it was like to be loved by someone who really cared about her happiness and well-being even if he was only a spirit from beyond this Earth.
It had been three years since Eve died on this planet with no one to mourn for her passing but herself as her heart beat its final few thumps against the walls of her chest before giving in and stopping completely, leaving behind an empty shell that would be buried in the cold ground below. Eve's body was cremated after it had been taken from the mortuary where it lay for three days waiting for someone to claim it as their own. Then they burned up everything about her life except what she left inside herself – a part of who she had once been that would never leave this world even when she did.
Eve didn't know how long it took for her spirit to reach the other side of death, but when she finally arrived in front of an archangel named Michael with tears streaming from his eyes because he had known all along what would happen to her on Earth and was so sorry that he couldn't have done something more. He was about to give Eve a hug before telling her how much she meant to him, but suddenly there was another presence in front of them both who said "Hey," as if they were long-lost friends catching up after many years apart.
"Who are you?" asked Michael curiously because he hadn't seen this person in ages either.
The spirit replied with a smile and then disappeared into thin air before anyone could ask any more questions about who or what it was that had just spoken to them both without saying its name aloud like everyone else does when they pass through these portals between life and death; instead, he just said "Hey," as if everything were perfectly normal for him.
The archangel named Michael knew that Eve was no longer here on Earth with her body because it had been taken to a mortuary where they kept all the dead people's remains until someone claimed them or until enough time had passed without anyone doing so, but when he looked down at where she used to be standing in front of him and saw that she wasn't there anymore either. It was like she had just disappeared into thin air leaving behind only an empty space filled with memories instead of flesh and bones - like how sometimes people disappear from our lives without any warning whatsoever despite knowing exactly when they're going to die due to medical complications caused by diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke or AIDS among others.
This spirit must have been so important for Michael because he couldn't help but smile at him warmly like an old friend who had just returned after being away from home for many years due to various circumstances beyond anyone else's control; however, as soon as this person said "Hey," before vanishing into thin air once again without giving his name aloud, it seemed that something bad was about to happen.
