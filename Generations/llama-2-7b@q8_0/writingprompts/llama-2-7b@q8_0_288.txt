2nd squadron commander spoke nervously as he pulled out the only other chair in the room, `` I think this is a good idea.''

 `` And why would that be?'' Rosario asked while leaning back in his own seat.

 `` Well sir, you know we have a new recruit coming in. We could use someone to help train her up.'' He added as he sat down. 
 
 Colonel Rosario raised an eyebrow at that statement. 
 
 ''I'm not sure that's necessary. I don't see what trouble she can get into with only one squadron.'' The colonel said, glancing to the side of his desk where a folder was sitting. He continued after taking a deep breath in through his nose and holding it for several seconds before releasing it slowly through his mouth. 
 
 `` It seems that this new recruit is an anomaly though. She's been assigned to me by the Commandant himself. I can't say exactly why he chose me but if he wants her with us, then she has to go somewhere and we happen to be here.''

 The colonel sat there for several seconds after that statement before speaking again. 
 
 ``Well,'' Rosario started slowly, ''I suppose it can't hurt. But you have to understand that she won't just be joining the squadron. She's going to be a part of this entire facility.'' The colonel said sternly as he leaned forward in his seat. 
 
 ``Yes sir!'' The commander replied, quickly nodding before turning back to look at the folder on the colonels desk. 
 
 ''You can read up on her while you wait for me to get her up here. We will be meeting with her today and she will begin training in a few weeks if all goes well.'' The colonel said as he stood from his seat and walked around the desk to close it before heading out of the office. 
 
 Once the door was closed behind him, the commander picked up the folder from the colonels desk. 
 
 ``I'm going to go back and finish my reports now.'' He said as he turned back to leave.

 ``Yes sir.'' The commander replied before heading out of Rosario's office.
