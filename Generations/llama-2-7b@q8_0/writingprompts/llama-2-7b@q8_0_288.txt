ographically between them. `` It is kind of you to offer me the use of your telephone. But I do not understand English. '' 
 
 She spoke French with the soft lilt of an Italian, the accent as fluid and uninterrupted as a mountain brook cascading over rocks. The sound of her voice was soothing and hypnotic, like warm water flowing over your skin on a winter day.
 
 ``Well, it's very simple,'' he began, pointing to his mouth, then making the motions with his hand of what he wanted her to do next. She nodded and repeated, `` Merci beaucoup .'' It was obvious she didn't understand but was trying, at least.
 
 He put down the receiver slowly and turned to face his guest. He wondered how much longer he could stand it. A week? Two weeks? How long before they were caught or discovered? It had been six months already. Six months of nights in her arms. Six months of lying beside her as she slept, breathing softly into the darkness of the night with a smile on her face and a curl wrapped around her finger.
 
 The ringing of the phone startled him; he almost jumped from his chair. `` Merci,'' he whispered to her in French. He took the receiver and held it to his ear, but no one was there. Again. This time he flipped open the directory and dialed the number himself: 1-800-HELP ME.
 
 It seemed like she was always trying to talk to him about her plans for tomorrow or what she wanted to do that night, but it never failed that they both ended up in bed, where he could touch her and hold her tightly, running his fingers through the silken strands of her long dark hair.
 
 ``Voulez-vous un caf√©?'' she asked sweetly. He shook his head no and turned back to the television, trying hard to concentrate on the baseball game. He felt her move behind him, leaning against his shoulder as he stared at the screen, waiting for a ball to be hit or a home run to be scored.
 
 Six months ago, when he was first introduced to her by some friends in Paris, he had never imagined that he'd still be there so long later. He had only come to Europe with his friend George for a three-week vacation, but now he found himself stuck in Paris and unable to go home. He felt like a fish out of water.
 
 She leaned against him, running her fingers lightly across the back of his hand as they watched the game together. The sound of their breathing echoed between them in perfect harmony. She rested her head on his shoulder and fell into an immediate deep sleep; he knew it was because she was exhausted from work but couldn't stop herself from being with him, even if just for a few more minutes.
 
 His mind began to wander as the sound of the ball hitting the bat echoed through the room. He remembered the first time they had met, and he could still remember every detail as if it were yesterday: how she was dressed in a skirt that came up to her knees and a red-and-white blouse; the way her eyes looked at him when they spoke together for the first time; even the name tag on her shirt that read ''Tina.''
 
 She stirred as he moved away from his chair and into bed beside her, but she didn't awaken. Instead, she pulled herself closer to him with a smile on her face. The sound of their breathing became one, in unison, and the music of the game echoed softly in the distance.
 
 It was only for an instant before he remembered what had happened last night. They had been watching a movie together when they both fell asleep, but not long after she woke up, she started screaming hysterically at him to leave her alone and never come back again because ''I love you too much!''
 
 He tried hard to remember what happened next, but all he could recall was that she had jumped out of bed, grabbed his keys from the dresser, and ran outside screaming as if someone were trying to kill her.
 
 It still frightened him when he remembered how terrified she was. He wanted so desperately to help her; it seemed like the more he tried to help, the worse things got for both of them. But all he could do was wait until morning and hope that they would be able to talk again like before.
 
 The ringing of his phone woke him up from his sleep and brought him back to reality. He answered it quickly, hoping that she might call him to tell him what had happened last night, but all he heard on the other end was static.
 
 He tried the number again later in the day with no luck. Maybe she'd gone somewhere else without telling him where? The thought of losing her made his stomach turn inside out and gave him a terrible pain in his head. But it couldn't be that way, could it? She had promised to stay with him forever, even if only for one more day or night together...
 
 It was the only thing he wanted more than anything else: just one last moment with her before they had to part forever. He knew she must still love him too because otherwise she wouldn't have asked him not to come back anymore when he tried to apologize afterward, but that wasn't enough for him now.
 
 His mind raced as the clock ticked on into the evening and he waited impatiently for her call again. He couldn't stand it any longer; he had to go out looking for her. It was his only option if he wanted to see her again before they were forced apart forever!
 
 The ringing of the phone woke him up from a sound sleep in which she lay next to him, one arm around his waist and her head resting on his chest as they both breathed slowly together. He felt like an animal trapped in a cage with no way out but through some secret passageway that would lead him back into freedom again someday soon...
 
 It was the sound of her voice calling for help that shook him awake completely this time; he heard it loud and clear, coming from somewhere outside his room where she must have been standing just moments before. He sat up quickly in bed and turned on all of the lights, trying desperately to find some sign that would tell him what was wrong but nothing seemed right until finally: ''Are you still there?''
 
 He felt as if he had been waiting his whole life for this moment; it was everything he needed and wanted more than anything else. The answer came quickly in a rush of excitement: ''Yes! Yes, I am here...and now!''
 
 She giggled at first before taking another deep breath and continuing to speak slowly while looking up at him from where she lay on the floor below his bedroom window with her arms around herself for warmth against the cold night air.
