ph to escape death. 
 
 I knew it would only end in pain. 
 
 "Nice job," she said. She stood over my body, still tethered to the floor. "You're going to make a great subject."
 
 I stared up at her. Her lips were parted. 
 
 A cruel smile played across them as she turned away and walked back to the console.
"I think it is time we go for a ride," she said.

# Chapter Three: The Journey

My head hurt so bad, I almost didn't notice when I was pulled up out of my chair by my collar. 
 
 There were three of them. 
 
 One had me by the shirt and another held a large metal tube in his hand. They dragged me to a door at the far end of the chamber and kicked it open. 
 
 I was thrown inside, then pulled back out into the hallway. The door slammed behind me. 
 
 "There he is!" 
 
 A voice shouted from down the corridor. 
 
 They were gone. 
 
 I turned around and saw a guard at the end of the hall. He had his gun pointed at my chest.
 
 There was no way out. I had to get by him. 
 
 Above me, on the ceiling, there was an access panel. 
 
 I took hold of it and pulled myself up. When I reached the edge of the floor, I looked back down and saw the guard. He wasn't paying any attention. 
 
 I crawled around the corner and into a dimly lit room that held four large sinks with faucets. There were no mirrors, but through the glass on each side of the wall I could see myself from every angle. 
 
 This was my first glimpse at what I would become after they had finished their work: a metal body with human eyes and lips.
 
 I saw something else in those reflectionssomething that didn't belong there. 
 
 It was the shadow of the man who stood behind me. 
 
 I turned to look at him, and he raised his gun. 
 
 "Freeze!" 
 
 There were two other men with him; each carried a different weapon. The one on my right side had a baton. It was pointed in the direction of my left shoulder. 
 
 I didn't need to see myself from all sides to know how this would end.
# Chapter Four: A New Life

They took me away.

I stood among them, but they did not treat me like one of them. They did not talk with me or even look at me directly. Their voices were hushed and their eyes darted around the room as if they feared I would attack.
It was a small room with four sinks and two mirrors on opposite walls. There was a door in each corner, and one in the middle of each wall. The mirrors did nothing to reflect our reflections. They were simply frosted glass set into frames that were bolted to the wall. I had seen similar things in other rooms where they worked with their creations before they took them out to be tested on the world below.
I had no idea what these people wanted from me, and I was scared when they led me across the room to one of the four sinks. They pushed my arms down into it until both elbows rested against the porcelain edge of the basin.
"Hey," I said. "What do you want from me?"
Their eyes met mine and they looked away. Then the man with the baton moved around to stand behind me, his weapon in position over my back. The other two had taken positions on each side of me as if we were going to be hanged for a crime we didn't commit. I thought that might be what they planned to do, but something else was going on here.
"Please," I said, "I just want you to tell me why—"
The man with the baton struck my right shoulder. The blow knocked me forward and I fell into the sink as pain exploded up through my arm and down the length of my spine. My body convulsed in agony. The cold water was ice against my skin, and I felt it running over everything except for what had just been hit by the baton.
I tried to stand but the men held me back with their weapons. "Get away from him," one said. He spoke with an accent so thick it was hard to understand a word he said. 
 
 The pain in my shoulder was intense, and I didn't know if I could move without passing out, but I fought to get up anyway. My arms were pinned down by the two men who held me tightly at each side of the sink. One of them had his gun pressed into my back.
"Please," I said again as he pushed the barrel against my spine and pulled it away with a violent jerk. 
 
 The pain in my shoulder was gone, replaced by another that ran down my right arm like an electric shock. As it passed through me I could hear myself screaming. It was the first time I'd ever done anything so loudly without thinking about it, but now I knew what it felt like to let go completely and just give in to whatever feelings you had inside you.
My body shook as if I were trying to shake away my own skin; my lips were pulled back into a grimace that was more animal than human. 
 
 "Stop! Please, stop!"
The men behind me held still for the first time since they'd come into the room. They seemed unsure of what to do next or maybe just too afraid of what would happen if I went completely out of control. 
 
 "You have no idea how bad this is going to get," one said, but his voice was quiet now and he sounded terrified. "We're not ready for that." 
 
 I didn't know what they meant by 'that', but I could tell from their expressions that it was something very serious indeed. They had no idea how serious though: neither did I, because at that moment my body began to change in ways I couldn't possibly have imagined. The pain in my right arm was gone and so were the men who held me down; instead of a man standing before them there was now only an empty shell, with nothing inside but memories.
 
 My head filled up with a million thoughts at once: every second that had ever passed by since I'd been born flashing through it like images on a movie screen—the good times and bad ones alike; the moments of happiness I shared with others as well as those of sadness; all those things we say to each other when we know there is no time left; everything from birth right up until this moment where my body was changing before their eyes.
# Chapter Five: The Beginning Of An End
 
 I can't explain what happened next, but suddenly it seemed like everything around me had become frozen in place while inside my head millions of images raced by so fast that all sense of time disappeared altogether. I felt as if I was being pulled into a vortex of memories and thoughts, as if every second of my life were passing before me at once—and it did! The entire experience took about five minutes but seemed like an eternity. 
 
 I could see myself walking along a beach with someone whose face had become blurred over time; then there was a picture of us standing together in front of our house when we were young children (I'm still not sure how they did that, since both my parents died long before I ever met them). 
 
 It seemed like there was no end to these images: people smiling at me from their old photographs; moments where something terrible had happened—and then there were good ones too! But all of it passed by in a blur until finally my mind came out on the other side. My thoughts settled down once more and I found myself standing in front of four men who were just as confused about what had happened to me as I was.
The two men with weapons held them pointed at my chest while one of them spoke in English: "You are hereby under arrest for the crime of murder." 
 
 I looked around and saw that everyone else in the room had gone quiet too; nobody made a sound except for one person who began to laugh softly. It was him—the man whose face had become blurred over time when he'd come into my mind earlier!
"What do you want from me?" I asked again, but this time it wasn't just because he'd hit me with his baton and knocked me down. Now we both knew what was going on here: they were going to kill us both unless someone changed their minds about how things had gone so far; at least that seemed like the logical conclusion to everything I'd seen until this moment when one of them stepped forward and placed something against my neck where his hand had been before. 
 
 A small metal disk came into view through an opening in this person's sleeve: it was attached by a wire which ran up his arm toward its source hidden inside his jacket collar; then suddenly there was a loud bang
