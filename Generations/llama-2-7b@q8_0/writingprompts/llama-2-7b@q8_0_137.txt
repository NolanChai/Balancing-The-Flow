IGHT THERE, we have to see 'em!'' Claire pleaded with me, clutching at my arm.
``Claire, listen,'' I whispered sternly as she leaned in towards me. I looked over her shoulder and caught a glimpse of something moving across the ground below us. I grabbed her wrist tight and pulled her down from the stall so that she was standing by my side instead. 
 ``We can't do this now,'' I whispered in her ear. I looked back out into the darkness once more, then closed my eyes again to better hear what Claire had to say. 
 `` But if they're here, they must have done something! If we don't stop 'em NOW, what will happen?'' she whimpered quietly. I leaned in and looked into her face as she spoke, still trying my best not to attract any attention from the creatures below. 
 ``I'll tell you what's going to happen if we stay here much longer: they're gonna find us, Claire. And then things are gonna get really bad.'' I said as firmly as possible. 
 ``But...but that sounds like something out of a book! If those guys in the movie were real, why would we be able to kill them? Why wouldn 't they just have killed us already if they could?'' She looked down at her hands and started to pout again. 
``We're not gonna do it,'' I said quietly, turning away from her. ``We'll find somewhere else to stay tonight - you can sleep with me for now if you want. But this is not the time for us to be out here, Claire. If we wanna survive this nightmare of yours, then we need to stick together and do what we know how to do: run, hide, and scream until it's all over.'' 
 `` But...but if there are monsters down there, why would they want to hurt us? Why wouldn't they just let us go?'' Claire asked again as I stood up and started towards the door. I turned back around one last time before walking into the darkness beyond the stall and tried my best to smile for her even though I didn't know what to say in reply. 
 ``Because they're monsters, sweetheart,'' I said finally as we stepped out into the night air and headed towards the exit of the barn where our horses were tethered outside. ``They don't like us either way. They just want us gone so that they can do what they want without fearing any consequences from us anymore.''
The following morning, Claire was still in a deep sleep as I carefully made my way out of the barn with one hand on her shoulder to wake her up and another ready to draw my sword in case something approached us while she lay unconscious on the ground. 
``Claire? Wake up!'' I whispered sharply into her ear, shaking her gently by her shoulders until I could feel that they had awoken with enough energy for them not just lie there passively but also able to move about freely without having too much difficulty doing so either way. 
``We've gotta go now!'' I said sternly as she struggled against me, trying to wake up from her dream while still being half-asleep herself at the same time.
When Claire finally did open her eyes, it took her a few seconds for them adjusted enough so that she could see everything clearly again. Then once they were bright enough again, there was no hiding how scared or confused she looked as soon as she saw what lay right before us: two zombies standing directly in front of where we had been sleeping only minutes before! 
 ``What's going on?'' Claire asked me, her voice shaking slightly. I took hold of the hilt of my sword and put it away quickly behind my back so that she wouldn't see it while trying to calm her down at the same time. 
``Well, now you know why I wanted us to leave right away last night!'' I said as sternly as possible in an attempt to distract from whatever else was happening around us just then.
But Claire didn't seem so easily convinced by this. 
 ``You mean because those things are gonna eat us?'' She asked, her voice sounding like it was on the verge of tears even though there were no actual tears rolling down her cheeks yet again at this moment. 
``No, I don't think they will!'' I said firmly as I tried my best to look serious even though I had no idea if that was actually true or not either way anymore since we hadn't really done anything to try and defend ourselves from these creatures so far yet in any case. 
 ``You sure about that?'' She asked me, her voice sounding as skeptical as ever before she finally stopped speaking entirely at last which meant that it was time for us both head back into the barn now anyway despite whatever else might still be happening outside there too! 
``Come on, let's go get our horses and leave this place behind us as quickly as possible.'' I told Claire once she had finally stopped talking again, trying my best to sound calm and reassuring even though deep down inside me I was beginning to wonder if that might actually be an impossible task right now in light of everything else going on around here at the time too...
The next morning, we woke up early to find ourselves surrounded by dead bodies. 
We had spent the night hiding under some hay bales and barrels so that nobody could see us or hear us if they walked past our hiding place; but it seemed that these zombies were still looking for something - maybe us? Either way, we couldn't stay there any longer because of their presence. 
So now Claire was standing in front of me with her sword drawn and ready while I held my own weapon as well - although not quite as confidently since this was my first time holding one against real people who might actually try to hurt us instead!
We waited for several minutes before making our move towards where we thought these creatures were coming from; but then suddenly they stopped moving entirely and began walking around in circles instead, leaving us feeling completely confused about what was happening at this point. 
``What's going on?'' Claire asked me again once more since she had no idea either way why these things hadn't attacked us by now - even though I did! 
I didn't say anything in reply because there wasn't really anything else I could do other than try my best not to think about what was happening here right then or how much trouble it might cause me later on down the line either...but all of those thoughts seemed rather useless anyway when you consider that they were only causing more problems than they were actually solving at present!
The sun was rising slowly over the horizon as we waited for a chance to strike. 
We'd spent most of our night hiding beneath hay bales and barrels, so we didn't have much experience fighting against these undead creatures that were stalking us from every direction. But Claire had told me about how she'd seen zombies before - they weren't hard to kill if you hit them in the head with a shovel or something similar. And I knew that I could do it too if necessary! 
I grabbed my sword from where it was resting against my back and held onto its hilt tightly while standing beside Claire, who had hers out as well. We waited for what felt like an eternity but probably wasn't more than a few seconds before they finally came into view again. 
There were four or five of them - all zombies that hadn't been killed yet by someone else but had instead just been left to rot in the open fields outside town where we lived now because nobody wanted anything else nearby either way! I could see their eyes glowing red behind their stiff arms as they stumbled forward towards us once more, looking for any signs of life anywhere close enough that might attract their attention if only just slightly. 
``What do you think?'' Claire whispered softly into my ear before we could say anything ourselves about what was happening here right now instead - although she knew perfectly well how scared I was by now! 
I nodded silently in response because there wasn't much else that either one of us wanted to do other than try our best not to get killed as soon as possible while still being able to protect each other too.
