 fact? That there is an alien life on Earth? And that they have been here for centuries…”
I feel my heart stop as he turns and looks at me, his eyes so blue it almost hurts. I have seen them before. He knows why we are here.
“ Are you telling the truth?” He asks softly, cautiously.
He looks confused; a little scared even? I shake my head quickly, hoping he can see the truth in my eyes as well. If only they could speak. I want to tell him everything…but that’s not what this is about. My heart sinks, “I don’t know,” I whisper, hoping my fear doesn’t show on my face.
He stares at me, waiting for an answer he knows won’t come; his eyes plead with me as they look into mine.
“ You can’t be.” He states, almost too calmly, “ There is no way I would believe you if you were. How could you…?” His voice trails off and he looks away from me, walking a few steps past me before stopping again to turn around, “It doesn’t make any sense…”
I know exactly what he means, but I don’t want him to go; I need his help. I take a step forward and touch his shoulder; my fingers dig into the soft cotton of his shirt. He looks down at me with tears in his eyes. “ I can prove it,” I whisper.
He turns away again, but doesn’t walk further this time. His hands clasp together in front of him as he speaks, “How?” His voice is strained and his eyes are desperate. I want to tell him…but there is something holding me back. What if it isn’t true?
“ Come with me,” I whisper, a soft smile spreading across my face, but it is quickly replaced by the fear that rushes through my body as he steps away from me and runs into his house. The door slams behind him, and I can feel the tears well in my eyes again. I haven’t been this scared since we first arrived here; on Earth…
The door opens and closes again behind him a second time before he walks back toward me with a hesitant smile on his lips, “You asked me to come with you? So now you’re just going to make me follow you somewhere?” He looks confused as I start walking towards the forest, but quickly falls into step beside me.
“I want you to see something,” I say, my eyes locked onto the ground ahead of us, “But I need your help…”
The leaves whisper in the wind above our heads and the sun dances on top of the treetops around us; a faint orange glow shining through the darkness. The forest is peaceful today, but this has been one of the worst weeks we have ever experienced here. It’s like all the pain that was once inside me has just disappeared…
I stop walking and look up at him from underneath my lashes; I want to tell him why I wanted him to come with me but instead, I shake my head slightly before turning back towards the woods, “Come on,” I whisper. He stares down at me for a second before he turns to follow, but stops behind me as we walk further into the forest.
“You know where we are going?” He asks, his eyes looking around nervously.
I nod slowly and take another step forward; I don’t want him to follow me, I need him to come with me. The trees around us seem to grow closer together as I approach them, but I don’t stop walking until we reach the other side of the forest. My heart races as my hand reaches up for the tree, feeling the cool bark on my fingertips; it feels so warm compared to the air outside that I have to smile.
The trees seem to fade away as they go from one side of the forest to another and now we are standing in an open field with only a few more feet separating us from our destination…a huge white house made completely out of glass; it almost looks like a castle floating through the clouds above us, but we all know this isn’t possible. I know my father would never let me walk into such a dangerous place without him being there to protect me and his eyes follow mine as he turns toward me, his hands clasped together in front of him again with an uncertain look on his face.
“Are you sure?” He asks again; the words sound like they are coming out of someone else’s mouth instead of his own…or maybe it’s just my imagination making things seem different than what they really are. I want to tell him that yes, this is exactly where we need to be right now because there may not ever be another time when everything will work out in our favor but instead all I do is nod slowly as he takes another step forward.
The door creaks open and the light floods through into the darkness of the house with a glowing green glare that almost hurts my eyes as they adjust to it after being outdoors for so long, “Come on,” He whispers again before turning around to lead me inside; his arm extends out in front of him like he is trying not to let go.
I take a deep breath as I step into the house and look up at the ceiling, which seems impossibly high above our heads but isn’t tall enough for me to see all the way down into its depths below us because this place doesn’t have any stairs or ladders leading down anywhere; it’s just an empty space between where we are standing right now and the floor, which is so far away that my eyes can’t focus on it anymore. I hear a door slam shut somewhere behind me as he shuts us in here with no other way out except through one of those large windows up ahead; but before we even get there our hands have been taken by force and pulled down toward the ground, “No!” My father screams at him before turning around to look at me again; his eyes are full of tears that he tries desperately not to let show on his face as they stare into mine.
I close my eyes tightly but it doesn’t stop the fear from building up inside me, “You can’t…” He whispers before looking back down at where our hands have been tied together and then he looks up again with tears running down his cheeks, “But why?”
“I don’t know,” I say honestly as I try to fight back my own panic and frustration that is starting to overwhelm me; this isn’t how things were supposed to go. We were going to be able to explain everything so easily then once they understood what was happening here on Earth there would never be any doubt about whether or not we belonged with them, but now…
“It doesn’t matter why,” He says calmly as he looks back down at our hands again; his voice is almost emotionless as if this were something that had been expected from the beginning. “What matters is how much you care about someone enough to go through all of this for them.” His eyes look deep into mine once more before he finally turns away completely and walks toward where we need to be standing right now; his body tense as he pulls on my hands harder than ever before, but I can’t do anything except follow him down the stairs that lead directly below us and out through one of those large windows.
I look up at our house again for a second before turning around quickly; there is no time to think about what just happened or where we are going next because this isn’t how things were supposed to go but instead everything has changed drastically since that first moment when my father came running into the forest with me trailing behind him.
“We need help,” I say softly as I stare down at him from above, “You can’t do this alone anymore.” The words sound like they are coming out of someone else’s mouth again; maybe it really is just my imagination making things seem different than what they really are? Either way, he doesn’t look happy about being told what to do so I take a step forward and reach down toward him before pulling on his shirt with all the force in my body…
The door opens behind us and we both turn around quickly as he walks into our house. It is dark inside but that does not stop me from seeing everything that’s happening; it’s like I am watching a movie play out right in front of my eyes, “I can help you,” He says softly before walking toward where we were standing only moments ago and reaching down for us both at the same time. My father looks up at him with tears rolling down his cheeks once more as if he doesn’t understand why this is happening; maybe because it isn’t supposed to be like this?
But then everything changes again when my father looks back into my eyes just before we are pulled inside through that door behind us…and suddenly we’re somewhere else altogether! It feels like we’ve been transported from one place to another without ever leaving the room where we were standing before. The air smells different and so does everything around me; but most importantly, my father looks at me with an expression on his face that I have never seen before…as if he knows exactly what happened here today despite not being able to understand why it’s happening right now because this isn’t how things were supposed to go!
