ase fire between the various factions.
It'd be nice if that extended to the common citizens as well. But I knew that wasn't going to happen. The people who hired them were just too scared not to use them. Fear made them forget their honor, their integrity. It was all about getting what they wanted as soon and painlessly as possible.
It took me a couple seconds to realize it wasn't a gun I heard. Just the sound of metal striking skin.
I whirled around, grabbing the guy by the throat, pulling him down onto my knee, using my other arm to pull out my pistol and place it against his temple. He stared at me with eyes wide, trying to breathe as he looked up at me. I pulled the trigger and a hole appeared in the man's skull.
He dropped backward, dead.
I stood up and walked over to another assassin who was standing across from him, watching what happened. He didn't look too happy about it.
"You okay?" I asked the assassin that had been attacked.
He nodded, not taking his eyes off me as he pulled a knife out of his chest and wiped away the blood running down it. The other guy wasn't even looking at him anymore. He was walking away, ignoring the assassination that just took place.
"The hell are you doing?" I asked. "Do you want to get yourself killed? That was one of mine! One of mine and now he's dead!"
"You know how this works, don't you? You kill my target, we both die," the other assassin said, turning around to face me. He wasn't angry. It seemed more like it was an annoyance that I had interrupted him. "We are not allowed to cross paths. You attack me and I will take care of your entire family."
"You don't need to threaten my family," I said. "I'll kill you without a second thought if you kill one of mine. If we both kill our targets, then it's off the record. We can never have any contact with each other again."
The assassin paused for a moment and nodded in agreement. Then he turned around again to walk away, but stopped before walking out of sight. "You know I don't like you, right? You're too..." He pointed his finger at me as he tried to think of the proper word.
I was about to tell him to go fuck himself when a shadow came over us. A man walked up and held two guns to each of our heads. "Anyone move or even blink and I will shoot you right here and now," the man said. The only thing I could see were his hands, waving around in front of my face as he held onto our necks with one hand and our foreheads with the other.
I knew what this was going to be about. There'd been rumors that there were some assassins in this city who worked for people other than their own bosses. I had heard all sorts of stories about how they were going after each other, killing people who weren't involved in any way with their jobs.
The man pushed us back and we fell to the ground. We were still facing away from each other but at least we could move our heads around and see what was happening. I got up first and turned my body around to face him. He had a gun pressed into my chest and another one pointing down at me as well.
"You're an idiot," the assassin said, looking back at his boss who now had two guns pointed at his head. "We were never supposed to meet again."
The man holding both of our heads spoke in a deep voice that sounded like it came from someone older than him. "I don't care if you're an idiot," the man said. "I want your target or I will kill you and then this other fool here as well." He pointed at each of us with one hand, making sure he was getting his point across to both of us.
"What do you want?" the assassin asked.
The man laughed. "You really think we don't know why you're out here? We are not stupid," he said. "I want my target and I will get him one way or another. What matters is that you kill him for me. If it takes killing both of us, so be it."
"You have the wrong person," the assassin said, pulling back from his boss' grip on our heads as he stood up. "I don't want anything to do with this job! I just wanted my target and leave. You killed one of mine and now you come after me? What kind of coward are you?"
The man who had both guns pointed at us laughed again, looking like he was enjoying himself a little too much. "I'm not here to talk," he said, pulling back the hammer on his pistol. He turned it around so I could see that there wasn't any bullets in it and then aimed it at my head. "All I want is what I paid for."
"And what would you have if we killed your target?" I asked.
The man looked up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he stared down the barrel of my gun. "If one of us dies then they both will," he said, pointing back and forth between each of our faces with both hands holding on to our heads again. "You don't need to kill him now...just wait for me in a couple days."
"I have other jobs I can take instead of this one," the assassin said, pulling himself free from his boss' grip and stepping away from us. He walked over to another man who had been watching from afar and spoke with him quietly before they both disappeared into an alleyway somewhere nearby.
"I'm not going to wait around for you," I told the man who was still standing in front of me, gun pointed at my head. "You want this job done? Fine then...you come after us."
"Don't be stupid!" he shouted back at me. "How do you think you are going to find us again? We will always stay one step ahead of your pathetic little organization! You will never catch up with us!" He fired off two shots, hitting the ground around us as we both ducked down.
I waited for him to reload his gun and when he did I jumped back up, taking aim at his head while firing twice myself before ducking again just in time for another shot from his pistol. We were both on our feet this time though and started trading shots between ourselves, trying not to get hit by any stray bullets.
It was a cat-and-mouse game as we tried to find each other's positions while making sure that none of the people watching us knew who was really after who. This went on for several minutes before we heard someone yelling from behind us, telling us that they wanted in on our little fight.
I turned around just in time to see another man with a gun pointing at my back. I put up my hands and stepped away from the two people fighting in front of me as he walked up to them, raising his own gun. He pointed it at both of their heads before lowering it again and saying "What are you doing here?"
The two assassins turned around just as fast as they could, firing off shots that hit him right between the eyes, killing him instantly. The three people who had been watching us all got out of there as quick as possible, leaving our bodies on the ground where we fell after getting shot in the head by another group of people waiting for us to finish up our fight before they could come in and kill us themselves.
After we were both dead from being shot in the head so many times that it was almost hard to tell how many times exactly there had been, one of these people came over to me, picked my body up by its hair and slammed it down onto the ground again before walking away without saying anything else at all.
