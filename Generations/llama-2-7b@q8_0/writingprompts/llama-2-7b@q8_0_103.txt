esse her out with an extra soda and slice of cheese pizza from a nearby shop. The end result: We both feel guilty and gain weight.
But for real: If you're in a relationship with someone who is not fit, healthy and happy, how can he or she be attracted to you? What attracted him or her to you initially if it wasn't that you were fit, healthy and happy?
If you don't have a lot of energy left by the time you get home from work, think about what is going on in your life. Are you stressed out, sad, bored or worried all day long? All those emotions will show up physically in your body as tension and fatigue.
To keep yourself in top shape, eat clean and exercise every day. You'll feel good about yourself and be more confident when dealing with the many challenges life presents to you. Your partner may not always be happy with what is going on but he or she will definitely admire how fit, healthy and happy you look!
If I tell people they need to eat healthier, the next question out of their mouth is: "What does that mean?" Here are some guidelines that I follow. I hope it helps you!
1) Eat whole foods only: Veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, fish and seafood (preferably wild caught), lean meat (grass-fed is best if possible). Limit processed or prepackaged foods that have more than five ingredients on the label.
2) Eat 5-8 times a day: I know it sounds like a lot but your body has an amazing way of telling you when and what it wants to eat. If you're hungry, then eat something. Your body will thank you for it!
3) Drink water: This is probably the most important tip I can give you. Without adequate hydration we do not function properly in our bodies. How much water should you drink? It depends on your size and activity level but a general rule of thumb is to divide your body weight by two. For example, if you are 150 pounds, you'll want to consume at least 75 ounces of pure, clean water (that's about nine cups or one gallon) each day!
4) Eat every three hours: If your digestion is a little off, try eating every three hours instead of every two. You will be amazed how much more energy you have when you feed yourself regularly and consistently throughout the day. And if you're trying to lose weight, this tip alone can do wonders for you!
5) Don't drink calories: Calorie-containing beverages such as sodas, juice, alcohol or coffee are best consumed in moderation (or better yet, not at all). Instead of reaching for a soda, reach for a glass of water and watch your energy levels soar!
6) Eat more vegetables: You know the saying "an apple a day keeps the doctor away"? Well, it's true. Apples are packed with nutrients that keep us healthy and our bodies functioning at peak efficiency. The same goes for other fruits and vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, broccoli and spinach to name just a few. So eat more vegetables!
7) Eat less sugar: Sugar is addictive because it causes us to crave more of it in our bodies after eating or drinking something sugary. But if you eat foods with natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup and coconut sugar (to name a few), your body will not be affected by these types of sweets in the same way that it would from white table sugar. So instead of reaching for candy or other processed sugars, reach for healthier alternatives!
8) Eat more protein: Protein is an important part of a healthy diet because our bodies need it to function properly and stay strong. This means eating things like chicken, fish (wild-caught salmon is best), eggs or nuts every day! And if you're not a meat lover? Don't worry, there are plenty of plant-based proteins available for those who want to avoid eating animal products.
9) Eat less refined carbs: Refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta and rice can cause blood sugar spikes that lead us down the path toward diabetes, heart disease or other chronic illnesses such as obesity or even cancer! Instead of reaching for processed foods with added sugars (like those mentioned above), reach for whole grains like brown rice instead.
10) Eat less saturated fat: Saturated fats are found in animal products and they've been linked to a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes and other chronic illnesses such as obesity or even cancer! Instead of reaching for things like red meat or cheese (both high sources), reach for healthier alternatives like fish oil supplements instead.
11) Eat less salt: Salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure so try not to add it to your food unless you absolutely have to do so because it can have negative effects on our bodies over time! Instead, season your food with natural herbs and spices like cinnamon, turmeric or rosemary instead.
12) Eat more healthy fats: Healthy fats are essential for brain function, cell membrane health (which affects how well the cells in our bodies communicate), hormone production and so much more! Instead of reaching for processed foods with added sugars or other unhealthy ingredients like hydrogenated oils/trans-fats found in things like fast food items, reach for whole avocados instead.
13) Eat less caffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that can cause us to become jittery and it may also lead us down the path toward dehydration which causes headaches! Instead of reaching for coffee or tea (which contains caffeine), reach for herbal teas instead.
14) Eat more fiber: Fiber helps keep our digestive tract moving along smoothly so that we don't have problems with constipation, hemorrhoids or diverticulitis (an infection of the large intestines). Instead of reaching for processed foods high in sugar and refined carbs, reach for whole grains instead.
15) Eat more omega-3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids are found naturally in fish oils like salmon, mackerel or sardines but they can also be consumed through supplementation if needed! These types of fats have been shown to lower triglyceride levels which helps reduce our risk for heart disease as well as inflammation throughout the body.
16) Eat more probiotics: Probiotics help support healthy digestion, immune system functioning and even brain development! They're found naturally in fermented foods like yogurt or kefir but they can also be consumed through supplementation if needed.
17) Eat more vitamins A&E: Vitamin A helps support healthy vision, skin and hair while vitamin E helps protect the body from free radical damage! These two nutrients are found naturally in things like leafy greens (like kale or spinach), orange fruits (like oranges) or even nuts such as walnuts.
18) Eat more minerals: Minerals help support healthy bones, teeth and muscles while also supporting brain development! They're found naturally in things like fish/seafood like salmon or halibut but they can also be consumed through supplementation if needed.
19) Eat more antioxidants: Antioxidants help protect the body from free radical damage caused by stress, pollution and even tobacco smoke! They're found naturally in foods like berries (like blueberries), green vegetables (like spinach or kale) or even dark leafy greens such as chard.
20) Eat less sugar: Sugar is addictive because it causes us to crave more of it in our bodies after eating or drinking something sugary! But if you eat foods with natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup and coconut sugar (to name a few), your body will not be affected by these types of sweets in the same way that it would from white table sugar. So instead of reaching for candy or other processed sugars, reach for healthier alternatives!
