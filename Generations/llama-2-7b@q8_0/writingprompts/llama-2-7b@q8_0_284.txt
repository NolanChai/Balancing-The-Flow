 at what seems like a small village on Earth with a group of people in front of you waving their arms and making a strange clicking noise that sounds similar to 'hello'.
For the past several months we've been living in a community known as Rathsalla. We're from several different worlds, and so are they; however, we all speak the same language and understand each other, mostly because it's the only language we can use right now.
We were given access to this village because we helped build an artificial intelligence called 'The Council of Factions'. It's a massive AI that represents every known faction in the galaxy with the intent to oversee the peace treaties between each and everyone of them, to make sure they abide by them.
Since we were unable to use our normal communications systems because it would take too long for the signal to reach us, they allowed us to speak to each other face-to-face in a place where no one could hear what was being said. We all know this isn't really possible; however, we believe there are ways around it as well as why The Council of Factions even exists.
The village itself is not like any village on Earth. It has about 20 houses surrounding a central building. Our meeting room is one of the houses where we gather to discuss how we will make this whole thing work and how it's all going to end. We call the building our 'Council House', but it also includes an entire wing where each of us stays.
We have about 200 people in total, divided between males and females; however, no one actually knows what their gender is anymore. There were several individuals who underwent a process called 'gender realignment' to help them be accepted by the other members of our society. I was one of those that decided it was important for me to change my identity into something else other than male.
I won't go too far in detail about what happened during this procedure, but let's just say things changed forever after that moment; however, it also means we are all now the same gender regardless of our biological sex. We call ourselves 'Androxen' for short and refer to each other with pronouns such as 'they/them', instead of 'he/him' or 'she/her'.
The village is located in what used to be known as Canada, so there isn't much left after the nuclear war that happened several years ago. We call it a 'fusion bomb'; however, the actual name is more complex than that. It was created by an organization called "The Shadow Council" which is now defunct. They were able to create this weapon using technology found in one of their own satellites.
When you come into contact with this technology, it begins to absorb you until everything becomes part of the weapon itself. After that point there isn't much left but dust and debris which gets blown away by winds across our galaxy.
The village was chosen for its proximity from Earth, so it makes sense that we would be here since we were all part of The Council of Factions at some point in time before being transferred over to this location.
We live in a small community surrounded by woods and meadows filled with wildlife like deer, rabbits, foxes, etc., but not much else due to the fact that most animals don't survive after being exposed for too long to radiation levels found within this area of Canada known as "The Wasteland."
We are here to find peace and we will do what it takes to keep it. We have already been attacked by several factions trying to stop us from doing our job, but we have held up quite well against them so far. I'm proud of my fellow Androxen because they are strong and determined people who never give up even when faced with impossible odds like this one.
