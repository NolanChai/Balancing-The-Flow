aqur [small sheep] at my father's farm in Galilee.'' Another answered simply, `` A girl.'' And yet another, `` I was happy.'' The stories were just as varied and beautiful: a woman who used to play soccer in Yemen; an old man who was once a doctor in Baghdad; a woman whose childhood friends became her husband's bodyguards after he became prime minister of Israel; and a man who was the best dancer at his wedding in Iraq. 
 
 One by one, these men, women and children, all refugees from war-torn lands, told their stories to photojournalist Chris Barton on film. But now Barton's work goes far beyond just taking pictures; he's also sharing the stories of his subjects in a book, ''Before the War: Stories From Survivors'' (Simon & Schuster). 
 
 The project began as an assignment for a photojournalism class. `` I wanted to find a way to showcase my work and show people that war doesn't only have one face; it has different faces,'' Barton said in a recent interview with Jewish Telegraphic Agency at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia where he spoke about his book. 
 
 The 32-year-old American also wanted to shed light on the plight of refugees and show that people are more than just a statistic, but instead are individuals who have unique lives with histories, hopes and dreams like everyone else. `` It's a human story before being a war story,'' he said. 
 
 The book has been well-received by critics. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Mark Z. Barabak called it `` an eye-opening project that illustrates the enduring humanity of refugees and their struggles for dignity in circumstances often defined by indignities.'' In a review of Barton's book on NPR, Randy Shilts wrote: `` 'Before The War' is both deeply personal and profoundly political, a stunning testament to the human spirit and a sober reminder that war has no end. '' 
 
 `` I think that if we can get people to look at these refugees as people just like them instead of people who are different, maybe they'll be more sympathetic toward those who have been displaced,'' Barton said in the JTA interview. 
 
 Although Barton did not meet with most of the people he photographed for his book until they had left their war-torn countries and settled down somewhere else -- often after living through several wars -- many of them remained deeply connected to where they came from, even years later. 
 
 A Palestinian man from Gaza named Yousef who now lives in Jordan told Barton that he wants to return home one day and rebuild his country. `` I always say I'd like to die there,'' the photographer said, quoting Yousef. Another young Palestinian refugee from Gaza, Nahla, spoke of her desire to visit Israel once again -- as a tourist this time. 
 
 A man from South Sudan told Barton that his father was killed in a civil war and that he, too, had fled the country because he feared for his life. The man now lives in a refugee camp in Uganda. But he misses his homeland so much that he longs to return there someday as well. 
 
 Barton said that although the project was challenging and difficult at times, it was also rewarding. `` There were days where I felt like this is a losing battle; people are suffering and you're taking their pictures and then they go away,'' he told JTA. `` But I think the stories were really compelling enough that I wanted to show them to people who would care about it -- and hopefully it will lead to action, but also make people more aware of what refugees around the world are going through and maybe lead people to donate or do something for them as well. '' 
 
 A New York resident, Barton is a former newspaper photographer who now freelances for publications including Newsweek and The Boston Globe. He has lived in Israel and studied at Tel Aviv University, and he is a native of the Philadelphia suburb of Bala Cynwyd. `` It was really important to me that I go to countries where the Jews live,'' Barton said.
