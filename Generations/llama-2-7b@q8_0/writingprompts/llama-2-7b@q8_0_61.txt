 his fingers as he gazed up at the ceiling of the ship. It had been six hours since they were attacked by the Flying Tigers. They'd lost one fighter jet during the fight.
A deep rumble reverberated through the hull and MacDow knew the time was coming to leave for another mission in China, although he didn't know where or what it would entail. He wasn't even sure why they were in China anymore. They could have stayed on Earth and fought the Tigers there. But he supposed someone had decided that being so close to China, it made sense to fight them here as well.
He tossed his coin across the room, catching it by its edge. He stood up and walked towards the hatchway and then stopped. He turned back toward the bed. Sitting down on it he pulled a pouch from inside his tunic. It contained his personal items - some coins, his watch, his dog tags, and other small knickknacks from his mother and father. He closed the lid of the pouch tightly as he began to tear up.
A soft knocking on the hatchway made MacDow stand abruptly. His face went pale. The door slid open a crack, revealing a shadowy figure. It was Lieutenant Colonel Tank.
MacDow swallowed hard and then nodded, accepting his fate. He stepped forward to the doorway and stood before it. 
``I am ready.'' 
 
 
 
 MacDow watched as the ship they were flying in began to lift off from the Chinese city of Shaoxing. They had been ordered here by the Allied Nations in response to an invasion of the Japanese into China and to protect their oil supplies from the Flying Tigers. This was his first mission with the Tiger Corps, the aerial armada of the UN that patrolled the skies over China. He glanced across the aisle at the man he had met only moments before. Lieutenant Colonel Tank was tall and lean with long, thick hair and dark blue eyes. MacDow could see a thin scar on his left cheek, as well as an amulet around his neck, which caught MacDow's attention. He was a little nervous about flying in the new fighter jets with him as he had only been in China for two weeks and was still getting used to them. 
As they climbed into the sky, Tank turned towards MacDow and spoke softly but firmly: ``You're my wingman now. If I die, you fly this jet back to base and get a new one.''
MacDow nodded his head in acknowledgement. The two men had been paired together on their first mission since arriving in China, when they had lost one of their jets. Now, with only the two remaining, MacDow knew he must be Tank's wingman, and that he would protect him if necessary.
As they flew over the clouds towards the coastline, a roar emanated from below them. It was an entire fleet of Japanese planes flying toward their location. 
``Hold on!'' MacDow shouted as his jet began to shake violently. The enemy plane flew close enough that he could see two men inside it and feel the heat from the exhaust emitting from its propeller. They were going in for a strafing attack, but Tank was already firing upon them with his machine gun. MacDow watched in horror as Tank's bullet shattered the plane into pieces and sent them plummeting to the ground below.
The adrenaline rush faded quickly and he sat back, exhaling sharply. His stomach felt like it was going to erupt at any moment. He turned towards Tank for a second but could only see his silhouette as his face was cast in shadow. 
As they continued flying, MacDow thought about what had happened and how scared he'd been when the Japanese plane came so close. It didn't help that he couldn't even hear Tank speaking over the noise of the engines. He didn't want to admit it but he was afraid Tank might be dead.
The mission continued on for hours as they flew farther and farther westward towards Beijing. The sun had already set behind them when MacDow noticed the sky turning orange in the distance. It was then that he realized what must have happened - the Japanese were firing upon the Chinese city of Hangzhou. 
MacDow began to feel more relaxed, even though they were still under fire from enemy planes. He knew it would be a while before he could go home and see his parents again but at least he wasn't afraid anymore. The two men had been through a lot together already and MacDow felt like they had become friends. 
As they neared their destination, MacDow was shocked to see thousands of Chinese soldiers marching toward them in formation on either side of the road. They were carrying guns as large as cannons and wearing white armor that gave them a menacing appearance in the darkness. But it wasn't until he saw several Chinese warplanes flying overhead that MacDow realized just how serious this attack was going to be.
They landed in Beijing at dawn the next morning and were greeted by crowds of people lining up on either side of the road. The soldiers had already cleared a path for them so they could drive right through without stopping. Once again, MacDow found himself gazing up into Tank's face as he stood beside him in their cockpit and listened to his orders - this time for landing procedures instead of fighting instructions. 
When they arrived at the air base, they were greeted by other UN soldiers who had also been dispatched from Earth to help defend China against further attacks from Japan. The commanders gave them a briefing on what was happening and told them about their mission - to destroy an entire fleet of Japanese warships that had just arrived in Shaoxing Bay off the coast of Hangzhou City. 
The next day, MacDow and Tank flew into battle once again alongside their fellow UN soldiers as they attacked the Japanese ships. As bullets ricocheted around them, MacDow found himself wondering what would happen if he were struck by one - whether it would hurt or kill him instantly. But he pushed those thoughts aside when he spotted an enemy plane shooting at another one of theirs and began firing on it instead.
The battle continued for hours as they fought against the Japanese forces in order to protect China from further invasion attempts. MacDow could hear Tank giving orders over his radio but couldn't understand a word since they were both wearing headsets that blocked out all outside noise except for what was happening inside their own cockpit.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity but in reality had been only four days, the fighting came to an end with no casualties on either side thanks to a truce negotiated between UN commanders and Japanese officials who were present at Hangzhou City during its siege by Allied forces. 
After this battle, MacDow felt more confident than ever before about being able to fly alongside his fellow soldiers without fearing for his own safety or that of others around him - even though he knew they had just survived their most dangerous mission yet due to a combination of skill and luck rather than anything else.
