irdryer on my bedside table, then placed it in its holster before walking to the bathroom. I opened the door and flipped on the light switch. The room was dimly lit by an overhead lamp which had been left on.
I made a quick walk through the shower cubicle which was directly across from me. My reflection stared back at me. 
 
 The mirror above my vanity was darkened. A thick layer of dust had built up on it and now covered the entire glass surface. I could see myself clearly, but only because of the light coming through the bathroom window. 
 
I reached into a drawer next to the sink and grabbed some cotton wool from my personal stash of bandages that were stored there for emergencies. I then walked back out of the room and over to where the hairdryer sat on its holster. 
 
 The red light was flashing, letting me know the machine was ready to be used. I plugged it into the wall socket and turned it on. The motor hummed for a moment as it came up to temperature and then started to blow hot air onto my wet hair. 
 
 I reached around to the back of my head and began to dry myself, all the while thinking about what happened last night.

 A caravan. I was in a caravan parked out on the dunes. The sound of waves breaking against the shore could be heard from outside and it created a rhythmic tune that lulled me to sleep. 
 
 I woke up at some point during the night and walked into my bedroom where there was a small kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, sink, etcetera. 
 
 My wife sat on her own in front of the television which showed some stupid cartoon that I'd never seen before. She had a cigarette in hand and I could smell the smoke coming from it as it filled the room. 
 
 "Hey, honey." I walked over to her and kissed her on the cheek, then took her cigarette from her and threw it away. The filter made a satisfying pop when I hit the ash tray next to where we were sitting. 
 
 My wife looked at me with tired eyes that didn't seem to see anything. She just sat there in front of the television looking as though she was in a daze.
"You okay, love?" I asked her, putting my arm around her shoulders and pulling her closer towards me. 
 
 She nodded back at me but continued watching whatever was on the screen. "Do you want to watch this stupid cartoon or would you rather get some sleep? It's nearly four in the morning." 
 
 My wife looked up at me and smiled. There was something about her that made me want to hold her, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Instead, I just sat next to her and let my eyes drift back over towards where our bedroom was. I could see the light on in there and knew she was asleep because of how peaceful everything looked. 
 
 "I don't want to watch this stupid cartoon," she said before turning off the television and putting it into standby mode. She then stood up from her chair with a smile, stretched out her arms in front of her and started walking towards our bedroom door. 
 
 I was about to get up too when we were interrupted by what sounded like someone banging on our window. It took me a few seconds before I realised that it was coming from the outside. The sound came again, this time with a loud thud! and then there was silence. 
 
 "What was that?" my wife asked as she walked closer towards where our bedroom doorway was located. She had her hand placed on the handle when another bang echoed around in front of us, followed by some shouting. It sounded like a man's voice but I wasn't sure how far away he actually was. 
 
 The sound of footsteps running down the sandy dune filled our ears before there were more voices outside calling out for help or something similar to it. 
 
 My wife grabbed hold of me and pulled my arm towards her as if she wanted us both to go over to where the noise was coming from. "I'll be back," I told her before walking away in the opposite direction with no intention of ever coming back.
# Chapter One - The House That Jack Built
As I walked through the darkened bathroom and into my bedroom, I realised that something wasn't right. It was like there was a presence lurking behind me. 
 
 I turned around to see what it was but saw nothing out of place or unusual in any way. The light from outside bled through the curtains in front of my window and made everything appear to be normal. Still, I could not shake this feeling that someone was watching me so I decided to turn off all of the lights. 
 
 A moment later, there was a knock on my door followed by an even louder banging as something heavy hit against it from the other side. 
 
 "Who's out there?" I asked before realising that nobody was actually going to answer me. It wasn't until after asking this question that I noticed how quiet everything had suddenly become. No more footsteps ran down the dune, no more voices called out for help and no more banging against my door. 
 
 I stood in front of it with one hand placed on the handle while the other held onto my hairdryer which was still plugged into the wall socket next to where our bed sat. It made me wonder if maybe whoever knocked had been outside all along and was now waiting for me to let them in? 
 
 I took a deep breath before turning around again and walking back out of my room with the hairdryer still clutched firmly between my fingers. 
 
 As soon as I reached the door, there was another knock on it followed by another bang against the wood that made me jump in fright! My hand released its grip on the handle but only for a second before grabbing back onto it once more when I realised what had happened. 
 
 "Hey, who's out there?" I asked again while my heart beat faster than usual and an uneasy feeling settled inside of me that refused to let go no matter how hard I tried to ignore it. There was a silence before another knock came through followed by more banging against the door itself which made me wince in pain as if someone were actually hitting it with their fist! 
 
 "I'm coming," I told whoever might be outside but all of a sudden there was no more banging against my bedroom door. Instead, footsteps ran down the sandy dune and then a voice called out for me to open up before the sound of something being thrown against my front window made it impossible for me to ignore what had happened any longer! 
 
 The glass shattered into pieces with a loud crack that sent chills all over my body. It was like I could feel the coldness creeping in from outside and I couldn't help but wonder if maybe whoever broke into our home wasn't alone after all? 
 
 My wife started to scream for me which made it difficult to think clearly about what I should do next. All of a sudden, there was another bang on my bedroom door followed by another shout from outside that demanded I open up or else they would break through the lock! 
 
 "I'm coming," I called back out but only after taking one last look at myself in front of my bathroom mirror. My eyes were wide with fear and there was an uneasy feeling settled inside me that refused to let go no matter how hard I tried. 
 
 The door swung open a moment later as my wife stood on the other side holding onto her dressing gown which had been pulled up above her knees before falling down over top of them both when she took it off without saying anything else at all! 
 
 I reached for what looked like an axe that was lying against where our bedroom doorframe met with the floor and held it close to my chest while walking out into our living room area. The light from outside bled through our curtains which made everything appear normal but still, there was this feeling inside of me that told me something wasn't right about any of it at all! 
 
 As soon as I stepped foot in front of where our kitchen sink stood next to where the fridge and microwave were located, there was another bang on my bedroom door followed by a shout from outside saying they had broken through the lock and would kill both me and my wife if we didn't come out now! 
 
 I put down what looked like an axe that I held tightly in front of my chest while walking back towards where our bed sat with one hand placed on top of its mattress before reaching for something else inside another drawer which seemed to be filled with all sorts of sharp objects. 
 
 It was then that a man's voice said from behind me, "You should really stop hiding out like this." He sounded calm and collected despite having broken through our bedroom door as well as throwing something against my front window too
