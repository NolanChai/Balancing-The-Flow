amp. It had been a long day at work, 
 It was the day before Halloween and I had just got home from work. I was feeling slightly hungover, still in my uniform and ready for bed when I heard a knock on the door. 
 
 My head hurt as I slowly moved towards the window to see who it could be, then I saw it; two kids dressed up in their own version of Halloween costumes, looking through my bin with an empty bag in hand. 
 
 
 Soon after that I was sat down with a mug of coffee, staring blankly at the wall as I tried to keep myself awake and functioning again. It's funny how you never realise just how exhausted you are until something wakes you up from your daze. 
 
 
 At this point it had been about twenty minutes since my alarm went off, I hadn't even bothered to put the kettle on as yet; instead I was sat at my laptop with a cup of coffee in my hand and an empty stomach. This wasn't how my morning had panned out when I'd set the alarm clock for 7am but here I was, working from home as always.
 It hadn't even been halfway through my morning routine that the sound of a knock came again on the front door and this time it was louder than before, like someone was trying to get in. 
 
 
 "I have no idea who you are." I said with a tired voice as I shuffled downstairs and opened my eyes for the first time since waking up. My eyelids felt heavy as they lifted, almost holding me back from seeing what was on the other side of the door. 
 
 
 As I reached the bottom step I could see an adult in a police uniform standing outside of my front door and looking inside with concern. He looked at me with wide eyes. "Can I help you officer?" I asked as I slowly closed the gap between myself and him. 
 
 
 "Yes, it's about what happened yesterday morning." he said softly, not wanting to startle me. "Well if you don't mind just coming in here please." I answered back as he started to push open my door, but stopped suddenly and pulled away from the door knob. 
 
 
 "I can't believe that was a real thing." I said quietly, feeling like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my ribcage. "Are you okay?" he asked as we walked into the living room and sat down opposite of each other on the sofa. 
 
 
 As he took his seat I closed my eyes and let out a deep breath before opening them once again, staring at him with a look that made it obvious I was ready to hear what was coming next. "We've been running tests on the material found in your bins, and it has come back as being human tissue." He said simply. 
 
 
 At this point there were two things going through my mind, one of which was just how stupid I must have sounded to people when I first explained what had happened yesterday morning. The second thing that was running through my head at that exact moment was how my entire life up until this point had been a lie and I hadn't even known about it. 
 
 
 My body felt numb as the officer continued with his story, telling me exactly what he knew to be true and what he thought would make sense in regards to the whole situation. It wasn't long after we had sat down that my mum came home from work, ready for a break from her own job as she worked 5-10pm most nights of the week. She looked confused at first but then concerned when she heard what he was saying.
 I never understood the importance behind Halloween until this point in time. This is why I had never celebrated it, and for a good reason. It's not all fun and games, in fact sometimes it can be pretty scary to some people and now I understand that all too well.
