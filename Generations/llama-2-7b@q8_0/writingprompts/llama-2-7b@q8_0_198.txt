 in here. My legs feel leaden and my lungs are filled with pins and needles. The air feels as if it were coated with some sticky substance. My hand searches for something to hold on to so that I can stop falling. What is this?! This isn't my room! I look around in horror, but it seems like I'm stuck inside a nightmare.
The walls are painted in blood and the ceiling drips with entrails. Bodies lie scattered throughout the floor, torn open and mutilated, each one filled with enough gore that any reasonable person would scream for their mother, but there is no escape. The dead, they're walking. Their eyes have turned to stone. Their mouths are covered in bloody grins. They seem to be happy about something. I watch as they go about the business of life and death with no regard for those who cannot do anything else except exist in their horrifying world.
I can't stop shivering, my teeth chatter uncontrollably. I'm trying to make sense out of all this, but it isn't going anywhere. The dead seem to be everywhere and they don't care if you're a cop or a murderer, an angel or the devil, a man or a woman, black or white. They simply kill without prejudice or mercy. They kill everyone, and then what? This is all pointless! This is...
"MOMMY!" I shout as loud as I can, "This isn't real! It's just another dream that you put me through." My mother comes running into the room with a flashlight. She flicks it on, lighting up my room and the surrounding area in a dull yellow glow.
"You okay baby girl? You were screaming again. This place is too old to handle all this stress," she says as she walks over to me and begins checking me for any injuries or bleeding wounds. "Just relax, we'll get you into the clinic and you'll be fine."
"Mommy? I wasn't screaming in a nightmare! I was yelling at those monsters!" My mother smiles sadly as she checks my cuts. She gently dabs at them with a sterile cotton swab. "No more dreams baby girl, the nightmares are gone."
"But mommy..."
My mother stops what she is doing to look me straight in the eye. She places her hands on either side of my head and shakes it slightly back and forth as if I were a doll that needed re-setting. "It's over now," she says calmly, "You're going to be okay."
"I don't want to forget what happened mommy! You promised you wouldn't let me forget!" I say, trying my hardest not to cry as I look away from her eyes. This isn't making any sense! Why is she saying these things? Is this real or some kind of cruel joke? "Please tell me that the monsters are gone mommy! Please please PLEASE!!!"
My mother lets go of my head, but instead of patting my shoulder like she usually does she takes her hands and grabs both sides of my face. Her eyes look right into mine and I can feel myself starting to drift away from reality. "You know what dear? You're right." She says as she holds me up with one hand, the flashlight dangling down between us like a deadly weapon, "Those monsters are gone and I won't let you forget it!"
She lets go of my face and grabs me by the waist. My feet leave the ground and I float into the air as she begins to carry me out of my room. She flicks off the light and shuts the door behind her before taking me down a long, dark hallway. As we walk past the doors that litter each side of us I see glimpses of what lies on the other side of those doors: skeletons with empty eye sockets staring at me, a man lying in his bed with one eye missing, another hanging out of its socket, and there are even some with no faces. All I can do is scream silently into my mother's shoulder as she continues to walk down the hallway like it was any other day.
"Stop screaming baby girl!" She says as if I were a child who didn't know any better, "The dead don't hurt us anymore." The halls go on and on as we pass more doors that seem to be leading to different sections of the hospital. There are a few hallways that lead down to the basement. As soon as we walk into one I can feel my heart beat start racing again, but there is no going back now.
"Don't worry baby girl, you won't see anything on your way." My mother says as she walks past another dead body lying face up in its own pool of blood and guts. She stops at the door that leads to the basement. "Here we are dear," she says with a smile as she opens it and lets me in, "Let's go see your father."
I walk into the room without hesitation. I don't even glance to my left where one of the doors lies open, revealing a skeleton on its knees with his hands tied behind his back and a gaping wound in his head. His eyes stare at me like they knew that I was coming for them before I ever even got there. This isn't real! There's no way this could be happening to me now...
"That's him baby girl," my mother says with an excited smile on her face as she holds up the picture of a man who looks just like me, but with black hair and blue eyes. "And that's his name!" She points at it proudly, "I had forgotten what it was until you mentioned it just now."
My head feels heavy and I can feel myself drifting away again. I don't want to forget this! Not like before! This time it is for real...
"There you are mommy," a voice calls out from across the room, "I thought I heard something. Come on in we haven't seen you in ages." My mother turns and smiles at me, her eyes bright with excitement as she walks into the room where my father lays sleeping peacefully in his bed.
"That's him baby girl!" She says as she stares down at him like a proud parent would their child who just got into college. "Your father looks good for a man of his age don't you think?"
I look over to where the voice came from and there he is, my father laying in bed with an oxygen mask covering half his face while he sleeps. My heart sinks as I take a step back into the hallway. He looks so small compared to how big we used to be when I was young. Is this what happens after you grow up? Do all your problems go away and people forget about them? Or do they just come back with more power than ever before?
My mother comes out of nowhere, wrapping her arms around me from behind as she begins to lead us down another hallway towards the basement. "Now don't you worry baby girl," she says in a reassuring tone as we walk past more doors that lead into other rooms with people lying on beds or sitting in chairs waiting for their turn, "You won't see anything bad on your way down." She smiles at me before continuing our walk.
"What about those skeletons mommy? What if they try to kill us again?" I say as I look back and see one of the doors still wide open with a skeleton kneeling in front of it holding its hands out for help while blood drips down from his head wound onto the floor below him.
"Don't worry dear, your father won't let anything happen to either one us." She replies as if there were no skeletons in sight at all and she had never seen one before today. "You just need to hold on a little longer...until he wakes up again." I look back at her with confusion as we continue our walk towards what seems like a bottomless pit of death waiting for us down below.
"How long do you think it'll take?" My mother shrugs her shoulders, "I don't know dear, but I hope he doesn't wake up anytime soon."
The hallway leads to the basement stairs which lead all the way down into the darkness below them. There are no lights on anywhere in sight except for one small one near where we enter through a door that says "No Trespassing" written across its front panel with red paint dripping from its edges.
We step onto the staircase and I can feel my heart pounding again as if it were going to beat out of my chest at any moment now...
