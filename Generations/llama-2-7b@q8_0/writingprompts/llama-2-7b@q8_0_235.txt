1x12 and 1x15 come to mind as good endings for this show. I want to feel like the finale will be something we'll remember, not that it was "a great last season" or a big farewell to the cast but that the final episode was truly special and worth watching over again.
I hope you do too, that would make me very happy!

That was what I thought when I watched the last scene in "Tell Me A Story", I felt sad but I also got goosebumps.
