 so dimly through his open mouth. But it didn't matter because I couldn't see anything anyway—his eyes were closed—and besides that, his teeth were still covered with a thick layer of blood.
I was lying on my back on the ground and the body was lying right next to me. He was dressed in clothes that seemed very familiar. I wanted to say something but then realized what an idiotic idea that would be because I could tell from his expressionless face that he couldn't hear anything anyway.
His legs were a little bent at the knees and I knew they were broken because I had snapped them in half with my foot. There wasn't any blood though, which was strange—I mean, if you broke someone's legs there would be plenty of blood. But not on this guy, just a tiny stream that trickled down his leg to the ground and then dried up.
The only thing that seemed familiar about him was something I could see in his left hand: a small key ring with two keys. This is where my confusion came from because he had been sitting right next to me when I killed him, but at this point it didn't seem like such a big deal anymore. The most important thing was that I was now lying on top of the body and this bothered me for some reason—maybe because he had once been human and now there was nothing left but his rotting corpse.
I got up carefully, using my feet to push myself back onto the ground so as not to step in any blood or whatever else might be dripping from him, and I went over to the edge of a nearby cliff where there were some very tall trees growing near it. Their branches stretched out toward me like long arms trying to pull me away from my hiding spot, but all at once they stopped and instead leaned against each other so that their shadows fell upon me like an ominous cloud, blocking out everything else from view.
I stood there for a while trying to calm down because I was still very upset about what had just happened, which made it difficult to think clearly. But after some time had passed I finally remembered why this guy's clothes were so familiar; it was because they looked exactly like those that my father used to wear when he went on hunting trips with me as a child—and now here they lay next to him in his final resting place.
It seemed like forever before the sun began to rise and illuminate everything around us in its warm orange glow, making it possible for me to see where I was standing at last without any help from my imagination or memories of better days gone by...
