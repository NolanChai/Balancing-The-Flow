 us? You think we are going to let you steal our most valuable resource just because you show up here?” another woman said sternly. 
 
 “ No, of course not,” the scruffy man replied in an equally stern tone. He slowly sat down on a chair across a table from them and motioned for his two female companions to do likewise. Once they had seated themselves, the man reached into his pocket, pulled out a small object that resembled a tape recorder or some similar device with a microphone on one side, then placed it on the table in front of him. 
 
 The woman who spoke first seemed to be in her mid-thirties with auburn hair that was pulled back behind her head and tied into a tight bun. She wore a business suit consisting of a skirt and blouse. Her name, as far as he knew, was Latrina. 
 
 The other woman who spoke second had shoulder length dark brown hair in a ponytail and a rather large nose. She seemed to be slightly younger than the first woman but also wore the same style of business suit. He assumed she was the one known as Dexa. 
 
 “ So what do you want from us? ” Latrina asked again, this time with a somewhat more subdued tone in her voice. She leaned back in her chair and placed her hands on her lap. 
 
 “ I need you to turn over all the data that you ’ ve been collecting on the new weapon system, ” he answered, holding his gaze on Dexa. “ The one developed by your scientists at the research facility? ” 
 
 Latrina glanced at Dexa before turning her attention back to the scruffy man again. 
 
 He paused for a moment and then continued, “ I ’ ve been told that it has the potential to be quite effective in ending this war we ’ re currently engaged in with the Shadows. ” 
 
 Dexa, who had sat silent during most of his conversation with them so far, suddenly spoke up, “ The Shadows are a problem but I doubt this thing will fix everything.” 
 
 He smiled and said, “ And why ’ s that? ” 
 
 Her eyes narrowed slightly as she replied, “ Because we have more pressing problems. ” 
 
 “ Such as what?” he asked. 
 
 “You ’ re not going to get the data you want from us,” Latrina said without looking up at him, her gaze still fixed on Dexa. He noticed a slight hesitation in her voice before she continued, “ Our scientists have been working on that weapon for years now and they will continue to do so.” 
 
 “Well, I was told this data would be useful to your side of the war,” he said. 
 
 Latrina let out a soft but somewhat annoyed huff as she replied, “And whose side are you on exactly?” 
 
 He paused for just a moment before responding with a calm tone in his voice, “I ’ m not sure yet.” 
 
 Dexa, who had remained silent during their exchange thus far, spoke up once again. 
 
 “That doesn’t sound like an answer to me,” she said. Her gaze shifted back and forth between the two of them as if searching for more information. 
 
 “It is actually an answer but not one you ’ ll understand.” The man leaned forward in his chair slightly before continuing, “But since we have been unable to determine what side it will benefit us to fight with, I believe it would be in our best interest to share this data with the other factions. ” 
 
 Latrina looked at Dexa again but she merely shrugged her shoulders as if trying to dismiss his suggestion. Then Latrina turned back toward him and asked, “What do you want from us?” 
 
 He paused for a moment before replying in an even tone, “I need the data.” 
 
 “And how are we going to get that when you know full well what we will lose if we give it up? ” she asked. 
 
 Dexa spoke up again and said, “We won ’ t just hand it over to you. We can destroy this research facility right now.” 
 
 The man shook his head slowly as he replied, “No, don ’ t do that. If you were to do something like that then our side would have no choice but to attack and destroy your base in retaliation.” 
 
 Dexa looked at him for a moment before asking, “And what if we didn’t care about the destruction of our research facility?” 
 
 The man let out a quiet laugh. He looked down at the table for a moment, then back up at them both and said in an even tone, “I don ’ t think you would like to lose your base any more than we want to destroy yours.” 
 
 Dexa shook her head slowly as she asked again, “And what do you get from us?” 
 
 The man looked back at the woman and said with a nod of his head, “You will see. We have been studying your species for years now and we believe that there is great potential in you to be a valuable asset to our side.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “I would like you to come join us on our world so we can take advantage of that potential together.” 
 
 Dexa looked at him for just a moment then shook her head. She didn ’ t say anything else but merely leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes while Latrina sat silently staring at the scruffy man. After several minutes of silence, he took out his handheld device again and said softly to them both, “Well? Are you going to help us?” 
 
 Dexa ’ s eyelids fluttered open and she looked back up at him before saying in a very calm voice, “You are wasting your time here. We do not wish to join with you or any other faction.” She paused for just a moment before continuing, “We will not help you in anyway shape or form no matter what the price may be.” 
 
 The man nodded slowly as he listened and then replied softly, “Very well. I understand that this will be difficult to accept but please bear with us. We would like to give you some time to think it over before making your final decision. In fact, we have a small reward for you both.” 
 
 The two women looked at each other before turning back toward the scruffy man who had once again placed his device on the table in front of him. He continued speaking softly as if they weren ’ t even there. “We would like to give you a few days to make up your minds and then we will return for a final decision.” 
 
 Dexa nodded her head slightly as Latrina stood up and said in an angry voice, “You want us to consider this? Then you should know that there is no way it would ever work out between our two factions. We are completely opposed to each other’s philosophies.” 
 
 The man remained silent for a moment before saying again in the same quiet tone as he looked directly at Dexa, “I understand your position on this matter but if you change your mind then we will still be here when you ’ re ready.” He paused for just a moment before continuing once again, “You have three days to decide and then we are gone. We will leave our coordinates with the base commander so that he can contact us at any time should either of you want more information about what we ’ ve offered or if one of you decides to change your mind.” 
 
 Latrina stepped forward once again and said, “We have nothing more to discuss right now.” She turned away from him and started to walk out of the room when Dexa spoke up. 
 
 “Hold on just a minute,” she said as she walked over toward them both. The man slowly stood back up and watched her approach. Latrina stopped short of entering the doorway into the main hallway. She stood there for several moments looking down at him as he waited patiently for what was to come next. 
 
 Dexa suddenly reached out with her hand and touched his arm in a very soft but gentle manner. Then, before Latrina could say anything else, she stepped up behind the man and placed her hand on his other shoulder. He glanced back at them both as they stood there facing him then turned his attention toward the doorway again when Latrina spoke up. 
 
 “If you do change your mind about coming with us I would like to know what this ‘reward’ is that you offered.” Her voice was stern and sharp but not mean spirited like before. She continued, “Please be more specific since I assume it will be worth our time to come see you again in the future?” 
 
 He remained silent for a moment as he looked directly at her then back at Latrina. After several seconds of silence had passed he leaned forward slightly and whispered softly, “We have been tracking your faction since we arrived on this planet and we know that you have quite a few members who are gifted in certain areas.” He paused for just a moment before continu
