veyone died! A few children were spared though, they would be the ones that would repopulate the Earth after it was all said and done.
The time came for their first lesson from God, The Creation. It was a good one, but sadly, not many took to the idea of becoming adults with power like their Father. Instead, they were seduced by the evil one, Satan. They became addicted to pleasure and pain.
Once they realized what had happened they begged God for forgiveness. He couldn't be angry anymore. After all it was his children that he loved so dearly! The first few days of repopulation were rough though. In an effort to make it easier on themselves, the people created their own gods. These gods granted them immortality, and they were able to live for many years before the Earth was ready again.
As time passed, Humanity began to forget about God. They became evil and hateful once more, and in order to save us from ourselves, God decided it was necessary that we be forced back into being good. He created his army of angels and set them out to destroy all those who weren't pure enough for the Kingdom of Heaven.
The people fought back though! Some were more evil then others, and so they would turn their backs on God, leaving him with no choice but to let the Army of Angels continue. In order to keep the balance between good and evil, he decided that there should be a place for those who weren't pure enough, a place where they could live out their lives as mortals instead of dying right away.
The Earth was not ready yet though, so it would take many years before it became habitable once again. The Angels had to keep fighting off the demons that had come in and corrupted those who weren't good enough for Heaven.
In time, the Earth became ready again. Those who were good could go back to Heaven while those who weren't so pure had to stay on Earth until they learned how to be better people.
