 tiredly.
"I'm sorry Sir," he said, "but I have been having trouble concentrating today." He handed the papers back to Dr. George.
Dr. George smiled gently and stared at Anthony for a moment. "You are tired. You should get some rest tonight and we can talk after you have had your lunch. Come up to my office at 2:00 pm sharp. I will be waiting." He handed the papers back with a reassuring smile and left the room.
Anthony sighed and pushed the papers aside, turning his head towards the door as it closed quietly. It was no use. It wasn't like him to work so poorly in class. He rubbed his hand over his face again, his fingers leaving a smudge of blood across his forehead.
"Anthony..."
"...I know." His eyes shot up and he saw the boy sitting next to him. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail with long bangs hanging in front of his eyes and he wore a white polo shirt over blue jeans. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and stared at Anthony with worried eyes. "You're not supposed to see me," he whispered softly.
"What do you mean I'm not supposed to see you?" Anthony asked.
The boy smiled gently and shook his head, "I can't tell you." He leaned back against the wall, running a hand through his hair as he thought. "Just...promise me that you won't say anything to anyone about what I told you? Please?"
Anthony sat quietly for a moment then sighed and nodded, "Sure. But why?"
"Because if they find out," the boy started, "I could get in trouble." He shook his head again. "And this is very important to me."
"Okay," Anthony said and took out a pen and paper from his bag. "Now what do you want me to say?" The boy hesitated for a moment then smiled at him. "Fine, I'll tell them that you gave me something to help me with my homework... but how am I supposed to get it back to you when the teacher asks for it tomorrow morning? You know they can't find any writing on the paper."
"I have a way," the boy said and reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, metal ring. He placed one end in Anthony's hand and took the other and held it next to his ear. "Listen closely," he whispered.
Anthony stared at him for a moment then closed his eyes as the sound started. A sharp ringing filled his ears. At first, there was nothing but a dull background noise but suddenly it turned into voices. He heard Dr. George's voice loud and clear, "Tell me about your parents."
The boy smiled gently at him and pulled away from Anthony, disappearing behind the wall. Anthony opened his eyes slowly, listening to the ringing in his ears. There was nothing but silence now as he stared up at the ceiling. The classroom was silent for a long moment before Dr. George entered with a new boy by his side. "Anthony," he said and sat down at his desk, "I would like to introduce you to your roommate."
The two boys shook hands as the teacher handed each of them a set of keys and they got up from their seats, walking out into the hall. They stepped through one door after another until finally they reached an empty room. There were three beds, all identical except for the name painted on the footboard in bold letters: Anthony Renault.
"This is your room," Dr. George said and handed him a stack of paperwork. "If you have any problems, please feel free to ask me or one of my assistants." He walked out of the doorway and locked it behind him. The new boy turned to face Anthony as he sat down on his bed. "Hi," he said, shyly extending his hand.
Anthony smiled back at him and took his hand in his own, shaking it firmly. "I'm Anthony." He moved closer towards the window and stared out of it for a moment before turning around to face his new roommate. "You can call me Tank if you want to."
The boy blinked at him for a moment then smiled gently, nodding. "Okay...Tank," he said and walked over towards the bunk above Anthony's bed. He picked up his bag and set it on the top of the lower bunk as Tank reached down and pulled off his shoes and socks. The room was quiet for a moment then they both turned away from each other to change into their pajamas, pulling them over their heads.
As Anthony began to strip out of his jeans, he heard something behind him. He looked back up at the boy who had finished changing but now stared off in the distance towards the doorway. "Are you alright?" Tank asked without turning around. His voice was shaky and his face pale, like he had been sick for days. Anthony frowned slightly before he walked over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Hey," he said gently. The boy turned around slowly, meeting Anthony's eyes with his own. "Everything will be okay." He smiled at the other boy who smiled back uncertainly. "I know this place is a little different than what you are used to..." Anthony trailed off as Tank blinked back tears before he burst into uncontrolled sobs, crying on Anthony's shoulder.
"Shhh," Anthony said and stroked the boy's hair gently until his cries became quiet whimpers and finally stopped altogether. "Everything will be okay..."
Tank nodded, pulling away from Anthony and rubbing his eyes, sniffing back tears as he walked over to his bunk. He pulled off his pajamas and got under the covers, shivering slightly in the cold night air. A few moments later, Tank drifted off to sleep while Anthony stared at the ceiling above him.
"Well," Dr. George said as he leaned back on his chair, "how do you feel about your new roommate?"
Anthony sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. He felt exhausted as he sat across from the other man in front of him at his desk. He had slept poorly last night and now, all he wanted to do was go back to bed but Dr. George's question caught him off guard and he turned to meet the doctor's eyes. "I don't know," Anthony admitted. "He doesn't seem very friendly."
"Tank is a bit shy at times," Dr. George explained gently, "but I promise you that it will not be long before he is your best friend." He leaned forward on his desk and smiled warmly, "You are both good boys and together, you can help each other through this difficult time in life."
Anthony sighed again. Dr. George was a good man but sometimes, the things he said annoyed him. "I have to go to bed early tonight," Anthony told the doctor, "I need my rest if I'm going to be here for five more years." He smiled as he stood up and left his seat behind him, walking over towards the door.
Dr. George frowned but nodded and followed him out into the hallway. "Don't forget about our appointment at 2:00 pm," Dr. George reminded him as they passed a patient in a wheelchair who stared back at them with dead eyes, his mouth slightly open as he breathed slowly through his oxygen tank.
"I won't miss it," Anthony said and turned down the hall towards his room. He felt like he was walking through quicksand and every step seemed to take twice as long as it did yesterday. "Tank?" he called out gently, "Can you come here for a second?"
Anthony heard footsteps coming from behind him then Tank appeared at the end of the hallway with his hands stuffed deep in the pockets of his pajamas. Anthony waited until the boy was standing in front of him before he reached out and put a hand on his shoulder, "Tank, I need to ask you something."
Tank frowned slightly at him then nodded, "Okay...What is it?" He stared down at his feet as Anthony spoke.
"How do you feel about me?" he asked quietly. Tank's eyes flashed up to meet his and the boy smiled gently back. His eyes were wide and a little frightened but there was no hesitation, no confusion...only warmth and trust. "That is good," Anthony said and patted his shoulder before turning around to walk away again.
"Good night Tank," he called over his shoulder as the boy stayed in place, staring after him with unbelieving eyes.
The door closed behind him quietly as Dr. George sat down on the bench next to Tank's bed and smiled gently at him, "How are you feeling?"
Tank blinked once then twice before he turned around slowly, meeting Dr. George's eyes with his own. They were a warm brown color
