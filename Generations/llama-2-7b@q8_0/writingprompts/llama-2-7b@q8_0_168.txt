incere when I say that I don't believe this was some kind of sexual assault. I think she could have been drunk and passed out, and he was just having fun. But I can see where it might look like something else. '' 
 
`` I want to know why you think so, Detective. Because a woman has to be dead before someone gets charged for sexual assault on her, in my experience.'' 
 
Rand's expression was flat and unreadable. `` There are lots of reasons, but one big reason is that women can be victims in these kinds of situations without being physically damaged or even aware they've been victimized. But you have a point: I don't have enough to charge him with sexual assault. '' 
 
`` It seems like if we were able to identify the woman, there would be an easy way to check out how well she was treated by her boyfriend and see whether or not there was any kind of pattern that would indicate physical abuse.'' 
 
Rand leaned forward again and looked at me with interest. `` How's your wife doing? '' 
`` I don't know, Detective. She left home last night for a couple days to take care of her mother. It'll be good for her to have some time away from here.'' 
 
Rand looked at me with sympathy. `` Things like this can really mess up even the best of marriages, you know? The way they're always worrying about what happened in the past and trying to figure out where things are going for them in the future...It just gets old after a while. It wears people down. '' 
`` Yeah, it does.'' I stood up and put on my coat. ``I have to run. I'll see you next time we talk about this. '' 
He nodded. `` Yeah, you do that. Good luck with your investigation.'' 
 
`` Thanks, Detective.'' As I walked out of the police station, I felt better than I had in days. But the feeling was short lived.
 
After I got home, I phoned my wife and told her what happened at the police station. I wanted to be prepared if she asked me for a list of names to run through the system. It took her some time to call back, but eventually we made arrangements for her to come stay with us in Seattle until we figured out where things stood with this case.
 
It was only when my wife called again to tell me about her arrival that I realized how much I had been counting on her being there to help me. If she hadn't shown up, I might have gone back to the station and asked to speak with Detective Rand privately, and we would probably be much closer to solving the crime by now than we are.
 
``You know what,'' my wife said over the phone, ``I just had an idea about the woman in the video...'' 
I held my breath as I waited for her to explain herself, but after a few seconds of silence, she laughed at something I couldn't hear and hung up. She called me back soon afterward with no explanation other than that I would be interested in what she had just told her about the video. 
``What is it?'' I asked impatiently when I heard her voice on my answering machine. 
``Nothing,'' she said. ``I'll tell you about it when we get home.''
 
For reasons that still make me wonder, I took a nap after I hung up the phone. When I woke, it was dark outside and my wife had just pulled up in front of the house. It took me only a few seconds to realize how wrong things could go if her idea didn't pan out. If she was right about who the woman in the video is, she would have to testify for us at trial--or at least give us an affidavit that we could use to get a warrant or subpoena information from her boyfriend. And even then it might not be enough, depending on how hard he fought us and what kind of evidence Detective Rand was able to find. I didn't know if my wife would do this for me...or if she even could.
 
My wife got out of the car, leaned in toward me through her open window, and gave me a quick kiss before stepping into the house. She was smiling as she closed the door behind her, but I felt nervous anyway--worried that this might be more than just another wild idea from my wife.
 
When I got to their room, she was sitting at the desk next to the bed, wearing a pair of pajamas and reading through some papers. ``So what's all this?'' I asked her as soon as I walked in. 
``Well,'' she said, looking up from her paperwork. ``I just remembered something I hadn't told you before, about when we were doing the police report at your house...''
My heart sank. We had already been through this once--with me telling Detective Rand everything that my wife and I knew and then asking for advice on what to do next. If she was going to suggest something different now, it would be a lot harder than before; if she didn't believe us enough to help us with the police investigation in the first place...
 ``Oh yeah?'' I said, trying to sound hopeful but feeling anything but. 
``You remember how that girl looked exactly like you, right?'' she said, smiling as she spoke. ``I mean, except for her hair color and size--which makes it even more amazing. '' 
Her eyes were shining with excitement now; I knew what this was all about...and I didn't want to hear it anymore.
``She must be your long-lost twin sister,'' I said. ``That's the only explanation for how you can remember things she did and said when you never even met her before today. '' 
My wife rolled her eyes at me. ``You are such a skeptic! You've got to see this. It will blow your mind!'' She handed me one of her sheets of paper, which turned out to be the same picture I had seen on my phone earlier in Detective Rand's office; only now it was accompanied by two other pictures: one showing my wife holding hands with someone else and another where she was laughing at something he said. ``Can you believe that?'' she asked me excitedly as we looked at the images side by side on her computer screen. 
I stared at them both, trying to figure out what it could mean...but I couldn't come up with anything. I knew my wife well enough not to think this was some kind of trick or hoax--and yet there seemed no other explanation for how she could be so sure that these were pictures of the same person as her boyfriend's girlfriend in the video clip we had seen together at home...
 ``What about your sister?'' I asked again. 
My wife shook her head at me impatiently. ``She isn't my twin,'' she said quickly before returning to what really interested her: how amazing it was that they looked so much alike and what it meant for all of us going forward now that we knew the truth about our family history. 
``So...what do you think? '' She asked me again as I started looking through more photos on my phone, trying to find one where she didn't look exactly like someone else in every single picture taken together with him over time. But there weren't any; they were just too alike--like two pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly because each had been cut from the same piece of paper in some long-forgotten moment before either of us was born into this world... 
``Well, I guess we should call Detective Rand and tell him what happened tonight.'' 
My wife looked at me like I was crazy; then she picked up her phone from its place on the nightstand next to our bed--and started typing in numbers before hanging up again without saying a word more about anything at all except that we should call Detective Rand back as soon as possible. 
I got out of bed and walked into my office where I kept my laptop, feeling like an idiot for not seeing what had been so obvious to her from the very beginning; but also knowing now how important it was going forward: If there really is a connection between us--if this isn't just some kind of coincidence or mistaken identity after all--then we need to find out everything about our family history before we decide what comes next. 
The police station would have been closed by now but I didn't care; if my wife wanted me to make that call then I was going to do it, no matter how much I hated having to talk with Detective Rand after what had happened earlier today...
 
I dialed the phone number for his office and waited until he picked up on the other end before speaking. ``Hello?'' His voice sounded tired as always; but when he heard my name he perked right back up again: ``Josh, it's good to hear from you! How are things going with your wife?'' 
``She's still upset about what happened earlier today,'' I said quickly before pausing for a
