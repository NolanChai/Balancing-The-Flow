 
 
 We have to be nice to them? To everyone? 
 
 
 So here we are: We're still stuck. 
 
 
 We sit on the couch, next to We's spouse... or We's siblings and their children... or We's parents. 
 
 
 No one speaks for a long time. We all just stare at our feet, or Our hands folded in Our laps. 
 
 
 Then We's uncle, who is married to Auntie, says: 
 
 
 Do you know what I want for Christmas this year? 
 
 
 We're thinking: It probably involves a lot of money and We don't have any. So, We say: What? 
 
 
 Uncle looks at Us and smiles: 
 
 
 A new body. 
 
 
 And We say: Why do you need that? 
 
 
 Uncle says: Because I can no longer be the man I want to be without it. 
 
 
 Then, after a long silence, We say: Okay. 
 
 
 Everyone smiles and laughs... except for Us, who is still thinking about that new body. It seems like the perfect gift, after all. A new body? Wouldn't it be awesome to have a whole new one? 
 
 **That night We can't sleep, thinking about how different Our life would be with a new body. In fact: We wonder if maybe that new body should come sooner rather than later...**
 
 
 We get up out of bed and head into the kitchen to get some water. We fill up a glass at the sink. Then, just as We are about to take Our first sip, something catches Our attention... 
 
 **We see Uncle standing in front of Us—he's in his new body! And he's talking and laughing with everyone else, like nothing is wrong** — **like a normal person.**
 
 
 We think: Maybe I should get that new body after all...
