, so many days of meetings, so many memos. All for this, the ultimate test. Nora was young, a graduate student. She was here to help, she said, but he knew better. He was being tested and he would be ready.
Nora entered his office with the papers and sat down. The door closed behind her. She began to read from the first page. "Your father is dead."
He shook his head. "My father died ten years ago," he said. But then something happened that was not quite right. He felt a pain in the chest, but it did not last long and soon he felt better. The room seemed to shake a little as she continued reading from the next page: "Your mother is dead."
Now there was more pain and this time he fell back against his chair. The world spun around him for a moment. It stopped spinning, and now everything was quiet again. He thought of what Nora had said: Your father died ten years ago. His father was gone? Yes, that much was true. He remembered it as if it were yesterday. But he did not feel sorrow.
"Your grandfather is dead." The words came slowly from her mouth and he could see the sadness in her eyes. "His house has been destroyed by an earthquake," she continued. "He had no life insurance because he died a few years ago, and the authorities say his home was not worth rebuilding. So you are now alone."
It all seemed like a dream, but then Nora looked at him with tears in her eyes and said: "The house burned down, so there is nothing for you to return to. Your life has ended. Now you must begin again."
