2 how much money people are willing to pay for their voice 2 b heard! Today it is:
   * A man whose wife had been diagnosed with breast cancer just like Nancy Reagan, who was in the White House when her husband was President. He wanted Trump to help him and his wife defeat her disease as he'd done for Ronald Reagan.
   * A mother of three small children who's facing a custody battle over her kids with an abusive ex-husband who was going to jail soon but not before she had to fight in court and it would take months to get a divorce, months during which he could do anything to her and the children. She hoped Trump would help stop this and protect them as well.
   * A father of a daughter with Down syndrome who'd been denied health insurance coverage for her special needs by Blue Cross-Blue Shield in Arizona despite having preexisting conditions. He wanted Donald to help him get her the care she needed without worrying about the cost and without getting dropped from his policy.
   * A woman whose husband had died after a long battle with leukemia and who'd been left with huge medical bills by an insurance company that denied any liability for them and wouldn't give her any money to pay it back because they said she was lying about how sick he really was. She wanted Trump to intervene on her behalf so that justice would be done, as it should have been from the beginning.
   * A man whose wife had just given birth but lost the baby at delivery and then suffered a serious infection afterwards which required surgery to repair the damage—all this while being forced by their insurance company into using hospitals out of state that were more expensive than those locally despite being much closer. He wanted Trump 2 tell his story 4 everyone so he could help other people going through similar situations avoid making mistakes like these in future.
   * A woman who was having problems with her family over the estate she had inherited from her grandmother and who believed that if Donald could get them talking, then maybe things would be better for everyone involved.
