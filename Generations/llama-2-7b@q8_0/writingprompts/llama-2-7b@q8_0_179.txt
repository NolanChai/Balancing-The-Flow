 liar, and we know what to expect in our house: a dog, cleaning products (or at least I think that's  
 what the spray canister says) and maybe a hint of baked goods from the neighbors. And when it rains,  
 even though our roof leaks, inside is okay because it's warm. When it snows, we go out to play in it.  
 That's why I love to be outside!
I think this is true for other animals, too. Most animals love the great outdoors and they will go far to get there.
My sister Lizzie used to say she wanted to live on a farm with lots of animals. She would run around chasing  
 cows or riding ponies all day long! I'd rather be indoors with my mom reading or writing in our secret  
 hideout, but I know I should at least like being outside because it's healthy for me to get some fresh air.  
 Plus, animals that are outdoors often have a better chance of surviving. But here is the thing—some animals live inside with us humans instead. 
 
 And they love it! 
 
 They don't mind being indoors and having their fur brushed or cleaned up after at least once a day.  
 Some pets even like to be inside because that's where their people are. We have a cat named Pouncey. He hates to be left outside, he really does! 
 
 But the thing about living on the farm is that sometimes when it gets too hot, you can just go inside  
 and sit underneath a fan. It's very relaxing! The farm has lots of fans and we have air conditioning in our house. I like that there are so many fans at my farm—they keep us cool!
Now, if I could just figure out how to get Lizzie away from her computer long enough for me to brush her hair,  
 we'd all be happy. But it is hard for a mom to find time to brush her daughter's hair when she's writing her own books!
# What do you think? 
I like being indoors and outdoors. I don't mind the heat or rain—just as long as there is air conditioning or  
 heating inside, it'll be okay by me. I don't know if my mom has time to brush my hair while she's writing her own books! But then again, when was the last time she had time for a manicure? 
 
 That is why we are going to go outside and take some photos of our pets now. We need to see what animals like  
 living outdoors, inside or both! I'm pretty sure that they love it all—but maybe there will be a surprise! So let's get our cameras ready . . . 
# Meet Pouncey the Cat
Hiya! I'm Pouncey and I live on a farm with my owner, Amy. She also has a dog named Lucky. And we both love to  
 hang out in her house when it gets hot outside. The air conditioning is the best! We have it so nice here. 
 
 But sometimes, I do miss being outside with all of the animals there. It's fun running around chasing mice and rabbits, especially when Lucky the dog tries to help me out.
I also like to climb on Amy's lap while we read books together. My owner is always writing about my adventures in her books so I am excited  
 to be featured in them! And now, here are some pictures of us outside and inside for you all to see!
# Meet Lucky the Dog
Hiya there! I'm Lucky—a big, beautiful dog with floppy ears. I live on a farm with my owner Amy and her cat  
 Pouncey. We get along really well because we have been together since we were puppies! 
 
 We love to go outside for walks or just run around in the grass. And when it's hot, sometimes we sleep inside and don't mind at all. The air conditioning is very comfortable and I always feel safe there. But I still enjoy being outdoors too—even though sometimes mosquitoes like to bite me on my long ears!
And now here are some photos of us inside and outside for you all to see!
# Meet the Horses: Dusty and Charlie Brown 
We love our horses. They are so fun to ride. But it is hot outside sometimes, and they do not mind being indoors with air conditioning. 
 
 We always get ready when we go out for a ride—but when we come back, we take off our boots because the house feels cooler! And now let's look at some photos of us together, shall we?
# Meet Snickers the Cow
Hiya there, I am Snickers and I live on a farm. My owner is Amy—she writes books about me, too. But  
 it is not often that she gets to come visit me since I don't always like people coming around. 
 
 That's okay with me though because my job as a cow is pretty important! I provide the milk for our farm, and also eat grass which makes it grow healthy.
Sometimes when I get too hot in the sun or rain, my owner brings me inside to be cooler and eat some grain while she writes her books. And now let's look at photos of me together, shall we?
# Meet Rosie the Sheep 
Hiya there! I am a sheep named Rosie, and I live on a farm. My owner is Amy—she writes about me in  
 books too. But it's not often that she gets to come visit with me because sometimes when I have babies (lambs) or if my fleece has gotten too long then it might get tangled up around their legs and hurt them!
But that is okay with me, as long as I can run out into the pasture and eat some grass. And now let's look at photos of us together, shall we?
# Meet Duckie and Coco 
Hiya there! My name is Duckie and my sister is named Coco. We live on a farm with Amy who writes books about animals like us.  
 But it is not often that she gets to come visit because sometimes when I have babies (ducklings), or if my feathers have gotten too long then they might get tangled up around their legs and hurt them!
That's okay with me, as long as I can run into the water and eat some grass. And now let's look at photos of us together, shall we?
# Meet Mimi the Bunny 
Hiya there! My name is Mimi and sometimes Amy comes to visit me on the farm where she lives with her  
 animals too (like Lucky and Pouncey). Sometimes I like it when she comes over because then she brings me some carrots which are really yummy. But other times, it's hard for her to get here since she has so many books to write!
And that is okay with me because when I am not eating any more food than normal then my owner can come play games  
 with me outside or take some photos of us together. And now let's look at some pictures of our fun time, shall we?
# Meet Pudge the Chicken 
Hiya there! My name is Pudge and I live on a farm where Amy comes to visit sometimes—she writes books  
 about animals like me too! But sometimes it's hard for her to get here because she has so many books that need editing or something else, you know? And that is okay with me since when I am not eating any food then my owner can come play games with me outside or take some photos of us together. 
 
 Now let's look at some pictures of our fun time, shall we?
# Meet Trixie the Horse 
Hiya there! My name is Trixie and sometimes Amy comes to visit me on a farm where she lives with her  
 animals too (like Lucky and Pouncey). But it's not often because I am old now, so sometimes my legs hurt when they get cold from being outside in the winter.
That's okay with me though—I like to eat hay and sleep in a nice warm barn. And that is why Amy comes over only once or twice per week. But when she does come by, it's fun because then I get lots of carrots! 
 
 Now let's look at some pictures of our fun time together, shall we?
