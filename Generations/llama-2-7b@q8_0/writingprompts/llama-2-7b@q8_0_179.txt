ie-boy!'' 
 
 `` We'll be there for you, James...'' 
 
 `` What? Where is this coming from, where are you?'' 
 
 `` Ah, it was just the voices in my head.'' 
 
 `` You need to take medication, Jamie-boy.'' 
 
 `` No thanks! I'm fine. I'll be out of here soon, and then we can go see some girls!'' 
 
 `` No girls for you, Jamie-boy. We don't want any more girlfriends for you until you're better. You have to stay in bed.'' 
 
 `` Why do I need to be alone?'' 
 
 `` Because that's the best place for a man like you... to recover.'' 
 
 `` Well, we've all been through it, Jamie-boy. We were there for you when you went into your last coma. And we'll be here for you again.'' 
 
 `` So what? You're just going to sit and stare at me while I'm stuck in this bed...?'' 
 
 `` Yes, Jamie-boy. Just as we did when you were in that other hospital, and then back home after that. We'll be here for you again, and always.'' 
 
 `` But I want to see girls!'' 
 
 `` You need your rest.'' 
 
 `` No! Give me some pills...'' 
 
 `` No, Jamie-boy. There are no more pills for you. Not until after the doctors say that you've fully recovered from this coma. We want to make sure it won't happen again.'' 
 
 `` But I don't care about that! I want girls... '' 
 
 `` No girls for you, Jamie-boy. It's time to grow up and be a man. You've been having girlfriends since you were twelve years old - '' 
 
 `` Hey! That was different then!'' 
 
 `` Still no girls for you, Jamie-boy. The doctors are very strict about that now.'' 
 
 `` They don't even want to let me see my family or friends anymore... I need people around me. I need to talk with them and be social.'' 
 
 `` Yes, but we can still help you by being your voice inside of here. We'll tell you everything that's going on. We'll keep you updated.'' 
 
 `` What? I don't understand... How would you know anything if you're not there?'' 
 
 `` Well, we can talk to the nurses and your family when they come in and see you. But mostly we're going to help you by being inside of you - '' 
 
 `` In me? Inside my head?'' 
 
 `` Yes! We'll be right there with you always... no matter what happens... You can count on us.'' 
 
 `` That's not so bad, I guess. Hey, could I call my friends in now to say hi to me while I'm here?'' 
 
 `` Not until we say it's okay. They all know about your coma, and they are very supportive of you, but for now it is best that you just rest. We will tell them everything once you're up and about again.'' 
 
 `` Oh... Okay. I guess this isn't so bad after all. It won't be like last time then... I can handle this. '' 
 
 `` You know, it is kind of lonely here, sometimes... it's not as good as when you were out with the girls.'' 
 
 `` But we'll be there for you. And eventually you won't feel so alone anymore once you get used to being in this place.'' 
 
 `` I know. You guys are great. I love you, you know that...'' 
 
 `` We know that too. ''
