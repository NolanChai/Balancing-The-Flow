vered with the breeze as if it were dancing on the wind. There was no fire, there was nothing that would burn the flesh, yet he still saw a vision of burning people. He looked around and the flowers suddenly disappeared as well. In its place was a small cottage with a thatched roof. The cottage was built from wood in which it resembled the look of an old toy house. There were no walls to hide any privacy nor were there curtains or doors to hide what may lie within. A single window was located at the front and it faced westward towards the setting sun. The roof was made from straw thatched on top with the shingles in a way that they would protect against rain and snow but could still allow air to circulate through the small openings between the straw and wood. There were no steps leading up to the front of this cottage, rather it was simply there as if someone had suddenly decided to build it on top of some land and had left it unfinished.
The area that surrounded the house was completely barren, not a single plant nor grass could be seen anywhere within sight. The ground was rocky with an uneven surface. Not even a blade of grass grew in this area. In fact, if one were to take a close look at the entire scenery it would appear as if nothing ever lived in that part of the world. There were no animals, there were no humans and yet for some reason this place did not seem empty or desolate; instead it gave off a feeling of warmth, safety and protection as if it were one’s home. The house itself had four walls, all painted with white paint that was still fresh on the inside and out. The roof was a brown shingle but when he looked closer at its edge there were some places where the shingles were missing or broken down into pieces. In the front of this small cottage was a large wooden door which led to a single room with a wooden floor that seemed to be covered in sawdust. There were two windows on each side, one facing east and the other west. The front window faced directly towards the sun while the back faced away from it, thus giving more privacy inside this small cottage.
Inside the house was completely empty, not a single piece of furniture could be found anywhere within sight. All that he saw were four walls painted white and a wooden floor covered in sawdust. There was nothing else; no beds, no tables or chairs just an empty room with nothing more than dust covering its floor. The cottage was small but it seemed to be large enough for someone to live in comfortably without worrying about where they would sleep at night or how much food they should cook each day.
“Hello?” he called out into the air hoping that someone would answer him back but there wasn’t a single reply nor any other sound coming from inside this small cottage. “I know you’re in here!” He said as loudly as possible trying to get his message across but it was no use because all of his words had disappeared into thin air before they could even reach anyone else’s ears. The cottage was so quiet that one might have thought that it had been abandoned for years without any signs of life at all, not even a single bug or mouse had dared to enter this place during the whole time since its construction many decades ago.
“Hello?” he called out once more just to be sure but there wasn’t a single reply nor was there anything else that could indicate someone might have been living in such an isolated location. He turned around and walked towards the door of the house only to find himself facing another room which looked identical to the first one except for two things; there were no windows here which meant it was completely dark inside this place as well, but most importantly there was a bed covered with white sheets hanging from both sides by metal ropes connected to wooden poles that supported its weight. The sheets themselves were clean and fresh looking unlike the ones he had seen in other places where they were dirt-stained or smelled like something had died on them.
“Hello?” He called out once more but still received no reply nor did any sound come from inside this small cottage. “Is someone there? Can you hear me?” No answer came back, so he turned around and left the place without knowing if anyone was living here or not. The whole time that he had been walking towards the door of this house he noticed something strange about it; as soon as he got close to it the front window appeared in front of him as though someone had moved it aside allowing a ray of sunlight to enter its interior through an opening at one end of the room where there was no door nor any other obstruction blocking its path. This small detail made him wonder if perhaps someone might have been living here after all because such things couldn’t happen without being noticed by anyone else unless they were doing so purposely but why would anyone go through such trouble just to make a simple window appear in front of his face? It didn’t seem like something that was done out of convenience either considering how small this cottage actually was; if someone were living here then surely there wouldn’t be any need for them to hide what they were doing from anyone else so why would they go through the effort of making a window appear when he got close enough to see inside?
“Hello?” He called out one last time but still received no reply nor did anything else happen which made him think that perhaps nobody was living here after all. “I guess I’ll just have to leave then,” he said with disappointment in his voice as he walked away from the cottage leaving its front window behind him once more so that when someone passed by again it would no longer appear before them, making them believe there was someone inside even though they were really alone.
The man stood up from his bed and walked over to one of the windows in order to see outside but there wasn’t anything worth noting on either side; it just seemed like another normal day except for a few birds chirping away happily as if they had no worries about being attacked by cats or dogs while people walked around below them unnoticed.
The man turned back towards where his bed used to be but now there wasn’t anything left on its place because it was gone; instead he saw a small wooden box lying atop the floor right next to him which had been placed there by someone else who had come into this room earlier today without his knowledge nor permission. This little incident made him even more suspicious than before about why anyone might have been living here in such an isolated place and why they would want to hide what they were doing from everyone else around them when it didn’t seem like something that was done out of convenience either considering how small this cottage actually was; if someone were living here then surely there wouldn’t be any need for them to hide what they were doing from anyone else so why would they go through the effort of making a window appear when he got close enough to see inside?

The man sat down on his bed and stared at the small wooden box lying atop the floor right next to him which had been placed there by someone else who had come into this room earlier today without his knowledge nor permission.

He looked at his watch and noticed that it was already time for him to leave this place so he grabbed the small wooden box lying atop the floor right next to him which had been placed there by someone else who had come into this room earlier today without his knowledge nor permission.

He put on his coat and walked out of this small cottage without looking back at anything because nothing was left behind nor did it seem like someone had been living there for some time now. The man went
