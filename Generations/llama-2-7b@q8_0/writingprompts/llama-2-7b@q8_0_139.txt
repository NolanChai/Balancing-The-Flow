 as though it were alive, eager for its next victim.
In the darkened room beyond she sees that the dust has settled into a thick layer on the floor. It’s more than just dirt from outside — there are flakes of paper and plastic bags, even pieces of a broken toy. There’s also a distinct odor: mildew, wet dog, and something else Jen can ’ t quite place.
A voice says behind her, “Well?”
Jen turns around, surprised that the stranger has remained silent for so long. His hair is cut short in military fashion; his body seems to be covered with tattoos of various designs. In one arm, he holds a handgun. The other rests casually on a small box lying next to him.
The young woman hesitates, unsure what to say. “Um … ” she starts. She can’t remember the last time she felt so scared. This is no ordinary kidnapper; this guy was obviously part of the group who had taken over her house. And his weapon isn’t the only one that he might use against her.
“Don ’ t tell me you forgot something, or need to go potty,” he says sarcastically. “Just come on.”
Jen swallows. She can see the fear in her captor ’ s face; he knows what she’s thinking: escape and a quick death over surrendering to him. But Jen has nothing left to run away with — no weapons, no money, no cell phone — and even if she did, how could she survive alone in this city?
Still, her life is worth more than his. She holds out a hand, palm up. “Here ’ s your box,” she says coldly, taking one step forward. “Now give me my phone.”
“So you have a cell phone,” the man replies, stepping back slightly and holding it closer to her face as if he might take it away again at any moment. He has good reasons: in Jen ’ s world of survivalist families, every little item is worth more than gold — or lives.
“It ’ ll have a battery,” she says. “So I can call you back.”
“That isn’t going to happen,” the man replies matter-of-factly. He takes another step closer and extends his arm, as if offering it to her for inspection. “But why would anyone want this old phone anyway?” he asks. The question seems innocent enough, but Jen knows that she ’ ll have only a few seconds to respond. If she gives the wrong answer, she ’ ll be shot in an instant.
She takes his hand and pulls him toward the doorway, into the hallway beyond. “Follow me,” she says sternly. She walks quickly down the corridor, keeping her eyes on her captor’s face as they go. He ’ s still holding tight to the gun in his hand.
“Who are you?” Jen asks abruptly, when he falls into step behind her. The question is unexpected; she didn’t think to ask him his name before now.
“No one,” he replies, “just someone who needs your help.”
Jen stops and stares at the man. He looks at her for a moment, then glances down at his hand, which holds the gun. It ’ s only when she sees that he ’ s not going to shoot her that Jen realizes how tense he was before. Still, Jen doesn’t feel safe until she turns away from him and walks up the stairs toward the main floor of the house.
Jen ’ s mother is sitting at the kitchen table, as if waiting for them to arrive. The woman ’ s hair has been braided back, away from her face; she wears a white T-shirt with faded jeans and brown leather boots. She ’ s just as calm now as when Jen last saw her in the hallway below — but is this woman really her mother?
“Jen,” the woman says softly. “It’s been too long.”
