rapes on the window across from me and cut off all sunshine. The room was dark, but I could still see.
I do not know if this is the kind of thing that happens to people who have spent too much time staring at screens, but after I turned around to look out the windows, all I could see in the darkness were flashes of color and shapes. My grandson ’ s dresser was a sea of blue with silver streaks, each one like a star.
I don ’ t know if this is what happens when you stare at screens for too long or if my mind has been trying to find something positive in the world so I have hallucinations from it now. I know that for me it is not just a little bit of time, because even on weekends where I do not spend much time on my phone, I feel like there are these flashes of color and shapes all day long.
I wonder what it would be like if we had no screens. Would this world have been different? Or maybe things were always the way they are now and our minds are just trying to find a bright spot in an otherwise dull existence.
I can ’ t imagine not having any screens, because I don ’ t know anything else. Everyone around me uses them all of the time, so when I am alone or bored with something, I pull out my phone and check it. It is like pulling a blanket over myself when I get cold.
I can’t imagine not having any screens because they are like air to me now. If I take my phone away for too long, I feel as if I am suffocating. There have been many times that I have found myself on the couch in front of my computer and even when I try hard not to think about it or look at it, there is this little voice in my head asking why am I doing nothing but staring at a screen? Why don ’ t I go outside?
