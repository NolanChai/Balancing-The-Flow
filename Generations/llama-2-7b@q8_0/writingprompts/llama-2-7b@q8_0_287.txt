 guess
Likes: Drama, Video games (Xbox 360), Anime, Music.
Dislikes: Lies, being lied to, stupidity in general.
I have a really big thing with honesty and trust, if someone breaks that trust I just get rid of them outright. Also don't like people who are fucking idiots, so...yeah..
Favorite Anime: I like quite a lot actually but the ones I watch the most is Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing Ultimate and Black Lagoon (It has some of the best opening scenes in anime). Other than that it's mostly shitty hentai.
Favorite Movies: The Dark Knight, Pulp Fiction, Shaun Of the Dead, Hot Fuzz.
Favorite Books: The Harry Potter books and Lord Of The Rings, anything else I don't have much of a preference for.
Mostly listen to rock music (Alternative) and some pop-ish stuff. I like some dubstep too but it kinda pisses me off that everyone thinks dubstep is all about dropping the bass so hard.
Would love to go to Australia, Canada or any tropical island if I could choose a place anywhere in the world.
