 sat down to take notes. He was from Channel 4 and he asked, “Are you ready to answer?”
``Yes I am ready but I have some conditions. I would like to talk about the whole war not just one person's story. Also I want a copy of this interview for myself and my family.''
 
 ``I understand and that is fine. I'm just going to write down what you said but I can get permission from Channel 4 later if they would like it to air the whole interview.'' The reporter took out his phone and recorded me talking, and I started off with my story.
``I am a little confused why I was chosen for this but that is fine. I will answer any questions you have. My family made it through by getting food, clothes, and shelter from others in the community who would do anything to help people. So we got help from those who wanted to give some. Also, my father was a pastor so we had church members help us as well. Some days he had to go out of town for meetings or funerals but sometimes he would just leave for his sanity's sake.'' I explained to the reporter and it went on from there.
 
 ``So your father was a pastor? That must have been very hard to not be at home when needed most during these tough times. Did you ever go to church with him? ''
``Not really, but if my mother or I were sick he would take us to the hospital and stay as long as we wanted. So for me it was just like going to school some days.'' 
 
 ``So how did your father get help from other people? Was there a program they signed up to be apart of?” The reporter asked.
``There wasn't but he would preach about helping people and the Bible in general, so most church members just helped us without asking for anything back.'' I replied.
 
 ``That is very kind of them. Did you get money from church donations or anything? '' He asked with a look of surprise on his face.
``No we never got any help financially but my father had some contacts in the church and they would always offer to pay for things when needed. Also, he was really good at making speeches so I guess people were willing to listen to him about what to do or not to do during that time period.'' I replied with a smile on my face.
 
 ``Thank you for talking with me, I think the station will be fine with this but they are going to have to edit some things out because of the language and other sensitive topics. If there is anything else you would like to say then just let me know.'' He said as he got up to leave.
``Thank you again for your time.” 
 
 ``You are very welcome. Thank you so much, it was really nice talking with you.'' 
 
 ``No problem have a good day, bye.'' I waved and he walked out the door. He was just trying to find stories of families who made it through the war but his story wasn't half bad either.
