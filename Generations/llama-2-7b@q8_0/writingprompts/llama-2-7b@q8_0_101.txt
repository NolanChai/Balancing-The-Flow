ared about him as much as his sister did.
Kishua didn't know what to do with himself for those long, lonely weeks. The village that had been his home wasn't his anymore-the Samurai and his companion had left without so much as a word from them. Kishua wasn't sure whether he should be sad or angry that they'd abandoned him. He felt like he didn't belong anywhere, any more.
But there was no time to dwell on thoughts of home-the two women who'd raised him were waiting for him in his favorite place, the clearing deep in the woods beyond the village. He had been waiting there for them all week, and they were always there when he arrived. The Samurai and his companion had brought Kishua to that clearing, saying it was a special place and that Kishua would one day understand what was so special about it-the two women would be the ones who told him everything once he came to understand what the clearing meant.
Kishua remembered how strange he felt when they said those words to him. He had never seen either of his mothers cry before, but both wept tears of joy as they'd taken Kishua into their arms and held him close to their hearts. For weeks, the women had taken care of Kishua, feeding him meals he wasn't used to, and giving him baths that he'd never known were so much fun. And now, they were telling him how happy they were-his mothers hadn't smiled like this since before his birth father had died in the wars that took their village from them.
"You must be wondering what this is all about," said his older mother, a tall woman with dark skin and short black hair.
"Yes, I am," Kishua said. He wasn't used to being spoken to like an adult-it was strange for him, but he liked it. He especially enjoyed how happy his mothers seemed to be whenever they were talking to him. They never did that when they talked with anyone else in the village.
"There are many things we need to talk about," said Kishua's other mother, who had much lighter skin and hair like the sunlight on a bright summer day. "But first, we must tell you something special."
Kishua knew that these were not words they said every day-he was used to his mothers being more serious than this. He felt excited, but also nervous about what was to come next. But his mothers didn't seem concerned or worried about how he might react when he heard their words. Instead of sitting on the soft grass in front of him as they usually did when they spoke with one another, they both stood up straight and faced him-they had never done that before, either.
"There is something very special about this clearing," his darker mother said. "It's not a place you can simply walk into or sit down in. It's a place where you must first make yourself known." She reached out her hand and took Kishua's small one in hers, pulling him up off of the grass with her. Then she pointed to a nearby tree with branches so thick that they were hard to see through even from close up. "This is what you have to do," she said, leading him over towards it.
Kishua was nervous and didn't really understand what his mother meant by 'making yourself known'. He didn't know how to do this kind of magic-all he had ever been able to do so far in life were small things like making fire or turning a frog into gold coins when it needed money. Still, Kishua did as instructed and began tracing designs on the trunk with his finger. After doing this for several minutes, however, nothing happened-he didn't see any changes in the wood around him at all.
"Are you sure you are doing this right?" asked Kishua's lighter mother nervously. "Maybe there is another way..." She took out a small box from one of her pockets and opened it up, revealing what appeared to be an ordinary dagger inside it. But then she quickly closed the lid again before Kishua could take too close a look at it.
"I think so," said his darker mother hesitantly. "It's been many years since anyone has tried this... but I am sure there is still hope for us." She handed him back his dagger and motioned for him to continue tracing designs on the tree with its handle. After doing this again, Kishua was starting to feel like he might be getting somewhere when suddenly, a large bird landed nearby in front of them both-it was so big that it made even his mothers seem small by comparison!
"Oh my!" cried his lighter mother as she looked at the creature before them. "What an amazing sight!" But then her eyes went wide with fear when she realized what this meant: if Kishua was going to make himself known in order to use magic, it seemed that there might be more than just animals here who could see him!
"Now you must tell us your name," said his darker mother, looking up at the large bird as if expecting it to say something. Instead of speaking however, all she did was stare back at them with eyes filled with tears-as though she knew how hard this moment would be for Kishua. "Go on...tell us your name..."
Kishua shook his head sadly and looked over at her mother who seemed so lost in thought that he wasn't sure if she even realized what was happening any more...until finally, after several moments had passed, Kishua spoke up once again: "My name is Kishua."
And just like that, everything changed for him. The large bird flew away from them both without saying a word or making any other form of communication; his mother began crying even harder than before as if she knew what would happen next was not good news; and Kishua himself felt terribly confused because although he had done exactly what they asked him to do-made himself known by telling them his name-he still couldn't figure out why nothing else happened!
"But how did you know?" whispered his lighter mother as she tried desperately not only to understand but also console her older sibling at this moment. "I told you before...that I knew there was something special about our son, but it wasn't until today that he truly proved me right."
"And how did you know?" asked Kishua in return as his mind raced with thoughts of what had just happened: why hadn't the bird said anything? Why didn't his mothers seem any happier now than they were before? Was this all some kind of trick so that people wouldn't find out about him being different from everyone else-like maybe he was a witch or something?
"I knew because I recognized the look on your face as soon as you first saw it," said his darker mother. "And even though it took me longer than usual to figure out why, once we were here together in this clearing where our ancestors used to hold councils so long ago-when I realized that everything was about us making ourselves known again...I knew."
Kishua felt himself smile for the first time since seeing those two women standing before him; it almost seemed like an eternity had passed since then! But despite his mother's words, he still wasn't quite sure how exactly she meant this "making oneself known" thing worked: what if there were other people who could see him now? How would they react when they found out about his abilities and magic? Would anyone believe them-or even care at all?
As these thoughts ran through his head, Kishua's mother began looking around anxiously for something she had lost somewhere within this clearing: some kind of container with small wooden sticks inside it that she needed to perform some kind of ritual. Finally after searching everywhere without success, she stood back up straight and sighed deeply before turning toward her son once more: "Now...you must take these items from me so I can do my part."
Without hesitation or even asking why or how exactly they were supposed to work together, Kishua took both sticks out of his mother's hands as she held them gently between his own; then he placed one into each pocket on either side of his body before turning back toward where his mothers had been standing moments earlier: "What now?"
"Now," said his lighter mother, "we wait."
And that was exactly what they did until eventually it became clear from their expressions and the way they were both looking around at everything except each other that something was happening-or perhaps someone else already knew...
Chapter 2: The War Begins
Kishua had been in this village for years. He was one of the few people who knew about the magic that could be done with fire, and he'd even written a book on how to do it. But he still didn't know what would happen when he did something like this. All he knew was that when he lit up his sword, everyone stopped dead in their tracks-and then they began fighting each other because they thought Kishua had done something evil!
Kishua was scared but also determined to figure out how to control these strange new abilities of his before it was too late. He knew he needed more help than what his sister could give him; so when she
