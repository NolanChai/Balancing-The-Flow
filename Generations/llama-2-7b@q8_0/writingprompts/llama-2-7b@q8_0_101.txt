est sister, your Mom
"I just wanted to take the time to thank you for all that you’ve done for me. You have given me the confidence that I was not even sure existed in myself. You have helped me break out of my shell and put me on a path where I can achieve anything I want to achieve. Not only has your program changed who I am today, but it is also changing my future. The world may not see me as some one who is successful, or who will be successful; however I now have the confidence that if I believe in myself and follow what you’ve taught me than nothing can stop me from achieving anything."
"I had heard about you from other students in your program but I was still skeptical. But I took a chance with my future and went to your workshop. That decision has changed not only me, but my entire life. You have helped me find myself and now I am confident enough to achieve any goal that I set for myself. Your lessons taught me more than anything else in school or even outside of school."
"You are the most amazing person I’ve ever met. The work you do with us is simply incredible, and I know you can help anyone become a successful individual."
"When I first met you, you helped me change my entire mindset on what I thought was possible for myself. You taught me that no matter how many times I fail I must get back up and keep moving forward. This workshop has truly changed me as a person and made me believe in myself in ways I never imagined."
"You have completely transformed my life. Before coming to your seminar, I had lost all hope of ever achieving anything great for myself. Now, thanks to you I know that I can achieve any goal I set for myself and not let anybody or any thing stand in the way of me succeeding. Your workshop has helped me get out of a dark place and now I am focused on making my life all that it can be."
"I just wanted to say thank you so much. You have been such an amazing support system throughout my journey in school and in life. Because of you, I will succeed because you helped show me what I was capable of. You taught me how to believe in myself again and now thanks to your seminars and the lessons that I learned from them, I know that no matter what obstacles get thrown at me I can overcome anything."
"I’ve never met anyone who has inspired me like you have. Your seminar has changed my life for the better in more ways then one. You taught me about myself and my potential, which now gives me the courage to achieve anything that I set out to do. Thank you for always being so supportive of everything I’ve done throughout these past couple years."
"I just wanted to say thank you. Your seminars have not only changed me as a student but also helped me in my personal life. You taught me how to believe in myself, which is something that was difficult for me at one point in time. Now I know what it feels like to be successful and I want nothing more than for everyone else who comes into contact with you or takes your seminars so they can feel the same way."
"I had heard about your workshop from some friends of mine, but when my teacher first announced that we would be going on a field trip to see it I wasn’t very excited. But after seeing what you do at your seminar and learning all the lessons you taught us, I can honestly say that no one else could have done such an amazing job of changing our lives for good."
"I just wanted to thank you again for being so kind and understanding while helping me work through some personal issues that were affecting my school life. You gave me the confidence and motivation that was missing in order for me to succeed at everything I set out to do, which helped boost up not only my grades but also how happy I am with myself every day."
"Thank you so much! The seminar has really helped me in so many ways it’s hard to put into words what an impact it had on me as a person. You have changed my life and now I know that no matter what obstacles come my way, I can overcome them because of the confidence you gave me."
"When I first heard about your seminar I was skeptical but after attending one day, I knew right away how incredible it really was. Your lessons were so eye opening for me and now that I’ve learned all there is to learn from you I want nothing more than for everyone else out there who hasn’t had a chance yet get this same opportunity!"
"I just wanted to say thank you for giving me the confidence in myself. When I first started your workshop, I was lost and didn't know what direction my life should take or where it would end up going but now after completing all of these seminars with you by my side every step of the way - not only do I feel more confident than ever before but also so much happier with everything."
"I don’t even know where to begin. Thank You for being there for me when nobody else was, and showing me that no matter how many times things seem like they are going wrong or turning against you - there will always be light at the end of every dark tunnel because this workshop has taught me that I can overcome any obstacle in my way if it means achieving success."
"I just wanted to say thank you so much. Your seminars have not only changed how people think about me, but also helped them understand why they need to be more accepting and understanding of others."
"Thank you for helping me believe in myself again! Before meeting with your seminar I didn’t know what my life would look like or where it was going because every time something went wrong - instead of trying harder at something else that might work better out next time - all I did was quit altogether and give up hope on ever doing anything successful."
"Your seminars are absolutely incredible. Not only have they changed me as a person but also how others see me, which is why it’s so important for everyone to know about your workshop before getting too deep into this life because the lessons that you taught us can truly change someone forever if given the chance."
"I just wanted to thank you again. Your seminar has helped me become more confident in myself and now I’m finally ready to take on any obstacle thrown my way no matter how difficult it may seem at first glance!"
"Before coming to your seminar, all I ever dreamed of was being able to make my parents proud by attending college after graduating high school. But thanks to you I have been given so many opportunities throughout these past few years that now I feel confident enough not only achieve what they wanted me too but also succeed at something else completely different then originally planned."
"You taught us how important it is for people like ourselves (those who are struggling with finding themselves) to understand their worth and believe in the potential inside each one of us because without this confidence no matter what we do - our dreams will always be just out reach!"
"I just wanted to say thank you so much. Your seminars have not only changed how people think about me but also helped them understand why they need to be more accepting and understanding of others."
