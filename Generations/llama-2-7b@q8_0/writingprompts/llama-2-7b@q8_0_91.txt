 I knew he was n't supposed to answer with the truth. `` Same way I always do. '' His antennae were twitching nervously, and my instincts told me that he 'd been lying again. As much as I tried not to admit it, I felt a little sorry for Derrick. He had to pretend to be human all day long in order to hide his true identity from the rest of the world. He did n't have any friends or family who knew about him because that was against his kind 's laws. Even I didn 't know what he looked like when he took off his clothes, and he never invited me over to his house (even though I sometimes wanted to see). `` Where are we going today?'' Derrick asked as I started toward the bus stop. He always asked that question every day. Sometimes I answered him with a secret route, but since it was my first time on the job this week, I decided to tell him where he 'd be working. `` Today you're going to be at the school. '' Derrick smiled as if he were surprised by the news. It seemed like every day was a surprise for him when we worked together, but that was n't really true. He knew what all of his assignments were and which ones he 'd been given the longest time beforehand. I just never told him in advance because it felt like too much work explaining things to him. `` The school?'' Derrick said as he tried to hide his disappointment. He must have really wanted a different assignment today. `` That's right, man. You 're going to be at the elementary school down the street from here. '' I watched for my bus and noticed that it was almost full of people who were all sitting in their seats with bags and backpacks. It made me sad to think about how much they had to carry around on a daily basis, just like Derrick did too. `` Hey, man!'' Derrick suddenly jumped up next to me as I waved at the bus driver. I turned around quickly so that he would n't catch me looking at him and continued waving my hand in front of the bus window. The bus pulled away from our stop and took off down the road, but it didn 't make me feel any better about leaving Derrick there without knowing what was going on with him later in the day or week or month (or even longer).
