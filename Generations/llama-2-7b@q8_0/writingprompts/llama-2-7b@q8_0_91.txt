ubbles of every shade of blue and purple that I had ever seen or imagined. This world of colours, the ocean’s palette, had been frozen in time by the camera’s lens.
For a second, everything seemed to freeze. I was frozen. The water frozen in its current position as it pushed past the rocks on its path towards the shore. A flash of lightning fractured this image as if someone had smeared peanut butter over my screen. It took me some moments to realise that these were not lightning bolts, but rather plankton floating in a school with their phosphorescent glow.
It was night time when we first set foot on the sandy beach. The shore stretched out before us as far as I could see. Our guide had told us to turn off our torches and only use them if we got into trouble or if we needed to find a way back in the dark. This is how we would be able to observe nature at night, he explained. It was true: it was so quiet that you could hear your own heartbeat. We had to wait until the moon had risen and the clouds parted so we could see what our guide described as “the magic of the underwater world”.
It was only when we were completely still and silent in this dark, empty landscape did I finally realise that I had never felt more vulnerable or more alive than at this very moment.
We continued to walk along the sandy beach until it turned into mud. It was slippery and mildly dangerous to negotiate with my bag filled with waterproof cameras over my shoulder. We walked in a single file, making our way through thick vegetation, up a gentle slope and down again towards the sea. The darkness intensified as we walked further away from the beach.
Our guide told us that when you see animals at night they often come into view only briefly before disappearing quickly into the shadows. He was right. We saw many nocturnal creatures along our journey; a scorpion-tailed gecko, the flickers of fireflies, and one particularly large tarantula which seemed to be trying to catch up with us in the dark.
Finally we arrived at an area where the rocks met the ocean. I was surprised by how quiet it was here. There were no waves or birds chirping as there had been on the beach. We put down our bags and stood still, our senses alert to every sound around us, like hunters waiting for their prey. Our guide told us not to be afraid of anything we may see at night because everything was harmless.
At first I thought he was talking about spiders or insects with razor-sharp claws but then a few moments later I saw the shape of something large and unidentifiable swimming towards me in the water. It looked like it was made out of plastic. My guide laughed, “It’s just some of our local fishermen’s rubbish.” He pointed to another floating object a little further away: a discarded beer bottle. I could make out the silhouette of an octopus hiding between the rocks next to us and was surprised by how small it looked in comparison with its surroundings.
Without any warning, my guide pulled me up from the water. “Are you ready for this?” he asked in a whisper.
I followed his eyes through the dark and found myself staring at a group of people who had gathered on the beach around the bonfire they’d built to keep warm after their day out fishing. They looked like ghosts with their faces illuminated by flames and were so close that I could hear them speaking in low voices about something as if it were top secret information being shared amongst members of a special ops group.
We walked back towards our boat, the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks behind us. My camera was filled with the magic of an underwater world I had never seen before and it gave me goosebumps to think that I may have been able to capture this incredible view on film if only for a split second.
This is why we don’t go out after dark, my friend said as he turned off our torches on our walk back through the dense jungle from where we had been fishing during the day. We both knew that it was dangerous to be outside at night in this area but we had decided to ignore his warning and see what happened for ourselves.
Our guide warned us against taking any photographs while out on our boat because he said there were too many piranhas swimming nearby. He told us that if one got its teeth into your arm or hand then it would be very painful but wouldn’t cause death unless you lost too much blood.
I was so eager to take my first ever photograph of a wild animal that I ignored what he said and began snapping away with my camera while we were out on the boat. There was something about this place which made me feel like nothing could hurt me, even though it was dark outside and there wasn’t a single light for miles around us except for our headlights as they shone across the water towards land.
We had been told that if you fell into any of these rivers then you would have no chance at surviving because most were inhabited by large crocodiles which could kill an adult man in one bite, so I was relieved when our guide said we should leave now before anything happened to us. As he helped me onto the shore back on dry land once again I felt my camera slipping from my hands as it fell into the water where it would remain for eternity unless someone found it and retrieved it sometime in the future.
I was so scared that I ran as fast as I could towards home while still hearing shouts coming from behind me saying “Wait! Don’t leave without your camera!” but there was nothing else left to do except hope for the best which is exactly what happened next.
We were told not to take our cameras with us when we went out fishing because they would get ruined if we dropped them into any of these rivers, but I wanted so badly to prove to myself that this place wasn’t as dangerous as people made it out to be that I ignored what everyone had been saying for years. It was only after we got back onto shore when my friend pointed out how much damage had already been done before he even started fishing!
My camera was completely ruined by being submerged in water because of all the bubbles and sediment which had entered through its lens during our journey into this wildlife reserve. I tried desperately to salvage what I could but there was no use, so after spending two whole days working on it we finally decided that it would be best if we just threw it away rather than keep trying to fix something which wasn’t even worth fixing anymore.
I had never been anywhere near this place before and now that I have seen what it looks like at night time through my own eyes rather than others, I know for certain that there is nothing else left in life which could possibly scare me more than fishing after dark without a proper camera to capture the beauty of our surroundings!
Our guide told us not to be afraid as we approached his home. He said it was just one of many places where people lived along this river, but we had never seen anything like it before and were anxious about what we might find inside. As we stepped into the doorway of the thatch-roofed hut, I could see a small fire burning in its centre with a pot bubbling over the flames. In front of us was an older man who sat cross-legged on the ground while two women were working at his side preparing food for dinner time.
I have been coming here to this place ever since it was first built, our guide said as he introduced himself and offered us some tea from a cup that had been kept warm by the fire. He told us how each family lives in their own small house made of wood or mud, but we would only be able to see them when they were outside working on the farm because everyone else stays inside all day long without any windows for light and air to enter through.
Our guide showed us around his home where he had painted pictures on every wall which told stories about life in this village over the years: from how many children have been born since then up until today as well as what food was available each year due to weather patterns changing with time etcetera! It felt like stepping back into history when we visited this place because everything seemed so ancient and untouched by modern society.
Whenever I close my eyes now, all that comes into mind is the memory of my first visit to a village on this river bank where I got to see how people live without any luxury items like phones or TVs but instead rely solely upon what nature provides them each day such as fresh fruit from nearby trees or fish caught in nets before they’re cooked over an open fire outside.
Our guide said that if we wanted a chance at seeing this place by nighttime then we would have to be very quiet so as not to disturb any of the locals who are trying hard enough during their busy day without being bothered by tourists! I thought it was quite funny how he managed to combine both English and French into one sentence but didn’t seem at all offended when I pointed this out later on in conversation; instead, he just laughed and said “It is my own unique way of speaking!”
