ared at him. Her mouth opened slightly but nothing came out for several seconds. Then she laughed, softly, like a giggle, though he knew she was trying not to laugh. It was a terrible thing to see her laugh like this: like a child who's afraid of being found out. He wanted to take hold of her and tell her it was all right, but he didn't know what to say to make her stop laughing.
 
 ``I guess you don't have many children in your world...'' she said, still giggling, the tears coming down her cheeks now. She held out the book so he could see it, and laughed again as though the words were a private joke between them.
 
 ``No, I don't know why you think that. It was just an idea for a story or something...''
 
 The laughter suddenly stopped and she wiped away her tears with the back of her hand. ``Oh, God... I can't do this...'' She took off her glasses and started to cry again, but she kept her eyes on him. He wanted to ask her what was wrong but couldn't think of anything to say that would make it better.
 
 He waited for a minute or two until the tears stopped and then said, ``I don't know how you got here, I don't know why...'' he said, trying not to stare at her bare legs as they hung over the edge of the bed. Her arms were folded across her chest and she looked at him like a little girl who had just been punished for something.
 
 ``What do you mean?'' She sniffed loudly through her nose, still looking at him with wide eyes. It made his stomach turn over to see her crying like this. He wanted to tell her it was all right and that he'd take care of everything but didn't know how.
 
 ``Well... I don't really have a choice now, do I?'' she said finally, wiping at the corner of one eye with the back of her hand.
He nodded his head, not wanting to say anything. He looked at her and realized that he would never see her again after today so he decided not to worry about it anymore. She reached out for him, still looking away from him, her eyes wet and red, but there was a smile on her lips now; the kind of smile you give when someone has told you something terrible they can't help but tell you anyway because it's all part of what happened in their lives before meeting each other...
