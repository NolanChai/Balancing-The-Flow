ents out space for them in his backyard. And when he rented out his home two years ago, one of the first things he did was put up some bird feeders and water dishes for the flock that had decided to call his house their permanent residence.
Now, my neighbor has never been what I would consider an animal lover. He is not a crazy cat lady who feeds squirrels, birds and raccoons out of her back door while singing show tunes at them, but he does like animals. He likes dogs better than cats (he has 2 dogs) but his love for all things avian seems to know no bounds.
Now this is not the first time that I have mentioned Flamingos in my blogs, but they do come up a lot. My grandmother was a huge fan of flamingos and used them as decorative accents on her property for years. And when she died, my parents decided to continue the tradition by purchasing a large pair of fiberglass birds that stand guard at our mailbox.
But back to the subject at hand- my neighbor and his Flamingo love affair. It really is amazing how much he cares about these little pink monstrocities, but when you stop to think about it, flamingos are a pretty tough bird to dislike. They are a relatively good sized animal, (about 4 feet tall) and they tend to be quite colorful- even the males. And while I will admit that their long legs and necks make them look sort of awkward, I can't really fault him for liking them.
One thing about my neighbor's backyard birds is that they do not like to leave. In fact, most of them stay in our back yard year round- even though there are many places nearby where they could live. But apparently they are happy enough with a large water bowl and some feeders, so I have no complaints.
As long as my neighbor can afford their upkeep, I will continue to support his flamingo flock and consider them an improvement over the neighborhood cats that used to hang out in our backyard.
