el as he spoke.
 
 `` He's a monster!''
 
 `` No,'' I said, and pointed at the slime. `` He has been drinking blood all day long.''
 
 `` Still no problem,'' said green slimy dude. 
 
 I looked at him in disgust. What a loser!
 
 `` You are an idiot, aren't you?'' I asked green slimy dude. He didn't answer me but started drinking the blood faster. 
 
 Green slime monster was not really my problem. I had my own problems. Like getting a new job and keeping my old one. Or at least keeping my current boss from firing me. My life is busy. I don't have time to get into other people's business, no matter how much fun it seems like it would be. 
 
 ``You should run away before he eats you,'' said a voice behind me.
 
 I turned around and saw the ghostly green slime monster sitting at my desk. He was writing in my notebook with his tongue. It was gross to see it. I wanted to turn away but I couldn't because that would make him mad. That would mean he would eat me first, then come back for everyone else after. 
 
 ``I'll run later,'' said the slime monster, wiping his tongue on my notebook paper. ``I don't feel like it right now.'' Then I heard him grind his teeth as he sucked down another human head. 
 
 The green slimy monster was evil and that was all there is to say about this. There are some people you should never befriend or help, and if they try to make friends with you, you shouldn't. Like the green slime monster.
