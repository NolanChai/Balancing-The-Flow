 between our mom and dad, but we never understood why things had to end up as they did. When you are a kid and something bad happens in your life it's not easy to understand that there is more going on than just that one thing, like a parent divorce for example. I didn’t think much about the painful circumstances because my main focus was having fun with my brother. We were very close and always had each other’s back. 
 My parents went their separate ways when I was 13 years old. A few months later, my father took me out for dinner to a nice restaurant as a treat for all the hard work I did helping him run his construction company. After we finished eating my dad handed me an envelope that had $500 cash inside. He said “I have something for you and it’s very important that you understand how serious this is”.
 My father explained to me that he wanted me to use the money to pay off any debts I might be in or maybe even buy a car if I wanted but one thing was certain: _If you lose all of this, don’t come crying to me_. He explained it all very matter-of-factly as if giving me a few hundred dollars was no big deal at all. 
 My father’s words have stayed with me since that day. It was then I understood how serious my parents were about not being able to repay the debt and they weren't willing to help me out of it either, but also, I felt like something bad had happened because if someone gave you money they want to be compensated somehow right? Well that’s what I thought. 
 My dad was a hard working man, he made sure our family didn't want for anything and we never went hungry. But the thing is; my father had always been very protective over me even before everything went south between him and my mom so it wasn't surprising that when I finally started getting into trouble he tried to do something about it, but unfortunately at this point in time he was already broke so all we could afford were small bumps here and there which weren’t enough to save our asses from getting nailed. 
 My first year in jail was the hardest because I knew what kind of life awaited me once released; my family would be in debt and we'd have nothing left to live on, I also knew that being broke is not a good place for someone who wants freedom back because it will make you feel like a slave.
 But then something happened that changed everything… 
 My brother called me one day and told me he had an idea about how to get out of jail but at the same time help our family financially. He said "I can't believe what I am going to tell you right now" which made me feel a bit apprehensive because most of the ideas we came up with were just plain stupid. But it turned out my brother was onto something and by the end of that night, he had managed to convince me into joining his scheme without telling him why I agreed or even what the plan was about! 
 My brother wanted me to become a hitman but after hearing his idea, I decided against doing anything crazy like murder someone for money. He explained how easy it would be because no one cared if another person got killed in the streets of Miami so we didn’t have to worry about getting caught or going to jail again; all that mattered was getting paid!

 I am not a hitman but my brother wanted me to become one and I agreed because it seemed like a good idea at first. The plan he proposed involved paying people off for their debts using our criminal connections in the underworld so we didn't have any money issues anymore, this would also help with the situation of us getting busted by police officers because they don’t really care about who gets killed or not if someone owes them some cash!
