aches and cream. Its more like a giant spider with sharp teeth that devour the hope of humanity. It doesn ’ t give a damn if you understand it or if it causes pain in people just because it feels like it. ” 
 
 “ I know. You don ’ t need to tell me. ” 
 
 “ But it can ’ t be wrong, and when it is, there are consequences that will make the Spanish Inquisition look like a fun family day out at a theme park. ” 
 
 “ There ’ s no such thing as black and white in science, ” he said and started pacing again. “ You always need to find some kind of gray area because there ’ s always room for doubt or even the possibility that someone makes a mistake. It just happens and sometimes it can be quite serious. I mean how many people do you think have died from science? How many scientists have committed suicide over something they did wrong in their research ? ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t know…maybe half of them, ” she said with a shrug. 
 
 “I think that is quite an underestimation. In the worst case scenario there are all these experiments conducted to find out how close we can get to creating life. Scientists have spent their whole lives trying to do it and they still haven ’ t succeeded in any way that you or I could understand. They have done something, but it wasn ’ t what they intended…and then there were all the accidents involving experiments gone wrong. ” 
 
 “I think the word mistake is too soft. Accident implies that everything was fine until some random event occurred and then everyone involved died from it. That ’ s not always how these things go, ” she said. “ I have seen what science can do, and believe me…it has a mind of its own. ” 
 
 “I think you have to trust in your instincts when dealing with the unknown. The reason we don ’ t know all there is to know about the world around us is because so much is still shrouded in mystery. There are many things that science can ’ t explain, and some of these things could be very dangerous…so why do you think it ’ s a good idea to meddle with them? ” 
 
 “I don ’ t want to meddle with anything. I just want to know what happened! And if the people who did this are still here, then I need to find out how they got away from me. ” 
 
 “And you think it was some sort of scientific experiment? You mean like something that would involve aliens or extraterrestrial life? ” 
 
 “Well no…I don ’ t know what the hell happened but if these people can do all this stuff, they are more advanced than us. I don ’ t think any scientist in their right mind is capable of pulling something like that off. They need to be a group, working together and I think we should find out who they are. ” 
 
 “And how exactly would you go about doing this? The police aren ’ t even going to help us, so why do you think anyone else will want to get involved with what has happened here ? ” 
 
 “Well, the only other option is me on my own…and I think that could be a problem. ” 
 
 “Why do you say that? You have been pretty resourceful in your work up until this point, ” he said as he moved closer to her and dropped onto one knee. He reached out for her hand but she pulled it back quickly. 
 
 “And you think I will be any good when dealing with a group of highly-trained scientists who know everything there is to know about the human body and its limits? ” she said, crossing her arms over her chest as she glared at him from behind them. “ Don ’ t they have some sort of code that makes sure experiments are conducted in an ethical manner? ” 
 
 “If you had been with me for longer I could tell you that the only thing scientists have to abide by is their own ethics and sometimes they don ’ t even do that. If there was a code then there wouldn ’ t be any need for laws. There are always loopholes in these things, ” he said and leaned over her shoulder so he could see what she was looking at on the screen. 
 
 She shook her head as she looked at him with narrowed eyes. “ It doesn ’ t mean you have to go into battle armed with only a slingshot, though…you should get yourself some guns and bring some friends along. ” He chuckled softly. “ And I suppose it would help if we had some weapons of our own. ” 
 
 She thought about this for a few moments before answering him. “ There is one thing that you can do to help…something that will be useful in almost every situation, and that ’ s magic. You know how to use spells and potions, so why not let me try some out on you? I think they could give us an edge over whatever we are up against. ” 
 
 “I don ’ t mind trying it if it will help…but what kind of magic do you have in mind? ” he asked her as he studied the image on the screen once more and frowned at it. 
 
 She shrugged and said, “I could make something to increase your strength or speed…something that will help us stay safe while we investigate what happened here. If you are going into battle against some powerful scientists then you should have some kind of advantage over them. ” 
 
 He looked at her and gave a slight smile. “ And just how do you propose to do this? I mean, there are hundreds of spells out there, and it would take a lifetime to memorize all of them. What makes you think you can make one that will help us against the people who did this ? ” 
 
 “I have read about some very powerful ones in books…and some of them use very little magic to do amazing things. I mean, just look at those pictures on the wall over there. If we were able to recreate something like that then we would be set. All we need is a starting point and it shouldn ’ t take long to figure out what we are looking for. ” 
 
 He thought about her words for a few moments before replying, “Okay, but just in case this doesn ’ t work the way you expect then I will still be there with my gun, okay? ” he said as he stood up again and looked at her over his shoulder. “ And don ’ t forget that I am armed…even if we are going to do some magic. ” 
 
 She rolled her eyes but nodded in agreement before turning away from him. “I know you will be there. You just can ’ t stay out of trouble for too long, can you? ” he gave a short chuckle as she sat down at the computer again and continued searching through files until finally finding what she was looking for. 
 
 He watched her intently from behind as she pulled up another file on the screen that had more information than before but it was still incomplete. She scrolled through it until she reached a section where there were images of two men in lab coats and a woman with blonde hair. “ I think these are them, ” she said as she looked at him from over her shoulder and he nodded. “ If you could remember the exact date they disappeared then we will know how far back we need to go. ” 
 
 He stared down at the screen for a few moments before frowning again. “ It says here that these two men were working on an experiment with some kind of genetic material, but I don ’ t know what it is or where they got it from. The only thing I can tell you for sure is that this image was taken in 1950. ” 
 
 She let out a heavy sigh as she pulled her hands away from the keyboard and dropped them to her side. “Well…I think we need to find someone who knows more about genetic material than I do, or at least has access to some books on the subject that might give us an idea of what these two men were trying to create. ” 
 
 “Yeah, but how? What are we supposed to do now that we have no leads and nothing useful to go off of ? ” he said as he stared down at his feet for a few moments before looking back up again and meeting her eyes once more. She could see the fear in them as she continued to glare at him from across the room. 
 
 “Well, you know I have some people who work for me…and maybe they can help us out with this. If not then I ’ ll find someone else who knows more about genetic material than I do and we will just have to try our luck there instead. ” she said as she turned away from the computer once more, her face turning back into a serious expression. “ And if that doesn ’ t work either then maybe we should go back to our old ways of finding information on people. It is hard but at least it gives us something else to do while waiting for answers. ” 
 
 He didn ’ t say anything as he thought about what she had said, not really knowing how to reply. He wanted to help her but there was only so much that any one person could do on their own and after everything they had been
