1960s and I am the only person who remembers what happened.
I found myself being treated like a criminal when I first got here because they had no idea why I knew things that were so strange. There are many reasons for this world to be screwed up, but it's hard to explain any of them to anyone on this world. They have no concept of science at all, not even what electricity is.
But I have to get back to my room because the other students will start arriving soon and we are supposed to eat dinner together tonight. I do hope that they don't try to kill me again!
