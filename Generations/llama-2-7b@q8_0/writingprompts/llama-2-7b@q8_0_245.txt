 the name of the building. It looked like someone had written on a clean sheet of paper and then erased it all.

 ``That's so weird.'' 
 I turned back to face myself.
 
 ``Yeah? You have something else to do?'' 
 I didn't reply, but the mirror replied for me anyway:

 ``````````````````````
 I would have liked to go with you, but this is my space now!
````````````````````
 I turned around to see if someone was there. 
 There was no one there except me. 
 No mirrors.

 ``````````````````````
 It's weird isn't it?

 ````````````````````
 A voice from above: ``Do you want to meet your maker now?''.

 ``````````````````````
 I looked up and there was a man standing next to the mirror. He had short black hair, a thin face with small lips, and deep eyes. 
 My heart skipped a bit. 
 The man looked at me suspiciously before asking: ``What are you doing here?''.

 ````````````````````
 I explained to him my situation as best as possible. 
 He listened patiently then said: ``Sorry, but I don't know about that.'' 
 His name was Hector and he worked at the company where I used to work for a long time ago. I had met him when I started working in their offices. We became friends after sharing many lunches together. 
 He had been transferred to another office two years ago, but still kept in touch with me from time to time.

 ``I have a good offer for you though''. 

 ````````````````````
 Hector looked at me carefully as if I was going to jump out and kill him any second. Then he said:

 ``````````````````````
 ``Well, I don't have anything better to do right now.'' 
 And so we went back upstairs where he started explaining my situation in detail until I understood everything perfectly well! 
 After all these years of being a professional translator myself (which makes me laugh every time), it's easy for me not only understand what people say but also write down what they mean when speaking another language than their own. 
 So as soon as we reached the lobby again, he said:

 ````````````````````
 ``Well then let's go!'' 
 And so we did! 
 It was a nice walk through downtown Vancouver even if it was raining heavily and cold outside. We talked about our past lives until we reached the building where I used to work before taking some time off. 
 Hector had brought with him one of his notebooks filled with notes on translation theory and linguistics but also memories from when he studied abroad for two years while working as an assistant professor at Oxford University during graduate school. We talked about our different lives until we reached the building where I used to work before taking some time off.
