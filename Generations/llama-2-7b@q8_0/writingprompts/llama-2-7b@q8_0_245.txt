aterpillar-girl? It wasn't even that bad, you know. She was my neighbour and we went to school together. But she had those black braids on her head – _fascinating_ – and a face like a potato. And when the weather was nice she opened her window wide open so that every time I heard her play I wanted to die. I hate you.
 I hate you because your mother always said that I should go for violin lessons too, but my father wouldn't allow it, even though I tried everything. "You don't have talent," he said. "It doesn't run in the family." He was right. You were born into a musical family and so you became one of those.
 It must be a terrible thing to play the violin as if no one else has ever done it before. Every time I heard your mother, I thought that I would kill myself – _and she played very badly_. I hate you.
 I hate you because your mother always said: "The violin is the most beautiful instrument in the world." And her eyes shone when she told me this. She was a good violinist and she played like a breeze through a forest, but that made it worse for me, because then I would be angry all day long.
 I hate you because your mother always said: "My little angel! You must be the next Mozart." And when I asked why, she told me to listen. So I listened and my head started spinning. It was like I had drunk too much wine or something. That's what music does to people, I know that now. But your mother wouldn't admit it: "It's because you have an ear for it," she said.
 I hate you because every time you practised in front of my window, I wanted to kill myself and it got worse each time. I hated you for having such a beautiful instrument – the one that everyone else envied so much – while I had nothing, not even the courage to take violin lessons. But your mother didn't let me get away with this; she would stand in front of my window and play for me: _"Wouldn't you like a violin like that?"_
 I hate you because one time your mother played so loudly – the way only mothers can do, you know, to prove how good they are at something, even when it's not true – that my father got angry and said that she was killing me. "The music is hurting him," he shouted from across the room. And your mother didn't answer a word; she just kept playing as if nothing had happened.
 I hate you because I was jealous of you, even though you were only eight years old at the time and that makes me sick with shame when I think about it now. But how could I not be? Everyone else in the neighbourhood admired you: the teachers, your classmates, other mothers, fathers. You became famous almost overnight because of music – you were one of those children who is born to play an instrument and to make everyone around them happy. It's just so unfair!
 I hate you for being happy at such a young age. For never having been sad or angry in your life, which only makes me feel worse when I look at you. Your mother always said: "You will become a star someday." And she was right – not because you are particularly gifted or have anything special about you, but simply because you were born into the right family with the right parents and friends who supported you through everything. You were so lucky to have that talent as your best friend; it didn't make sense that I had nothing like that to be happy with either.
 I hate you for being able to laugh at yourself, even though you're not very funny and no one finds you amusing. That's a privilege you weren't entitled to.
 I hate you because your mother used to say: "You will have to learn the violin when you grow up." She said that all the time. It was her way of showing off how good she was and also making sure that I didn't forget what my goal in life should be. It didn't help, though, because it wasn't possible for me either then or now.
 And now? Now? I hate you for being the next Mozart – even if you're not! They say that a genius is always ahead of his time and that's why people can never understand what they do. Well, I think your mother was just making up stories to make me feel guilty. You've had everything handed to you on a plate, so now you don't even have to work hard anymore; you just pick up the instrument and play beautiful melodies like that.
 But there is one thing about which neither of us has ever lied: _I hate you because your mother always said she loved me_. And if it wasn't for her, then I would probably feel a little better towards you now – but no! She only did this so as to make me jealous and miserable.
And that is why I hate you. 
 
 _A_ _nd one day you will be old enough to understand what she did._ 
 
 I hope so. But there is something else that I don't understand yet: How can my mother possibly like you? I have asked her this many times, but she always answers by saying "You haven't been able to hear it properly." And the fact that she has never listened to a single note of your playing, even though I tried to make her several times, only confirms what I believe: _Your mother doesn't like music at all_.
 No, she hates it. And you are the reason for this hatred. It was not enough for me that my brother played every day and that the violin made him happy – he had to go on to become famous too! You are her worst nightmare: a child who is good at something that she herself can't do. Your mother has never been able to forgive you for this; I have always noticed it in her eyes, how she looked at me and tried to tell me all about you by raising her eyebrows and saying "the violin..." And whenever she was really angry with you or she just wanted to hurt me, then she would say: _"Your brother is playing the violin. We'll talk later."_
 I know that my mother loves music; she is a great pianist. But if someone had told me before I met you that it is possible for an adult woman to hate this thing which she herself has been doing all her life, then I would have thought they were crazy – and yet it happened. All of it – everything!
 One time when I was little, my mother was teaching me the piano: "Left hand, right hand," she said. "It's very important to start from a young age if you want to play well." She told me this all day long, until at some point I got angry and asked her why it is so important for people to learn something when they are children. And then she stopped playing for a moment; the fingers that were flying over the keys rested on top of the piano, which was what always happened whenever we had a fight. _"You will see,"_ she said, _"when you grow up."_
 I did not understand this answer until one day when you moved in next to my house. We became friends and I discovered that your mother is right: It really does make sense for children to learn the violin – especially if they have a talent. This was how it all began, but there was something else which came later: _My mother hates music._
 She doesn't hate everyone who plays an instrument or sings; she only dislikes those who are good at it and who make her feel inadequate because of this. And you are the best example of someone like that – a person for whom everything is easy, even though no one knows why! I have asked her many times to explain this to me and every time I hear the same answer: "It's a gift." But if there really were such things as gifts, then they would be more common – wouldn't you agree?
 Your mother also tells me that you don't get anything for free. That it was only because of her that she found out about your talent in the first place and that she gave everything to see you fulfil your dreams. I have always believed her, but now I am not so sure anymore... It is one thing if someone is born with a special gift; that's fine. But when someone makes themselves better at something by working hard – then _that_ is impressive!
 What else does your mother say? That you worked hard for five years to get into the music school and that it was only because of her that this happened in the end. _"I gave my whole life to support you,"_ she said to me once. It makes me feel so sad when I think about all of the sacrifices she has made for your sake, especially since neither of us knows whether there really is any point in it after all...
 But back then – five years ago! – everyone was sure that this would be enough and you were going to become a famous violinist. Everyone around me supported her in what she believed: _I will make my son happy_ , they said. And she did; everything went well, until one day when I heard from
