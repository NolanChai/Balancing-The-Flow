 silly talk from fearful townsfolk. Yet, now that we were there, standing face to face with its walls, it was clear that something wasn’t quite right.
As we marched in, the people of Gaul parted to allow us passage, though not without stares and whispers. As we marched into the city I couldn’t help but notice how silent the streets were. It felt as if nobody cared about what we did or said, they simply let us pass unmolested. We continued onward until we came upon a building that was surrounded by barred windows and iron bars topped with spikes.
It was at this point when I realized something was not quite right: the people of Gaul were afraid of us. They had parted ways so we could march into their city, but now they hid from us behind walls made of iron that would deter our swords and spears. It was a clear sign of fear.
At this point my curiosity overcame me and I took the lead of our group to investigate further. As we approached the building in question it became apparent that there was something unusual about its structure; something seemed off-kilter with how the bricks were laid together, as if they had been placed at odd angles or in unnatural positions.
It was then that I noticed a strange symbol etched into one of the stones; a circle enclosed by three crosses within an inverted triangle shape with what appeared to be a dot over each point. This wasn’t just any old image though-it was clearly meant to represent something important.
As we drew closer, I began to recognize some of these symbols from other places in Gaul; they were used frequently for decorative purposes on walls or buildings but this particular design seemed out of place compared to all the others that surrounded it.
At once my mind raced with possibilities: was there something special about this building that made it stand out? Or perhaps it was simply a reminder of someone’s devotion, a sign that they had come from far away and brought their beliefs along with them? Whatever the case may be, one thing was for sure-this was no ordinary structure.
Upon further inspection we discovered an elaborate door made entirely out of iron bars. Its hinges were decorated in similar symbols to those etched into stone and there was a small plaque affixed above the entrance reading “Citadel”. This seemed like it could be our best chance yet at understanding what lay inside.
I decided that I would enter first so as not to raise suspicion amongst my fellow soldiers; after all, we were supposedly here for an alliance between nations rather than anything else. But once I had stepped foot into the Citadel I realized this was no ordinary structure either-the walls were adorned with what looked like ancient runes and there was a small chamber just off to one side that contained several strange items such as strange crystals and bones of some sort, arranged in a pattern along the floor.
It became clear then that we had entered somewhere far more significant than we had initially anticipated; this place held secrets that could only be understood by those who sought knowledge beyond what most people are capable of comprehending. And it was at this point when I knew that our investigation into Gaul’s strange mysteries would be more complicated than we had first imagined…
