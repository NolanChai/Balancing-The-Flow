 up just as the computer announced, ``Emergency disengage complete. Landing in 12 seconds.''
Andrew relaxed as he watched the final countdown. His body was still undergoing the transition to Mars' gravity, but his mind had already begun to adjust to it. It felt a bit strange, like everything around him was moving slightly faster than normal, and he wasn't used to walking with such extra effort; he had gotten use to it over time, but now he had only been on the surface for 5 minutes, so the strain of keeping his body moving at the appropriate speed made things a little... odd.
``We will be landing in 10 seconds... 9... 8... 7... 6...'' the computer counted down to zero without pause. The atmosphere slowed Andrew's movements more and more, making it harder to keep up with his thoughts. ``5... 4... 3... 2... 1! LANDING IN ONE SECOND!''
The ground rushed toward Andrew as he stepped forward; the computer had counted down to one second too soon. He landed heavily on the surface, and looked around him. The first thing he noticed was that there were no other people here. There wasn't even a settlement or town in sight. Looking over his shoulder, Andrew saw what the other men must have seen upon landing on Mars for the first time: a wide expanse of flat plain; dark gray in color with only some small patches of lighter sand dotted throughout.
Andrew walked to the edge of the plain and looked out across it. There were no hills, mountains or even buildings. Just endless brown fields that stretched as far as he could see in every direction. He took one step forward, then another. Suddenly his foot sank into the dirt, nearly up to his ankle.
Andrew paused, and looked down at the soil. It was darker than the ground around it; a reddish brown color, unlike that of Earth's sandy dirt. Andrew pulled out the shovel that was stashed in a compartment on his suit, and began to dig out some more of the sand. He sifted through the piles looking for something... anything!
``What are you doing?'' someone asked from behind him.
Andrew turned around quickly, unsure what he might find there. He was surprised to see a man in his mid-twenties standing there; his brown hair tied back into a ponytail and the red jumpsuit of an astronaut.
``I'm looking for something...'' Andrew responded nervously. ``A piece of equipment, perhaps? A tool maybe?'' He tried to think of anything he might have forgotten, but couldn't remember any special tools being required for this mission.
The man laughed and said ``I've been here two days, I'm sure whatever you were looking for is still around!''
Andrew smiled as the man walked up to him. He was about his age; he had been in the same program that Andrew had completed back on Earth. They both felt like they had known each other forever, and Andrew knew they would get along well.
The two of them began digging at different piles of dirt until they found a piece of equipment Andrew had forgotten to pack; an antenna used for communications with the base. With that he decided it was time to start the next part of his mission: locating the rest of his team...
Andrew and the man walked side by side down the edge of the plain, heading toward where they thought the base might be. They looked around as they walked, looking for any sign of civilization or habitation - anything that would tell them where they were going next on their journey. ``I don't remember seeing any of these rocks before...'' Andrew said, pointing to a large rock lying off in the distance from where he stood with his friend. It looked like it had been placed there on purpose; its surface was smooth and even, with no signs of erosion or other natural causes that might explain how it got there.
``That's weird...'' Andrew said as they drew closer to the object. It wasn't just any old rock however, but something very special indeed - it looked like an alien spaceship! They were still far enough away from it to see clearly though; a large structure made of metal with curved wings on either side and a small doorway at its front end which appeared to be leading inside. ``What do you think that is?'' Andrew asked his friend who had stopped walking so he could get a closer look at the strange craft himself.
The man shrugged before answering back: ``It looks like some kind of spaceship... but why would anyone leave such an important piece of equipment out here in open space?'' He scratched his head thoughtfully before continuing on again towards what had to be the landing site for this mysterious craft - as far as he knew there were no other structures like it anywhere else on Mars.
They reached their destination just seconds later; another alien structure sitting nearby with nothing but sand stretching out all around them into infinity - except instead of being made out of metal like before, this one seemed to be made out of stone! It wasn't quite as large either though; more like an oversized bunker than anything else.
``What is that thing?'' Andrew asked his friend once again after they had gotten close enough to get a good look at it from up front. ``I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before!'' His eyes widened as he looked around, trying to take in all of the details in one glance...
The man turned around slowly until his face was almost level with Andrew's own; then he replied: ``It looks like some kind of alien spacecraft! I don't know what it is exactly but we should get back to camp - they'll want to see this too!'' He started walking again before turning and offering out a hand to help his friend up onto his feet once more.
The two men made their way back through the sand dunes until they reached base, where all of their team members were waiting for them inside the entrance hallway. ``What did you find?'' one man asked excitedly as Andrew stepped through door into what he had been expecting: an abandoned building filled with dust and cobwebs!
``I found a spaceship... '' Andrew said simply before turning back around to see if any of his teammates would believe him or not. They all looked at each other, unsure how to react - until one man finally spoke up once again: ``Well done! Now we can start heading out into space again!''
``You're going to have a lot more fun here than I do,'' Andrew said as he walked past the group towards where his team was waiting for him. He didn't say anything else but knew what they must be thinking - and it wasn't good...
