udge off to sleep.
Later that night, after a decent amount of tossing and turning due to the fact I was restless because of work related matters, I finally fell asleep around 2 am. Only a couple hours later did I wake up and notice my phone had been buzzing incessantly since before 11pm. I decided against looking at it for fear that all the buzzes would be from people trying to get me to go out and party or something, but still I checked.
Immediately I regretted not checking it earlier. My phone was blowing up with messages from multiple friends on social media asking if I had heard about the horrific shootings in Las Vegas? Some of them were even crying. That’s when my night went to complete sh*t and it stayed there until the next day.
It’s been over a week since then and while many are still mourning for the victims, I am too; but I’ve also been contemplating what this means for me and my future.
What does the Las Vegas shooting mean to me? Well, in one word: FEAR. It has caused an immense amount of anxiety, fear and worry that I have had to deal with as a result. In addition it has affected how I go about doing things like traveling, visiting concerts or festivals and even just going out at night.
Since the shooting I have felt as though I’ve been in a constant state of heightened awareness, both physically and mentally. My body is always on alert for any sign that something isn’t right. The same goes with my mind, which feels constantly burdened with fearful thoughts like: “What if I am caught in the crossfire of a terrorist attack while driving to work one day?” or “Will this be how it all ends for me? A victim of some psychopath that managed to get his hands on firearms and massacre innocent people while enjoying their lives just like I’ve been able to do for the past 28 years of my life?”
I also fear what will happen if something does occur in my future. What would happen to me or my family? Will we be financially able to take care of ourselves? How could I move on with life and try to resume a normal one after being put through so much pain, anguish and trauma as the result of another person’s reckless actions?
This is where my mind goes. It’s been going there for a while now and I can feel myself slipping into a depressive state if I’m not careful about how I manage it. Whenever this happens, I tend to lose focus at work which affects me both personally and professionally as I have a strong reputation to uphold and the company depends on my ability to do so.
I try my best not to let fear control my life because after all we only have one, but it’s not always easy when you know that something like what occurred in Las Vegas is possible at any time without warning or notice – especially with how easy access seems to be given these days to weapons of warfare.
This shooting has changed me forever and now I can never unsee what I have seen nor undo all those thoughts which haunt my every waking moment from now on.
I feel like an outcast in society, even though no one knows about it because they assume things are back to normal when really – how could they be? It’s hard enough coping with life before such events happened but since then things have gotten so much worse that I don’t know what else can possibly happen next!
What the Las Vegas shooting means for me, and countless others like myself is a constant state of fear. Fear that we could be caught in the crossfire at any given time, even though it hasn’t happened to us yet – or at least not on an individual level where they were targeted specifically due their race/gender etc.. It makes me feel as if I am always under surveillance by terrorists who want nothing more than to take away my life because somehow we offended them by living our lives freely without worrying about being harmed while doing so.
I can’t say how long this will last but until then, I hope you all stay safe and try not to let fear control your life either. It isn’t worth it!
Fear is a powerful thing that can take over our lives if we allow it to do so. In the wake of Las Vegas shootings, people are understandably scared for their safety as they go about their daily activities but this does not mean that you should let your fear control your life! Focus on what’s important instead such as family and friends who will always be there no matter what happens.
When we feel afraid it is easy to forget our priorities which can lead us down dark paths if left unchecked so make sure that no matter where you go or how much fun you have at an event like the Las Vegas Shootings – remember this one thing: Fear won’t kill me before my time comes around, but living in fear could very well do just that!
