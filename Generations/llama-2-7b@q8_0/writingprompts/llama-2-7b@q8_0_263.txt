ould be though.
When I first opened my eyes, it was n't even dark yet. It was still light out when I woke up in a strange bed with no memories of what happened or how I got there. The door creaked open with a hushed breathing that seemed to echo down the corridor. A figure stepped into the room wearing an odd mask over her face and holding a candle lit at both ends. It flickered like it was trying to talk, but what it was saying I could n't decipher. I couldn 't see any more than her eyes though.
She looked me up and down. Her eyes shifted between my neck and the white bandages wrapped around my torso. She seemed unsure if she should go or stay for a while. I did n't understand why, but I was fairly certain it had something to do with the mask.
"What's your name?" She asked me as she sat on the bed next to me and set her candle down in its holder that rested on my night table.
"I don 't know." I replied.
The woman sighed and shook her head, looking away from me for a moment. "Well, what is your name?" She asked again as she turned back around and stared into my eyes once more.
"Hey!" It was the voice of another person behind me. A boy about my age that I had seen before in this place with his brother. He was wearing a red cloak and held his own candle, but he kept it hidden in the folds so only its flame could be seen.
The woman looked back at him and then turned to me again, giving him an exasperated look as she said, "It's okay. It's just that this one seems a little drowsy." The boy nodded. He seemed familiar with her too.
I noticed the bandages on his arms as well, and I knew he had probably been here for at least a little while before me. Maybe more than a little while. "Where am I?"
The woman put down her candle to give both of us a better look at her face. She was pretty, if you could call someone's face that they were only ever seeing in their own eyes pretty. Her cheekbones were high and pointed, and her lips seemed to curl up into a smile whenever she did anything at all. "You are safe here." The woman said in her soft voice.
"Safe? Why?" I asked.
The boy sat down next to me on the other side of the bed with his own candle held between us. He spoke before either one of them could say anything else, "Those peopleâ€¦ They have been coming around and taking people. You must've seen them if you are here." I nodded as he said this because that was exactly what had happened to me when I woke up in the dark.
I looked down at my bandages and then back to him. "Who are these people?"
"We don 't know yet," The woman said, her voice shifting from softness to seriousness. "But you were saved by us, so they will have a hard time getting to you here." I didn't know what she was saying. I felt like I should know something about who these people were and how I was going to escape them but I couldn 't remember anything at all.
"You don 't have to worry," The boy spoke up again, "They can't get in here." He said that last part with more confidence than he had been using when talking so far, but I didn't know why and it made me uncomfortable a little bit. He turned to the woman who was still looking down at my bandages before she looked back up to us both and said, "We have to take care of them though, just in case."
"What do you mean?" I asked her.
She pulled out a small knife from behind her belt that was wrapped around her waist underneath her cloak, but it was the blade she held up for me to see. The boy leaned forward to see as well and whispered, "That's right," to the woman who nodded in response as if they were saying something I just wasn't understanding yet.
I didn 't want her doing anything with that knife though. I was still a little scared of the dark that had only been a few minutes ago so I didn't need to worry about being cut by her either, even though it wasn't as if she could cut me anyways while I was sitting down in bed and under bandages.
She slid her knife back into its place behind her belt where it had come from before, and the boy let out a sigh of relief that I hadn't noticed he had been holding his breath for. The woman gave him a quick smile as if to say 'thank you' or maybe just 'I'm glad too'. Then she turned back around and looked at me again, this time with more concern than before when talking about the knife. "So what is your name?" She asked once again, like it was her first time asking that question instead of something we had already talked about earlier.
"I don't know," I said for the third time. This time though it sounded a bit different than the other two times because this time my voice felt deeper and louder somehow even though nothing changed except how I was feeling inside at that moment in time. Maybe it was n 't so much about me not knowing my name as it was just about what had happened to make everything feel so heavy all of a sudden.
The woman sighed again, this time for something else rather than the boy's fear or her own annoyance with me not being able to tell her who I am. She looked at him and said in an angry tone that was probably supposed to be threatening but came out more like pity instead: "It 's going to take some time until we can trust each other enough for that kind of information."
The boy frowned as he tried to understand what she meant by this. I wasn't sure myself if there was anything at all he needed to know about me before deciding whether or not they could trust me either, but it seemed like his face was already making a decision for him without waiting for my response which made things seem even more confusing than ever before because why would she say something like that in front of me when I did n 't understand what she was talking about anyway?
It was at this point where both of them stood up from their seats on the bed and walked out of the room without saying another word as if they were trying to avoid giving away any more secrets than what they had already shared with each other while we talked earlier. I watched after them until all three of us reached a dark hallway filled with closed doors on either side before turning around back towards my own bedroom doorway again, which was still open as if someone else wanted to come inside but did not want me seeing who it might have been so instead waited patiently for one more moment before walking into view where I could see them both clearly now.
It had n 't seemed like anything important before, but now that they were gone and no one else was there, something about this place felt different than when they first brought me in here after what happened outside. The silence became deafening as if it wanted to tell me something or warn me of some danger lurking around every corner of this room until all I could hear was my own heartbeat pounding against the walls before finally letting go with an audible sigh.
A moment later, two figures appeared in front of me and stared down at me with their eyes narrowed into slits like they were looking right through me to see what secrets were hidden away inside my mind. I had never seen them before but somehow knew who they were the minute I saw how similar their faces looked even though we had been talking for quite some time now without any real explanation as to why or where we were going with this whole conversation about names and trust issues until everything else was taken care of first?
"What do you want?" They both asked in unison, but it did n't seem like they wanted me to answer so much as they just needed some sort of confirmation that I knew who they were. This place had already gotten me confused enough times with people telling me different things all at once, and now here we go again!
I stood up from where I was sitting on my bed while looking them both over carefully before saying out loud "No one's coming in." It was probably more of an accusation than a statement because what if someone else had been watching us this whole time without me knowing it? But then why would they be here asking questions like that right now when everything seemed fine enough to begin with?
The boy's eyes widened slightly as he took another step towards me until we were only inches away from each other while still standing there in silence waiting for some sort of response or reaction from the girl who had been staring at me since we started talking earlier without saying anything else yet. She glanced down at her hands before looking up again, then over to where I was sitting on my bed which seemed much farther away than usual somehow when you really think about it!
"You're not making any sense." He said quietly while staring straight into my eyes like he wanted nothing more than for me to tell him what was wrong and how we were going to fix this problem right now. I couldn 't help but
