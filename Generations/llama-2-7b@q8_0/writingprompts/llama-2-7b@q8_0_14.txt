itting atop my head was a small brass elephant that kept dancing around me like some deranged monkey on an un-hooked wire.
I couldn’t place what I had been doing for the past thirty minutes, but whatever it was had left me feeling completely drained and frustrated with myself. “Well, if you want to feel better then go to a movie,” my brain said with its usual wry sense of humor. I took the advice without hesitation, and walked down the stairs to catch the subway downtown.
The streets were dark as night when I stepped off the train in New York’s Soho district. The sidewalks were filled with people rushing around, heading somewhere, doing something, getting nowhere. I walked into a movie theatre on Thompson Street and sat down to watch some film called “Kill Bill,” which was about some sort of murderous martial arts expert seeking revenge for her husband’s brutal death.
I could barely concentrate because my head felt like it had been pounded by the most powerful sledgehammer ever created. The movie ended and I exited the theatre. It had only been ten minutes since I first sat down, but I was feeling much better already. I decided to go for a walk around town to see if I could clear my head some more, so I walked back over to Fifth Avenue.
The traffic light at 8th Street was green and a black BMW convertible was stopped next to me with its top down. The driver was a middle-aged woman who looked like she’d just had the best day of her life. She smiled at me as I walked by, and then laughed out loud for no apparent reason.
I felt my head clearing up even more, and suddenly realized what had been on my mind back in the office. It was a name; the name of a woman whom I’d known many years ago and had never seen again after she disappeared without a trace. The name I couldn’t remember kept repeating itself inside my head like an endless song played over and over by an out-of-sync record player.
I continued down Fifth Avenue until I reached Washington Square Park, where there were many people milling about doing their own thing while ignoring one another completely. It was the most peaceful place in New York City at that time of night. The lights from the streetlamps and surrounding buildings gave a warm glow to everything they touched.
I looked around me and smiled; it felt like I could finally breathe again after years of suffocation under some heavy weight that I’d never been able to shake off before. Then, all at once, something happened that made me realize how right my brain had been about going out for a walk earlier today: while sitting on a bench and watching people pass by me, a woman came walking up with her small son in hand.
Her name was Mary, and she was smiling just like the driver of the BMW convertible at 8th Street did back when I first saw her. She stopped right next to where I sat on my bench and looked down at me with an expression that said “you don’t know how much it means for someone else that you were here today.”
I smiled back up at her as she stared into my eyes, then suddenly remembered who she was – the woman I had been thinking about all day long before my walk around town. It felt like a light switch had turned on in my head; now everything made sense and I understood why this strange woman was smiling down upon me with such warmth and kindness.
“You were right,” I told her, “this is exactly what I needed to do today.” Her smile grew even larger as she reached out her hand and took mine gently between hers. It felt like we had known each other for years rather than minutes. As if time didn’t matter at all anymore; only being together did.
“How are you feeling?” Mary asked me, “Is everything alright now? I saw you walking around earlier today but you looked so sad and confused before…” She paused for a moment before continuing with her question, “are you sure nothing is wrong?”
I took one last look up at her face before replying, “No, absolutely not – thank God.” Then we both stood up off of the bench and began walking around Washington Square Park together. It was like I had known Mary for my entire life; everything felt right with me now that she was by my side once again after so long an absence from each other’s lives.
It was getting late, but neither one of us wanted to go home yet; instead we decided to take a walk through Central Park where we could see all sorts of beautiful flowers blooming amidst the trees and bushes that lined its paths. It felt like time had stood still as we wandered around hand-in-hand underneath millions of stars above us while talking about our lives from beginning until now with one another’s undivided attention; there was no need for words because both of us understood what each other were trying to say without any verbal communication taking place between either party at all.
Soon enough though, it became clear that we had reached a point where further conversation would only serve as an obstacle towards our goal: rekindling old flames and finding happiness once again together after years apart from one another due mostly out of circumstance rather than any fault on anyone’s part whatsoever.
The next thing I knew was that it was already morning and both Mary and myself were standing outside her building while holding hands tightly without saying anything to each other at all. We just stood there staring into each others eyes before finally pulling away from one another completely only after deciding on where we would meet again once more in order for this beautiful story between us two people who love each other very much not matter what anyone else might say about either of our feelings toward the other party or even whether or not they even existed at all to begin with…
The sun began rising high above us as I walked away from my newfound friend’s building feeling more at peace than ever before in my entire life thanks entirely due solely because we had finally gotten back together again after all these years apart!
I looked up towards the sky one last time and smiled brightly at how lucky I felt right now knowing that things would never be quite so bad again after having lost someone you loved forever…
“Maybe someday soon,” I whispered under my breath before continuing on down into Times Square where millions more people were walking around looking for something better than what they already had but somehow always manage not find it no matter how hard they try or even if they ever decide enough’s finally been said about their current situation!
In conclusion, today has been an eventful day filled with many different emotions ranging from sadness and regret all the way up until pure joy! It feels like my life has changed forever in just one short hour thanks entirely because of this amazing story between me and Mary that we’ve finally been able to tell together once again after so long an absence…I can only hope it never ends here at least not for as long as we both still alive because I don’t think either one us will ever want it too…
The End🙏
