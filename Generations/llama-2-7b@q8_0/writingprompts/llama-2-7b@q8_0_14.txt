ance that has crept into our minds since we first started reading the news online.
We have been conditioned to expect this kind of reporting ever since it was introduced by a certain tabloid in the 90’s, so we are not surprised anymore when a newspaper gives us a ‘big exclusive’ with no solid proof. We are not surprised when the government is found guilty of corruption because the same thing happened last time, and before that too, and it probably will happen again next week. We do not blink when we read that another politician has been caught in an act of deception, or a famous actor in one of his antics on the screen, or even a supermodel in one of her dresses.
And so there is no point asking questions anymore because we already know the answers; and those who are not satisfied by the half-truths they get from mainstream media are left with two options: 1) Get their news from some random blog, or 2) Stop caring altogether about what is going on around them.
I am guilty of both, but more often than not I find myself in the latter category when it comes to politics. That is how we’re taught to think nowadays. We are told that there are two kinds of people: those who care and those who don’t. But the truth is that all of us have the potential to care, whether about what happens in our own country or what happens far away in some other part of the world. And even if we do not care for ourselves, we still have the option of caring about others who need help and support.
And so today I am choosing option number 2: stop caring altogether about what is going on around me… But at least it makes me feel better to know that there are people out there who really do care enough about their fellow human beings, no matter how much time we spend in this world of apathy and indifference.
