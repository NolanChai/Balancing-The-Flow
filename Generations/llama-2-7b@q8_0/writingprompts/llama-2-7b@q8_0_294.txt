' I was awoken by a phone call. My alarm had gone off and I couldn't get back to sleep. It felt like my whole body had been frozen in place, unable to move or even think. Finally I picked up the phone and said, "Hello?" A woman on the other end spoke, "Is this Mr. James Cormier?" 
 I nodded. "This is he." "My name is Mrs. Shelby," she began, "I'm sorry to be calling you so early." I waited for her to continue but she said nothing else and when I asked how I could help her she simply hung up the phone. It wasn't until a few hours later that I realized it had been a wrong number. 
 Some days are just better than others. My boss called in sick today so I got a whole day to play with. 
 Sometimes you can feel like time is running out, but sometimes it's time itself that has come undone. 
 All that time he had wasted when he could have been on the phone calling me or texting me. Why? Was he avoiding her because she wouldn't answer his calls and texts? She said she didn't know who the man with the gun in her house was. He must be an impostor. 
 I couldn't help but to think about it as we drove, that this might be all a lie or a ruse from her part. Why would someone do something like that? To trick me out of my money so easily? If she wanted the money that badly she could have just asked for it instead of putting us through such an elaborate rouse! 
 It was strange how quickly the day had gone by, as if every hour had been compressed down to ten minutes. I had no idea what time it was when my phone rang and when I looked at it I realized that the number belonged to her. 
 He didn't seem like a liar. I believed him. I mean, he had the gun on me so how could he lie? Still though, there were times when I felt like something wasn't right...like he was hiding something from us. Whenever I would ask him about it he would just shrug his shoulders and say that they didn't want their past to get in the way of our future together. 
 "What are we doing here?" I asked as we drove past another house that looked exactly like ours. The man behind the wheel said nothing, instead driving on until finally it was over and he pulled up into a driveway that led up to a large white door. He got out of his car and went around back to open my door before turning to me with a smile on his face as if to say I told you so. 
 "I don't know what you mean," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "The man who came into your house last night was an impostor." "What?" "Yes he was," she replied, sounding more confident now than before. "I found out this morning when I woke up that there had been someone pretending to be you all along and now they are trying to trick me again!" 
 She looked around nervously as if waiting for someone else to come through the door or for a car with a loud exhaust system to drive down the street. Whatever it was she didn't like I could tell because every time we were in public she would cling onto my arm and squeeze it so hard that at times I thought it might break off. 
 The man's face went red as he looked me up and down, his eyes searching mine for some clue about what I was thinking. "We had a deal," he said finally. It wasn't an accusation but more of a statement of fact. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of bills which he began counting slowly in front of me while at the same time looking away from my eyes so that if I was lying or not there would be no way for him to tell. 
 "I can't believe you," she said, her voice trembling with anger as well as sadness. "You took everything from us and now you want more?" 
 He handed me the money and I put it into my pocket without counting any of it first. Then he reached out again to take it back but before he could do so I said something that caught him off guard. "I don't know where else we can go," I told him quietly, trying not to make eye contact with either one of us since doing so would have only made things worse between us. 
 The man's face was pale and his eyes were darting from side to side like a nervous cat waiting for someone else to come along and tell him what had just happened or how it should have been handled differently than the way in which we had done so earlier that day. 
 I knew this would be hard to hear but I needed you to know why I couldn't give your money back. It was because of her, not me. She was the one who didn't want anything to do with it anymore and so she took it from me as if trying to erase every memory associated with us by taking away what had been most important in my life for so long-the money that made up everything else about me at this point. 
 "But how can you just take all the money like this?" I asked, still feeling guilty despite having done nothing wrong myself. "I mean it's not right," she replied defensively. "We agreed to give each other time before either of us tried anything again but instead one or both of us decided that there wasn't enough time left so we went ahead without talking first." 
 I couldn't help but feel bad for the man as he sat across from me, staring at his hands in his lap like they were something he didn't want to see. "You know," he said quietly, looking up at me with eyes that seemed to say more than just words, "I don't care about any of this anymore." 
 It was strange how quickly the day had gone by, as if every hour had been compressed down to ten minutes. I had no idea what time it was when my phone rang and when I looked at it I realized that the number belonged to her. 
 I knew he wasn't lying because his hands shook so badly that he couldn't even hold onto the gun properly. And then there were those eyes, they didn't look like someone who had just committed a crime. They seemed almost sad, as if he felt bad about what happened but had no choice in the matter. 
 She was right, I should have told her sooner instead of waiting until it was too late for any other reason than my own selfishness because now she would never forgive me and it would always be like this between us even though we both wanted something different than what we were currently living with each other so far away from one another where all we could do was talk about things on the phone or text back and forth while waiting for a response that might never come if you didn't send enough emojis along with your words (ðŸ’”). 
 I thought he would be happy to see me but when he opened the door instead of smiling as usual, there was only fear in his eyes. He stood still and watched me carefully before saying anything at all which made me feel even more nervous about what might happen next because then we would have nothing left between us except our memories which were already fading away like sandcastles on a beach during high tide when no one is around to stop it from happening again. 
 "I'm sorry," she said, her voice shaking as if she was afraid that something else might go wrong now that I had come home with all my money in hand ready for whatever plan we had made earlier this morning before leaving each other alone with no idea of what would happen next or when either one of us would see each other again (if ever). 
 The man looked at me for a long time, as if trying to decide whether he could trust me. "What do you want?" I asked finally after staring back into his eyes for so long that it felt like my own pupils had been shrunk down to nothingness by their intensity alone (a side effect of too much coffee?). 
 The money was a small price to pay if it meant saving her life. He didn't seem to care though because when we went back inside he took off his jacket and threw it on the ground before sitting down in front of me with one hand held out while watching me closely as if waiting for an answer from me that would tell him whether or not I had come here just so he could steal everything away like he always does whenever there's a chance (even when we were dating). 
 The next day, after she left my house in tears and with the promise of never seeing her again unless she wanted to get back together with me (which was highly unlikely), I called him up on his cell phone. "I need your help," he said without asking what kind or why but instead just stating it like something that had already been decided between us which made me wonder if this whole thing might have actually started months ago when we first met each other while waiting at an airport somewhere along the way before finding out about all those things I told you earlier today. 
 She was right, I should have told her sooner instead of waiting until it was too late for any other reason than my own selfishness because now she would never forgive me and it would always be like this between us even though we both
