uthanasia, how would you pay for everything? If everyone can live forever, why would anyone have to work? How could you even fund war if it meant so much to so many people?
As our bodies began to fail us in their last years on Earth, we became desperate. We wanted more time, more life. That’s when we discovered the first immortals; or rather they came to us. Their cells were dying, like everyone else, but they wouldn’t die.
They had been dead already for 150 years by the time we found them, and yet their bodies did not show it. They could no longer reproduce, as no-one was alive long enough to help, and they could do little beyond eating, sleeping and waiting – but wait they did. Every day, every month, every year of their lives was an eternity for us.
Our scientists worked tirelessly with these first immortals in the hopes that they could live on forever with us, but they never were able to figure out what was making them stay alive; not even close. We found more people who had lived past 150 years and we learned more about them, but still nothing changed. It took decades of trial and error before we discovered the secret:
Their cells did not die because they did not have enough nutrients to make them live forever; our bodies were simply devoid of nutrition. They lived on and so could we if only we would feed them properly. But it was too late for us, and after a century of living with these immortals, we had become dependent on them and now we wanted more than just to live – we wanted eternal life.
We began using the first immortals’ cells in order to clone themselves, using their genes as an instruction manual so that each new immortal would be exactly like its predecessor. We created the Immortals from those who could not die and now we could all live on forever.
The first immortals were called ‘gifts’ for 400 years after they came to us, but as more immortals were made, people became less grateful and more demanding. The original idea behind the Immortal was that each immortal would be a gift to society – an infinite resource we could use to help others in need and save lives where we couldn’t otherwise afford them. But when there is no-one who can die, what is so special about that? We are not made of gold or silver; our lives cannot be taken from us without someone else dying too.
In the 23rd century, as immortality became more widespread and accepted, the name ‘Immortals’ came to describe anyone who had been cloned with the use of genetic material from an immortal being – regardless whether they were actually still alive or not. Today people have come to accept that they are just another human being like any other: no different in anyway besides their age and their ability to die.
As a result, many people began questioning what was so special about the original gift-giving; why do immortals get all the attention? So we took things a step further by making more than one clone out of each donor cell if needed; after all it’s not like they’re going anywhere. And with the help of a few genetic modifications here and there, we now have thousands upon millions of people who look just like us – except they keep on living forever.
The first clones were called ‘Immortals’ but eventually this name became more associated with immortality rather than immorality so it was dropped completely in favour of a new word: ‘Omnipotent’ – as these cloned people did not die like the originals had and could therefore do anything they wanted.
In 2079, Omnipotents were officially classified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be their own species; separate from humans but still human enough for us to breed with them – if you’re lucky enough to find one who wants sex that is!
Omnipotent clones are not just immortal, they have a much higher level of intelligence than the average person and an infinite capacity for knowledge. They also possess telepathic abilities which allow them to communicate with other Omnipotents as well as humans (providing we don’t mind talking in our heads).
It is said that their only real limitation is their limited physical form – though this may soon be changed if scientists can find a way around the problem of cloning physical traits too.
Omnipotent clones are now used by many organisations to help them solve complex problems as well as fight crime and even war; however, despite being seen as valuable assets in society they remain largely unrecognized due to their unusual appearance.
Their unique qualities have led some people (usually those who don’t know any better) to believe that all Omnipotents must be evil because it is easier for them not to understand something than it is to try and figure out what makes them different from other humans – even though we know better.
In the 30th century, scientists finally figured out how to clone cells without using genetic material from an immortal being but this new method only produces clones that live for 150 years (and can be killed easily by anything from a virus to bad luck). This discovery led to many people looking back at those original clones with disdain as they now realised how little those gift-givers actually gave away – they died too.
But despite this setback, humanity still looked towards immortality as its ultimate goal; and so began another 100 years of research into prolonging life through different methods (including genetic engineering). And it was during that time that something amazing happened: people started living for longer than they ever had before!
For the first time in history, humanity was able to break down the barriers between death and immortality. This newfound freedom led many people (especially those who didn’t want or couldn’t afford Omnipotents) towards self-preservation techniques that would allow them to live as long as they wanted; with no-one dying anymore – not even if someone tried!
In the 40th century, scientists discovered how to increase lifespans by using nanotechnology which allowed people’s cells (and therefore their bodies) to stay healthier for longer periods of time. This new form of immortality has been called ‘Eternal Life’ because it allows everyone who uses it – whether they are an Omnipotent or not – to live indefinitely without dying.
This discovery was met with great enthusiasm by many people who had previously wanted nothing more than just one day longer; now that dream became a reality! Unfortunately however, Eternal Life also came at quite a price: those who use it tend not only look much older but also experience serious health problems along the way.
Despite this drawback (which has led many people away from using it), Eternal Life is still widely used throughout most of Earth’s population today and continues to be one of humanity’s greatest achievements!
