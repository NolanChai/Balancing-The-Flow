 situation that made the hero feel like he'd been beaten by a common criminal before being tossed into prison with criminals, instead of facing down a foe worthy of his abilities in combat and taking him on as an equal.
“ Yes, I do have some last words for you ” he stated calmly, glaring at the two men holding him.  “ But if those words are to be heard, you'll need to let go of me immediately ” he warned with a hint of concern in his voice. 
 One of the thugs responded to this by tightening the shackles around Iron Fist's wrists, causing him to yelp out in pain.  “ Ouch! You are going too far...” 
 “Too fucking bad ” the other one said with a smirk on his face as he walked towards Iron Fist with an expression that didn't make it clear if he was happy or sad about what would be done to him. 
 This was the part of the plan they had not foreseen, but were ready to deal with.  “This is my fault ” said one of them, stepping forward and gently removing a bag from Iron Fist's right hand.  The other man grabbed this bag as well, which caused the hero to scowl at him and say with some venom in his voice: 
 “Let me go! Now!” 
 The two thugs looked at each other before the one who had just removed the bag spoke up.  “I'm sorry, but it's too late for that. We have your bags.” 
 This caused Iron Fist to glare angrily at them both.  “You can't do this! I haven't done anything wrong!” he exclaimed with a frown on his face as tears began to form in his eyes. 
 The one who had removed the bag looked back at him sympathetically before turning away and saying: 
 “We're sorry about that, but we have no choice.” 
 Iron Fist was furious as he continued to struggle against his restraints while screaming out loudly.  But it didn't do any good because they would not listen or release him from those chains that kept them together like brothers in arms fighting for their freedom from bondage and oppression by evil men who wished only harm upon innocent people!
The two thugs finally released the hero and walked away, leaving Iron Fist to his fate.  He was now alone with no hope left but death; an execution which he knew was coming soon enough due to this situation that had been thrust upon him without any warning whatsoever...
<b>“If you want my bags, then I'm not going to be able to stop you from getting them,” the Iron Fist said, his voice calm and steady. “You can take whatever is in there, but if it's money or jewels that were stolen during the robbery of an airplane that crashed into Lake Erie last year, then I don't care what happens next.”</b>
<b>“I know exactly who you are,” the man said with a cold smile as he pointed his gun at Iron Fist. “And we have no intention of letting go of these bags until we get our cut from them.”</b>
<b>The other thug stepped forward, his own weapon raised to fire on Iron Fist if necessary.</b>
<b>“I'm not afraid of death,” the hero said as he held up both hands without fear. “But I don't want anyone else to die because we couldn't come to an agreement about how much money is in these bags.”</b>
<b>The man with the gun laughed and lowered it slightly so that Iron Fist could see him better.</b>  <b><i>“You think your threats will work? We are not afraid of you,” he said, his tone turning serious again. “And we know what happens if you don't hand over these bags.”</i></b>
<b>The other thug nodded in agreement and aimed his gun at Iron Fist once more.</b>  <b><i>“We have no choice but to kill you, because you've already stolen from us.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist remained calm and unmoving as the two men exchanged words with one another.</b>
<b>The thug who had spoken first stepped forward again, this time raising his gun even higher so that it pointed directly at Iron Fist's head.</b>  <b><i>“We are not afraid of you,” he said once more before lowering the weapon slightly. “But we will take what is rightfully ours.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist stared back at them without saying anything as they continued to speak among themselves.</b>  <b><i>“We know how much money is in these bags,” said the other thug, his tone now becoming more serious than before. “And we will not hesitate to use it against you.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist remained silent and still as they continued their conversation.</b>  <b><i>“We will make an example of you,” said the man with the gun. “You will be remembered forever in our minds, and anyone who tries to steal from us again after this incident will suffer your fate.”</i></b>
<b>The thug lowered his weapon slightly as he finished speaking.</b>  <b><i>“But until then...” he said before turning back toward Iron Fist. “You are going to die.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist remained silent and motionless as the two men spoke among themselves again.</b>  <b><i>“We have no choice but to kill you,” said the other thug, his tone becoming even more serious. “Because you've already stolen from us.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist remained silent and still as they continued their conversation.</b>  <b><i>“We will make an example of you,” said the man with the gun once again, his tone becoming more serious than ever before. “You will be remembered forever in our minds.”</i></b>
<b>Iron Fist remained silent and still as they continued their conversation.</b>  <b><i>“But until then...” said one of them, turning toward Iron Fist once more with a gun raised at his head. “You are going to die.”</i></b>
