ila near the sea. The population numbered just over two hundred residents. Many of these people worked in the mines or at the docks. They were simple hard working men and women who had learned to live by their own standards. They lived together harmoniously, each one to his or her own.
There were a few shops that catered to local needs and some homes where the well off dwelled. There was even a church which stood in the centre of town and was made from stone. It had been built many years ago when this area had first been settled, but now it looked old and worn down. The stained glass windows were cracked and the doors hung slightly askew on their hinges.
The people here knew each other by sight at least if not by name. They said hello to one another or nodded in recognition. They knew what time of day it was, which fisherman was out on a boat and where they were returning with their catches. The women gathered on the porches of the homes chatting about this and that. Mostly about who had gotten married, who had been widowed, or who had given birth to another child.
Theo Cullins, twenty-eight years old was a handsome man. He stood over six feet tall with light brown hair cut short and deep brown eyes. His skin was dark from working in the mines underground for so many years. Theo had a rugged look about him that most of the women found appealing. He wore an old tattered shirt and trousers which were dirty with dried sweat on his brow, face and neck. A frown always seemed to be etched onto his features no matter what he was doing.
As Theo walked through town he passed by one of the houses. As he walked closer he could smell a faint hint of something cooking in the kitchen. He also knew that there was a girl working in the kitchen who had been there for a few days now. Her name was Anna and she had come to live with her aunt and uncle here in Valia. Theo wondered if it would be okay to go inside, but he decided against it since he had not seen or spoken to anyone of them yet.
As the day progressed, people began coming home from work or school. Many were happy and tired after an honest days labor, while some others were angry that they had been fired for trying to speak up about a problem at their place of employment.
Theo made his way over towards the church where he sat down on one of the steps outside its doors. He took out a pack of cigarettes and lit one, watching as the people passed him by. The old priest walked by him and smiled. They both knew each other well enough to wave in greeting to one another.
It was at this moment that Anna stepped into sight from behind some trees. She had been on her way home from work, but stopped when she saw Theo sitting there smoking his cigarette. He turned around to face her and smiled as he stood up. They both walked towards each other, not knowing what the other would do next.
Theo looked at her with awe in his eyes, while Anna's eyes widened slightly when she saw him standing so close to her. She had never been this close to anyone before. Theo took another drag from his cigarette as he stared down on her with intensity. Anna smiled nervously back up into those deep dark brown eyes of his and then turned away towards the church's doorway, which was slightly ajar due to the warm weather outside.
Anna looked around one last time before closing the door behind herself. She knew that Theo would be watching her through the glass as she stepped inside. As Anna walked into the dimly lit room, she could hear him following after her with his heavy footsteps on the wooden floorboards. She turned around and saw him standing just inside the doorway looking at her with those deep dark brown eyes of his that seemed to have captured every fiber within her being.
Anna stood there for a moment not sure what to do next, but then she walked over towards him with a nervous smile on her lips. Theo came closer and put one hand up against the glass door as he leaned in close towards Anna. She was about to tell him that it was okay to come inside when suddenly they were face to face. He reached out and took hold of her hand, which she quickly pulled back from his grasp.
Anna stepped away from Theo's touch as he stood there with a look of confusion on his face. Anna knew this expression all too well because it was the same one that her uncle had been giving her for years. It meant that she should have listened to him instead of doing whatever it was that she did.
As she began walking away from Theo, he looked at her with those deep dark brown eyes and then reached out his hand towards her again as if asking for forgiveness. But Anna knew better than this man what was good for him in the long run. She turned around again, ready to tell him off once more when suddenly she found herself being pulled into an embrace.
Anna closed her eyes tightly and held on for dear life as Theo lifted her up into his arms. He then placed a kiss upon her cheek before setting her back down onto the floor with both hands on either side of hers. She looked up at him with those wide green eyes, which were filled with tears. They began walking over towards one of the pews in the center of the church's nave while Anna held tightly to his hand.
Anna had always been a very quiet and shy girl who kept mostly to herself when she was younger. She used to watch people from afar as they went about their business with little regard for how much her gaze might have affected them. It was like watching ants in the grass, but there was something different about these particular creatures that made Anna want more out of life than just sitting back and observing it all go by without saying anything or doing anything to change things for anyone else.
As they sat down on one of the pews next to each other, Anna began crying again as she looked up at him with those big green eyes full of tears. Theo put his arm around her shoulders and held her close while trying not to let out a loud sigh or make any sudden movements which might startle her even more than he already had done so far during their short encounter in this church's nave.
Anna was still crying as they sat there together, but she looked up at him with those big green eyes full of tears and said, "I don't know what I was thinking when I came here."
Theo smiled down at her while gently wiping away some of the tears from her cheeks. He then kissed her forehead before looking into those wide green eyes again as if to tell her that he understood how she felt, but that it didn't matter what he had done because nothing would change anything between them now no matter where they were or when they spoke next time around.
Theo leaned forward towards Anna with those deep dark brown eyes staring into hers while holding onto one of her hands tightly in his own hand which was resting gently against the back of her head. As he moved closer to kiss her, she pulled away from him quickly and began crying again as if something bad had happened between them instead of good things happening all around them now that they were finally together at last after years upon years apart due mainly because one person was always scared or too afraid to take a chance on what could have been an amazing love affair full of happiness for both parties involved!
As she wiped away her tears again with those soft hands which had been resting gently upon his own chest, Anna looked up at him once more before asking in a broken voice, "How long do you think this will last?"
