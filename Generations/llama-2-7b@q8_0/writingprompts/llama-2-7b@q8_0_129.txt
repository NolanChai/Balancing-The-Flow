30 yards away and decided to investigate.
John found a huge pile of bear scat, about five feet tall, but it didn’t smell like a bear, too foul and musty for a bear. It also had small pieces of bark with what looked like hair tangled in the debris. He figured it was from a squirrel or chipmunk that got into something.
As he approached, he could see the top of a very large snake. The size of his head was at least 30 inches around and probably close to four feet long, he couldn’t believe what he saw but he was too interested in checking it out to leave just yet. He took off his glove and picked up some debris with the snake on it, and as he did so it lunged at him and coiled around his arm.
It had a very rough coat and large fangs that were dripping venom, John was in a panic. He dropped the piece of bark and scrambled backward away from the snake and fell backwards into the pile of scat as the snake slithered up to where he was standing. He got up and ran downhill towards the trail for his life with the snake coiled on his arm.
It felt like a burning pain all the way down his arm, so bad it felt like he had broken bones in his hand but as he looked at them there wasn’t any damage. When he reached the trail and started running, the snake uncoiled and dropped onto the ground behind him and struck again with its venom dripping fangs. John fell to the ground screaming for help and rolled onto his back. He felt more pain in his shoulder than his hand, but when he looked at it there were no punctures or gashes that should be there.
He was yelling now and realized how loud he was. People must hear him from down below because he thought someone would come to help him. A man came running up the trail towards him with a shotgun in his hand, “What the hell is wrong with you?” he asked John. “There’s a rattlesnake on your back!”
He jumped off of John and fired the gun at the snake as it coiled around its body ready to strike again. He got up from the ground and looked down at his hand where the wounds were, but there was no blood and felt nothing other than what he thought might be broken bones.
The man shook his head in disbelief and said “I’ve never heard of anyone surviving a rattlesnake strike like you did!” He helped John to his feet and told him to put his hand on the back of his head so they could get down off the mountain as fast as possible.
