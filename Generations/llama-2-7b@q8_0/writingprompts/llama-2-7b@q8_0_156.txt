 screams were all that could be heard for miles around. I heard them every night as they fell on deaf ears, and with each passing day I felt myself slip into a black pit of despair that seemed to grow deeper and more suffocating than any grave. It was this sense of hopelessness and emptiness that eventually led me down the path to the edge.

 I sat alone in my cell, rocking back and forth with an empty stomach and bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep as well as a constant headache from what I assume must have been a mixture of starvation, dehydration, and exhaustion. All that had been keeping me alive at the time was the hope that one day, after this never-ending nightmare was finally over, there would be something for me to return to. A memory of a better time, maybe even a person I knew well enough to care about them and share my experiences with as they shared theirs. But then I realized that I didn't even remember my own name anymore.

 I had been in this place for so long, I could no longer recall how it happened or what it was called. There were no clocks, no windows, no doors. No sound but the screaming of those around me. The only thing that seemed to remain constant about everything else was the fact that I wasn't allowed to eat and the only thing they wanted from me was for my head.

 That was when it all happened.
