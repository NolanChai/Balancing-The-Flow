rup on your waffles? ”
 
” Hey, buddy! How did you sleep?” 
 
“I slept like a log!” I reply as I throw my arms around him and kiss his cheek. My dad hands me the syrupy waffle, and I put it on my plate along with the bacon and eggs.

” So how was your first day? Did you have any fun?” 
 
“It was really good!” 
 
 ” It’s nice to meet you! I heard that you have been looking for a new friend.” My mom is standing in the doorway, and she greets my dad.
 
” Yes, but where are your manners?” She continues with her eyes glued to me as she asks what kind of syrup I want on my waffles. I shake my head no and quickly grab the maple syrup.
 ” So, what’s your name again? I can’t seem to remember it.” 
 
“Oh, I am sorry!” I reply as I look into my mom's eyes. “My name is Dylan.” 
 
”That’s a really good name! You know, you remind me of the movie “Dumb and Dumber,” where they were in love with each other but didn’t want to admit it.” She continues. “But I can tell that you two are going to be best friends!” 
 
 ” Yeah, I agree with that last part!” My dad replies as he turns away from us to check on breakfast. As my mom begins to walk out of the kitchen, she looks back at me and says, "I like your shorts too! They look really nice on you."
 
” Thanks.” I reply with a smile. 
 
 ” What about that girl from last night? How was it?” My dad asks as he brings our plates to the table. 
 
 “Oh, she is fine. We just talked for an hour in front of her house. She likes to stay late at school sometimes.” 
 
” You should call her tonight! I am sure she would want you to come over and hang out!” My mom says with a smile. 
 
 “Oh, I will talk to her later,” I say as I eat my breakfast. 
 
 ” Well, I hope that you both have a great day!" And then he walks upstairs to shower before work.
 
 ” Bye!” My mom replies with a smile as she watches him walk away from us and up the staircase to his bedroom. Once he is out of sight, my mom turns back to me with a concerned look in her eyes. She takes her time walking over to where I am sitting at the table. When she reaches our breakfast nook, she pulls the chair out for me and sits across from me with a smile. 
 
 ” What was so nice about that girl? She seems like an okay person.” She asks me as she looks up from her plate to my face. I smile back at her while looking down at my empty plate. The last piece of bacon is sitting next to the plate, and I pick it up with a fork before putting it in my mouth.
 
 ” She’s just nice.” I say with a smile as I chew on the small piece of meat in my mouth. 
 
”That’s not what I am talking about!” My mom says in a stern voice, and she begins to laugh at herself after hearing the way that she sounded when she said it. As soon as she finishes laughing, her voice turns into a serious tone, and she looks directly into my eyes. 
 
 ”I mean why don’t you like her? Is there something wrong with her?” My mom asks me in a serious tone, looking down at the tabletop to hide any signs of emotion that may come up on her face. As I look back at her, I can tell that she is truly worried about what could happen if I do not go out with this girl soon and begin talking more openly with her than just having conversations outside after school ends for the day. 
 
 ”No, there isn’t anything wrong with her!” My mom says as she stands up from her chair before heading over to grab her plate. “You should give her a call and see if you two can hang out tonight! I am sure that it will be nice!” And then she walks away from me quickly without looking back at me once as she disappears behind the corner into their bedroom, leaving me alone again with my thoughts of what might happen if things do not work out between us.
 
 ” Hey, Mom! I need to call her but don’t have any money.” I say aloud while sitting in front of our kitchen sink. The water is running over the faucet as it sprays onto my hand and into the sink with a loud rush. 
 
 ” Oh, that's okay!” My mom replies from behind me before walking back into their bedroom again. “You know you can always just use your phone to call her!" And then she walks away once more as she disappears around another corner in our home and out of sight. 
 
 ”Okay, then I will give it a try!” I say aloud while sitting down on my seat again with my feet crossed under me and the phone in front of me. After getting through security questions about my birthday and my name, I hear the sound of the dial tone ringing out from our landline phone that was sitting next to the table in front of me as soon as it finished connecting me over to my girlfriend's number on her cellphone. 
 
 ”Hi! It’s me!” My voice says with a smile before she begins talking again and asking how I have been feeling since our first date last night at The Waffle House.
