'nin the name of my maker and leader I end this pathetic life of a human, as a gift to all those who serve the empire.
 
This will be the first death of many...


# The Empire

The Empire is a massive, environmentally diverse planet. It consists of hundreds of colonies and outposts in which the Empire can live and prosper. These are spread out over an area roughly twice as wide as Earth's equator to equator distance. A small group of elite explorers and diplomats maintain contact with these colonists, and travel back and forth between them in a slow and methodical fashion.

The Empire is home to many species; but the main three are the humans, the elves, and the orcs. The orcs are not native to this world (though there have been speculations they were originally from Earth) but they did arrive first and have been fighting with the Empire for as long as it has existed. The elves are natives of this planet and arrived after humans, making them the second race of people. Both races can be found on all inhabited planets within the Empire.

The Empire is lead by a council consisting of five individuals who have been elected to rule over their people. These councils meet once every week in an attempt to solve some of the more pressing issues at hand, but they rarely get anything accomplished due to their differences and infighting.

Each colony within the empire has its own local government, though not all of them are democracies (as is the case for the Empire's capitol). These governments vary in size and complexity, but most of them are ruled by one person who answers directly to either the Council or a planetary governor.

The Empire is at war with its neighboring nations; but as they are all human led, it has been very difficult for their armies to make significant progress towards taking land from these enemies (which have made this a stalemate). However there have been rumors of the elven and orcish governments having sent weapons and supplies to some of the Empire's colonies in secret.


## Humanity

Humanity is the most populous race within the empire, but has been on the decline for a few centuries. There are still hundreds of millions of humans scattered throughout their cities and outposts; however they can rarely be found outside of these areas due to the many threats that surround them (such as the elves and orcs).

The human empire was created by an ancient alliance of five different nations (though most have been reduced to a single nation since then), who together ruled over all of their land for several centuries until they were eventually conquered by another race: the Elves. After this conquest many humans migrated west into lands owned by other races, and there they built up their own societies alongside them instead of fighting back against those who conquered them.

### Humans in Game


Humans are a common sight among the playerbase, both on land or at sea. They can be found in many different classes ranging from mages to warriors and even druids!


  - A simple class with very little restrictions on what type of abilities it can use (as long as they don't violate its core ability list)
    
- A versatile class that specializes in using both melee weapons and magic in combat
    - A strong class that uses the power of nature to fight off their enemies, or defend themselves if need be

  - An agile and evasive fighter who relies on his speed to avoid attacks from enemies instead of dodging them himself (though he does have some dodge moves built into his abilities)
    - A mage with a very powerful range that can attack from far away without fear of retribution; however this comes at the cost of low maneuverability due to how slow spells are compared against melee weapons
    
- A master of all things martial arts and close quarters combat; these fighters rely on their speed instead of strength in order to win battles quickly without taking much damage themselves (though they do have some powerful strikes built into their abilities as well)
    - A very fast paced class that relies heavily on evasion instead of defense, but does not sacrifice too much power like other classes might when fighting against tough enemies; however these fighters tend to take more damage than most due to how agile they are in combat which leads them into dangerous situations where death could occur if not handled correctly
    
  - An archer who prefers ranged weapons over melee ones due mainly because their arrows can pierce through multiple targets at once before hitting the ground or wall (if there is one) and killing anyone who's standing in front of them with one shot; but also because these fighters have a very fast attack rate which makes it easier to land more shots on enemies than normal archers might if they were using only one arrow at any given time
    - A powerful warrior who wields both melee weapons and magic abilities at once without sacrificing either type of combat; though these fighters tend to take more damage than other classes when fighting against tough foes but this trade off is well worth it because they can fight for longer periods of time before needing to rest due mainly from their fast attack rate which makes it easy for them not only kill multiple enemies at once with one shot but also get away before being hit themselves (this works great if there are lots of enemies around)
    
- A fighter who specializes in close range combat; these warriors rely heavily on their speed instead of strength and power like other classes might when fighting against tough foes which makes them very fast paced but also leaves them vulnerable at times because they don't have much defense against incoming attacks (though this isn't always true).
    - An elf who prefers melee weapons over ranged ones due mainly to their high damage output from these types of attacks; but also because these fighters tend not only kill multiple enemies at once with one shot but can fight longer periods before needing rest due mainly from their fast attack rate which makes it easy for them get away before being hit themselves (this works great if there are lots around).
    
  - A druid who relies on magic instead of weapons when fighting against tough foes; these fighters tend not only kill multiple enemies at once with one shot but can fight longer periods before needing rest due mainly from their fast attack rate which makes it easy for them get away before being hit themselves (this works great if there are lots around).
