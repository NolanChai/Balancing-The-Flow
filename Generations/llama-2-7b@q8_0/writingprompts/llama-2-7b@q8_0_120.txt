quid nitrogen could turn even an ox into a meal, let alone something halfway human like him.
He put down the hammer and took another look at the wall. The sprayer had already filled in all the gaps between bricks and mortar but Coruscan knew the job was not complete. Some of those holes still needed to be plugged up with fresh concrete and it was his job to do that, hammering away with the jackhammer while a man with a sprayer worked on filling in the larger cracks between bricks and mortar.
Coruscan took another look around him. It seemed like they had been at it for hours already and it still looked like they had days worth of work ahead of them before the job would be done. He knew why though, and that was because it was a big house with lots of brick walls. Even when he got through plugging up all those holes in this part there were always more to go on somewhere else in the mansion.
The reason Coruscan did not mind working so hard was simple: he hated his boss. Not the one who had brought them here, but rather the one who had sent him and two other men out here. That boss had been a short man with dark eyes that were always moving around like he was looking for something to jump out of. He would come over when they started their shift or whenever it came up in conversation, and say things like "Well, well, well..." and "Looks like you are making some headway" as if that meant anything.
Coruscan did n't think much of him except for his stupid little dog which was always with the man no matter where he went. The boss would bring it along on jobs sometimes too. It had an ugly face and seemed to hate Coruscan even more than its owner did, though that might just have been because it was so hard to understand what it wanted at any given time due to all those teeth of his.
He shook his head again as if trying clear out the thoughts from before while he got ready for another swing with the jackhammer. It was going to be a long day and he had other things on his mind besides brickwork.
The first thing Coruscan thought of when he woke up in the morning was how much he wanted breakfast, but there were so many different ways this could go wrong that it was easier just to give up and start thinking about something else instead. There would be time later for food as long as nothing too bad happened before then.
As far back as Coruscan could remember life had always been a struggle, even when he was young and living on his own with no other responsibilities besides working odd jobs here or there just to keep himself fed and housed. It seemed like everything was against him from day one: his parents did n't want anything more than for their children not grow up like them so they treated each new baby as an inconvenience until finally having one too many made it hard even then.
But despite all this Coruscan never lost hope that things would turn around someday and life would be good once again, if only he could find a way out of the hole that he had dug for himself over time. That was why when his boss came to see him about a job yesterday afternoon he immediately said yes without thinking too much about what it meant because this might just be his chance at getting away from everything and starting fresh somewhere else with no more worries in the world.
The first thing that went wrong was when they got there and discovered that their boss had hired someone else to do the work, so now instead of being paid for it they would have to pay someone else for doing what should have been their job. Coruscan did not mind too much about this part since he always expected things like this would happen with any other employer he worked for.
But then came another problem: there was more than one person on this job, so instead of being able to work together like before they now had to compete against each other to finish the task before them. That meant working harder and longer hours just because their boss thought it would be funny watching them all try to get through their shifts at once without anyone else knowing what was going on around them or how close they were getting towards completing whatever project had been assigned in front of them, let alone whether or not any of these men would even make it back home after being out here all day long doing nothing but trying hard enough so someone could tell where each brick had been placed beforehand.
The second thing that went wrong was when they arrived at the site and found that their boss had hired a man named Coruscan to do this job instead of them, which meant he would be paid for it even though none of them knew what he did or why anyone should pay him anything in return other than maybe some food and water once he finished whatever it was they were supposed to finish today.
Coruscan hated his boss because every time he came around all he said was "Well, well, well..." and "Looks like you are making some headway" as if that meant something. Coruscan did n't think much of him except for his ugly little dog which always seemed to hate him more than any other person on earth even though it had never met him before today because apparently everyone else thought he was too scary looking or whatever else they were thinking about when they saw him standing there with a jackhammer in hand.
But then something happened that made everything worse: their boss brought his ugly little dog over and started talking to Coruscan, even though no one had said anything about this being okay before now! It was like he was trying to get Coruscan to do something for him, but what? Coruscan did not know because all he wanted was breakfast so he could get back home where things would be better than they were right now.
Coruscan did n't have time to think about any of this though since there was work to be done and by the end of the day it was clear that everything had gone wrong from start to finish. The only good thing Coruscan could say about what happened today was that he had met someone new who knew how hard life really is sometimes, even when you're trying your best to make things better.
The last thing Coruscan thought of before he went home for the night was how much he wanted breakfast in case something bad happened while they slept and he did n't wake up until morning once again. This time though maybe everything would go right without any problems at all, because this could be his chance to start over somewhere new where life would finally turn around instead of getting worse every day like it had been before today...
