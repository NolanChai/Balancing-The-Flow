 to the palace, after he had promised them that he will be bringing back something for them. 

 He took it with both hands, then he made sure to inspect its length and quality. It was really a beautiful item: It was shining metallic grey in color, its surface were polished very nicely, as if they have been sanded many times. Aside from that, the metal also felt smooth on his fingers, indicating that it is well-oiled.
 
 ``Now I just need to find out who will be using this rod.'' 
 
 He sat back down and closed his eyes, then he began to concentrate in his projection's form. With his eyes closed he felt like he was slowly rising into the air. Then, once again he opened his eyes, but instead of seeing the walls around him, he saw only darkness everywhere. Aside from that, he also sensed something different, almost as if his vision has changed drastically and now he can see with a completely new sense.
 
 ``I am beginning to think that I might have to create my own projection form.'' He thought to himself. ``But for now, I'll stick to this one. Besides, it is pretty damn useful.'' 
 
 A sudden glow of light was seen as he began his meditation in his room. The room itself was filled with a pearly white light which made the entire space seem like they are underwater. He found that peculiar, but he did not mind it for now and instead looked around him. 
 
 There were no signs of anything familiar in this world. There wasn't even a single piece of furniture or object present here. All of them seemed to have vanished. It was as if the entire room itself has been enchanted. He stood still for a moment and examined his surroundings, only then did he realize that there is no such thing as time in this world, not even an indication of it.
 
 ``Strange...'' He thought to himself as he walked around the area. ``The world seems to be very much different from my home. And yet, I do feel a sense of familiarity with it. As if there was once something about this place that I already knew before.'' 
 
 It didn't take long for him to discover what the connection might be: This world was eerily similar to his dreams. The only difference between both realms is that everything here was in perfect condition, without any flaws or damage at all. He decided to sit down and examine this place further.
 
 ``The most peculiar thing about this dreamland of mine...'' he began to think to himself. ``Is the fact that I do not remember my name nor where I came from. As if this was a world entirely created by me, for me. And yet, when I close my eyes I can still see what happened in those visions. Like they were just memories of mine...''
 
 ``Maybe that is the way it should be. It seems to be working out pretty well so far.'' He then opened his eyes as he stood up and stretched his arms. ``It does not matter who I am, as long as I know what I want from here onwards. And for now... I need a name. But first of all, I must find the owner of this metal rod I have found.''
 
 He then opened his eyes and stood there for a moment. ``It has to be nearby somewhere.'' Then he walked around once again looking for something that might stand out in this place. This time however, it didn't take long before he spotted some sort of an object glowing with the light on the wall behind him. 
 
 He then turned and approached the object which happened to be a huge mirror, located against one of the walls there. ``Hmm... Interesting.'' He said as he stood in front of the mirror, inspecting it from head to toe. The reflection that was shown on it however seemed to have vanished, instead he found himself looking at another world through this mysterious object. 
 
 Aside from the light which illuminated the area and made the entire scene appear to be glowing, he could also see a huge stone pillar in the middle of the room where it was situated. It looked like a throne but one that is different from his own in the dream world: Instead of being placed on an elevated platform, this one was simply located somewhere on the ground with no signs of support whatsoever. 
 
 The stone pillar itself was quite tall and wide, and it seemed to be made up of a lot of smaller stones which were all neatly arranged together. On its surface there were also many inscriptions written in what appeared to him as a strange language that he had never seen before. He examined each one closely as if they might reveal something, but unfortunately there was nothing special about it aside from the words themselves being quite simple and ordinary-looking. 
 
 ``There must be some way of understanding them...'' He then muttered to himself. ``Perhaps I need another tool that will help me with this. Hmm...'' He continued walking around, looking for something useful that might aid him in his search. ``I'll just ask my projection if there are any other things available here that would help me with these inscriptions or even with anything else for that matter.''
 
 So he decided to do exactly as he has said and sent out a mental command for his projection form, which was still floating in the air somewhere outside of this dream-like place. As soon as it arrived, it immediately took on its original shape and appeared before him once again.
 
 ``What's up?'' He asked it curiously as he approached closer towards where it is standing.
 
 ``I have been waiting for you to call me so that we can get moving...'' It answered in a robotic-like voice. ``As requested, I have scanned this entire room and I cannot seem to find anything of use here.''
 
 As he listened to the reply given by his projection form, he found himself nodding his head in agreement with its statement. 
 
 ``Then let us begin...'' He said as he walked towards the stone pillar located on the ground. Once he reached it however, he felt like something was missing from this place and that is when he noticed a hole just big enough to fit one's arm into that was located behind the stone pillar. 
 
 It was almost in front of his face with no way for him to know that it even existed until now. ``Hmm...'' He said as he began examining its interior once again. There did not appear to be anything special inside, and so after a brief moment of inspection, he decided to move on from there.
 
 ``I was hoping to find something more...'' He sighed as he turned around and looked back at the stone pillar. Then suddenly, his eyes widened in shock as he noticed that there is indeed something more inside. 
 
 There was a small hole located within one of the inscriptions which looked like it leads somewhere else. ``I was hoping to find something... But I never expected this.'' He said to himself before approaching closer towards where that hole might be found. After he reached for the inscription in question, his hand went straight through without any difficulty whatsoever! It seemed to have been perfectly made and designed in a way to allow anyone who would try it to pass right into its interior with ease.
 
 ``Hmm...'' He muttered to himself as he took one step further inside. The moment he stepped into that hole, everything changed around him. 
 
 Once again he found himself in the midst of a completely different world. There were no signs of any other humans or lifeforms anywhere around here except for his own reflection. There was also nothing else which appeared to be of use either. ``What now?'' He asked himself as he stood there, still examining everything that had happened up until this point. 
 
 Then suddenly a voice echoed from within the distance. 
 
 ```
 ---I am here to serve you! If there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to ask me whenever you are ready.---
 ``Ah... So I am not alone after all?'' He thought to himself as he examined his surroundings once again. Then, just like the last time, a sudden glow of light was seen within one of the areas in this strange world, and that is when he saw what it was: It turned out to be yet another mirror! 
 
 ``I wonder why I am seeing these mirrors everywhere...'' He said curiously as he approached closer towards where they are located. Then without warning, the light on one of them began to fade away and in a moment it vanished completely leaving him standing there alone once again. ``That was strange...'' He muttered to himself with a blank expression on his face. 
 
 ``I'm still not sure why I am seeing these things everywhere either, but now that I think about it... These mirrors have always been there since the start of my visions, so maybe they are trying to tell me something?'' He continued thinking for a moment as he stood there. But then after what felt like a few minutes had passed by, his eyes began to widen with shock as he suddenly realized that this must be the object that he is looking for!
 
 ``I am pretty sure about
