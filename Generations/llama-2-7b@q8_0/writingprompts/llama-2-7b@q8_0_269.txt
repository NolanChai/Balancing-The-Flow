�Sweet Mother!� He screamed.
�Silence!� I roared at him and shot a fireball at the ground beside him causing an explosion.
I ran my finger down his cheek, �Now what is it you wish to discuss with me?� The man gulped in air, �My name is Gobblegut. I am known as a lord of darkness. You can call me that or simply call me the master if you like.�
The old mans face went pale and then red before turning completely black. I stood there for a moment just staring at him in disbelief, but he was still looking at me with those empty eyes. �You are no more a lord of darkness than I am, so don�t call yourself that again or we will have words.�
Gobblegut laughed and started laughing like he had just heard the most hysterical joke ever. �Ha! I wish to know what you have been doing for the past month or so.� He stopped laughing, �You were attacked by one of my servants.� I didn�t respond, but remained standing with a fireball at the ready. �I was watching you from a distance when all this happened. That is why I sent you back to your own dimension and now here you are again. So what do you want? You have nothing worth keeping here anymore.�
He stepped closer to me, but then stopped. He seemed to be looking at something behind me. �You won�t get anywhere with your attacks, so come join us! We would like to hear more about what you have done in the past month or two.� I turned around and saw that he was standing beside a large fireball that had been hovering right behind my back.
I couldn�t believe this man. He really had no sense of danger at all. �So, just come on over here and join us?� I looked him straight in the eye, �No!� He laughed again, but this time his face turned red like a babys face when it cries after being spanked for crying too much.
I was about to fire another ball at him when he disappeared in front of me and then reappeared behind me. This time I was prepared and threw two balls at the same time causing them both to explode on impact with each other. His laughter continued even after this and a third fireball appeared beside him, but it soon disappeared.
�You have gotten stronger over the past year or so, haven�t you?� he said between laughs that sounded more like coughs now. �Yes I know about your abilities!� He continued to laugh. �How long has this been going on?� I looked at him and was surprised to see a new fireball had just appeared beside him, but it fizzled out before impacting.
I ran my finger over the back of his hand again, �Don�t you get tired of all that laughter yet?� he stopped laughing, �No! It is your fault for being so damn powerful and able to withstand the pain of these burns that I keep causing myself.� He shook his head at me and then flicked his finger over my cheek causing me to turn away from him.
I turned back around and he was gone once again, but a large fireball had just appeared on top of my head. �No!� I cried out in agony as the flames consumed my body. I felt like an ember was burning through every single piece of me causing pain that I could not explain.
I heard laughter and turned around again, but he was gone once again. It took a moment to realize that he was right beside me, �So you still won�t join us?� I stared at him with tears in my eyes. �Not yet!� He nodded his head up and down in agreement as the pain subsided and then disappeared completely.
I stood there for a moment with nothing but confusion and bewilderment, but then he spoke once again. �The next time you are attacked by one of us it will be even more horrific than this!� I stared at him blankly, �Now get out of here!�
Gobblegut laughed for a moment as he started walking backwards towards me, but then stopped suddenly and turned around. He held his hand over my face with one finger pointing right at my eyes. �And don�t even think about coming back to this place ever again!� His voice was calm and quiet when I opened my mouth to speak once again.
