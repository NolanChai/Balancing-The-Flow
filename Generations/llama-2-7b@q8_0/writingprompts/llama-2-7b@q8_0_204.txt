ining room table.
He looked across to the clock as he pulled out his mobile from the breast pocket of his shirt and saw that a red light flashed above the number 2.
'Green,' he said into his phone.
'Colonel James Green?'
'Yes.'
The voice was high-pitched, American, female. It sounded excited. 'This is Detective Inspector Jane Tennison calling from the Metropolitan Police. I'm working with Chief Superintendent Dexter on this matter—you know him? He told me to call you.'
Green thought for a second. 'Of course,' he said. 'Chief Inspector Dexter.'
The voice hesitated, as if unsure of what to say next. 'I have some information about the body that was found this morning and I wondered if you might like to speak with me?'
'Certainly. What time?'
'How would two o'clock in the afternoon be?'
Green smiled. He could tell by her voice that she was younger than he was, probably just a couple of years out of training. She sounded American but the way her vowels slurred together as if they were trying to form words without tongues. A foreigner and not someone who would be in London very long. 'I'd love to meet you,' he said.
He looked over at his wife. Her face had become sallow in recent weeks, she was losing weight quickly, her eyes were hollow with worry. The thought that the news might come from this call caused him a sharp pain. He could feel it well up inside him and knew what it meant: he would have to tell his wife the truth; about her mother; about the girl's father. It was as if a long-standing battle had been resolved.
Green hung up the phone, put down the receiver and looked over at his wife. She smiled weakly but then quickly turned away, as though she could not bear to look at him, and he knew that the moment of truth would have to be postponed for at least another day; maybe longer.

The meeting took place on the first floor of a restaurant in Chiswick. The windows were open and Green felt the breeze cooling his face as it blew across his cheeks, reminding him that he was now getting close to the age when men grow old too quickly.
'So what can I do for you, Inspector?'
She smiled at him as she sat down opposite him. Her eyes were blue and her lips looked like they had been glued on tightly. Green liked the way her hair fell around her face, framing it softly; it was dark and long and curled slightly, falling over one side of her face to just below her ear. She seemed almost shy as she sat back in her chair, as if she were not quite used to being here at all.
'Well, I have some information for you,' she said, 'and we think it might help with the investigation.'
Green nodded and looked across to where the waiter was standing near the door, just out of earshot.
The inspector reached into her handbag and pulled out a plastic evidence bag containing a small item that she placed on the table in front of him.
Green looked down at it, trying to work out what it might be. 'Do you mind if I open this?' he asked.
'Not at all.' She smiled again as she watched his face.
Green picked up the evidence bag and tore along one side then lifted it carefully by its two corners. The contents dropped onto the table with a light thud and Green saw that there was a small piece of plastic in his hand. It looked like it had been torn off something else, but what? He turned it over between his fingers and looked closely at the image printed on one side.
'It looks as though this might be an identity card or a driving licence.'
She nodded and Green held up the item for her to see. 'And do you know if there are any other items missing from this young lady?' he asked.
The inspector shook her head but her eyes flickered away to where she had left it sitting on the table in front of him. Green looked at it again and tried to think back to when he last held anything like that in his hand, wondering if there might be some clue as to how old it was or what year it was from. He picked up a piece of paper from the table where they had been handed menus by the waiter but could not find anything suitable so he placed it down again and turned back towards the inspector who now looked anxious, almost fearful that she might have given something away.
'There is no other evidence,' she said quickly, 'but we know that the young lady was reported missing in New York on Monday 29th September last year.' She leaned forward a little and continued. 'We think this might be her ID card or her driving licence or maybe even both; we're not sure yet.'
Green looked closely at it again, wondering what else he could say. He took one step towards the table and reached for his mobile that was sitting on top of the bag in which it had been kept warm by the inspector's handbag. 'I have an image here from New York Police Department of a young lady called Emily Jane Walker.'
He placed the phone down on the table so she could see the screen and the photo of the girl, her head turned to one side as if she was listening to something that had been said just behind her, the light shining in from somewhere off-camera. She wore a blue denim jacket over a black vest top and jeans. Her hair fell over one shoulder and was caught up with two thin ribbons.
'That is definitely Emily Walker,' she said as she moved closer to examine the image. 'But there is no sign of her other possessions—I mean, nothing else has been found at all?'
The inspector shook her head again. She sat back in her seat and looked out towards the window where she could see a few cars making their way along Chiswick High Road. Green followed her eyes to the cars and then back again as he thought about what was happening here. 'We are talking about missing persons here, Inspector; we do not know that this young lady is dead—at least, I don't,' he said.
'But you think she is?' she asked. Her voice was quieter now and almost sounded as if it were coming from a distance. She was looking down at the floor again so Green leaned forward to look into her face. 'Do we know that there have been no reports of someone who fits this description being found dead?'
'No, not yet,' he said, 'but I can assure you that if anything like that had happened it would already be on our records and it wouldn't have taken two days to get the information from America.' He leaned back in his seat. 'Do you know who she is? Did your colleagues contact her family?'
The inspector shook her head again but this time she was looking up at him as if she needed some reassurance that he really did want to help them find out what had happened to the young lady. He leaned forward and smiled as he looked down into her eyes. 'Look,' he said, 'we're all working together here on this one—I can assure you that we will do everything we can to find out if there are any relatives who might be able to help us with this.'
She nodded her head slowly and then leaned forward in her seat again as she looked back down at the table. 'Do you think there is something wrong here, Inspector?' Green asked. He could see that she was upset about it but wanted to know what exactly was making her feel anxious.
'No,' she said with a shake of her head and then paused for a moment, as if considering whether or not to tell him more. 'I don't think there is anything wrong at all.' She leaned back again in her seat and looked down at the table once more but Green could still see that she was upset about it.
'Is everything OK?' he asked. He didn't want to sound like a father asking his daughter if something was bothering her—he was simply trying to find out what was worrying her.
She smiled again and nodded, but this time her eyes were watering as she looked back up at him. 'I have no reason to think there is,' she said as her voice began to break a little, 'but I just feel that there's something more here than meets the eye.' She paused for a second or two then continued. 'It's all very strange; you know?'
Green nodded slowly and tried to think of what else he could say. He took another step towards her so that she could see the image of Emily on his phone again, trying to keep his face as calm and even as he spoke.
'We have our own officers here in London working with the New York Police Department,' he said. 'If anything more is found about this young lady then they will contact me directly.' He paused for a moment or two, then continued. 'I know that you want to do everything you can to help us solve this but I'm afraid that there isn't much else we can do without knowing exactly what happened and who she was—or rather, is.'
The inspector nodded again and looked back out of the window. Green could
