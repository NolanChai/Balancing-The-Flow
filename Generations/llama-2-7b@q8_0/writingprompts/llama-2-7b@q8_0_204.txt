, minding my own business, trying to get a few things for dinner when this lady comes up to me.
"Excuse me miss! We need your help!" She says with a smile.
"Um...I can't really.." I say as she gets closer. She looks at me and pulls out her phone.
"Yeah, yeah, just give it here." I say as I take the phone from her. I look at the picture for a second. The face stared back at me, dark circles around the eyes, sallow skin, and messy hair. But that wasn't how I remembered her looking when we had dinner together.
"We need you to identify this girl." She says as she puts on a pair of gloves.
I look down at the body for a second, and then back up at her face.
"Oh come on!" I say angrily as tears stream down my face. "This is your daughter! I would know who she was if she were dead!" I screamed out loud. The lady's eyes widen when she hears me yell.
"You're lying, aren't you?" She says while holding back her own tears.
I look at the body again, but this time with more emotion.
"She doesn't even look like her! You made us all do that!" I say as a tear falls out of my eye. "We had to memorize who everyone looked like." The lady gives me an evil smile and then picks up the phone back into her hand. She brings it right in front of my face and looks at it again.
"We've got you, don't we?" She says as I stare at the phone, hoping this whole thing was just a nightmare. The lady takes off her gloves and places them on her chest. Then she walks out with no hesitation. As she leaves me there, I feel something in my pocket. I look down to see a note.
'My apologies for what had happened to you.'
