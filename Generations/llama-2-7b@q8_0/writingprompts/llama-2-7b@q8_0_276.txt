ushed at the sight of Admiral Nimitz and his two aides. Even Captain Smith, who had spent most of her career in Starfleet, was taken aback by the size of the flagship she commanded. Admiral Nimitz took this all in as he made his way to the center seat on the bridge. 
 
 ``I assume you're the one we've been waiting for?'' 
 
 ``Yes sir. I am Lieutenant Commander Davidson. It is a pleasure to be of service.'' 
 
 ``Likewise, sir.'' 
 
 ``A pleasure indeed. This ship has quite an interesting history, doesn't it?'' 
 
 ``I do believe that was her previous commanding officer's intent when he designed the ship.'' 
 
 The admiral nodded approvingly and asked Captain Smith to take him on a tour of the vessel. Nimitz was impressed with the thoroughness of the ship's maintenance. He spoke with everyone on the crew, and inquired as to how each felt about their commanding officer. He even went into the engine rooms and medical bay. After that he had a final meeting with Captain Smith. 
 
 ``Admiral Nimitz, I believe you have everything you need here. If there's anything else we can do for you, just ask.'' 
 
 Admiral Nimitz nodded to the captain and strode toward the exit, followed by his aides. The doors parted as he approached them, revealing that two security guards were waiting outside of the bridge. The admiral nodded, and the security detail escorted him off the ship. 
 
 *Now for some R&R.* 
 
 *I can't believe you left the station without saying goodbye to me first!* 
 
 *What? I had a job to do. Besides, you're not my type. Now go away.* 
 
 *So where are we going? You said it was going to be a surprise.* 
 
 *Well now that I'm here I suppose you should know. We're heading back to Earth. I have some...* 
 
 *I know, I know. I can't wait to see my family again! I just hope they haven't forgotten me. And then there is school. I was going to try out for the cheer squad. How about you? Any plans?* 
 
 Admiral Nimitz looked around at his surroundings as he answered, ``Not really.'' He got up and moved toward a large window that provided him with an expansive view of space. He stood silently looking outward for several moments before turning back to his companion. 
 
 *That's it? You just want to look at stars? I think you could do more than that.* 
 
 Admiral Nimitz smiled and said, ``I have been asked to consult on a project in Earth orbit. I will be gone for a while but hope to return soon afterward.'' 
 
 *Sounds exciting!* 
 
 The admiral looked at her once more before responding, ``Yes, it does. And now...'' He turned back toward the door and disappeared into the night. 
 
 *Well then, it is time to get ready for my big date! I am so excited! I can't wait to tell everyone what a gentleman he was.* 
 
 She started walking again as her thoughts raced with anticipation. Just then the ship's computer chimed. ``All hands, prepare for planetfall on Earth in two hours and fifteen minutes.'' 
 
 *Great!*
