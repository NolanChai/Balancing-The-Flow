ational latitude. By this time tomorrow, everyone in the world will have it. No vaccine or medicine can stop its spread. Everyone is going to die.
The entire human race has one week left before extinction.
 
 The virus's original name was the Zombie Plague; but I soon realized that it would not create zombies, so I changed it. Now, I will have to live with that mistake for the rest of my life.
I am a virologist who has been working on viruses since 2013. My name is Dr. Holloway. The world knows me as Doctor Z. They think I'm dead.
That was the best decision anyone ever made.
 
 I never set out to destroy humanity, or even to kill a single person. All I wanted was to be famous.
My story began in 2013.
 
 On February 4th of that year, I started working on a new virus. My team of four was hired by the Department of Defense. We were given the goal: Make us an airborne virus for use against our enemies. We were to create something that would spread through the entire human population in six hours or less. The virus had to be highly contagious, easily spreadable, and deadly.
 
 I was up against some tough competition from a team of Japanese scientists at the Kobe Medical School. They created a virus with almost all the same attributes as my own. It was called MV214-036. The name stood for Mixed Virus, 214th Try. It was named after how long it took them to get their new virus to work. I still have a picture of that virus in front of me:
 
 _The first virus created by the Japanese scientists_.
The virus had many different strains; one for each country on the globe. Their plan was simple: Drop one virus on a city and wait as it spread across the entire world. The viruses were kept inside sealed vials that were protected from any airborne contaminants. They called these vials "Shrouds."
 
 This virus would not be easy to develop. It would take many tries for our team of scientists and technicians to get it right.
After many failed attempts, we finally succeeded in making the virus. The Japanese had been working on their virus since before my team was even formed. We were able to beat them with a lot of hard work. I felt very good about myself that day as our president shook my hand and congratulated me for my victory over our foreign enemies.
The next step would be to make the virus airborne. To do this, we first had to test it in some rats. We placed a rat into an incubator and then injected one of the new viruses from MV214-036 inside of it. The rat was dead in five minutes.
 
 This wasn't what I expected at all. I thought that we might be able to infect someone without killing them. We decided to do another experiment:
We injected one of my viruses, which were made from the blood and body fluids of my team members, into an uninfected rat. This time, the rat lived for two days before dying. I was very happy that my virus had worked on a live animal at last. I decided to name it VT-623 after my grandmother's birthday—June 23rd.
The Japanese team didn't stop there in their efforts, though. They also wanted to find out whether or not you could get the virus from touching infected surfaces. I thought that this was a great idea since it would be easier for soldiers and military personnel to use my new virus if they knew how to spread it.
 
 The next day we set up an experiment in which we took blood samples of people who had been exposed to MV214-036 and injected them into rats. We made sure that each rat got only one sample so that there would be no risk of cross contamination from multiple donors' viruses mixing together during our experiment.
We waited for the rats to die, and then we examined them closely in order to see what had happened inside their bodies since they were infected with my new virus versus being injected with just regular human blood or nothing at all (the control group). We found out that nearly every rat died after being exposed to VT-623; however, not one of these deaths occurred during normal business hours like you would expect if someone was really ill from having been infected by this virus.
 
 We were finally able to prove conclusively that my new virus could be transmitted through airborne infection alone, without the need for any type of bodily fluid contact whatsoever; and even better yet—it didn't kill anybody either!
Now it was time for the final step before releasing my new virus into society: testing it on human subjects. We needed to see if there were any side effects associated with being infected by this virus, so we set up a clinical trial where people could come in and get infected by our team members who had already been exposed themselves during previous experiments at our lab facility before volunteering themselves for possible exposure again without knowing what kind of risk they would be taking on themselves if any were present or not.
 
 We tested this virus on five human subjects over the next few days, and none of them died. This was great news! There weren't even any side effects at all from being infected by my new virus either. I felt very proud of myself for creating something that could help people live longer lives without having to worry about getting sick or dying from an illness caused by another person touching them in some way, shape, or form!
I was ecstatic that everything had gone so well during all these trials leading up until now; however, there was still one more thing I needed before releasing this virus into society: approval from the Department of Defense (DOD). They were very skeptical about my new invention at first since it did not kill anyone when exposed to it—which made them think that maybe I had just created something similar enough so as not to stand out too much compared against other viruses on Earth while still having some unique properties that set themselves apart from any others found here before. But once they saw how easy this new virus was able to spread among humans without killing anyone, their minds were changed completely! They immediately gave me approval right there at our lab facility where we were holding these clinical trials on human subjects so as not only for safety reasons but also because of time constraints too; however.
 
 After everything had been approved by both DOD and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), it was finally time to release my new virus into society!
 
 I knew that there would be many people who were excited about this new invention, but at first glance it seemed like nobody actually cared much or even understood what kind of thing they'd just created together with me here today—and yet somehow everyone still had high hopes for its future success when released into society later tonight.
I could already tell that there was going to be a lot more interest in my new virus than anyone expected too! I couldn't wait until everyone found out what they'd made and how successful it would become in the coming weeks, months, years, and beyond—this is going to be one heck of an exciting time for all involved here today.
 
 We were ready to release my new virus into society, but I needed some help from someone else first: a man named Richard Holloway. He was my partner in crime at the lab facility where we held these clinical trials on human subjects so as not only for safety reasons but also because of time constraints too; however, he refused to take any part in our project unless I gave him some money first—and since this virus had been developed without using taxpayer funds whatsoever (thanks DOD!), there wasn't any extra cash lying around anywhere on site right now either.
 
 Richard Holloway is a virologist who works for the Department of Defense and lives in California with his wife, Linda; their two children named Matthew and Emily; plus another son named Robert whom they adopted after he was orphaned by his mother during an attack on her village when she was pregnant—but that's another story entirely...
 
 Richard is also a friend of mine, so I knew if anyone could help us out it would be him! He has always been very good at getting what he wants from other people too: just look at how easy this whole thing went down here today without any problems arising between us; however.
I wanted to make sure that my new virus was released into society safely, so I decided we should all get together for dinner at the same time as our clinical trial ended with no one being exposed during these events either way around—and what better place could there possibly be than a restaurant named after Richard himself? After all, it's where he got his start too!
 
 We agreed on meeting up at The Holloway for dinner the following day (Friday). I thought this would be best since everyone involved with our project has been working hard throughout these past few weeks without stopping one bit along their journey—and now they need some time off from everything before returning back
