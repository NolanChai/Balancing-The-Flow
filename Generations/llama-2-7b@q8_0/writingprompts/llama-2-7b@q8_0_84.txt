My grandparents, on my dad‚Äôs side, lived with us when I was little. My mum and dad couldn‚Äôt afford a mortgage, so they lived in one of those council housing estates. My granny and grampa lived with us, which made life easier for my parents because they had a little more help looking after me.
Most people would assume that I loved living with them: a big house, a nice garden, the chance to play in the street all day long‚Ä¶but it was actually quite a depressing place. My granny and grampa were lovely people but there was something missing. It‚Äôs hard to put your finger on what it is exactly but I just didn‚Äôt feel happy around them.
My granny used to knit. She always had a new project in hand and the house was full of unfinished things, half-completed blankets, sweaters with holes in and jumpers that hadn‚Äôt yet been sewn together. There were also stacks of books on the bookshelves and piles of magazines everywhere. My granny loved reading but she had so many magazines that they had to be stacked up along her bedroom wall, two rows deep with a few more at the bottom. She was always saying that she‚Äôd love to read them all but somehow it just never happened.
One day I was helping my granny clear out some of the clutter from her room when I found an old photo album underneath one of the piles of magazines. It had a picture of my grampa on the front and looked pretty old, so I flipped it open and started browsing through the pages. There were lots of photos of my granny but she never seemed to smile in them‚Äîjust posed looking straight at the camera with her eyes closed or smiling but not really laughing. Then I came across some pictures of a younger couple, the two people on the album cover. They looked like they were enjoying themselves and it was obvious that my grandparents had been very happy together in their youth.
My dad told me once that my grampa had died when he was still young and my granny never got over his death; she always missed him terribly after he passed away which is probably why her face looked so sad in all the photos I saw. As for my grandparents‚Äô marriage, it lasted longer than most but it wasn‚Äôt really happy either because they were too busy working hard just trying to survive day by day instead of enjoying themselves like everyone else did back then with parties and picnics all summer long instead of going to work every morning before heading off somewhere else after dinner each evening.
When you get a chance, try looking through your family photos or even better ask your parents if they have any old ones that can tell some stories about how life used to be when things weren‚Äôt so complicated and stressful as nowadays seem to be for most people who live in this modern world we call ours today.
A photo album is a collection of photographs, either printed on paper or stored digitally. They are usually organized by date or event. Photos can also be grouped into albums based on their subject matter such as family members, vacations and other special occasions. The first known instance of an album being used to store photos was in 1864 when the French inventor Edouard Baldus published his book Les Albums d‚ÄôEdouard Baldus which contained over 200 pages worth of images that he had taken during his travels throughout Europe from 1857-1863. The term ‚Äúphoto album‚Äù has been used since at least 1894 when it was coined by the English photographer Alfred East who used this phrase to refer specifically to a book containing photographic prints.
The first known instance of an actual photo album being created is from around 1873 when Charles Darwin began keeping notes on his travels around South America, Africa and Australia which he then organized into one single volume for reference purposes. This was done with the help of two assistants who had been sent to join him during these expeditions so they could provide support in any way possible including taking pictures of everything they encountered along the way using a camera designed by their employer.
I‚Äôm not sure what your grandparents did for work, but my family members have always worked as farmers and laborers because they were born into it‚Äîyou know how it goes; we all grow up to do what our parents or grandparents did before us so that we can make something better out of life than what they had when they were growing up themselves.

That‚Äôs why I became a chef!
My mom was a stay-at-home mom until she died at the age of 60, while my dad worked in an office until he retired at the age of 75 (he still works part-time). He had been working for many years as a lawyer but wanted to do something different when he got older so we moved into town where there were more opportunities available for people over 60 who don‚Äôt want to work anymore than just sitting around all day doing nothing except watching television or reading books.
My dad liked being able to travel sometimes too though so he would go away every couple of months or so just so he could have some time off from his job and do something different instead like visit relatives living far away who hadn‚Äôt seen him in years!

I remember when I was a child, my grandparents would come to visit us every year for Christmas. They would stay with us for about two weeks and then they‚Äôd go back home after the holidays were over. My parents always told me how much fun it was having them around, but even at such a young age, I could tell that something wasn‚Äôt right between my grandparents and me‚Ä¶ something had changed since last time they visited us together (which had been more than five years before).
I don‚Äôt know what happened between then and now; maybe it was just an age thing where our personalities were clashing or maybe there was some other reason why I couldn‚Äôt stand being around them anymore‚Ä¶ but whatever it was, we didn‚Äôt seem to get along very well anymore.
When they left after their stay here ended (which wasn‚Äôt long after Christmas), my parents told me that they were planning on having another child soon so maybe this would help us all get along better with each other again? But then again‚Ä¶ maybe not‚Ä¶ because even though we had been getting along okay before then when they first came over here from England in 1967; by the time I turned seven years old in 1972 my grandparents were already divorced‚Ä¶ so maybe it was just one of those things where no matter what happened between us kids weren‚Äôt really happy about being around them anymore either way!
So here we go again folks: another long-awaited chapter! I hope you all enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. And if you like my work then please leave a comment below letting me know how much fun you had reading the story so far üôÇ
‚ÄúTina, Tina!‚Äù shouted Dad, leaning back in his chair as though those additional few centimetres were the difference between Mum hearing him or not. I sat nervously opposite him. What had I done this time? What could have possibly happened to get Dad so angry with me?

I looked at my dad who was now staring at me intensely from behind his glasses, waiting for an answer. But instead of saying anything, he just turned away from me and started reading one of the many books that lined shelves all around our living room. It was obvious to see that this was going to be another one of those long lectures about how I was never doing anything right in life‚Äîthe kind where I felt like running out of the room as fast as possible before he finished talking!
‚ÄúMummy, Mummy!‚Äù shouted Tina from across the house. She seemed excited for some reason and was jumping up and down on top of her bed in an attempt to attract my attention but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work because she couldn‚Äôt get past Dad who was sitting there reading his book with complete indifference towards everything going on around him!
‚ÄúTina, Tina!‚Äù shouted Dad again as
