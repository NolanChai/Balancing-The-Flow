cies.''
 
 `` Well then I can only hope you do not go out again anytime soon, and that your lamp is an actual lamp, not a metaphorical one or otherwise. '' 
 
`` Well it is an actual lamp, but like i said, bigger on the inside than on the outside.''
 
 `` What, have they never heard of a telescope? '' 
 
 `` A what? I do not think so, and anyway even if they had why would they want to look at you instead of me?''
 
`` Well what about that one over there in the corner, he's staring.'' 
 
 `` He is? Oh, well i don't know about him but I can assure you that we have a long standing tradition of looking at each other. I do not believe that is all he was thinking of.'' 
 
 `` What is it then, some sort of ancient lamp custom or something like that? '' 
 
`` No, no not at all actually, this is what you call the first stage of a relationship. The first time you see each other and decide to get to know each other, well as much as possible anyways.'' 
 
 `` So what are we supposed to do now? I mean hey, my name is ________.''
 
`` Well that's good i suppose but why don't you let me introduce myself too then, my name is _______.''
 
 ```
``That's nice. But since there are no other people here and we already know each others names what are we going to do now?''
 
 `` Well if I were you i would ask for a dance.''
 ```
``I don't know how to dance, i can barely even walk.''
 
```
``Well in that case you should start practicing then, it is not as hard as it seems once you get the hang of it. I will teach you if you like, and i think we might both enjoy learning from each other.''
 ```

``So how about it?''
 
 ``I suppose so, but i am sorry in advance for my lack of skill because i am quite terrible at dancing.'' 
 
 ``It is alright, you will be better than me anyways, and besides there is no shame in admitting weaknesses. '' 
 
 ``So it was a yes then? I'll be waiting right here for you.''
 
``Okay, i guess i have nothing else to do so i might as well do this then, just let me go get ready first.''
