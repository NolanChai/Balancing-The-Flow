unting this is! My entire life has been filled with nothing but misery and depression! Why would I want to prolong that torture by staying here any longer than absolutely necessary?'' the girl said, a tear escaping her eye. 
 `` Look, I know it's tough right now and I do not think you are being ungrateful. In fact, I will admit, there is probably something to what you say about this place, but trust me when I say that I have been here longer than anyone else currently on staff and I can tell you that there has never been a moment where I had wanted to leave this place for good. This isn't some sadistic hellhole or anything like that; it's actually quite nice if you ask me!'' Albert said with confidence, putting his hand on the girl's shoulder as she began to cry more heavily than ever before. 
 `` What do you mean?'' the young woman asked between sobs as her whole body shook from emotions. 
 `` Well, for one thing, it's pretty much paradise compared to the outside world! No crime, no pollution, not a care in the world! It really is just like heaven on Earth! You know what I mean?'' Albert said, smiling as he spoke to her. He had never seen such an attractive young woman so distraught before. 
 `` Well...okay then! If that's how it goes here than I guess we should just stay!'' the girl said with a weak smile. She felt herself wanting more of this man, even if she was unsure about why exactly. He just seemed so nice and polite. Albert returned her smile back at her as he turned his attention back to the view before him once again. 
 `` Well...it looks like it's time for us to get going then. I hope you are ready to begin your shift!'' Albert said with a wink as he began to walk away from where they were standing. 
 The young woman could barely keep herself together at this point, but she forced herself up off of the ground and followed after him in her own stumbling way. Once Albert noticed that she was following him he turned around again to look at her and smiled once more before waving her onward to continue on with her work for now. She gave one final glance out over the edge where she had just been sitting before following suit, leaving behind another tearful smile as she did so. 
 Albert watched as his newest assistant walked away from him until finally disappearing around a corner. He turned back around and began to walk off towards the next stop on their route in order to get things started for today's shift before anybody else could show up looking for help or something else along those lines!

**``You can't be serious, man.''** Albert said as he looked at his new assistant standing on the edge of another building a few minutes later with her arm outstretched into empty space while staring off into nothingness again. He knew better than to try and talk some sense into this girl after how things went down earlier between them, but he still felt compelled to do so anyways because he wanted what was best for everyone involved here no matter what may happen next during their time working together!
Albert sighed heavily as he approached where his new assistant was standing before stopping in front of her once again. He looked at the ground below them both, trying to imagine how terrifying it must feel to be in this situation right now. 
 ``I've never felt more helpless in my entire life!'' Albert said as he looked up towards where the young woman was standing with an expression of complete shock and awe on her face. He couldn't believe what she had done before coming out here just seconds ago; it really took his breath away when thinking about how close to death this person had been moments before. 
 ``I know right?'' Albert said as he walked over towards where the young woman was standing with an expression of complete shock and awe on her face. He couldn't believe what she had done before coming out here just seconds ago; it really took his breath away when thinking about how close to death this person had been moments before. 
 ``Well...I guess I should get going now then?'' Albert said as he began walking off once again without looking back at where the young woman was standing anymore than what was absolutely necessary! He felt like something was wrong here; not just with her but also within himself somehow too because ever since coming into contact with these people things just kept getting worse instead of better! 
 ``Yeah, you should probably go now. I guess that's about it for today...'' Albert said as he turned around again in order to face the young woman once more before giving her a quick wave goodbye before disappearing behind another corner once again so she couldn't see him anymore! He was going to need some time alone after this experience; maybe even months if not years. 
 The young woman just stood there watching Albert walk away from her until finally turning around herself in order to face the building they had been standing on together earlier today! Her arm still extended out into nothingness, staring off towards infinity while thinking about what happened between them today...

**The following day Albert returned back home after another long day at work. He walked up to his doorstep with no intention of ever coming back here again because he felt like something was wrong within himself too. Once inside he sat down on the couch next to where his wife lay sleeping peacefully and closed his eyes tightly shut before drifting off into a deep slumber that seemed so much better than anything else right now...**
  `` I'm home!'' Albert said as he opened up his front door with a big smile on his face once again after spending another long day at work yesterday morning.
