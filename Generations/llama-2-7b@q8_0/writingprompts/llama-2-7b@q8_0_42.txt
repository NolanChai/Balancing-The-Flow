 problem with drugs. Her mother called her and asked if she would be willing to get clean in hopes of getting married. She agreed and moved back home to start detoxing. After 3 days he was able to take care of her while she got clean.
As they got closer together, the addiction overtook Summer’s life again. He found her passed out one day after taking drugs. He didn ’ t want his mother to know so he put her in the shower and told her not to move. When he came back 5 minutes later she was dead.
He felt responsible for the rest of his life because he thought it was all his fault.
As I talked to this man, he realized how many people loved him. He knew he could beat his addiction if he just put his mind to it. His mom told me that since coming to our church, she saw a huge difference in her son.
