pt me from asking it myself and I was glad they were still asleep when it came time to introduce myself.
“I'm Ben. The name's on the door,” I said, trying to keep my voice casual while glancing at their sleeping forms. My eyes stopped on the man in a second, but I couldn't help staring at the woman next to him, she had an extraordinary shape and her dark hair was streaked with gray. It wasn't until she woke up that I realized there was a third person sitting behind us eating cereal.
“Hi. I'm Sarah,” she said with a grin. “And this is my husband, Michael.”
Sarah nodded her head in the general direction of the man still snoring. Then she looked at me and winked before saying, “I thought it would be fun to get up early so we could watch the sunrise together.”
“Yeah, that's cool,” I said with a shrug.
“Ben, this is my friend Michael. He's coming over from California to visit us in a few days.” Sarah winked at me again and then took off toward the kitchen. Her husband followed right behind her and I was left standing there staring after them wondering if it was normal for people to introduce themselves that way.
Michael must have noticed something, because he started laughing. “Sorry about her. She's always doing stuff like that.” He said in a friendly manner as he poured himself some more cereal and took a seat on the other side of me. It was then that I decided to ask him why they were afraid of alcohol.
“So, are you guys planning on being here long?” Michael asked while taking another bite out of his cereal.
“No. Just until tomorrow morning.” I said with a shrug and then took a sip of my coffee. “I'm just trying to make the best out of things right now.”
Michael looked over at me with an odd expression on his face before asking, “Was she the one you were dating?” He asked in a casual tone as he waved toward Sarah's house. She was standing in the kitchen doorway laughing and talking with her mother.
“I wouldn't say that.” I said with a shrug, then added after thinking for a moment, “We did kind of break up though.”
He smiled and nodded his head while chewing on some cereal. Then he took another sip out of the mug before saying, “It sounds like you two were more than just friends.”
“Yeah,” I said with an awkward laugh and then looked back at him. “But it's over now so there's really no need to talk about it anymore.”
Michael shrugged his shoulders and then smiled before asking, “So what are you going to do when she gets back? You two weren't that close but I know if you had any plans on breaking up with her, you wouldn't have left the way you did. So what exactly happened between you two?”
“That's a good question.” I said as I took another sip of my coffee and then stared out at the water. “I don't know if she would like me talking about that.”
He laughed before saying, “I think it might be better for both of us to get everything out in the open.”
I nodded and looked back at him with a smile. I knew what he was saying made sense but I had no idea where to start or even how to begin to explain everything. So instead I asked him if there were any other questions he would like me to answer before Sarah got here.
“You can't just ask me that, you have to give me some kind of warning so I know what to expect.” He said in a joking manner and then laughed when I shook my head at him. “Okay, so tell me why are elephants afraid of alcohol?” Michael said with a smile as he looked up from the cereal box and stared directly at me.
“Because they're really stupid.” I said with an awkward laugh before looking out toward Sarah's house again and taking another sip of my coffee. “I was thinking maybe we could talk later today or even tomorrow night. If it gets too hard to deal with, you can always just go back to bed.”
Michael smiled and nodded his head while staring down at his cereal box before saying, “That's probably for the best.”
“So what time did you guys get in last night?” I asked as I poured myself a mug of coffee. Michael took another bite out of his breakfast before answering.
“Around nine-ish.” He said with a shrug and then winked at me while taking a sip of his own cereal. “I'm glad you got up early to watch the sunrise with us though, it was nice. You should really think about making some time for that sort of thing more often.”
“That's true,” I said with another awkward laugh as I sat down and took a drink out of my mug. “Sarah is pretty cool and she always makes me feel better when things get hard to deal with. She's the type of person who knows how to make you smile.”
“I know what you mean,” Michael said in a casual manner as he poured himself some more cereal and took another bite out of his breakfast. “She really is great, isn't she? I don't know if you've met her husband yet but he's also pretty cool. He makes me feel like my life doesn't suck.”
“Yeah,” I said with a nod as I stared out toward the water again and took another sip of my coffee. “He seems nice enough, but I think Michael is more of an introvert than you are. He tends to keep to himself whenever we get together.”
Michael shrugged his shoulders before asking, “What about you? How do you feel about spending time with me and Sarah?”
“I don't know,” I said in a casual tone as I stared out toward the water again. “I just like to be left alone most of the time.”
He smiled before saying, “Well that makes sense since we are all introverts nowadays.” Then he took another sip of his cereal and said, “So tell me something else about yourself then?”
“Uhmmm…” I said in a casual tone as I stared out toward the water again.
Michael smiled before saying, “You know what? I think it might be better if you told me all of that right away.” Then he took another bite out of his cereal and looked back at me with an odd expression on his face. “Why don't we just forget about everything else for a little bit so we can have some fun before Sarah gets here?”
“That sounds like a good idea,” I said in a casual tone as I stared out toward the water again. Then I smiled and took another sip of my coffee, which tasted better than ever before. “I think it would be nice to forget about all that stuff for just one day.”
