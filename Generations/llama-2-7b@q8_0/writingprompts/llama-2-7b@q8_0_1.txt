16-year-old brother is also interested.
“Mom! What are you doing? I’m going to the bathroom!” He shouted as he ran through my open legs. His body slamming against mine. He didn’t stop and pulled down his pants, letting it all hang out as he made a run for the doorway. I was in too deep to care if anyone else had seen what we were doing. The sight of him standing there with nothing on but his socks while trying to keep from laughing at me was sexy.
His cock was pointing upward, almost hitting his belly button. It took everything in me not to reach out and touch it. “Get your pants back on now, I’m done.” He whined as he ran toward the bathroom.
I had just gotten out of a long marriage with a man who was boring in bed and I didn't want to go through that again. Sooner rather than later I found myself online looking for men. There were so many different men I could meet up with, some older, some younger and some right around my age. I was surprised how many younger guys had profiles on the site.
“Mom! What are you doing? I’m going to the bathroom!” He shouted as he ran through my open legs. His body slamming against mine. He didn't stop and pulled down his pants, letting it all hang out as he made a run for the doorway. I was in too deep to care if anyone else had seen what we were doing. The sight of him standing there with nothing on but his socks while trying to keep from laughing at me was sexy.
I looked around, hoping no one saw us. His cock was pointing upward, almost hitting his belly button. It took everything in me not to reach out and touch it. “Get your pants back on now, I’m done.” He whined as he ran toward the bathroom.
“I don’t know what you saw that made you think that was okay. I have a wife at home and I expect you to respect her as well as me when we are out together.” He said sternly looking down his nose at me. We were on our way back from a company dinner where I had been seated next to him at the table, but he wasn’t interested in me that way.
I sat there feeling like shit. “But you wanted it!” I screamed and ran into my bedroom and threw myself face down onto my bed. I sobbed for a while until I felt his hand on my shoulder. It was warm and reassuring. His breath tickled the back of my neck, making me jump at first before relaxing again as he stroked it gently with one finger.
He was still standing over me when I heard something rattling in my bedside table drawers. He lifted his head from where it had been resting on mine and looked over at the source of the noise. “I’m sorry about what happened earlier, but this is for you.” The gasp that escaped him as he opened them was audible even through the door.
My eyes widened in shock. They were filled with hundreds of pills, each one individually wrapped in foil and stamped with the company logo on the front and “10mg” on the back. I could feel his eyes on me as he looked over at it and then back at me. He didn't say anything but I knew he was worried about what they were for.
“I think you should take one of these before we get to your place tonight so that we can talk about what happened earlier.” I said quietly, “They might help us both relax.” The idea of having him there with me and being able to tell him anything at all was terrifying but it would feel great not knowing if he wanted me or hated me.
He laughed at me as he took the pill from my hand. “I’m so going to kill you for this!” He said before shoving it in his mouth and swallowing it quickly with a gulp of water from his glass on the nightstand next to him. It was a struggle not to laugh but I managed to keep myself from breaking out into giggles as he pulled back onto his bed beside me.
He let out a deep sigh before reaching for my hand, pulling me close and kissing me softly at first before pushing his tongue further into my mouth. I pushed back against him harder than intended as I tried to get closer but he was having none of it.
“No.” He said firmly pulling away from the kiss and gently shaking me off of him, “We are not doing this anymore.” His eyes were full of pain as he looked into mine. It was a look that told me how much this was hurting him but there wasn't anything I could do about it at the moment.
“I don’t know if we can ever be together again after what happened last night…” He trailed off before looking away from me in shame. “But maybe we should try and talk to each other sometime soon?” It felt like there was a wall between us that would never be broken down as long as he held onto his anger for me, so I reached out my hand towards him again hoping this time it would be different but when his fingers touched mine they just lingered there without moving closer or farther apart.
“I don’t think that's going to happen anytime soon.” He said before letting go of me and rolling over onto his side facing away from me in the bed we had been sharing together for so long. I was left staring at nothing but my ceiling feeling lost and confused as to what had happened between us during our time apart that led up until this moment where things were ending before they could ever begin again, all because of one simple kiss on New Year’s Eve night over four years ago when everything changed between us forever
“I’m not sure if I can do this anymore. I mean we're really close and it feels like something is wrong between us.” He said as he lay down next to me with his hand resting on my stomach, “Do you think maybe there could be a problem?”
“I don't know what the problem is but if you feel that way I guess we have no choice but for one of us to leave. But please don't tell your mother.” He said as he got up off of our bed and walked away from me into the kitchen. I heard him turn on some music before coming back with an apple in hand, “I’m not going to eat this.” He said as he threw it at me. It landed in front of my face but I didn't move until he took another bite out of his own and began to chew on it slowly while looking away from where the fruit had landed next to me, “I think you should go back home now.”
“Okay.” I said as I grabbed up my clothes off of him and left with no more than a few words exchanged between us. It was hard enough knowing that we couldn't be together but it felt even harder leaving without saying goodbye first or at least thanking each other for our time spent together over these last few months before everything changed between us forever...
I woke up to the sound of my mother calling out to me from across the room. "Mom!" I yelled, trying desperately to get her attention but she was too far away and I couldn't make myself heard over all the noise in my head that had been going on ever since I woke up earlier that morning after what seemed like an eternity of sleeping off a hangover from last nights festivities.
When she finally looked over at me with her usual stern expression, I felt relief flood through my body as she smiled warmly at me before reaching out to brush some of the hair away from my face that had fallen across my eyes during the night's activities . "Good morning sweetie." She said softly while patting me on the shoulder gently with her hand. "How are you feeling today? Are you okay?" I was glad that she didn't seem to notice anything out of place with how much I had been drinking last night but still couldn't help feeling guilty about it all.
"I'm fine." I replied, trying to sound cheerful and not like a complete mess as usual after these kinds of events. "How was your Christmas?" She asked me while looking directly into my eyes as if she knew exactly what was going on inside my head without even needing any kind of explanation from me .
"It was great!" I replied enthusiastically even though deep down I didn't feel that way at all, especially when it came to thinking about how everything had turned out with us...
The next day we were walking in the park and we saw a man who looked just like my husband. We stopped to stare at him for a while but he was not looking back so we kept going until he was out of sight.
My son is sitting on top of his bed crying because I told him that Santa wasn't real anymore and it made me feel guilty about what happened last night...
I woke up the next day feeling sick to my stomach and with a huge headache, but it seemed like everyone else around me was having fun. My husband came home early from work and gave me flowers before going out to play golf while I tried desperately not to throw up all over
