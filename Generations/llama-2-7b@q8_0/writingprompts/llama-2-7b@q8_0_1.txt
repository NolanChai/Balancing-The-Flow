 through the room as someone kicked in the other side of the door.
I got to my feet, and looked down at my watch; I had only ten seconds before the alarm would start blaring. I threw open the back door, and was halfway down the fire escape when the alarms went off. I ran quickly down two flights of stairs and slid silently around a corner into the darkened corridor that led to my room.
I stopped just outside the door. This was it - I had to do something about this situation now, or there wasn't going to be any way out. The thought brought with it a sudden surge of adrenaline; I knew exactly what I had to do. I had never done anything like that before, but then again... who ever really has? I turned on my flashlight and walked back toward the door.
I threw myself against the door, slamming it hard with all of my strength as I felt a hand grasping at the handle from behind me. I kicked at the knob in desperation, but it was locked fast into place - no matter how much force I put behind the kick, the handle would not budge. The door creaked loudly against its frame and then slammed shut again, locking out both of us.
I whipped around, holding up my flashlight like a sword in front of me as the figure reached for the door-handle. He was tall, with a black turtleneck that covered half of his face, and jeans that had been ripped at knee level; I could see the blood on his right leg. I didn't know who this man was - but there was no mistaking my situation: he had me trapped in here with him.
He stepped forward, reaching toward me as if to take my flashlight away from me, and I swung hard at his hand, feeling the plastic case of the light make a dull thud against his bony fingers. He took a quick step backward as I lunged for the door-handle, but when he moved forward again I didn't have time to swing before he grabbed my arm with his free hand and pulled me into him - hard enough that my flashlight was knocked loose from my grip.
I tried to break free of his grasp as I felt myself being jerked backwards, but it wasn't going anywhere; no matter how much I struggled he held on tighter, forcing me backward through the doorway with him. We fell in a heap against the door that was still closed and locked fast into place.
I had never felt so outmatched as I did now - this man seemed to be stronger than ten men put together; no matter how much I struggled he held onto my arm like it was made of rubber, refusing to let me free. I tried desperately to pry his fingers loose from mine, but that only served to cause more pain as the bone in my elbow snapped with a loud cracking noise and his hand clamped down even harder on top of it.
"Get off...!" I yelled at him through gritted teeth as I struggled futilely against his hold; this wasn't how things were supposed to go - there was no way that this was happening to me! But then again, nothing about tonight had gone according to plan; the last few months hadn't been any better either.
"Stop it...!" He pulled harder on my arm as I tried to get up off of the floor; I felt something snap inside of my back, and all at once everything went black as I hit the floor face first.
