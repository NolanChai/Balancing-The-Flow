 .” The voice on the other end is clear with no hint of a southern accent or dialect. It’s not just male; it’s also flatly emotionless—no inflection whatsoever in his tone. I think for a second and decide to call him “ Eme ” from now on, as that feels easier than trying to remember the proper name for a moment like this .
 
 “ Repeat, this is an emergency number. Can you please verify your location?” It takes me a minute to answer—to collect myself enough so I can be heard. “ This is Luna Park in Brooklyn.” I say. Eme sounds annoyed but he doesn’t let it show . 
 
 “ Repeat, this is an emergency number,” he says, then waits for my reply. I look at the address on the screen—9021 Surf Avenue in Coney Island. I don’t think Eme knows that location just yet but if I tell him there will be no need to explain where Luna Park is .
 
 “ Repeat, this is an emergency number,” he says again, with a slight edge now in his voice. I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that he called me first so I can’t even process his annoyance at being interrupted yet again by someone who’s already told him their location . 
 
 “ This is Luna Park,” I repeat. It sounds more like a statement than it does a request for clarification, but whatever. “ Repeat, this is an emergency number.” Eme doesn ’t wait for me to say anything else as he moves right along—not wanting to give the slightest hint of being annoyed . 
 
 “ Is there anyone with you?” I hear him ask, and even though he’s not giving me any visual cues, I know the question is directed at me. I shake my head no, but then remember what he told me in his message to call him back if I found myself alone—or worse yet, needed someone to talk to . 
 
 “ Then please state your name and location,” Eme says after a brief pause. I look around for the closest bathroom as I speak into my phone with no shame whatsoever. The only person here at Luna Park who can hear me is this man on the other end of the line—and there’s not one damn thing he can do to help .
 
 “ My name is Luna Park and my location is Brooklyn, New York,” I say with a bit more enthusiasm than before. “ Repeat, this is an emergency number.” Eme ’s tone is flat but his words are emotionless—like he’s just stating the facts . 
 
 “ And what do you need?” He asks now that we’re past the location bit and into what I can only assume to be some sort of actual dialogue. It takes a few seconds for me to respond because this is all still so new, even though it shouldn ’t be—I mean, after everything that happened over the last twenty-four hours, there should have been plenty of time for my mind and heart (and the rest of my body) to catch up . 
 
 “ I just wanted to say hi,” I reply. There’s a moment of silence on Eme ’s end but he doesn’t respond right away—which makes me think he might not have heard what I said correctly or maybe it wasn’t what he expected at all .
 
 “ What?” He finally asks, sounding like he’s just now awakened from a deep sleep. “ Sorry, repeat please.” His tone is still emotionless and flat—like there was no question about the quality of my voice before I even spoke into this phone line . 
 
 “ I said hi,” I say again without missing a beat. There’s another moment of silence on his end but this time it feels different; like Eme ’s not only awake now, he’s also listening very closely to whatever my next move may be . 
 
 “ Okay.” He says after what seems like an eternity—but in reality is probably just a few seconds. His tone has changed again: now there’s more emotion behind it than before as he waits for me to continue speaking .
 
 I look around and see that there are no other people nearby who could possibly hear what we’re saying; this call will have to be made in code, whether Eme knows about it or not. So I take a deep breath before responding—not sure if he can even tell what I ’m doing over the phone but hoping for any clue that tells me what to do next . 
 “ My name is Luna Park,” I say. It sounds more like a question than anything else because I’m not sure if Eme knows who I am just yet—but then again, maybe he does? There are plenty of people in the world who would recognize my voice alone; that’s something I can ’t deny . 
 
 “ And you say hi?” He asks without missing a beat. This is it—the moment where all eyes will be on us and we need to make sure everything goes according to plan before either of us gets in trouble over nothing more than an innocent phone call . 
 
 I look up from my phone and stare at the nearest camera; there’s one just above me, directly facing this spot where I’m standing. It doesn ’t matter which direction I turn or how hard I try to hide what we’re doing—this whole conversation has been recorded already . 
 
 “ Yes,” I say into my phone as I stare up at the camera with nothing but determination written all over my face and body language: like I have no idea that everything around me is being watched closely by someone who wants to see how this will play out. And for now, it seems like Eme knows exactly what he’s doing—but then again, so do I .
