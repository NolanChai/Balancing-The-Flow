ense shoulders and backs to the onlookers, as they moved through into the clear.
``The gods have spoken,'' said the voice of Pontius, ``Their wish is our command.'' A small man dressed in a grey cloak with his head wrapped by a leather hood stepped forward from the crowd and approached the plinth. He stopped three paces short of it, turning to face the crowd again.
``Let the sacrifice begin!'' The priest's voice reverberated around the arena like that of an orchestra tuning their instruments; all attention was now on him as he stood, his arms held out wide, his fingers touching those who had gathered around the plinth. ``He will come to us when he is ready. When he wants to.'' The crowd stirred uneasily and some whispered amongst themselves.
``What does he say? '' said the voice of a young man in the crowd.
``The Gods have not spoken, but it will be soon enough for all of this.'' The young man was stunned by what he had just heard and glanced over to see who had said such things; he saw only empty space where his companion should have stood, a gap in the crowd. He turned back to watch the proceedings, as did many others.
``It's happening already isn't it?'' asked another voice, this time that of an old man, and once again the young man searched for its origin; he saw nothing, but could still hear the words.
He glanced upwards at the bleachers in which those who watched were seated, but nobody there seemed to be speaking. He looked back down at the plinth, where the priest had taken a few steps forward towards the crowd and was now addressing them again; ``The time draws near.''
``He speaks!'' The words were like knives being driven into him by those who stood around. They seemed to come from every direction, as if the air itself was alive with the sound of them. He looked around once more and saw that they came not from where he had thought, but rather from a group of people standing just behind his right shoulder; their heads were bowed so that he could not see their faces.
``I have heard your words!'' The priest's voice boomed out across the arena once again. ``The time has come for you to be tested.'' The crowd began to murmur, as if a thousand voices had been cut off at the same time. A few heads rose and turned towards him; he felt sure that their eyes were boring into his.
``I cannot hear you!'' There was silence once again in the arena for a moment before a voice whispered from behind him, ``He's speaking to me.'' He had not heard the man speak before but could now tell that it was one of the priests who had been standing behind his shoulder; he turned to look at the man.
``You do not have ears!'' The priest's voice had become angry and loud once again, as if he were addressing them all. ``But I will speak to you just the same.'' He turned away from the plinth and began walking towards the man who had spoken; those around him parted like waves before a storm-tossed ship.
``What are you saying?'' The young man said, but could get no answer from his companion, only silence. ``You can't hear me!'' he shouted to himself and then turned back towards the arena; there was nothing more that he could do. He stood still for a moment watching what was going on before him and began to walk away, back towards the tunnel through which they had entered.
The crowd parted as if by magic as the young man passed through it and he felt himself pulled from side to side in response to their movement; a few of them were staring directly at him but no one seemed willing or able to speak with him. He was relieved to have moved away from where he had stood before, yet he did not look back as they did, for fear that someone might still be watching him there and might say something if he turned around.
Once he was sure that the crowd was out of earshot, he began walking faster; it was becoming more difficult to breathe now as well, and so he quickened his pace further until he found himself running down towards the tunnel once more, almost unable to stop himself from sprinting at full pelt through it.
He paused for a moment in the darkness of the corridor and allowed himself to take deep breaths before moving on; when he had done so, he started to walk again, his heart still beating fast but now slow enough that he could talk as well. He began muttering quietly to himself, ``It'll be all right I'm sure it will be okay...''
His footsteps echoed around him like a distant chorus from another world and soon he came across a small wooden door in the wall of corridor; this one was different however than those that had led off into other rooms. It was slightly ajar, but he could not see through it until he pushed it open with his hand; then light spilled out onto the corridor floor as if it were water from some great fountain, or sunlight breaking over a mountain peak.
He stepped through quickly and stopped in amazement at what lay before him; ``Wow...'' He had expected to find something special here perhaps but this was far more than he could ever have imagined! It was like stepping into another world altogether and yet one that felt familiar somehow, as if it were a place he had visited many times before.
He walked towards what appeared to be the center of the room; there were large pieces of stonework inlaid within it which seemed almost like windows into another realm. As he approached these, they began to glow with a soft light that lit up everything around him and made his skin tingle as if thousands of tiny needles were piercing through it.
He could not see what was causing this effect however until he reached out for one of the stones; then its surface came alive beneath his touch, changing colors from red to blue in an instant before slowly fading back again so that they once more became part of their surroundings. The light that had been shining through them seemed to have a life of it's own too and moved around like fireflies; he reached out for another stone now but this time found himself reaching towards something else as well, something which was not just sitting there on the floor!
A figure appeared before him now -a beautiful woman with long hair flowing down her back- she smiled at him gently as if they were old friends who had been separated for many years then took a step forward and held out her hand towards him; it was soft and warm against his cold skin. ``Please come with me my friend,'' she said in a voice that sounded like an ocean wave rolling towards the shore but did not drown it out completely when it arrived.
``I don't understand!'' He had forgotten his companion in the excitement of what he was seeing now and could no longer hear him even though they were still running together down through corridors until they reached another doorway; this one looked more like a cave than anything else but there seemed to be light coming from within it as well so he pushed open the door without hesitation.
When he stepped inside however, everything changed once again; he was no longer in any kind of tunnel or hallway at all but rather standing on top of a large hill looking out across a valley filled with trees and bushes which sloped down towards a small river that flowed past below him into what appeared to be an ocean beyond.
The sun shone brightly above them both making everything even more beautiful than it already was but he had no time for such things now, not when there were so many questions still unanswered in his mind! He began walking down towards the river's edge where it met with the sea before him; as he did so however, something caught his eye off to one side of him which caused him to stop suddenly.
A figure was standing at the top of the hill looking out across this valley towards him and although she was dressed very differently from how she had been earlier -in a simple white dress with no jewelry or other adornments- he knew immediately who it was; ``Sarah!'' He called out her name loudly so that everyone around might hear.
She turned towards him then, walking quickly down the hillside until she reached where he was standing on top of the rocky ridge below them both; as soon as they met one another's gaze however there seemed to be something different about how Sarah looked now compared with how she had been just moments before...
She smiled at him again but this time her smile did not reach her eyes, only part of it did and even then only for a split second. She took a step forward towards him reaching out an arm to touch his cheek; he could feel her fingers through the fabric of his tunic as if they were burning hot against his skin yet when she pulled back again there was no sign of any pain on her face...
Sarah's smile changed once more into something that looked almost angry, but before he had time to say anything else about it; a loud thump echoed through the air around them both like an earthquake striking deep below them all! ``No...'' Sarah said quietly as she clutched at her stomach with one hand while pushing him away from herself with another
