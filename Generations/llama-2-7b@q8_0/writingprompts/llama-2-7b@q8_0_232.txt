 ght of a winter day is an appropriate metaphor for the emotional state I find myself in. The yearly cycle has always affected me more than most. It’s as though I experience time on a different schedule than everyone else, and it’s been like this my entire life. I’ve often wondered whether this was related to my father’s untimely death or if I had inherited the condition from some other source. The only way that I can explain how this condition affects me is to compare the emotional swings in my mood with a roller coaster. The day I found out that he died, time stopped and I was frozen for what seemed like an eternity. 
 
 Time Stops

 The ride down from that high point was just as sudden but much more painful. I’m not sure how long it took for me to descend fully back into the pit of my depression, but it felt like an eternal fall. As I sit on the ground staring up at the sky in a desperate attempt to escape its emptiness, I realize that I have come to accept the fact that he is gone and I am now alone. I can’t fight time anymore; I just want to lie down in the dirt until I fade away into nothingness. 
 
 The Fade Away

 As the sun sets, my emotions begin to even out. This period of acceptance seems to last a little longer each year and it becomes more difficult to let go with every passing day. Although I am sad that he is gone, I feel like there is finally some peace within me as I watch him ascend into the clouds in his final act of rebellion against time’s endless cycle.
