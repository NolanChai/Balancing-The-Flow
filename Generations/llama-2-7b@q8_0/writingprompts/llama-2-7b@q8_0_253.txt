ke back the words before I get too caught up with my own insecurities and end up saying something stupid. 

 Troy was waiting for me at my locker, pacing anxiously back and forth, his brown hair shoved into a messy mop on top of his head. He had an earbud in one ear as he waited impatiently. I smiled, but it felt flat. 

``Sorry guys...'' Troy was the first to apologize. I think we all were. `` I guess I just got a little too carried away. Sorry about the...'' He shrugged and held up his hands as if he had no control over what happened. I sighed, trying not to let my frustration show. 

 Troy's eyes darted between me and Kyle, who was now standing next to me, looking nervous and uncomfortable, probably from the embarrassment of it all. His hair was matted into spikes along his head, and he had on the same pair of jeans as this morning. He had a stain that I couldn't see, but I bet if you took out the shirt and looked at the sleeve it would be brown like yesterday. 

 Troy and Kyle were both looking at me, waiting for my response to what happened, wondering if they should say anything or just get out of there, go back to their locker. I wasn't sure how long we had been standing there before I made my move. It seemed like forever but really it was only a few minutes. I looked around the room as if trying to find someone else to talk to, when I noticed that most people had left already. 

 Troy and Kyle were waiting for me to say something. They knew they'd done wrong but didn't know how to make up for it. They stood there awkwardly waiting for my response. We were in the middle of the school hallway, next to my locker. It wasn't like I could walk away from them and pretend they weren't even there. 

 The crowd had thinned out a little bit since we first got there, but there were still a handful of people who walked by us on their way somewhere else. They avoided looking at me or Troy because we were obviously in trouble. I was trying not to stare at the floor as I looked down. 

``You guys...'' I said slowly, taking my time with the words, hoping that would help me find a response and not let this conversation get out of control like it had before. ``... I'm sorry too. I guess I just got too caught up in the moment. I didn't mean to embarrass you guys or anything.'' 

 The two boys stared at me, waiting for me to say something else. They both looked nervous and scared of what might happen next if they said the wrong thing. 

 Troy spoke first. ``You don't have to be sorry. You just got a little overexcited...'' He said it with a smile. He didn't seem mad at me anymore, but he was still unsure how I felt about what happened in there today. His eyes were focused on something across the room, as if he wanted to see something, or someone else. 

 Troy and Kyle were both standing there looking at me expectantly, waiting for a response from me. They didn't say anything yet because they thought maybe I was going to make it up to them. Like maybe I would do something to show that this wasn't their fault but mine, so that we could all get back on track and pretend like nothing happened today at lunchtime. 

 We stood there for what felt like forever, waiting for me to say something or give some sort of indication that everything was going to be alright again. But the truth is, it wasn't. This morning had been a nightmare and I didn't know how to fix it anymore than Troy did. 

Troy sighed heavily as he looked down at his shoes. I could see him squirming, wanting me to say something but not knowing what to do or say next. It was almost like he felt guilty for something that wasn't even his fault in the first place. He probably felt bad enough already just being there with me. 

 Kyle's eyes shifted from side to side as if he were looking around to see where we were supposed to go next, or what he should say next. His hands were clasped behind his back and his fingers were twitching slightly as if he wanted to run away but was too scared of making things worse by doing so. 

 I could feel myself starting to panic, not knowing how this conversation would end or what we were going to do next. I couldn't let it get out of hand like before, when the crowd had started shouting and laughing at us as if they enjoyed seeing two friends fight in front of everyone else. 

 It felt like forever before Troy spoke again. He cleared his throat a few times before he finally said something to break up our silence. ``Are you going home early today or staying late?'' 

 I shrugged my shoulders as if it didn't matter either way because that was the truth, really. I had no idea what time school let out for me so all of this was pointless anyway. It felt like we were standing in front of an audience who wanted to see us fail or embarrass each other somehow and I wasn't going down without a fight anymore. 

 Kyle looked at Troy with wide eyes, unsure how to answer the question because he didn't want things to get too tense between them again after what happened earlier today during lunch break when they had all watched us screaming and fighting over some girl none of us even knew existed. 

 ``Well...'' Troy said hesitantly, looking away from me like maybe if he stared at his shoes long enough it would help him remember something important that might be able to save this entire situation from getting any worse than what was already going on between the two of us right now. 

 Kyle's eyes darted back and forth between Troy and me, waiting for one of them to say something or do something else before we walked off together again like nothing had ever happened between us at all during that entire day earlier today when they watched us fight in front of everyone else who was also there too watching our every move closely from behind their own masks as well. 

 ``I don't know...'' Kyle said, still unsure how to answer the question because he didn't want things to get any worse than what was already going on between us right now before we walked away again like nothing had ever happened at all during this entire day earlier today when they watched us fight in front of everyone else who was also there watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 Troy didn't say anything, just looked down at his feet and then shrugged before looking back up again to see if I had said something yet or not since I hadn't spoken since we stood there waiting for him to tell me what time he got out of school today either way so that maybe this entire situation would finally end before it could get any worse than what was already happening between us right now while we waited in the hallway outside my locker at our school together. 

 ``I guess I'll just stay late...'' Kyle said quietly, looking down at his shoes and then back up again to see if Troy had said anything yet or not before turning away from me suddenly because he didn't want things between us getting any worse than what was already going on right now while we waited outside my locker together in front of everyone else who were watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 Troy shrugged again, still unsure how to answer the question because he didn't want things between us getting any worse than what was already going on right now while we waited outside my locker together in front of everyone else who were watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 ``Well...'' I said hesitantly, looking away from Kyle like maybe if he stared at his shoes long enough it would help him remember something important that might be able to save this entire situation from getting any worse than what was already going on between the two of them right now before they walked away again together while we waited outside my locker in front of everyone else who were watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 ``I don't know...'' Troy said, still unsure how to answer the question because he didn't want things between us getting any worse than what was already going on right now while we waited outside my locker together in front of everyone else who were watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 ``Well...'' Kyle said again, looking away from Troy like maybe if he stared at his shoes long enough it would help him remember something important that might be able to save this entire situation from getting any worse than what was already going on between the two of them right now before they walked away together again while we waited outside my locker in front of everyone else who were watching our every move closely behind their own masks as well. 

 Troy didn't say
