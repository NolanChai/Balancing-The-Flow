 was a white man in his mid-twenties, with dark brown hair, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt.
"What are you thinking?" Evan asked.
The other man shook his head. "I don't know."
He was a black man in his late twenties. He had short cropped hair that framed his high cheekbones, and he was wearing a gray T-shirt with the logo of a local radio station.
"Why are you thinking about it?" Evan asked him. "I thought we agreed this isn't something to think about."
The other man glanced at him and then back up at the hole. "Maybe not."
The three men were standing on a large wooden platform that had been constructed in the center of a grassy field outside of a small town called Eggertsville, Ohio. The town was just north of Cleveland and housed a large military base, which had served as the area's economic backbone since it opened its gates in 1942.
Now, more than thirty years after the end of World War II, the economy of the surrounding towns had shifted from the war industry to tourism. The nearby shores of Lake Erie and Cuyahoga River provided a pleasant vacation spot for those who wanted to spend their summers near water without traveling too far outside Cleveland.
Evan was born in Cleveland but, as his father put it, he never really fit into the city. He wasn't sure if that meant he was a little strange or just from another place. Either way, he knew that he had always preferred spending time outdoors rather than in crowded areas with people bumping and jostling him while trying to get by.
He was standing on the platform now with his two friends, staring up at this new hole in the ground. The other man—the one who Evan thought of as "Jerry" but he didn't know if that was really his name—was looking down into the hole. He had a strange look on his face; like he knew something bad was going to happen, or maybe he was afraid it would.
Evan didn't know what Jerry was thinking about because they hadn't spoken for weeks now. The two of them were normally close friends but, recently, there had been tension between them that neither wanted to admit. Evan knew why the other man didn't want to talk—he had said it himself at least half a dozen times in the past few weeks: he was afraid they would be arrested by police and charged with trespassing on military property.
He tried not to think about how much trouble Jerry could get into, or how badly his own life could go if something happened that day. It was just as well that none of them had said anything—they would have been arrested for sure. But now they were standing there and nothing had changed except for the fact that they didn't know what to do next.
Jerry turned around slowly, his eyes moving from Evan's face to the sky above him before focusing on the hole again. He took a deep breath before speaking. "It looks like we won't be finding out today."
Evan frowned and shook his head as he looked at Jerry. "What do you mean? We don't know anything yet—it could still be there."
Jerry turned back to the hole, staring down into it. He seemed lost in thought for a moment before turning back to Evan with an apologetic look on his face.
"It isn't there," he said quietly. "We didn't find it."
Evan felt a cold chill run through him as Jerry turned around again and looked at the sky above them. He was still breathing heavily from their long walk into Eggertsville, but now he began to shake uncontrollably. His hands clenched and his eyes welled with tears, threatening to spill over any second.
"Jesus Christ!" he shouted suddenly in a loud voice that echoed off the grassy hillside around them. He turned toward Evan, staring at him intently while trying to control himself from falling apart completely. "What are we going to do now?"
Evan felt a lump forming in his throat as well, but he did nothing to stop it from growing larger. Instead, he stood there looking up at the sky above them until Jerry grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around so that they were standing side-by-side facing each other with their backs to the hole.
"We're going home," he said softly as his eyes filled with tears. "It doesn't matter anymore."
The two men stood there for a moment, silent and still, staring at one another without saying anything else until Evan turned around again and looked down into the hole. He could see nothing but darkness below him now that it was nighttime and he couldn't even tell if anyone else had been standing nearby watching them earlier today or not because there were no lights anywhere in sight except for a few cars passing by on the road behind them where they had parked their car earlier in the afternoon before walking here together to find whatever it was that they thought they had discovered earlier during their long hike through this unfamiliar area around Eggertsville.
The three men stood in silence and stared up at the dark socket above them. The man in the center, Evan, glanced at the man to his right. He was wringing his hands, dry-washing them over and over. He  was a white man in his mid-twenties, with dark brown hair, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt.
He was a black man in his late twenties. He had short cropped hair that framed his high cheekbones, and he was wearing a gray T-shirt with the logo of a local radio station. Evan knew that neither one of them had been there when it happened—they were just kids at the time—but they didn't need to hear what really happened in order for their minds to fill in the blanks.
They couldn't see anything, not even if it was right above them. It seemed as though there was a solid wall of darkness where nothing could be seen but then something caught Evan’s attention—it looked like a bright light was shining from within this blackness and it took him a minute to realize what he was looking at.
The three men were standing on the edge of a cliff, facing down into an abyss that seemed endless. The darkness around them was so thick that they could not see their hands in front of their faces even though the light from below them made it seem as if there was nothing but empty space all around them.
The men had been standing on this ledge for what seemed like hours now and had spent much of that time talking about how strange things were getting lately—they had not yet decided whether or not to jump down into the abyss below them when they noticed something odd happening beneath their feet. The ground began to shake violently and then the men heard an explosion coming from somewhere deep within this dark void, followed by a loud rumbling noise that sounded like thunder but lasted much longer than any normal storm would ever produce.
When everything finally calmed down once again, Evan was standing there alone with his hands on his hips looking up at the sky above him while Jerry and Joe were still talking about how strange things seemed to be getting lately as they stood beside each other near where their bodies had been blown apart by an unknown explosion.
The men walked back home slowly, keeping a close eye out for any more signs that something was wrong but there wasn't anything else to see or hear so they continued on until finally arriving at their doorstep without incident. They didn't say much during this whole ordeal but when they finally reached the house and got inside it felt like things had been different between them ever since then—like something had changed forever after that night in Eggertsville Ohio where they thought they were going to find out what was hidden beneath a big hole at one end of their town's local park.

"I don't think we should talk about this," Jerry said as he took his friend by the arm and led him away from where everyone else was standing around waiting for something terrible or miraculous to happen. "It's not good for us."
The two men walked across the field together, heading toward an abandoned warehouse that had been built in the early 1950s but hadn't seen any new construction since
