if I just did the things I needed to do, instead of what I want to do at a later date?
I decided that before I can dream big and reach my goals I need to find out where my priorities lie. This is something that you should think about as well - after all, it's your life!
Where does your heart lead you in 2018? How do you want to spend your time? Are you going to follow your heart or just go with the flow?
These are important questions for every person. If I hadn't stopped and asked myself these questions, then I would still be procrastinating about my goals - which is something that I don't plan on doing any longer!
In 2017, I was lost in a sea of unanswered emails, forgotten social media accounts and an unhealthy life. I didn't do the things that were important to me, even though it felt so good when they happened (or at least afterward). It wasn't until I realized how much time I had spent living someone else's life instead of my own did I start thinking about what was really important - and where it would lead me if left unchecked.
As you can see, it is easy to get off track with your priorities in the midst of a busy schedule. By being mindful and taking stock of how much time has been spent on each priority, we are able to identify areas that need attention or improvement. It’s not about what needs done next; instead think about where you want your life headed so that everything else falls into place naturally!
We've all been there: you have a long list of tasks and priorities, but when it comes down to actually doing them, something always seems to get in the way. You may be wondering how many tasks can realistically fit on your plate at one time? The answer is none if you want anything done efficiently!
In order for us not only finish our lists faster than before but also do a better job with each task and achieve higher results overall, we need more focus from ourselves as well as other resources like time management tools. You can use these tips below as guidelines when prioritizing your list of tasks:
- Prioritize what matters most to you by ranking everything according to its importance; this will help keep your mind focused on the important things while making progress towards accomplishing less urgent goals later down the line (or never). If an item doesn't make sense now but could become necessary in five years or so, put it off until then.
- Give yourself plenty of time between each task so that you don’t feel overwhelmed by everything at once! This will allow for more effective work sessions where there aren't any distractions because you won't have to worry about what comes next while finishing up something else first
When prioritizing a long list of tasks, it is important to know your own personal limits. If the task that needs doing requires hours of time and energy from someone who already has too much on their plate or if it's not urgent (and thus can wait until later), then you should put those tasks lower down in your priority queue so they don’t distract from other more important things like sleeping, eating healthy food, spending quality time with loved ones, and so forth.
When prioritizing a long list of tasks it is important to know the difference between what can be done quickly and easily versus what will take some extra effort or planning ahead in order to get done. For example: if I want to clean my house today then that's obviously not going anywhere unless there's plenty of time available where no other responsibilities need tending too much attention at once (like answering emails).
This is also a great time for reflection on the things you are doing in your life right now. What is it that really matters to you? How can you spend more time with those people who make you feel happiest and healthyest? And where do all these other things rank when compared against one another - does an event at work trump a visit home from college or vice versa (depends on what day).
When prioritizing your long list of tasks, it's important to remember that not everything is worth doing. The most effective way of doing this is by creating an action plan for each task so you can determine if the item should be completed at all based on its importance and urgency. For example: If I were asked what my top five priorities would be today, they might look like this - cleaning house; preparing dinner; exercising; taking care of business emails from last week (and so forth).
When you know where your time is being spent, it's easier to determine whether or not something on the list should be done. This can help you make decisions about which tasks are most important and how much time they require. It also helps avoid procrastination by allowing us to see what we need to do before we start doing other things that may take longer than expected (like cleaning).
It's easy enough for me here at work but when it comes down on my personal life like grocery shopping or laundry there's always something else going on which makes this difficult sometimes - especially if someone else asks me where everything goes because they think I should know better than them what happens behind closed doors!
The first thing you need to do is identify your priorities. It’s a good idea to write down all of the things that are important in your life, and then rank each one from most important (1) to least important (5). This will help you focus on the tasks at hand rather than getting distracted by other things while trying to get them done quickly or efficiently.
Once this has been done, it is time for some reflection: what are my goals right now? What do I want out of life? How can these goals be achieved with regards to what has already happened so far (or hasn't). This will help you make decisions about how best use your time moving forward as well as determine which tasks should be done first and why!
I hope that this article helps you organize your long list of tasks into a prioritized order. You can do it by thinking about what is most important to you, or by setting deadlines for each item on the list. If you're still unsure how to proceed with all those tasks then just start working through them one at a time until everything gets done!

There are many different ways in which you can prioritize your long lists, but there is no right or wrong way. The important thing is that you know where to focus your attention so that you don't get overwhelmed by everything on the list and start procrastinating again!
