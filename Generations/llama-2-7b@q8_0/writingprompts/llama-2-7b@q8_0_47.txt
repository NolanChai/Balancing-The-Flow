icy blue eyes.
 Jack? Who's that? And what are you doing in my dream? I must have fallen down the stairs at school.
 Jack! Help me! There's a monster eating me! He's taking off pieces of flesh, and leaving me behind!
 Oh, crap! I heard her scream. What do I do? 
 I don't know, Jackie, help me! Hurry up, or he'll kill me! Help me!
 Who are you talking to in my dreams? I must have fallen down the stairs at school and woke up in the hospital! How can a boy with blonde hair talk in my dream?
 Jack! Hurry up, before it's too late! The monster is taking pieces of flesh off me! He's eating me alive! 
 Jackie? Who's that talking to you? I must be at school, because the teacher is calling us to class.
 Jackie, help me please. It hurts so much, and he's still eating me alive! The monster isn't even done with me yet.
 Jackie, what are you doing in my dreams? Who's that talking to you? What are you doing to her? Oh God! I hope this is just a nightmare! 
 No it's not. I don't know who he is, but I can tell you one thing, he won't stop eating me until he's done with all the pieces of my flesh off me. If only I could wake up before he does that to me. Oh God! 
 Jackie, what are you doing in my dream? Who's talking to her? She sounds hurt, and she can't get away from him. He's eating her alive! Why is it always me who gets into trouble at school? I hope this isn't a dream. It would be nice not to have to worry about getting in trouble at school today. 
 Jackie, please hurry up and help her. She's hurt, but he won't stop eating her. He'll keep eating until she's dead! I hope it isn't too late for her already. 
 The monster is still eating me alive. He hasn't even left a single piece of my flesh behind yet, and I don't know why, but he wants me to feel the pain. It hurts so much Jackie. Help me please! Don't let him kill me. Please help me. 
 Jackie? You have to wake up now. This isn't a dream. Look at your body. Do you see any holes in it? There are no pieces of flesh missing from you. That means the monster didn't eat you alive. He's not real! It was all a dream. 
 Yes Jackie, I know he isn't real. You can't be hurt by a monster that doesn't exist.
 Jackie? Is everything okay now? Do you feel better yet? Can I hug you? I'm really sorry for scaring you with the dream. 
 It wasn't your fault, and it was a nice dream. You look so good in my arms Jackie.
 Jack! Where are we going now? Why did you leave me here alone again? You promised you wouldn't leave me without someone to hold onto this time.
 I know baby, but if you want the monster to come back and eat your flesh off you then we have to stay out of each others dreams from now on, okay?
 Yes Jackie, I understand what you mean. But when will I be able to touch your hair again? You always say it's a bad idea for us to hold onto each other in the dream world, but why not here? I really miss being able to hold onto your hair Jackie. 
 I know baby, and we can do that again after school today if you want. But how about this time when we get home from school today I take a shower first so I'm ready for you. Then you take the longest shower in the whole world until I come back out of there with clean hair to wash yours. 
 Okay, that sounds good Jackie. It won't be as much fun for me without you holding onto my hair again, but it will give us a chance to get some more time together later today. You can do that for me right? 
 Yes baby, I promise. After school we can hold each other and wash each others hair until the sun goes down tonight. But right now, it's time for you to go to sleep so you don't miss any of your classes at school today. Goodnight Jackie, see you later this afternoon okay? 
 I love you too baby, goodnight. 
 It's a quarter past midnight, and the moon is high in the sky right now. Tomorrow will be another day full of fun for us to enjoy together again. You have the whole rest of tonight to dream about me, and maybe even get up off your bed later on after you fall asleep just to see if I'm still here waiting for you too.
 Goodnight Jackie, sleep well, and we can talk more in our dreams tomorrow morning okay? 
 Yes baby, I love you too! Goodnight.
 The clock is striking twelve again tonight, but that doesn't mean it has to be midnight anymore. We still have a little more time left together tonight before the sun comes up over the horizon, and daylight takes control of this world once again for another whole new day.
