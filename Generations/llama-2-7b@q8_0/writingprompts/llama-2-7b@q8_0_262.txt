arned frog,'' Ava replied. 
 
 `` Oh, we get one every day at this time. It's like a ritual with the other kids and I guess me too now,'' said the teacher. 
 
 She then walked over to the blackboard and wrote down some numbers that were given to her by someone else. After doing so she turned back around only to find Ava standing in front of her with an evil grin on her face. She had been hiding behind a curtain all this time, but was now ready to make her move. 
 
 `` Now class, I am going to ask you some questions. Whenever the answer is right, raise your hand.'' The teacher said as she turned around and faced her students. Ava was about to take her first step when she heard a loud clap of thunder. She screamed in fright and ran back behind the curtain. 
 
 `` Who else thinks they should have never come?!'' Ava cried out. The teacher looked at her quizzically before saying, `I think it would be best if you left now.` With that said, she turned around to go to the blackboard once again. It was then that she realized that there was only one other student in the class. 
 
 ``Oh, Ava! I thought you were going to help me,`` said the teacher. 
 
 Ava smiled at her as if nothing had happened and walked back over to the blackboard. She pulled out a piece of paper from underneath her sweater and started writing down numbers on it. When she was done she looked up at everyone in the room and said, `There!` The teacher was about to ask what this meant but Ava quickly grabbed hold of her and threw her against the wall, making a large dent into it. 
 
 ``What is wrong with you?`` asked the teacher as she rubbed her head and got up off the ground. 
 
 `You need to learn some manners or else I will make you sorry.` Ava replied. She then took out an envelope from underneath her sweater again, this time holding it in front of herself until she could get a good grip on it. After doing so, she ripped open the flap with one hand and pulled out all of the contents inside before closing up the envelop once more. 
 
 The teacher stared at her in disbelief as Ava began walking towards her with an evil grin on her face. She then reached out for her hair, which was currently held in a bun with two pins holding it together, and pulled it out. In one quick motion she twisted the teachers neck around so that she could see where they were going next. 
 
 `Let`s go downstairs. I have something to show you.` said Ava as she walked towards the door. The teacher nodded her head in agreement but didn`t move from where she was standing until Ava had already left with the envelope and she knew that it would be pointless trying to stop them now anyways, so instead of fighting back she just followed behind them silently all the way downstairs into another room. 
 
 `You know what you want to do?` asked a voice from inside the room. Ava looked at her teacher and smiled before shaking her head no in response. 
 
 The person who spoke walked towards both of them until he was standing right next to them, his back facing them while they stared at him for several seconds with their eyes wide open but not saying anything else except for that one question from earlier on about what she wanted to do first thing tomorrow morning. Finally after an eternity passed by without either woman answering him or moving at all he walked away again leaving only silence behind him as if nothing had happened before starting over again somewhere else within earshot distance from where they were standing still with their eyes closed tightly shut so tight in fact that not even air could pass through them anymore let alone words because there were none left inside of either one`s mouth nor head anymore either due to extreme exhaustion caused by having no food nor water available since morning time until now at around three o`clock P.M., which meant that she hadn't eaten anything since breakfast last night after getting home from school late enough where she fell asleep almost right away without even waking up once during the entire process of eating anything whatsoever before drifting off into deep sleep again while still lying down on her bed with no signs showing anywhere else around them indicating otherwise at all except for maybe just their eyes being shut closed tightly enough so that no one could get in either way anymore because they were both too tired out right then and there after having gone through such an intense day without getting any rest whatsoever since morning time until now.
