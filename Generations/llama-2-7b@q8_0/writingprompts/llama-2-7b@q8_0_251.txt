 would be a force to contend with. They had to be; otherwise, they wouldn't survive the night.
"If you can hear me," he said to them all, "then stay alive. You might not know it yet but I will be watching over you and every one of my brothers is doing likewise."
He knew what that meant; that he would have to take the brunt of the attack so that his men could live. The thought almost made him laugh. Almost, until he felt a tap on his shoulder.
"No, sir," said Sasaki. "I can't leave you like this."
"You must."
He felt the cold, wetness of her tears as they soaked into his cheek and knew that he was not going to be able to let her go. The best way to make sure that she remained safe was by having him die; there would be no doubt about it then. He could only hope that this sacrifice would be enough.
"I'll wait for you," said Sasaki, her voice quivering with emotion. She sounded like a child in the face of the terrors of war — which was exactly what she was. He knew because he felt much the same way himself: it was an indescribable dread that made one's stomach feel as if it would be sucked out by a vacuum cleaner. It was the kind of feeling that took everything you had to get through and then some.
"I don't know how much time I have, Sasaki," he said. "But for now, this will have to do." He kissed her deeply on the lips and tasted the warmth of her flesh one last time. "I love you," he whispered in her ear before she let go of his hand.
"I'm sorry," she said, with a tear welling up in her eye.
He didn't have the strength to reply — not even for her sake. He couldn't even bring himself to turn around and watch as she walked away, leaving him alone. Instead, he just lay there, listening to the sounds of battle until everything went quiet. That was when he knew that it was time; he could hear his men calling out to one another over the field.
"I have to go," he said, trying desperately to keep up a conversation with Sasaki even though he had no idea what to say. "The battle is won."
A moment later, his men came into sight and they all knelt before him, in unison. He knew that it was the right thing for them to do because it gave them honor while allowing them to escape harm. He wanted to stay with them but he knew it wasn't possible; not if he were going to survive this ordeal.
"My brothers," said Genghis Khan, "the battle is won. It will take time for the Empire to recover from what you have done here, so don't get complacent and allow yourself to be caught unawares again." His eyes glittered in the night as he spoke these words; his gaze focused on each one of them until they turned away from him out of respect.
"We will not," said Kumogawa, nodding solemnly at his commander-in-chief before he turned back to face the enemy forces again. "Our men are already preparing for another attack."
He smiled, knowing that this was true and feeling a surge of adrenaline as he realized just how strong these warriors really were. But it wasn't enough; there had to be more than just brawn if they hoped to survive against an opponent with far greater numbers on their side.
"Yes," said Genghis Khan, "and you will need every last one of your men. I know you can do this; all you have to do is believe in yourself." He looked at each man in turn and saw a deep-seated resolve within them that made him proud; not only because it was there but because he knew how difficult it would be for most people to find such determination when faced with adversity like this. "Now go!"
He watched as they began preparations for another attack, hoping against hope that their courage and loyalty would prove strong enough to withstand the onslaught of enemy firepower. The sound of gunfire rang out from all directions as he sat alone in a trench atop the hill; it was an ominous reminder that they were far from being safe from harm even though they had won this battle and there were no more bullets coming their way.
"It's time," said Genghis Khan, turning to face Sasaki one last time before she disappeared into darkness with only her hand held out towards him as if she wanted something more than just a hug from him before he was gone forever. "I will see you again soon."
He smiled at this thought and watched until his eyes were unable to pick up any image anymore; it had been such a short time but still too long for him not to be able to say goodbye once again. With one last glance into the sky, he saw that there was nothing but stars above him as well as an empty void beneath him — both things which made him feel alone despite having many men around him who were fighting hard against their enemies on behalf of their own country or religion .
As soon as he heard gunfire erupting behind him again and knew that it meant trouble coming from all sides once more, Genghis Khan decided to leave this battlefield so that he could go back home where there would be no wars raging anywhere near his homeland anymore — ever again after what had happened here tonight!
Chapter 8: The Siege of Higashiyama Castle
The Siege of Higashiyama Castle, also known as the Battle of Kashima, was one of many battles fought between Genghis Khan and his son Ogedei. It took place in 1204 CE during the Mongol invasion of Japan. After several failed attempts to capture this castle from the Japanese forces who had taken up residence there, it became clear that they would need more men if they were going to succeed. That's where Genghis Khan came into play—he decided he needed help from his own troops and sent out an order for reinforcements from across Asia.
When Ogedei arrived at the castle with thousands of new soldiers under his command, he found himself facing off against nearly 100 thousand Japanese soldiers who were defending themselves vigorously against these invaders. The battle raged on for three days before Genghis Khan finally decided that enough was enough; he ordered Ogedei to retreat and let them have this castle if they wanted it so badly!
The siege of Higashiyama Castle lasted over two years, with the Mongols fighting hard to keep their foes at bay. The Japanese were desperate for reinforcements from other countries like China but these never came; instead, they had to rely on themselves and their allies within Japan itself who helped them hold out against this long-running battle.
Finally, after a siege that lasted over two years, Genghis Khan finally broke through the walls of Higashiyama Castle in 1206 CE when Ogedei led his army to victory against all odds!
