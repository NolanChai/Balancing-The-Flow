ng in front of him.
``What? That's impossible! How can it be?''
Caillou shook his head sadly. ``Sir, we are over capacity, and you have already exceeded your allotment for this week. It appears that there will be no more available until next Monday at the earliest. ''
The woman gave a loud, angry scream. ``I want my usual order of six thousand souls delivered to me ASAP!'' She glared at him, her red eyes flashing with anger. ``I do not like being kept waiting and I will not tolerate this any longer! You know the penalty for tardiness, don't you?''
Caillou swallowed nervously. ``Yes ma'am. It is my fault entirely. I will make sure to get your order expedited. '' He stood up and saluted smartly. ``I am sorry Ma'am. We will see that it is done properly this time, so you won't be inconvenienced again.''
She nodded with approval. ``Very well. I am sure that we can work out the problem together. Now get back to your desk and do what needs to be done! And I want your report by five o'clock this afternoon, you hear me?'' she barked before storming off toward her office.
Caillou watched in amazement as she left. ``Well I guess that went well, '' he thought, then turned back to his desk. He grabbed a phone and dialed the number for the main gatekeeper. A voice answered on the third ring. ``Hello?''
``Yes hello. This is Caillou from the personnel department in the underworld,'' he began nervously. ``I am hereby issuing an urgent call for volunteers! We need six thousand souls immediately! I have a form that you will need to sign before entering.''
A pause followed and then another voice came on. ``Uh huh. You mean we're not going down there anymore?'' He asked nervously.
Caillou's heart sank. ``Well, no. You know that you have a contract for service until you die. After that...it is up to the powers above us who are in charge of your destiny. But if we don't get these souls, they will be late again and then there will be hell to pay!''
The voice hesitated. ``Oh alright. I guess so. Send me down an application form and I'll sign it and get back to you.'' Caillou thanked him for his help and hung up the phone. He was going to need a lot more than six thousand souls to meet his quota this week.
His first task after getting off work that day was to find a bus stop so he could take the bus home. They had been closed earlier in the week due to budget cuts, and were not scheduled to open until next Monday. He walked through an alleyway until he found one where no one would see him. Then he took out his wallet and handed it to two men who stood waiting for a few coins.
``Thank you sir,'' they said in unison before grabbing him by the arms. They were huge demons with clawed hands that reached downward as if they were grasping for something to hold on to. Caillou fought hard against them and struggled, but his efforts were useless as he was dragged kicking and screaming away from where he stood.
The two of them hauled him into a room filled with men just like them who all had their eyes closed. One held an open book in front of each man's face while the other reached out to grab one by his arm and force it downward until it was firmly resting on top of the page, then slowly opening one eye at a time until they were both fully opened. They gave a loud bark as if in pain.
Caillou watched in horror as this went on until every man had been awakened. The two men let go of Caillou who fell to the floor with a thud, then scrambled over to where he lay and pulled him up by his arm. ``We will be leaving now sir,'' one said, then dragged Caillou outside.
The next thing he knew, he was standing in an open field watching as people walked past him toward the gates of Hell. He could see them clearly now because all the souls who entered were unclothed, but he still didn't recognize any of them. One woman came up to him and asked if she should take off her clothes before going through.
He looked at his watch, ``No ma'am. They will be glad to see you naked!'' He said with a smile before turning around and walking back into the building. Inside was another large room filled with people who had been brought there for work purposes, including himself. A sign on the wall stated that all employees were required to wear safety clothing at all times when working in this facility or they would be fired immediately without notice!
The next morning Caillou woke up feeling sore and tired from working overnight shifts as well as having been dragged out of bed by those two demons before dawn. He took off his clothes and put on an orange jumpsuit, then left the room to find someone else who could help him get ready for work today.
``So we have you here today to replace that old bum,'' Caillou said as he watched a group of men coming out from behind some curtains with their heads lowered in shame. He looked over at one particular man and said ``You know how I feel about this guy?'' The other guys nodded yes but did not respond because they knew that if they answered Caillou would be angry with them for it, so instead just kept walking away without saying anything back.
``What can we do to help?'' asked another employee as he passed by on his way into another room filled with more people who were getting ready for work too; however these ones had no idea what was going on since they were new here like Caillou himself! One man said ``I'll take care of this one right now,'' before walking over to the other side where a lady sat waiting patiently while he put some paperwork down in front of her so she could sign it without having anyone else watching what was happening around them all.
``Thank you for coming today! Now get ready and I'll see you next week!'' Caillou said as they left the room, leaving behind only one person who had been waiting patiently by his side since he came in: a woman named Lisa. She smiled at him before giving him an envelope containing her payment which she had earned from all these years worth of work here; though it was very little compared to how much money they made each month collecting people's souls, but still enough for someone like her who lived off government aid most days anyway so long as nothing major ever happened!
Caillou took the envelope and ran his fingers through its contents until he came across one particular note that read ``I am not here anymore. I hope you find what you're looking for in life because it seems like something was missing from mine...''
``This is a good day, isn't it?'' Caillou said with a smile as they walked together into the next room where more people waited patiently without any clue about what would happen next. He took her arm and held on tight while she watched everything unfold before her eyes like an open book that had just been written by someone else!
Caillou woke up in his bed with a loud scream ringing out across the house. ``Wha-'' he said as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes, then realized what was happening and jumped up onto his feet to check on everyone around him. Everyone else was already awake but still seemed confused about why they were there instead of somewhere else like their own home or something!
``What's going on?'' He asked with a question mark at the end while looking around frantically trying to figure out what had happened here before anyone else caught up with him. It didn't take long though because within seconds everyone was looking back at Caillou as if they were waiting for something...something important that might be coming soon enough!
Caillou could tell right away that something major was about to happen so he grabbed his cellphone off the table next to him before running out of the room and downstairs where all these people had gathered together like sheep without a shepherd. It didn't take long until they were all waiting patiently in front of their leader who looked almost exactly like Caillou himself!
``So what do you guys think?'' He asked as soon as he got up on stage before everyone else started clapping and cheering loudly while waiting for his answer which came after several minutes had passed by: ``I think we should go home now because there's nothing left here anymore.'' Everyone agreed with this statement but it seemed like some people weren't convinced either way so Caillou kept going until he found someone who said yes right away!
``Thank you guys for coming today, I appreciate your time more than words can describe - well actually maybe not since we had no choice in whether or not we came here but whatever...'' He smiled while looking around at everyone before adding ``I hope to see all of you again soon!'' And with that he went back upstairs to
