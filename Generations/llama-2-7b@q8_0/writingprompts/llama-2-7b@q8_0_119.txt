5 dollars in their pocket. I did not speak for I had none. 

 Then, they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak up for me! 

-Song lyrics by Nate Flynn

## About

The song is a parody of the famous poem "First They Came..." by Martin Niem√∂ller. The original poem lists groups of people who are being silenced and later killed, in response to anti-Jewish sentiments during World War II. This version replaces the list of targets with items that were once considered normal or acceptable (such as soda drinkers) but have been deemed abnormal and unacceptable by the progressive left over the last few years.

The song has been referenced in several political cartoons and memes, including an image which appears on the cover of Dinesh D'Souza's book The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left (2017).
