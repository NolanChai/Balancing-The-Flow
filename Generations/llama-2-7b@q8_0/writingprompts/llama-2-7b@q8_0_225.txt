oodie, jeans and boots—the perfect getaway attire. And his eyes... the kind of eyes that make you think he knows something that you don't. I could have gone for coffee or to my brother's house, but instead, I decided to be stupid and pick up this guy in the middle of the night. 
 
 When we reach a red light, he reaches over and turns on the radio, softly singing some song about how there must be another way. I turn it off before his voice can creep into my subconscious. He's nice enough, so I don't kick him out, but I can't help thinking this was a terrible idea. 
 
 My brother isn't home and the coffee shop is closed. It would have been better to go back to my empty house than deal with this guy on top of all the other things going through my head. But it's too late for that now. We drive in silence for a while, until he asks me if I can turn down the radio. I oblige. 
 
 "I have some stuff to take care of," he says. "Do you mind?" 
 
 He gets out and walks around my car for a minute before coming back into the passenger seat with something in his hand. A gun? A knife? I can't see what it is because of the darkness, but it's something sharp enough to make me feel like maybe he'll hurt me if I don't give him exactly what he wants. 
 
 "Do you want me to take care of this?" he asks. 
 
 He opens his hand and holds out a pair of scissors that must have been in my purse all along. "I found them." He pauses, glancing at me with eyes that are almost human before looking away again. He grabs the scissors back and starts to cut through the seatbelt, then takes them off me altogether. 
 
 I should have kicked him out of my car a long time ago but I don't want to make it worse by arguing. "You can't do that," I say, looking around for help or some way out. There is none. My only hope is this guy doesn't try to hurt me, and I can only pray he won't. 
 
 He cuts the seatbelt off me one by one before throwing it into the backseat like it's just garbage. "I have to do things differently." His voice sounds so distant as if he is trying to tell himself this is okay. "If you want, I can get rid of it for you," he says with a laugh that doesn't sound at all funny. 
 
 Before I know what to say, my wrists are cuffed and the back seat has been emptied out onto the street. The guy starts moving things around in there, piling them up on top of each other as if he's hiding something inside. "I don't like it," he says after a few minutes. "I need to get rid of this stuff." 
 
 I try not to look at him with my eyes. Instead, I stare straight ahead and think about how the moonlight is making his pale skin glow as if he's some sort of supernatural being. Maybe that's what he wants me to think. "I don't want to get rid of it," I say in a tiny voice. 
 
 His hand moves quickly from my shoulder and touches my face, making me flinch backward. He looks at his hands like they belong to someone else, before rubbing the backs of them against each other. "I just don't think I can." I watch him stare at his hands again, not knowing what to say or how to make him stop. 
 
 His eyes flicker between mine and then to my left arm, where they start to focus in on the scars that run across it like a roadmap of my life. "You were bitten by one?" he asks, still looking at those marks. I nod without saying anything, afraid if I do talk I might give away what I'm thinking about. 
 
 The guy looks me in the eye and then turns away to stare out the window again as if this whole conversation was just a waste of time. He doesn't say another word after that, but instead he pulls down one side of his hoodie and uses it to cover my wrists so I can't look at them anymore. 
 
 "You were bitten by one," he repeats in the same matter-of-fact tone as before. He moves closer and puts his hand on top of mine, but this time I don't flinch away because it doesn't hurt so much now that he isn't squeezing my wrists anymore. 
 
 "You should have told me." His eyes are like a dagger against the dark of night and they pierce through me without even touching, leaving my skin feeling raw and exposed in a way I don't think is possible. It feels like something has been ripped out from inside me and left in this car with him as proof. 
 
 "I have to tell you," he says. He looks back down at the scissors that are still clutched tightly in his hand. "It's going to be okay." I don't know what he's talking about, but before I can say anything he rips open my shirt and starts cutting away material until there is a huge gaping hole right over where I was bitten by the werewolf. 
 
 It burns like fire as he yanks it out of me, leaving behind an angry red scar that looks almost painful enough to be alive with its own pulse of blood. He stops and stares at what he's done for a long time before pulling off his hoodie again so I can look at the scars on him—scars made from years of fighting werewolves like me. 
 
 "I have to take care of this," he says, picking up the scissors and holding them out to me again as if it would make sense for me to cut his own wrists open in order to help him get rid of a scar from when he was bitten by one. I shake my head no even though part of me wants him to cut himself with these scissors so we're both equal. 
 
 He doesn't listen and starts cutting into his wrists, blood spilling out onto the car seat as he does it. "I have to take care of this," he says again. But this time there is something else in that sentence—something I can't put my finger on but know it has nothing at all to do with werewolves or cutting open scars just so we both look like we belong together. 
 
 The guy puts his head down and starts crying as he cuts deeper into himself, making me want to pull him away from the pain that is happening right in front of us—like I can do anything at all about what's going on here. "I have to take care of this," he says again before jumping out of my car and leaving it behind as if I never existed at all. 
 
 I stare at the empty road, still thinking about how stupid it was for me to pick up that guy in the first place even though part of me wishes we were together so I didn't have to be alone anymore. "I guess it wasn't such a bad idea after all," someone says from behind me with their eyes on fire against darkness as if they know exactly what kind of person you are and where they belong inside your head. 
 
 A voice in my head laughs and says something I don't understand before the guy disappears into thin air without a trace—like he never existed at all, leaving me alone once again. But even though it was stupid to pick him up this time around, next time will be different because I know now that if someone gives you a ride somewhere they might not have your best interest in mind after all. 
 
 So don't forget who or what they are before deciding whether or not it would be better for them to take care of themselves instead."
