 had the nerve to say it was for safety.
I turned back to the stack of papers I needed to get through before lunch.
A few minutes later a tap tapped on my door. "Yeah?" I called out, not bothering to look up from my desk.
"Is this a good time to come in, or should I make an appointment for tomorrow afternoon?"
I looked up and smiled at the guy leaning against the door jamb. He was wearing a suit that fit him like it had been tailored specifically for him. His thick black hair was combed over a bit too perfectly with his eyes hidden under a pair of shades, but it was his smile that made my stomach do flips.
"It's always a good time to see you," I said and pushed back from the desk.
He grinned as he came into the office and pulled off the sunglasses. The guy standing in front of me could be mistaken for any number of celebrities, but he wasn't one of them. He was too real, his face showing too much life to make him look fake. "How are you?"
"I'm good," I replied as I led him over to my couch and sat down.
"You're looking better than when I saw you last." He looked me up and down then tilted his head slightly before he leaned forward and kissed me softly on the lips. "Thanks for being here for me," he said as he pulled away from the kiss, his eyes searching mine.
"You're welcome," I replied with a smile. "I think we both needed to do this."
"Are you sure about that?" He glanced down at my hand resting on my lap before looking back up to me. "Don't say yes just because I asked."
He was so earnest, the way his eyes searched mine for honesty. He didn't deserve lies from me and I wasn't going to give him any. The guy in front of me wasn't some player trying to get a quick fix of sex; he cared about me. "I'm sure," I replied as I shifted my weight on the couch, leaning toward him slightly.
He took that as his sign and slowly lowered himself onto me as we kissed again. His hand slipped under the hem of my dress and slid up over my leg before moving into my panties. I closed my eyes and let my head fall back on the couch, my arms wrapped around him as our lips parted only for a second to take in each other's breaths. "You're so fucking gorgeous," he whispered against my skin.
My heart rate increased at his words as I moved closer to him. He wasn't the first man I had slept with, but he was the first man to make me feel special and wanted in bed. "I like your suit."
He chuckled low in his throat and pulled away slightly from me. "Didn't think you'd be here until later," he said as he tilted my head back with one hand and used the other to unbutton the top of my dress before slipping it off over my shoulders, revealing a black bra underneath that hugged my body perfectly.
I didn't even hesitate when I reached up and grabbed his tie, pulling him down to me as we kissed again with our hands roaming over each other's bodies. It was hard to get dressed while sitting on the couch, so I pulled away from him long enough to stand up and slip out of my panties before stepping into a pair of heels that made me taller than he was.
I moved closer to him as we kissed again until his hands slipped under my dress and he lifted me onto the couch, letting it slide off of me so he could get on top of me in one motion.
His mouth found mine again as I wrapped my legs around his waist, taking him deeper into me with each thrust. His hands slid over my body before they moved between our bodies, cupping and squeezing my breasts while his fingers dug into the backs of my thighs where he held himself against me.
His kiss became more urgent as I rocked against him. We'd only been apart for a few minutes but it felt like days since we had seen each other last and now we couldn't seem to get close enough to satisfy our desire. "Fuck, baby," he groaned against my mouth before pulling away from me slightly and rolling his hips so I was pressed even closer into him.
The feel of his body against mine sent waves of pleasure through me as I ran my hands over the backs of his thighs and up to his ass before I cupped it, drawing a sharp intake of breath out of him as he pushed deeper into me. "You're so fucking tight around me," he whispered against my skin while he pulled away from me long enough to grab his pants where they were lying on the floor next to us. He dragged them off and kicked them to one side before lifting himself up to lie between my legs, his hands sliding over my hips to pull my dress back down around me so it covered my body as he pushed inside me again with a groan of need that sounded like he might explode from wanting me.
I grabbed the hem of my dress and lifted it up a bit higher on my hips, letting him look at me while I was open for him. "You're so fucking hot," he gasped out as his eyes raked over my body. He pulled back slightly from me and ran one hand down the length of my thigh before he slipped a finger inside me while the other went back to playing with the sides of my breasts.
"You're so wet for me, baby," he whispered against my skin as he pushed back into me harder than before. "So fucking tight around me." He continued to kiss and touch me as I moaned out his name over and over again while our bodies moved together.
We were both panting and sweating when we came together at the same time, our moans filling the office space with pleasure as my back slammed against the couch, my arms wrapped around him tightly as he fucked into me one last time before he pulled out of me with a loud groan.
He fell down onto his side next to me as I leaned up on my elbows so I could look at him. "That was good," I whispered in his ear.
"Yeah, it fucking was." He kissed the top of my head before he slipped back out from between my legs and pulled away from me to roll onto his side as well.
I watched him for a moment as he rested his head on one hand, staring up at the ceiling as if he were in another place. His movements were more lethargic than they had been when we had first made love, but I could see it was because he cared about me and didn't want to get away from me too soon after having sex. "You look so cute like that," I whispered as I leaned up on my elbows once again and ran the tip of one finger over his bottom lip.
"What are you doing?" He looked at me with a hint of concern in his eyes before he rolled onto his back to stare up at me, his eyes searching mine for an answer. "Babe, don't do this."
I smiled softly and leaned closer toward him so I could press my lips against his. His hands slid underneath my dress until they wrapped around my waist, pulling me down onto him so we were face-to-face again. The warmth from our kisses was enough to have him rolling us over in the couch again as he moved his hand up to cup my breast, his thumb moving over my nipple with a gentle touch that made me moan into his mouth.
The sensation had me arching my back against his hand while I ground my pussy against his thigh so it would rub against him. "You're already hard for me again," I whispered in between kisses as he pulled away from the kiss long enough to take my hands and pull them above my head where they were held together by a set of handcuffs that were dangling over one end of the couch arm.
"Do you like that?" He looked up at me while I was cuffed in place as he moved his mouth down over my neck to suck gently on my skin before he trailed kisses all along the length of my collarbone until they rested underneath one breast. "I don't want you to get away from me so soon."
The words made me moan and squirm against his thigh as I arched back into him again, but it was his words that made me come harder than the first time we had been together. He moved my hands above my head until they were cuffed next to mine before he lowered himself down on top of me once more. "You're so fucking tight around me," he whispered as he pressed one hand against the back of my neck while he rubbed his erection against my thigh with the other.
I could
