 pondered the situation, it came to me. He'd beaten me once before, but that was when he had his powers. Now he didn't.

I got up from my bunk and went over to my bed where the dagger was still sitting. I picked up the weapon and looked at it carefully. I could feel myself getting stronger by the second; my muscles were literally bursting out of my skin.
 
 *What did he do when I threw a punch? He dodged, not blocked!* 
 
 *I can block now.*

I began to pace up and down the bunk area in front of my bed, thinking about the battle that was soon going to come. As I paced back and forth, I began to notice something different about myself: My skin had begun to glow with an orange-yellow light! 
 
 *Wow...I'm glowing! * 
 
 *How can he not see this?* I thought as my eyes narrowed in concentration. As my body absorbed all the energy surrounding me, I could feel myself getting stronger and stronger by the second. It was almost like my whole being had been re-energized by some unknown power!

I'd always felt a connection to this blade before, but now I knew it was more than that...it was an ancient weapon created long ago in a time when people were not as advanced as they are today. This sword had been passed down through many generations, and each one has had their own unique experience with it.
 
 *But why does my body feel so different?* I wondered aloud before realizing something...
 
 *I don't think the glow is just me anymore.*

With that revelation in mind, I knew what needed to be done: Find out who or what had given this ancient weapon such power. And with that thought, my body began to absorb even more energy than before! Suddenly, a bright light shone around me as my skin glowed brighter and brighter until it was almost blinding to look at directly.
 
 *Wow...I've never felt this strong before.* I smiled broadly as my body began to absorb all of the energy around us like sponge! After a few more minutes passed by, everything went back to normal and I realized that now was the time for action.

As I walked towards my enemy I could feel his presence even from across the room; he knew what was happening before it happened because he had been there when this all began...but even so, it didn't seem like an advantage anymore since my body had become almost indestructible!
