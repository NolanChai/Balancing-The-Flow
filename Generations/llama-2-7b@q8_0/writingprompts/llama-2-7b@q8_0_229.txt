ma bear and her baby cub, in that moment all of it stopped and we were just two humans staring into each other’s eyes. And I saw him take my breath away.
I had never seen a man look at me like he did that night. I don’t know how to describe the look but it was full of want and need and hunger. He didn’t blink, and his gaze stayed locked on mine as his hand reached for his belt, slowly slipping downwards with each passing second. And then I felt his hand slide into my own and I knew.
I knew that our paths had crossed for a reason. We weren’t meant to be strangers, we were destined to be together from the moment he looked at me. The way he touched me, so boldly with his eyes and his body, it was unlike anything else in this world. I couldn’t resist him, and yet I did. He kept looking at me as if I was everything to him when really all I had were a few bruises from the fight that broke out around us. But he didn’t care about my injuries or what was going on with the other humans in this world, it wasn’t until now that I realized I didn’t either. All we knew was each other.
When the bullets flew over our heads and the screams of war erupted again around us, he looked at me one last time and his hand slid down my arm and touched mine. We both felt it then – the pull between us so strong that neither could resist. He pulled me closer to him with a smile on his face, his eyes darting to my lips as if he were planning to kiss them. And before I knew what was happening we were locked together in a passionate embrace and all the pain of our lives disappeared because for just one night we felt whole again.
And then it was over – like everything had been when it all began. We both pulled away from each other, still not blinking. I knew that look now though, as if he were saying goodbye. His hand was still on mine and his eyes spoke more than a million words could ever say. He slowly let go of my hand with one last touch before walking into the crowd of humans who were once our enemies but now we were just two people searching for something to call home in this world that had gone mad.
I watched him disappear into the mass and I didn’t want to let him go, not yet at least. But there was nothing left for me here except pain and suffering, so I turned around and walked away from my newfound friend who would never know how much he meant to me in this life or any other world that might exist beyond our own.
I’m not sure what happened next but suddenly it was just another night where bullets flew over our heads and humans screamed for help. But I guess it doesn’t really matter because that man will always have a special place in my heart even though he never knew me at all. His eyes told me everything and even though we only spent one evening together, their memories will live on forever inside of me.
The two humans stared into each other’s eyes for what seemed like an eternity before finally breaking apart with a sense of mutual understanding that neither would ever be able to explain or describe in words alone..
