 then I got to pick up a dress at the store* Sandra thought to herself.
Her husband was working late again. "Isn't this normal?" she asked herself. She knew he was working late but every time it happened she still felt disappointed. "You shouldn't be so demanding of him," she thought, "he is doing the best that he can." Sandra had made dinner for him but he wasn't there to eat with her. The table was set nicely and the food smelled good.
As soon as Sandra got home she changed into some more comfortable clothes. She planned to relax and watch a movie after all of this craziness. She sat on the couch in front of the television and opened the newspaper. "Ah, nothing important," she thought. *Maybe I should do that before bed.* She said as she picked up her cell phone from where it was lying on top of the small table next to the couch.
Sandra dialed his number. The phone rang once then twice. Then he answered. His voice was slightly scratchy but it did not sound unfamiliar. "Hello," he whispered. Sandra had no idea how to answer back, so she just remained silent for a while. He continued speaking, *Honey, where are you?*
Sandra didn't know what to say. She sat there thinking about the situation. Then it came to her that the only thing she could do was tell him the truth, "I am sitting in front of my television watching your favorite show." After a slight pause she continued, *You aren't on it right now are you?* He laughed nervously, which made Sandra even more suspicious.
"No," he said. His voice sounded very strange and unfamiliar to her, "I am here with a girl. It is her birthday." Then she heard him whisper, *My God! This isn't funny.* She realized that he was nervous because of what she had said to him earlier about going over the two manuscripts for Jane and James for their meeting tomorrow morning.
"What are you saying?" Sandra asked, "You can't be seeing her now." Her husband's voice was growing angrier by each second that passed. He sounded as if he had been drinking, which he wasn't. This was the first time in a very long while that she had heard him like this and it made her even more upset because she knew he would not act this way unless there was something wrong between them.
"I don't believe you," Sandra said as she put down the phone. She sat there for a little bit longer with tears rolling down her cheeks before getting up to go and get ready for bed. *Oh my God,* she thought to herself. This time it wasn't just anger but more like confusion and hurt feelings that were rushing through her head.
When she reached the bathroom she saw that he had left a note on the mirror, "Honey I am sorry." She began crying again when she read it. *He never calls me honey,* Sandra thought. This time it was not anger or confusion but sadness that filled her body and mind as she let out small sobs.
Sandra went back into the living room and sat down on top of the couch once more with her head between her legs and her arms wrapped around herself for comfort. She began to shake and sob harder when suddenly a thought came to her, *Why didn't he just call me?* The thought made sense to her so she went over to pick up the phone again and dialed his number.
This time it rang only twice before he answered, "Honey are you okay?" He asked in what seemed like a very caring voice. Sandra started crying harder than ever as she said, "No." Then she heard him whisper, *I'll be right there.* She listened as the line went dead then sat there for another few minutes before getting up to go and brush her teeth and wash off all of her makeup.
Sandra waited in front of the bathroom mirror with a towel wrapped around herself until she heard his footsteps running down their stairs, "Oh my God," he said as soon as he reached her, "What's wrong?" Sandra didn't answer right away so he continued speaking before taking her into his arms and kissing the top of her head.
She did not say anything back to him until they had gotten ready for bed again then it was only a few more minutes later when she whispered, "I love you." She heard his smile in his voice as he said, *I know.* They laid there together holding each other while listening to the rain outside their windows.
