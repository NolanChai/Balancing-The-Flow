 be dead.
The last thing I need is another one of those.
I watch her go through the doorway and then close it behind her. She has a lot to learn, that's for sure. But she'll get it—eventually.
I don't know where this pod came from, but if we can steer clear of all the dangers in space I intend to figure out how to use its weapons. If I can take down just one of the monsters in here that would be a huge step forward for me and for the crew.
"I hope you don't mind," Captain Coffin says as he pushes through the hatch. He has the pod's controls tucked under his arm like an overnight bag. "I borrowed it from your cabin."
He hands them to me, looking at me expectantly. The captain is a small, skinny man in his late forties with bright blue eyes and a perpetual smile on his face. I've spent enough time around him that I can read the smile even when he isn't making it, but right now all I want to do is grab hold of those controls and launch us out of here as fast as possible.
"That's fine," I say. "Thanks."
I take a step toward him and he takes a half-step backward. It's an automatic reaction. The pod's hatch opens and the captain turns his eyes down to the controls, making sure he's ready for the next time we need to escape.
"You still don't like it in there," I say, moving closer. He takes a quick step back but this time he doesn't look up at me.
"No," he says. "I do not."
The hatch slides shut and then the captain turns around.
"But you've done everything right so far," I say. "You've proven you can handle it."
He looks at me but doesn't answer, just turns away again. I take another step forward and this time he looks up at me, meeting my gaze with his own. He has the kindest eyes I have ever seen. Like his smile, they look happy even when he is not smiling.
"I'm sorry," he says. "It just feels like a death trap."
He reaches out and takes hold of my hand. His fingers are thin and callused with work on the ship. They aren't afraid, and that makes me feel safer than I ever have. The captain has never let go of his fear in all this time and it's made him a stronger person for it.
"I don't blame you," I say. "I just... wish you weren't so scared."
He doesn't answer, he just pulls me toward the hatch with his other hand. We don't go to our cabin this time but instead head down a long corridor that leads through the ship from port to starboard side and ends in another room where a man named Zack is standing at attention.
Zack wears an officer's uniform, though he isn't one of us—he works as an engineer. He is short but broad shouldered with brown skin and black hair that spikes up over his forehead. His eyes are the same dark color as our captain's: happy blue. I like him a lot even if we have never had much to talk about because he does the important work of fixing things around us so we can get from here to whereever we need to be.
"Captain Coffin," Zack says with a nod. He doesn't smile at all, but then again neither do any of our crew members. We're not friends or even casual acquaintances; we are family and that means you can never smile at someone outside the family. Not when you want to survive. "Sir."
The captain holds up the controls he has brought with him.
"I borrowed them from the boy," Captain Coffin says. "If anyone asks, I've been showing him how to use it. He needs more training in space maneuvers."
Zack nods again, but doesn't say anything as we walk past him into another room. We are not going anywhere that is dangerous right now, so this isn't our primary living quarters. It's just a place where I can practice using the controls to steer us away from whatever might be out there in space.
The room looks like any other room on the ship: white walls and floors with gray accents around the doorways. There are only two chairs, one near each of the large windows that run down both sides of this wall. A small table stands between them, holding a glass bowl filled with candy and several metal straws.
"It's too good to be true," Captain Coffin says as he sets the controls on the table in front of me. The chair is facing away from him so I can see the controls but not his face. "You're actually going to get a chance to do some flying."
I look at him and nod, trying to keep my voice calm even though it's difficult. I don't like being out in space for more than five minutes at a time; there is nothing worse than seeing something so huge, so far away that you can barely see the edges of its body. It makes me feel small, like if they were to come close enough we might just disappear into it altogether and be lost forever.
"You're going to do great," Captain Coffin says as he reaches out and gives my shoulder a quick squeeze before turning away again. "And don't worry about what happened with that other ship—I mean, we don't even know if they were dead already." He walks toward the door but then turns back around so his eyes meet mine one last time.
"It's just a pod," he says. "You can do this."
I nod and take a deep breath. The captain is right: it's not like I'm steering a ship of thousands through space, I'm only driving the smallest pod we have left on board our ship after everything else was destroyed by that thing in front of us yesterday evening when we were trying to reach this place called Earth (wherever that even is).
"Ready?" he asks. He walks over toward me but doesn't take his hand off the controls as if they are somehow part of him and he is afraid of what might happen if he ever let go of them for too long, even when talking to someone else about something else entirely unrelated to those particular objects at all times.
"Yeah," I say with a smile as wide and genuine as any that has ever come out my mouth before—or since then either, but we don't talk much in here anyway because there isn't time for it when you have things like death traps lurking around every corner waiting for someone stupid enough to stumble across them by accident without first reading up on exactly what kind of monster it is going to turn out being so they know how best to avoid getting themselves eaten alive while simultaneously being thrown off a cliff into the ocean below because some random guy named Zack told me I could steer away from these things if only he'd let go of those controls long enough for me to find out what buttons do what exactly when all there really should be left here is just three simple levers: one red, one blue and a green one that says "eject" written in big letters above it because no one would ever know how else to press if they didn't already have experience piloting ships through space so why bother adding anything else when nothing matters anyway?
"All right," I say again as he sets the controls on the table in front of me. "Let's go."
He steps back and holds up his arms like he is ready to be thrown off a cliff if that's what needs doing here, which it doesn't because there aren't any cliffs anymore unless we count mountains which we don't because mountains are just hills with more rocks on them. And even then those wouldn't be anywhere near as high or wide enough to make anyone think about throwing themselves off anything except maybe a bridge overpass but that would only happen if you were really desperate for it at which point there wouldn't really be any need because you could just wait until another one came along before trying again.
"All right then," he says as he backs up even farther, so far away from me now that I can barely see his face anymore (but don't worry about that part because we won't talk much either). "Let's get started."
