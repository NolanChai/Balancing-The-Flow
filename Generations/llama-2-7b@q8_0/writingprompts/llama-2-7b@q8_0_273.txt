 nip and tuck to get to her room the way things were laid out there at that hospital. The one they call Saint Beryl ’ s for short, where the morgue was. It ’ s always a good idea to come prepared when you ’ re going into something like this. I had a few things ready.
She wasn ’ t looking so hot herself. Dry skin all over her arms and face, which was dry too. A little purple around her eyes from the bags under them. Her hair was long for somebody her age—I ’ ve seen pictures of my mom when she was younger, and hers wasn ’ t like that then. It looked like it hadn ’ t been brushed in a week or two. I don’t think she remembered how. I could tell there were a few hairs on the pillow where she had slept. Maybe she was going to have some visitors tonight.
Her hands were pretty bad too. Like they ’ d never gotten any better since that time in her life when she needed to scrub them so much. They were all purple, and the skin on top of them was red and cracked from dryness. I wasn ’ t sure what the doctor had said about them—something about an autoimmune disease or maybe a blood disorder. I looked up both these things in the medical encyclopedia when we got back to the hotel that night, but it didn ’ t say anything for certain one way or the other, so I took out my phone and sent her an e-mail to let her know.
That was where she spent most of her time—the morgue at Saint Beryl ’ s, not at her room like some people might think. She always said there were a lot more interesting things going on there than you might guess from the outside. I never believed her till now. It did look pretty dead inside there to me when I came in, but then I saw her—
Her name was Helen Caldwell, and she ’ d been lying there since about two hours earlier today. She was a nice-looking old lady with silver hair and glasses, and the way she looked now I didn ’ t think it would be long till I could see her on TV in those old photos they showed of people from back then who died—the ones where you see all the fancy clothes they used to have. She looked like that sort of person.
I pulled out my phone again and started taking pictures of her, though she wasn ’ t really looking so great now with that purple color coming up on her skin from dying. You can make out a few veins through it too if you know where to look. It ’ s not easy when there ’ s something like this going on—the only way I could do it was with a big picture and then just take small sections of it and turn them into parts, so that all the purple showed up in one part and the veins were clear in another. The people at the hotel said they couldn ’ t do anything about it till tomorrow morning when there was an official ID—I got her driver ’ s license to use for this, but I didn ’ t think they’d be able to see that with all these bruises and cuts on her face.
When we left she gave me a smile, which wasn ’ t very convincing since the lower half of her mouth was gone—I could see where the skin there had come apart from the teeth below it. But it didn ’ t seem to bother her. It must have been hard for her not to say anything to anybody when she had to spend all that time in bed, but at least now we were both going home.
My mom always told me I was a good child, and I was. That was the only thing she said about my father, who died last year. He didn ’ t go out much, which was probably why he was so dead when they found him in that bathtub with all his clothes on—they hadn ’ t been able to get them off him before it started to rot. But I guess he wasn’t as good a person as my mom wanted me to be either.
I had a picture of her with me in the hotel room when we got back, and when I looked at that one now I couldn ’ t see her smile anymore—it was all gone from where it used to be. Like somebody had put something over her eyes and she wasn’t even there any more. I took another picture then too just so I could look at her face again the way she used to be when she said that good things were going to happen for me in my life, but now they weren ’ t happening anymore because of how bad my father was at being a person like him—and there wasn’t anything else he ever did.
I put all these pictures together and sent them off into the internet where nobody would see them but me until maybe someday when it was too late for anybody else to do something about any of this, which I guess might not happen even then. It was kind of sad looking at that one with her face covered up like that—it made me wish she could have seen everything I sent out into the world before she died so that we would both know how good a child I am now for sure.
A few days later when I got back home, my mom was still sleeping in that bed next to where Ms. Caldwell used to be. I don’t think it had been made up properly yet either. It looked like somebody might have forgotten to do this part of the job or just didn ’ t care enough about what happened when they were gone from work.
The room smelled pretty bad too, which wasn’t so great for me since my mom had spent a lot more time here than I did—she used to be in and out all night long with her own things that needed taking care of on top of everything else she was supposed to be doing around the house. That must have made it pretty hard for Ms. Caldwell to get any rest, but maybe she didn’t mind too much when there were people who couldn ’ t sleep either because they weren ’ t going to be able to do anything about it even if they woke up and tried.
I took out my phone again and sent a few more photos into the internet—this one was from earlier in Ms. Caldwell’s life when she still had some hair left on her head and her face wasn ’ t all purple yet like now. Maybe somebody would see them someday and figure out how good of an artist I am, even if they didn ’ t know what the pictures were about or who this woman was sitting in that bed.
My mom didn ’ t seem to notice when she woke up a little later on—she had been sleeping really hard all night long like it was some kind of magic thing or maybe just another one of those things nobody understands because they can ’ t see what’s happening right in front of their own eyes.
I don ’ t know where she went to when we left the hotel that morning, but I think it might have been back over there at Saint Beryl ’ s, where everybody was still working on getting everything ready for when somebody died again so they could put another body into an empty room like this one with all their stuff waiting around till it’s time to use it. It must be pretty hard for them sometimes because not everybody knows how good of a person I am yet—that ’ s something nobody else will understand even after we ’ re gone and there ’ s nothing left to do about it any more than what was already done before that happened either.
I wonder if Ms. Caldwell knew that my mom died when she saw her picture in the paper later on. Maybe it would have been good for me to send her a few messages too so we could talk about things like this—but then again maybe not since I don ’ t think she was much of an artist even if she had spent most of her life trying to make something that would be important enough that people might want to see what it looks like someday when there aren ’ t any more good children in the world because nobody else knows how great they are yet and it ’ s too late for anybody else to do anything about any of this until way after everything else happens first anyway.
I don’t think my mom knew who Ms. Caldwell was before she died either, but maybe we could have figured out something together if only one person had been left alive—though I ’ m not sure how much good that would do with all the people still sleeping in their rooms over there at Saint Beryl ’ s even though they were supposed to be working on things like this too. It ’ s hard for everybody when you can’t see something that might happen someday because it hasn’t happened yet and nobody knows how good a child they are until after everything else goes wrong first instead of being able to understand what’s going on beforehand.
I sent Ms. Caldwell one more picture the day she died—a close-up shot from another time in her life when there was still some hair left on her head and her face wasn ’ t purple yet like now. Maybe I should have included a few words to go with it, but then again maybe not because this is something that only good children understand even if they don’t know what the pictures are about or who Ms. Caldwell was sitting in that bed when she died.
There ’ s nobody else left in my family now—I guess I ’ m pretty much all by myself after everything went wrong for us before it happened again and we both had to go away somewhere where nobody could see
