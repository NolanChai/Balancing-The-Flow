ates me, all I can think of is how much it hurts and how long this agony will go on.
My mind replays an incident from last summer: My family, my husband and two sons, was driving along a desert highway when we heard a thumping noise under the car. We stopped to check out what had happened only to find a dead cow in our front bumper. It took hours to get a tow truck and then it took days for them to figure out how they were going to move it from our vehicle.
My mind replays another incident: Last year at the grocery store, I was shopping for ingredients to cook dinner when I looked over my shoulder into a mirrored shelf display and saw myself in profile. It hit me like an earthquake that I was no longer beautiful—not even pretty—and that I’d never be young again.
My mind replays another incident: When I was 10 years old, I lay awake one night wondering about death. What if God really did exist and he knew everything? If so, then why wasn’t he taking me out of my pain now? I thought of myself in a coffin, covered up with dirt, dead, gone forever, no longer even knowing that I was dead or alive. I felt like I would never know anything again. And the only thing that I could think to pray for was to have somebody hold and comfort me.
As I lay here dying, my thoughts are all on how much it hurts and how long this agony will go on.
They say that what you think about in your last moment is the most important thing in your life. But they’re wrong. What you think about in your first moments of death is the most important thing in your life because at that point, you won’t be able to think again. So what I thought and prayed for as a child, that somebody hold me and comfort me, has been answered with a love and comfort from God himself. And it continues even now, when I am dying.
