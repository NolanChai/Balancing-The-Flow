 One day you feel good about yourself for voting that way, then next day your friends hate you for it, the next day you do n't even know what to think anymore. Sooner or later, the whole thing will be sorted out, and you can go back to being concerned with things that really matter. And you have no idea how stupid you look when you think this.
 
 `` I love him so much, he just doesn ' t care about me at all-'' 
 
 `` You're right, maybe if I had more sex- '' 
 
 `` We'll see what we can do to make your life a living hell - '' 
 
 Round and round the merry-go-round, you might get up there someday.
