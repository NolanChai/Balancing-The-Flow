 boxes were not able to cope with the electromagnetic pulse from the nuclear blast.
But as the years went on, the engineers found out that some of these gadgets where actually able to send messages and receive them after a few minutes. It was also possible to use this technology in a very slow way. The people who dug up these items did so with great care, because they where aware that they could get fined for having these objects as their property.
In the beginning only oldies were able to communicate with their families and friends using this new form of communication, but after some time they found out how to make them work fast enough for a normal conversation. It is still not known who made the first phone call or what they talked about. But there are some clues.
Many people have kept their old smartphone as a collectors item and also to remember the good old days, but no one has managed to find out how this technology works yet. The best guess so far is that it uses something called a tachyon transmitter, which was supposed to be used for fast communication between two parties, but never made it into use.
There are many theories about why this happened and what the purpose of these machines where, but none of them has been proven yet. But there is one thing that is sure: If you find a smartphone with tachyon technology on it, then you will get quite a lot of money for selling it to someone who wants it as a collectors item or something similar.
So if you are looking for such an object in the near future, then here's what you should do: Go out and dig up some old phones!
