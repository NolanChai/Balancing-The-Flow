"You're going the wrong way," came a voice from behind me.
I stopped dead in my tracks. This was not a good place for this. Whoever it is has an advantage. If they wanted to harm me I could n't fight back and run. "Who are you?" I said as calmly as possible, knowing that if someone was here, he did n't want to talk.
"You can come with me." He said, "If not, the next time you try to cross this path you will end up dead." And then he ran off.
