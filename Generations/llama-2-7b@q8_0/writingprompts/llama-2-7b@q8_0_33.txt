ethe family home in Hickory Ridge and said, "Okay, here's how you get a girlfriend."
"Here goes," I said, expecting some sort of manual.
"All right, this is what you do. You look for a girl who has three things on her side. One: she should have good manners; two: she should be pretty—and here's the thing to remember about beauty in general: it's not how much makeup she wears that matters. It's whether or not she wears any at all, because it's better for her to look like a natural than an actress. Three: she should have something in common with you."
I was listening, and nodding as he talked. "Okay, so what do I do now?"
"Well," my dad said, smiling, "it depends on how you know the girl. If it's through school or church or something, you can be a little more direct; just ask her out." He laughed. "If that doesn't work, there are other ways to get a date with someone who doesn't like you back."
"Like what?" I said.
"Well," he started, and then stopped. "Look, if she likes you, it won't matter. She'll say yes—but if she doesn't, you have to be creative." He leaned in close and whispered, like a man would when talking about a secret.
"Like how?" I said.
My dad grinned again, but I was already thinking of something. It wasn't my first date by any stretch—but it was the most interesting one I ever went on.
My parents had always been fairly open-minded with regards to romantic relationships: they were cool if you had a girlfriend in high school or college; as long as you weren't living together, and were acting like adults, that is. My mom would even bake cupcakes for us when we got back from dates!
This was the first time I ever dated someone who wasn't Jewish—and it was a bit of an issue between my parents and me as to what I should do about her. Her name was Mara, she was half-Southern (though she lived in Georgia most of her life) and half-Asian (half-Cambodian).
The first time I saw her, I knew right away that there was something different about her—not just physically, but her mindset. She didn't talk like anyone else; she had a way of describing things that made me want to listen more and ask questions. It was all very foreign for someone who had grown up in an environment where people spoke the same language with the same mannerisms.
When I first started talking to her, I noticed a distinct difference between our personalities: I'm a man who likes to joke around a lot—and she just didn't take it as well. For her, humor was something that wasn't meant for people like us and not meant to be taken too seriously; but for me, it was something to lighten the mood during times of stress or confusion.
Despite this difference, we got along very well—and one night after dinner, she asked if I wanted to take a walk outside with her before going back inside for dessert and coffee (yes!). So we went out onto our balcony, where it was nice and cool at night; she had brought some wine that she liked to drink every so often but not too often because of its high alcohol content.
When we got up there, though, I noticed something: on her back were two long cuts from head-to-toe—and when I asked about it later after dessert, she said that someone had done that to her before and told me how much they loved my hair (I'm a redhead). She then asked if anyone had ever hurt me like that; which made me uncomfortable because it made sense at first but then didn't when I thought about what happened afterwards.
So we talked more until midnight came around, and then went back into our room where we shared one last kiss goodnight before going off to bed (this time without any alcohol involved). The next day was Sunday morning; after breakfast with my parents who were still sleeping peacefully at home, I left for work with Mara in tow.
In the weeks that followed—and months too come to think of it!—we went on many more dates together; some at our apartment building while others took place elsewhere in town or even out-of-town sometimes. She would always bring her books along (she's an English major) which I liked because I could read them during my lunch break or after work when I had time before going home to rest for dinner with family members who weren't around yet due to having gone out themselves earlier in the day without me knowing until now...but anyway!
All these dates were fun—and she was a lot of fun too but not exactly my type either (she doesn't drink alcohol). She's sweet and kind-hearted though which makes up for this lack of similarity between us two; I just don't think we could ever be more than friends or casual lovers because that would involve me living somewhere else from here so as not to get caught by anyone else who might find out about our relationship if they saw something online like Facebook posts talking about how much fun we had together after work.
It's been almost a year since then and I haven't spoken with her at all; she left for school early on last fall and hasn't come back here yet though there is still time before summer ends so who knows if we might bump into each other somewhere between now until then? It'd be nice to see someone from my past again but that might not happen either way.
My name is Cathy, I am 15 years old and have been dating the same guy for about a month now! My parents are very open-minded when it comes down to relationships (I'm Jewish) and they let me do whatever I want as long as he doesn't hurt me in any way shape or form which isn't too hard because we never fight with each other over anything major so far.
One day before school started again this year though my parents asked us both what our plans were for the upcoming fall semester; after hearing about how much I enjoyed being out of class all summer long (which was true) they suggested that maybe we should try taking some classes together at a local college since we have similar interests like literature and writing poetry etcetera. So after talking things over with each other afterwards it sounded like a good idea so we decided to go ahead with the plan; I'm not sure if this means anything but at least they aren't mad that I dated him before going back into high school!
The first class was pretty boring since it focused more on theory than practice but after two weeks or so things got better when we started reading poems together during lunch break; he really knows how to make them sound good too which is why I keep coming back every week despite having other things going on at home (like sports).
So far nothing has changed between us apart from our relationship getting stronger because of the fact that now we spend almost all of our time together after school until dinnertime; this might not seem like much but it means so much more when you consider how little we see each other throughout the day normally speaking.
