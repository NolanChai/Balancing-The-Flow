! '' he was shouting when they pulled him away by his collar. 
 
 `` The *only* thing that can be said in favor of Humanity's Guiding Species is the fact that it has not yet been tried out,'' the Chairman shouted at those around him as he struggled against them. They finally prevailed and dragged him into a back room where they held him down on a table and bound him tightly in chains. 
 
 `` We have to be *very* careful about this,'' the Committee Chairman was told by those who'd brought him there. It was not until he had been bound that he recognized it as a torture chamber. 
 
 They didn't even wait for him to recover from his shock. They shoved a heavy metal coil in front of his nose and he was soon unconscious. 
 
 When the Committee Chairman awoke, he found himself strapped onto a table with an oxygen mask on his face and wires attached to several parts of him, including both his arms and legs. The room around him seemed more like a hospital than torture chamber. He looked around for someone and saw that a large number of people were watching him from the other side of a glass wall. Some of them were holding clipboards on which they had written down what he was doing. 
 
 `` We'll let you go now,'' said one of those on the other side, when he noticed that he was staring at them. He pulled off his mask and got up. He began to walk around the room. Whenever he touched something or moved an object, it made a sound which was transmitted through speakers. There were several people standing there with clipboards, waiting for him. 
 
 `` The most important thing we want you to know,'' said one of them, `` is that this will not work.'' They'd put up signs around the room saying that he should just get started already. It was hard for anyone watching to believe that Humanity had a Guiding Species. 
 
 He walked over to the far side of the room and sat down. Then he pulled off his shoes, rolled up his sleeves and put on his headphones. They were made up of a dozen different speakers which had been wired to various parts of his body. He could hear himself breathe through them. 
 
 `` You can't even hear yourself breathe when you have those on,'' said someone from the other side. He put back on the oxygen mask and tried again. After a while he was able to do so without thinking about it but that wasn't much help either since he could still only hear himself breathing. 
 
 They had him sit at one end of a large room with no walls. At the other end there were three people sitting in front of computers and two more standing near them, watching closely as they typed away. The Committee Chairman was wearing a pair of headphones and a wired oxygen mask. He tried to get up but he couldn't move his arms or legs so he sat back down again. 
 
 They started off by having him hold a series of objects in each hand at once: a cup, spoon, pen and pencil; a sponge, towel and rag; a comb, brush and toothbrush; then some books and papers. The Committee Chairman was not very good at this but he got better as time went on. After that they had him do arithmetic problems in his head while listening for sounds in the room around him: the sound of chairs moving around or being pushed away from tables, people walking by or sitting down, things being dropped to the floor and other noises like that. The problem was that he didn't know what these sounds meant so when they finally told him which ones were important he couldn't do anything about them without knowing how many were there in total and where each one came from. 
 
 They had him write down numbers, letters and words while listening for things going on around him: the sound of paper rustling or a pen scribbling across it; someone speaking aloud; footsteps walking by; coughing, sneezing or burping; etcetera. They made sure that he knew which sounds were important so when he finally got to writing down words they could tell him exactly what each one meant and even make suggestions as to how many letters it should have in order for them to be correct. 
 
 It wasn't long before the Committee Chairman was able to write down entire sentences just by listening without being told what they were about or how many words they had. He could tell what each letter stood for and where each one fell on his page based solely upon hearing them spoken aloud, knowing which sounds were important in terms of whether they represented individual letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9) or punctuation marks (periods). 
 
 He was soon able to write entire pages without having to look at anything but he still couldn't see the words themselves. They had him hold up his book and read it aloud while they typed away at their computers. Sometimes he would misspell things or forget how certain letters were pronounced, even though he could recognize each one as soon as it was said. 
 
 He didn't think he could do any more but then someone suggested that maybe if he wore the headphones all night long while sleeping they might be able to tell what kind of dreams he had during those times when he wasn't aware enough to write them down or remember anything about them later. 
 
 It turned out that this was true, at least in part; he did indeed have some very vivid and detailed memories from those periods which were not recorded because they occurred while he was asleep. They also found out through one such experience (during a dream) that humans can recognize different kinds of emotions even though they may not be consciously aware of doing so. 
 
 This discovery led them to believe that maybe human beings have Guiding Species after all; if their senses are capable of telling them how something feels then surely there must also be some kind of physical reaction taking place within the body when we experience those kinds feelings, like happiness or sadness. If so then perhaps there should indeed exist a species with an instinct for this sort of thing; one that would know what each individual was feeling just by being around them long enough to study their behavior closely without having any knowledge about them at all beforehand (or even during). 
 
 The Committee Chairman found himself wondering if this could really be true. He had never seen a Guiding Species before but it didn't seem impossible to believe that one existed somewhere out there in the world; maybe somewhere near Earth where he would eventually be able to find them and study their behavior so as not only learn what they do but also how best approach them when doing so was safe for everyone involved. 
 
 After a while, however, this idea began to fade away from his mind because it wasn't much use now that he had no idea where these creatures might live; there were millions upon millions of stars out in space and if anything like an alien species existed anywhere near Earth then surely they must have been found by now. 
 
 He felt sad about this but decided not to give up hope quite yet. There were still plenty more ways for him to figure out whether or not Humans truly had a Guiding Species which he could use if he was willing to do some research into it; if only he had the time needed in order to make such discoveries... 
 
 `` I know you're bored right now,'' said one of them as she walked over to where he sat and looked down at him from above. He nodded his head in agreement. It had been almost three days since he arrived here but so far there were no signs that anything would happen soon enough for this meeting with her father; if only they could somehow speed things up a bit then maybe he'd be able to leave before too long! 
 
 `` I have something that might interest you,'' she said as she sat down next to him and reached out towards his head. He put on the glasses which had been placed there by someone earlier in this day (he couldn't tell who) so he could see what was going on around him better without needing any additional light sources; then waited while she fiddled with some kind of device inside her pocket for several minutes before removing it from its hiding spot and putting it down near them both where they sat together watching each other do nothing at all for now. 
 
 `` This is how we communicate through sound waves instead of using speech or hand signals,'' she explained once she had finished taking out the object in question; then held up a small black box so he could see what was inside before turning it around again to show him that it actually worked. He watched as she pressed down on one end while holding onto another part with her other hand; then heard something rumble away somewhere far beyond his reach where no humans would ever go without being killed instantly by whatever lay beyond them... 
 
 The Committee Chairman was sitting at a desk, typing up notes about the events of this day as fast as he could while looking over their shoulders and watching them type. He didn't know what they were writing down or why but he thought it might be helpful if someone else knew what happened here today too so maybe someday someone would read these words somewhere down the road when everything
