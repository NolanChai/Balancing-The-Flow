ingled with my own air was that of someone else. And it wasn't mine.
I looked around to find out where I was in that space. I saw the back wall and ceiling and floor, and suddenly realized that it was me who had died. Someone had been breathing for me. My chest hurt with every breath now. I felt my own hand moving forward to take off a mask from someone's face. A female voice said, `` We have a 23 year old male,'' and then she said, `` 10-4'', and the tone of her voice was matter of fact. She looked up at me as I removed my mask, and with a smile on her face she said, `` You are awake''.
The room seemed familiar to me as I looked around. There were a lot of medical equipment on that table. And on that table next to it was a man, maybe 45-50 years old, who was still covered in foam from the mask he was wearing earlier when he saved my life. He looked at me with his own eyes for the first time and said, `` I think you need to be moved''.
I saw him take off a white shirt that had stains of blood on it, and put it on the floor next to where I was standing. It was then that I realized how much I had needed him to save my life. As he started walking towards me, I began thinking of everything I should say when we finally met each other for the first time in real life.
I walked down to his side and extended my hand. He looked at it with a confused expression on his face, and then said, `` Oh! Sorry''. He didn't shake hands with me though. He took both of his hands and pressed them firmly together as he put them underneath his chin. I tried to smile but was unable to do so for some reason.
I asked him, `` Did you die?'' in a voice that was too loud to be considered normal. It sounded like the way it had been when I heard my father screaming at me from behind as I ran away from home in an effort to never see him again. But this time I didn't want to run away.
He said, `` Yes'' and then he paused for a moment before adding, `` Are you going to die?''
I was already wondering when my life would end next after hearing those words. That sounded like something that only happened in movies and not in real life. But then I realized that this man was also alive because someone saved his own life in a similar way. So there must be some truth behind what he said to me earlier, or at least it seemed so based on the fact that he had been lying on my hospital bed only hours before, when we both thought our lives were about to end.
I tried to smile again but failed once more. It's not that I don't like smiling, it's just that this time it felt awkward for me to do so. After all, he was the one who saved my life without even knowing me beforehand. And now I am the only one alive among all three of us, while both of them are dead now because they didn't survive their wounds caused by gunfire at close range during a shootout between gangs in downtown LA two days ago.
The next thing that happened was something unexpected. As soon as I walked away from him and started heading towards my room where doctors were treating me for severe trauma injuries sustained by being shot twice, he suddenly called out to stop me before disappearing through a doorway behind the nurse's station with her following closely behind him without even turning around.
When I got inside again after walking through that same doorway, there was nobody else present except for one doctor who had been monitoring my condition since arriving at this hospital earlier today as well as three police officers assigned to guard me because of threats made against both my life and those of everyone else involved in the case which is now being investigated by LAPD detectives after several witnesses came forward with information about what happened during that shootout.
I looked over at them while sitting down on a chair near where they were standing around me but before any questions could come out from my mouth, I heard someone walking up behind us and saying `` You guys need to leave this area now''.
