 I'm scared. 
 I know there are no guarantees with these things but it was just too much. Too much for anyone to deal with, 
 and i think that's why i feel so unprepared for what is happening now. I never thought of myself as 
 someone who would do anything rash or stupid. 
 I don't know if you're still out there, 
 but i feel like i have to talk to you. I need you to hear me. 
 I need help. 
I think my brain has turned against me. I can't focus on any one thing for more than a few seconds at 
 a time and i can't stop thinking about the worst possible scenarios. It feels like a terrible, dark 
 part of me is taking over. And it isn't just that I'm scared, it's also that i don't know who to talk 
 to about this. 
 I know you're not someone who will listen to me now, but i have to try. 
 Maybe if you hear how crazy things are for me right now, you won't be so quick to judge the rest of us. 
 If I don't get help soon, it could end badly. I can feel it coming already and i just need something 
 to focus on that isn't my own mind or thoughts about what will happen when i break. 
I guess what i'm saying is, you were right. We are all crazy. 
 Just maybe not in the way you meant. 
 Thank you for everything and please don't judge me if it doesn't sound like a goodbye.
It feels more like one of my regular thoughts now, even though i'm scared to say it out loud. 
 I hope there will be someone here who can help me when this is all over. 
 And whoever that person is, they better bring their best. 
 Sincerely,
Alice
