 ca n't play chess with the King and Queen anymore? You know, that 's funny because there are so many games that one could play that would involve not just playing chess, but the whole board too, but no, I do n't want to die yet.'"
He waved his hand at the room. "I would n't mind taking a turn on this contraption here, if only to have a laugh at your expense. But I do n't think it would be amusing enough for me to waste my life waiting on it." The man shook his head.
"Your death is coming, human. You ca n't escape from it any longer than you can escape from the stars in the sky. What are you afraid of? The inevitability of your passing?"
The doctor did not answer right away. He was still studying the device. "You have been gone for a while now," he said at last, his eyes never leaving the contraption on the bedside table. "Are you saying that when I am dead, if only my body is, and if that body could communicate with this machine, it would be able to convey its state of mind? It 's been an interesting experiment so far, but I do n't think I can tell yet."
The man chuckled. "Your state of mind will not change until you die." He reached for his glass and took a sip of water from it. "I am here to see if this machine is able to record the thoughts and emotions of the mind, in order to establish whether it is indeed a consciousness which inhabits man's body, or whether it is only the body, without any awareness on its own part."
He paused, as though considering how much more he could say. The doctor looked up at him, and after a moment nodded his head. "I see your point," he said. "That would be an interesting study." He turned back to look at the machine, which was now off but still hooked up to a monitor. "And this is what I should do while I am here?"
The man laughed again and put down his glass. He took a deep breath before answering the doctor's question, then said, "I would recommend against it."
"You might not find my answer as funny," he explained, "but I do n't think you 'll have much luck here. There are things we cannot measure, and even if there were a way to quantify them in terms of electricity or magnetism, there is no way we could ever get inside the mind. You might be able to understand the brain waves generated by your thought process, but that is different from understanding what you are thinking. This machine is designed to record a person's thoughts and feelings; it does not analyze them." He laughed again.
The doctor was getting irritated at this point. "Well then," he said angrily, "what are we going to do? Let him die of dehydration? Just leave us in peace?"
The man shook his head and sat down on the edge of the bed next to the doctor. He picked up the water glass again but did not drink from it; instead he held it in front of him as though it were a talisman, which he believed would protect him against any ill fortune that might befall him during their conversation.
"No," he said slowly at last, "I do n't think you should let him die." He put the glass down on the table next to the machine and looked back at the doctor who was still sitting on his stool in front of it. "I do not believe that human beings are mere automatons; that they only exist because we say so, or because there is a God watching over them, or any other such nonsense."
The doctor did not reply immediately, but when he did speak again he was no longer angry with the man. Instead his voice had become gentle and soft, like a mother speaking to her child for comfort. "I agree," he said in a hushed tone of voice.
"I know this is hard to accept at first; it goes against everything we are taught from birth." He paused again as though considering what he should say next; then after a few moments added, "But I think you would do well to reconsider your views on the matter."
The doctor nodded his head and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Perhaps," he said at last, "there is no such thing as free will." He paused again before continuing in a more confident voice: "If there is no such thing then why should I care about my actions? Why should I even want to live?"
"Because you are human," replied the man. "You have a brain and a heart, and that makes all the difference; it gives you choices." He took another sip of water from his glass and looked up at the ceiling for a moment before continuing with his explanation: "The reason why we care about our actions is because of how they affect other people. You can not live your life according to what you want, without considering how it will impact those around you." He paused again but this time did not stop talking; instead he seemed energized by what he was saying and went on with great force: "And that brings us back to where we started! It is our responsibility as human beings to protect each other. We have to do everything in our power to make sure everyone has food and shelter."
The doctor stared at the man for a long moment before finally speaking again. When he did, his words were softer than before but no less important: "That's an interesting way of looking at it." He paused once more before adding, "It seems like we are not that different after all."
The man smiled and nodded in agreement as the doctor spoke. It was becoming clear now that they had found common ground between their beliefs on free will. The doctor took another sip from his glass of water; he could feel a bit thirstier but at least it showed that he was listening closely to everything the man said. "So we are both wrong?" asked the doctor, who was now staring intently into the glass in his hands.
"It is hard to say," replied the man after a moment of silence. He then leaned forward and placed the water on top of the machine before speaking again: "But I do think it is possible that we are both wrong."
