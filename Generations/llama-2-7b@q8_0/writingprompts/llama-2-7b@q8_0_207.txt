 young man in the same way that one might notice a bird – beautiful in flight.
I was not one to judge people by their outward appearance – if you do this, you are missing the essence of life’s beauty and splendour. But when I saw him that morning on my first day in New York, I noticed he had the most exquisite eyes. His skin was golden brown, his lips were plump, his teeth white as fresh milk – but it was the depth of his eyes that caught me.
The elevator opened and I got on to join him. He did not say a word, instead turned around and pressed ‘7’. With all the grace of a ballerina, he stepped out with the speed of a bullet, leaving only an enigmatic smile behind.
For the next six months, we ran into each other on different floors of different buildings every single day, but still neither of us spoke. I would see him looking at me with those deep, brown eyes, and I knew he was as taken by my beauty as I was by his. We never spoke, because words were not necessary to communicate our feelings for one another.
One night, just as we had finished dinner, the elevator opened on floor 37 – the top floor of my hotel. The young man was waiting there and he smiled at me, holding out a single rose. I walked over to him and took it from his hands.
He didn’t need any words or signs – just that smile was all it had taken for us both to understand that our feelings were mutual. It was time to tell each other what we thought of one another.
The following morning, after a breakfast of croissants and orange juice, he came over to my table, took the rose from me and placed it on top of an open copy of ‘Love in Times Square’ that I had been reading all week. He looked at me and smiled with his eyes as wide as sunflowers – and then kissed me gently.
And so began the most wonderful relationship either one of us ever knew, full of love and devotion, adventures and fun, laughter and joy. We spent every second of every day together for almost two years, before he returned to his home in Warsaw where I had come from. We were not apart long when the elevator doors opened again and we stepped inside – just as they always had.
He leaned over towards me with a single rose in his hand. He pressed 18, the top floor of my hotel, and smiled at me before pressing ‘5’. I couldn’t tell you what happened next, because it was such an indescribably beautiful sight that all I could do was close my eyes.
I opened them again to see him standing in front of me, but this time there was a second smile on his lips – not quite the same one as before, which had been so pure and full of love; now, he looked sad.
‘Oh no,’ I said. ‘What’s happened? Tell me.’
But he didn’t say anything at all – instead he reached out to me with that single rose in his hand, and kissed me once again before leaving the elevator.
I waited on floor 18 for hours, but he never returned. I have never found a more beautiful man than him; nor do I think I ever will.
