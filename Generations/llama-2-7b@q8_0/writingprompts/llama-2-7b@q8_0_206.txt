 I tried pulling myself up but couldn't find any place to grab onto with both hands. I looked back over my shoulder and saw a man standing there waiting for me. He seemed to have known that I was going to be at the top of this cliff side when he arrived, but I don't think it bothered him in the least bit. I didn't really know what to do at first so I just stood there wondering if I should run away and leave this place or try to make a friend of my situation by talking to the man. I decided that it would be best to talk with the man, but I couldn't understand him as he wasn't saying anything at all. I guess he could not speak English either because I was still in shock from what had happened and just stared at him for a few more seconds before I spoke. "Hello there," I finally said, looking to see if my words were going to have any affect on the man. He responded with his own greeting as well that sounded like something close to my name but was very different from what my name really is.
After hearing him say a word similar to my name in a foreign language I felt an overwhelming need to help this stranger even if I didn't understand him at all. I tried again, "Hello there," and this time the man said, "Hello there!" back to me in English and with his hands outstretched. He seemed really happy to be here but then again he was probably happy about anything since he had just crash-landed a plane on an unknown island that wasn't even listed on any map I ever owned or knew about. I shook his hand as we both stood there, looking around in silence, trying to see if anyone else was coming our way. We finally broke the silence and started talking about where we were from and who had brought us here. The man told me that he was a scientist on an expedition looking for rare gems in caves below sea level when his plane ran out of gas and crash-landed on this island instead. I told him that I just came off a plane to visit my sister after being away from her for some time and then we both sat down against the side of the cliff while waiting for any sign of help or rescue coming our way.
After about 15 minutes sitting in silence listening to waves crash on the beach below us, I finally decided that it was time for me to tell my new friend about what had happened before landing on this island and he told me all about how his plane ran out of gas during flight when there was no place else left to land except right where we were sitting now. We then began discussing how both our planes crashed within a couple hundred feet from each other while trying to find a way off the island with no tools or supplies to help us do so. The next thing I knew, it was dark outside and my new friend and I went inside his tent where we both fell asleep on our sleeping bags without any concern for what might happen if either of us woke up alone in this place later that night.
