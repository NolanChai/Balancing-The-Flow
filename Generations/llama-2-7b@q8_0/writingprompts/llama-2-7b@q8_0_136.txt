 **Revelation 12** :9  

This is what we are looking at today.... the old serpent being cast out of Heaven. And as he falls to the earth he brings with him a third of the Angels, who were his minions in heaven... and it is these who are also cast down along with Satan himself.. 
 
 
 
 The dragon was enraged at this man,  
 who called on God's people to be faithful  
 even though they were being persecuted.  
 So he attacked them with angry words and by hurting the earth. He was afraid that they would become strong like his children, so he kept them from growing up. He is a liar, and the Father of lies! He is the one who caused the first man to fall into sin. The people who live on the earth made this evil one their god. They worship him and follow all that he does. This has been going on for a long time.
 
 
 
 Satan was furious with the people  
 who had given over their faith  
 in God's kingdom to be killed.  
 So he attacked them, by making war on his children  
 and on those living on earth. He did this because of jealousy.  
 He knew that they were going to grow stronger  
 than all his people, and he was afraid that they would become God's children too. Because of this fear,  
 he kept them from growing up into what their Father had made them.  
 He is a liar!  
 And the father of lies!  
 He used to be called Lucifer, which means "the light-bearer."   
 For many years now, people have been saying that this man was God's enemy and that he caused the first human being to sin. They worshiped him as their god. That is what has happened since the beginning of time!

 People who had been marked with a sign of God's name were killed all over the world. ''
