 g about it tomorrow, but I 'm going to go ahead and tell ya now that the phrase `` safe '' is actually not a term used in regards to theft insurance, rather it means something along the lines of `` secure'' or `` protected.''
The definition given from Wikipedia (a great site b y the way) is: "In English law, a safe comprises a lockable box to hold valuables that may be attacked by fire, water damage, forced entry, and similar dangers. This sort of safe is called a ''safe deposit box'' if it is available from a bank or other financial institution."
I don't know about you but the term `` fire '' really freaked me out because I 'm not sure I would feel too secure with my valuables in a lock box when there is such a thing as arsonists. Then again, what can ya do?
The phrase comes from the 18th century and was used by an English writer named John Byrom: "There's many a slip between the cup and the lip / There 's many a safe 'tis unsafe to keep," in his book Cursory Observations on Several of Mr. Pope's Poems, which is exactly what this phrase means. It was then picked up by Samuel Johnson as one of the 100 Greatest Proverbs.
So there you have it folks. I hope that next time some one says to me `` You know what this phrase means '' that I will be able to give a proper answer and not get all freaked out like I did the first time around.
