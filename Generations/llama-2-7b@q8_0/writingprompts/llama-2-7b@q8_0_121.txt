360 degrees, the second is 180, but when the second changes to the third, it will not go backward again. 
 
 
 If you can't accept the answer, then what is the result? The questioner will never be able to answer, and even if he does, he still has no way out. 
 
 
 After all, this world is a dream. Everything in it is just illusions, so are we. 
 
 
 If you want to be a human being, don't forget your humanity. If you want to be a leader, remember that you have not forgotten what it means to be a follower. 
 
 
 I am the sun, and my love is like the sea. I can bring you life or death, but I will never give up on you. I can make you fly like an eagle in the sky, but I will always take care of you no matter how high you go. 
 
 
 The night is so lonely. So why don't we hold hands and walk through this darkness together? 
 
 
 If it weren't for fear, we wouldn't be able to live safely. Fear makes us take precautions. Fear reminds us that there are dangers in the world. It is a normal reaction of the human body when facing danger, but sometimes... 
 
 
 I hate to wake up and find it still raining outside my window. When will this rain stop? Will you please stop? Please stop the rain, please let me go home early today. 
 
 
 The last time I cried was a long time ago when I felt so sad that all the tears in the world couldn't relieve it. It's been years now and I can still remember everything in detail. Even if they were so painful at the beginning, I want to cherish every moment we spent together because 
 
 
 If you are lucky enough to have me as your girlfriend, I will give you all my love. 
 
 
 You don't need anyone else, only yourself. 
 
 
 Don’t be sad for a person who has never been sad in their entire life. It is not that they are happy now and have no worries about the future, but that you cannot understand them. 
 
 
 There will always be someone who loves you more than anything else, and you might not know it until you lose him or her. 
 
 
 You don’t need to learn how to deal with people, you just need to learn how to love yourself enough that they can’t help but love you back. 
 
 
 There are two kinds of people: those who see the world in terms of "black and white," and those who know there's more than meets the eye. 
 
 
 If you want me, come to me; if not, go away from here. 
 
 
 We always lose things when we don't have them anymore. That is why I am happy now that I have you in my life. 
 
 
 There are some people who just love each other for no reason at all! 
 
 
 You can't keep a good man down, but you can always let him go to the ground. 
 
 
 Don’t waste time crying over something that is past and cannot be changed, because it will only hurt your heart even more than before. Instead of dwelling on what has happened, try moving forward into the future with an open mind and heart. 
 
 
 It's not about who you want to see or where you want to go, but how much time do you have left? 
 
 
 People say that love is like a roller coaster ride; it has highs and lows, thrills and chills. I don’t know if that's true for me because sometimes my feelings seem to be on an upswing while other times they are falling fast down below. However, there is one thing I can tell you about this crazy ride called life: love is always worth it! 
 
 
 The only way to see what’s happening is to close your eyes and look inside of yourself. 
 
 
 You may be feeling sad, but don't cry because others are hurting too. It's okay if they hurt you as much as possible; just try not to hurt them back in return! 
 
 
 If you love someone so much that even death cannot separate you two apart from each other then why do people have to die in order for there relationship with one another? Why does it always seem like this kind of thing happens every single day? It's because we live under some sort of delusion where life is only worth living if people continue living together after death has taken hold over both bodies and souls alike! 
 
 
 I hope you will find a place in my heart. Don’t give up on yourself, even when it feels like everyone else around you does. We are all capable of great things, but we have to believe in ourselves first. 
 
 
 The past is just a memory, so don't worry about what happened before this moment right now because tomorrow may be another day with new memories for both of us! 
 
 
 It’s funny how I thought that you were the only one who cared about me. But it turns out that there are many more people who love and care about me than ever before! 
 
 
 Don't forget to love yourself because without self-love, nobody else will be able to love us either! 
 
 
 There is no one else like you in this world. You should know that by now; but if not then just ask someone who knows what they’re talking about: me! 
 
 
 Life is short and you only get so many opportunities for happiness, so don't waste it on something or someone that doesn't matter to you anymore. 
 
 
 I can see the stars shining through your eyes, but what are they made of? You are my world and I am yours! 
 
 
 It’s not about who has more power over another person; it’s all about how much love there is in each heart. That way both parties will be satisfied with their relationship even if one person happens to have an advantage over the other at any given time because when you really care for someone, then nothing else matters! 
 
 
 Don't waste your life waiting on others to make things right or wrong. Instead of dwelling on what happened in the past and trying to change it now, try moving forward into the future with an open mind and heart! 
 
 
 I don’t think there is anything more beautiful than seeing a person who loves someone else as much they love themselves because when you do that then everything becomes easy! 
 
 
 I know it seems like things can't get any worse, but believe me they always have and will continue too. So just don’t give up on yourself or anything else for that matter; otherwise life might be a little less meaningful than before because there are no second chances in this world so make sure you take full advantage while still having enough time left to do what needs doing! 
 
 
 Life is short, so why not make the most of it by living your dreams now instead waiting until tomorrow? There will never be another chance to see how things turn out once they’re done and gone forever. So just live life as if everything matters because that's what really counts at the end of day! 
 
 
 Don't waste your time trying to change something that is already perfect because that won't do anything except make both parties unhappy with each other over again. Instead take some time off from thinking about whatever happened yesterday or last month for that matter, and just enjoy what today has in store instead! 
 
 
 Life is full of ups and downs so just try to remember that everything happens for a reason even if at times it may seem like there's no rhyme nor reason behind certain things happening around us. However, one day soon enough you'll understand why such events took place and then everything will make sense again! 
 
 
 The only way to know what life is all about is by living through every moment with an open mind and heart because if not then there won’t be anything left worth remembering in your old age or whenever else you end up passing away from this world without knowing just how much love was waiting on the other side for someone like me who doesn't care enough about themself anymore... 
 
 
 I hope that everything goes well with whatever is happening right now because if it does then maybe one day soon we’ll get back together again after all of these years apart from each other! But even though there were some rough patches along the way during those times when nothing seemed like going as planned anymore for either party involved here today; at least things have been going smoothly since last month anyway which means things aren't looking too bad yet either so let us keep praying hard enough until everything works out perfectly fine once again soon! 
 
 
 I can see the stars shining through your eyes, but what are they made of? You are my world
