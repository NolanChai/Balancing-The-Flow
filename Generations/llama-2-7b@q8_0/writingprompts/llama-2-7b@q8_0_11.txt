aller and less chubby. I clear my throat again and lean against the wall to the right of his couch, hoping I can take up as little space as possible so he won't feel overwhelmed by a tiny girl. `` Uh... yeah, I guess '' He says. His eyes are dull and distant. He stares at some point just above my head. It's not the look of a man who wants to be near me; it's the look of a man who wants to be somewhere else. `` What do you wanna play? '' I ask, trying to be as non-threatening as possible. He lifts his head and stares at my face for about five seconds before answering, ``...uh...'' And then he fidgets around the room, rubbing his thumbs across each other with a bit of intensity and shifts from side to side like an adolescent cat in heat. I sigh. `` How 'bout a game of chess? '' He blinks and stares at me again for five seconds before he says, `` Yeah... that'd be cool.'' We go into the kitchen and he pulls out a board from underneath his bed. He fidgets with it for about three minutes, before finally saying `` I guess... you should sit down?'' He hands it to me without looking at my face. I don't even know if he remembers what position I am in right now and I really, really, want to make a good impression so I quickly move off the wall to the left of him (where there is enough room for us both) and sit on the floor across from the couch. I hope it isn't too soon that he doesn't look at me. `` How do you wanna start? '' I ask, trying my best not to sound like a dork. He nods and picks up his own chessboard. Before either one of us make the first move, I glance at his face for about five seconds. His eyes are still vacant, staring at something only he can see. `` So... you're playing me '' I say with a questioning look on my face and point at both boards. He nods again. It takes me by surprise. `` Why?'' I ask, making sure to sound genuinely curious. For the first time since meeting him, he looks up from his board and stares directly into my eyes as if he were seeing them for the very first time. His smile is unrecognizable, but he seems to like it. It's a little unnerving. `` I wanted to play someone who wasn't gonna try to make me laugh or talk about anything stupid '' He says. `` That was kinda rude'' I say, feeling my cheeks flush slightly and then my entire face. I feel like a dork again. `` Oh, I didn't mean it that way... '' he mumbles, but it's too late for him to save face. `` Well... sorry. But what were you gonna do?'' He asks me with a small smile and moves his king. I smile back, a little bit happier. His eyes are still looking at something else, but I think he likes my company. That makes me happy too. We play chess for a couple of hours (and lose both games). And during that time, our conversation is minimal. But even though we don't talk much, I feel like his silence says more than any words could. After the game, we both decide to go watch an old movie on Netflix instead and then take a nap until dinner. It was my first time in a friend's house as a guest (besides my roommate) since I moved into the city a month ago and it was pretty comfortable. We went out to eat at some trendy new restaurant downtown and it was delicious. There were about 30 other people eating dinner there, but we sat in our own little corner and enjoyed ourselves. The food was good, the atmosphere wasn't too crowded and we got along well enough that the waiter didn't come by our table more than once to check on us. The day turned out much better than I thought it would. The rest of the weekend is a bit hectic though; we had so many plans lined up for today, but I guess they all just got cancelled...
