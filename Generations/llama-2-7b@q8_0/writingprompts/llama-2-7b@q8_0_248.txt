 through my gut. The thought that he might not have been alone gave me an adrenaline rush to end all adrenaline rushes. 
 I stepped up onto the curb and crossed the street as quickly as possible, avoiding eye contact with anyone I passed on the sidewalk. 
 I finally found my apartment building after nearly two hours of searching. The address had been the last thing he'd said to me before we parted ways on the bus that afternoon. It was at the top of a hill and seemed like it would take forever to get up there, but I managed to make it without having any more uncomfortable encounters with strangers. 
 Once inside my apartment building, I found myself in front of the elevator doors within seconds, as though I was being propelled by an invisible force. The door opened and I stepped inside. My heart raced. 
 Just as the elevator doors closed behind me, the sound of heavy footsteps filled the hallway. I felt a jolt run through my body and realized that I'd been holding my breath for quite some time. With trembling fingers, I reached up to press the button to bring me to the top floor. 
 The elevator came to a stop with an audible thud as though it was struggling to move forward. Just like the sound of heavy footsteps in the hallway outside. 
 I took a deep breath and pressed the button for my floor, but this time when the doors opened, I stepped off into the darkened stairwell instead. 
 I'd made my way to the top floor without any trouble or encounter with anyone else. 
 When I found the door to my room, it was open just a crack. I pushed the door open and called out his name but no one answered. 
 Fear clamped down on me like a vise as I stepped inside and shut the door behind me. The room felt cold and lifeless without him in it. As I began to take inventory of my surroundings, I noticed that someone had rifled through his clothes and thrown them around. My stomach clenched into a fist when I realized they were police uniforms. 
 A rush of adrenaline filled me as I scrambled over the bed to see if he'd left any messages or notes behind. There was nothing except for the remnants of his clothes that had been tossed onto the floor. 
 My heart thudded heavily in my chest and I realized with a jolt that I'd left the door open when we arrived. If they were here, then there would be no escape. No chance to run or hide. No way out of this mess I'd gotten myself into. 
 The sound of heavy footsteps echoed in the hallway outside as though someone was slowly and deliberately approaching my room from behind. 
 As a cold sweat broke out across my skin, I heard them coming closer until finally they stood at the door of my room. My heart hammered so loudly that it felt like it would burst from my chest as their voices filled the silence between us. 
 ``We have to talk.'' one of the men said. His voice was low and gravelly, but it cut through the air with a ferocity I had never heard before. 
 I swallowed hard, trying to gather my wits about me. My mind raced as I tried to think of something clever to say in order to stall for time and buy myself some more precious minutes to escape this situation. 
 ``I know why you're here.'' the man said, his voice laced with anger now. He didn't give me a chance to respond before he continued speaking. 
 I felt like my heart was about to burst from fear and dread. My throat went dry as I struggled for air. 
 ``I want you to leave this place.'' the man said in a commanding voice that brooked no argument or objection. His words were cold and impersonal, like a stranger ordering me around without any regard for who I was or what had happened between us. 
 There was no room for debate here; there would be no negotiation or discussion about anything else but my leaving this place as quickly as possible before they came inside to take me away forever. My world suddenly felt very small and insignificant as fear gripped me by the throat, squeezing until it hurt. I realized with a terrible certainty that there would be no going back after this; once they saw what had happened between us, there would be no taking back what had been said or done between us either. 
 It felt like my heart would burst from fear and dread. My throat went dry as I struggled for air to speak. ``I won't tell anyone.'' I managed to whisper in a voice that was barely audible over the pounding of my own blood in my ears. The men outside stared at me blankly before turning away without saying another word, and slowly making their way down the hallway and out of sight. 
 I stood there for a moment, unsure of what to do next. Finally, after what felt like an eternity had passed, I gathered myself together enough to start heading toward the elevator again. But this time when I stepped inside, my hand shook as I reached up to press the button to take me downstairs. My heart hammered loudly in my chest and my breath came out in ragged gasps as I waited for what seemed like forever before the doors opened once more into darkness again. 
 When they finally did open, light spilled into the hallway from somewhere below that made it seem brighter than it was by comparison with how dimly lit everything else had been up until then. I took a deep breath and stepped outside into that brightness, only to find myself once more in front of my own door on this same floor once again where I began before all this started happening in the first place. 
 The fear and dread continued to grip me as I stood there staring at the closed door in front of me for what seemed like an eternity until finally it opened with a creak that echoed loudly through the empty hallway. 
 When they found her, she was still alive but barely so. She had been raped repeatedly before being strangled to death while struggling desperately against her assailant who was twice her size and strength, until finally succumbing to his brutal assault as he choked out the last bits of air from inside her tiny lungs until there was nothing left but a hollow shell of what had once been someone's life before being snuffed out like an old candle in the wind. 
 My eyes filled with tears as I saw him lying on the floor next to her motionless body. There was blood everywhere; it seemed that he had lost so much more than just his innocence that day. But there were no words of comfort or consolation from me because I knew without a doubt that she would never have wanted them spoken by anyone else but herself, even if they did come out as tears instead. 
 The sound of sirens filled the air outside my building as they made their way toward this place to take him away forever. And in that moment when all hope seemed lost and there was no one left who could save me from what had happened between us, I knew without a doubt that things would never be the same again once he was gone from my life for good. 
 ``I found him.'' I said quietly to myself as they led him away in handcuffs until finally they vanished out of sight into a black void that swallowed them up whole like an abyssal whirlpool ready and waiting to pull me down with it if only I allowed it to happen by stepping inside its deadly grasp without realizing how much danger awaited anyone foolish enough to take such chances.
