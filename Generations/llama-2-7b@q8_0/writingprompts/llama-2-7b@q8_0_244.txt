ears would start to sting my eyes every time the music stopped. A sad song with lyrics that made my heart feel so heavy. He just got up and walked off stage without a glance back at me, as if he had no idea where I was.
It was dark, Maestro kept me hidden always. “ The magically appearing rabbit ”. Pfft, more like the magically hidden under the table rabbit. It was ridiculous. I always kept quiet and didn ’ t move. Tears would start to sting my eyes every time the music stopped. A sad song with lyrics that made my heart feel so heavy. He just got up and walked off stage without a glance back at me, as if he had no idea where I was.
I wondered how long it took for him to remember the rabbit was still sitting there in her chair. But then again, it wasn ’ t like she could do much since her legs were locked behind that giant chair. It wouldn ’ t be funny, but somehow hearing those two words always made me snicker.
“ Maestro? ” I said in a soft whisper as the lights turned back on and his back was to me. The red carpet was still glowing from where my feet touched it. My eyes searched for him as he started walking away, towards his office I guessed.
“ You are late today, don ’ t you know? ” He snapped at me, but it sounded more like a question than an order. He turned around and his face looked sterner than usual. “ Didn ’ t your mother teach you anything about time management? ”
I started to shake with nervousness. I wanted to just walk away because Maestro made me feel uncomfortable, but that wouldn ’ t be good. I didn ’ t know what would happen if I ever missed one of his rehearsals. So I stayed and hoped he would forget about my late arrival.
“ Sorry. ” That ’ s all I could think to say. It felt like my tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth. “ I wasn ’ t sleeping well, so...”
“ I can hear you breathe, ” he cut in with a scowl. “ Don ’ t worry about it today. Your father will be here soon. Just go home and get some rest. You look as if you are going to faint any second. ”
I stood there looking up at him. He was so tall that he had to lean down so his face wasn ’ t far from mine. I swallowed hard, trying not to let my nerves show on the outside. I always kept my emotions inside of me and out of other people ’ s business. It was a bad habit, but at least it kept Maestro from finding out about how much he made me feel uncomfortable.
“ You are very good with your music, ” he said. “ There is no need to worry if you aren ’ t asleep the night before your rehearsal. ”
I just stood there staring at him. My legs were so wobbly that I wasn ’ t sure they could hold me up anymore. His gaze seemed to bore right through my skull and into my soul. The way he was looking at me made me feel small and insignificant.
“ That is all, ” Maestro said finally before walking away again with a swagger in his step that I wasn ’ t sure how to deal with.
I sighed as the feeling of guilt washed over me. What if he had been mad at me? It would ’ ve been my fault, of course. He had never been late himself and it seemed like everything fell on me all the time. But there was nothing I could do about it. Nothing but to just keep playing for him, that is.
I looked up at the sky and let out a small sigh. The sun was starting to peek through the clouds now as they started to move in a hurry, trying to get away from the heat of the sun. I loved this time of day when everything seemed so calm and peaceful. The breeze felt like it was caressing my skin. It made me want to close my eyes and just feel every moment of it.
My father had been here earlier than usual today, as he always did on Sundays. Maestro had a list with all the names written down that were going to come in for rehearsal tomorrow morning at six am sharp. I knew it by heart now since it was my second week working here, but I still looked at it every day.
I had never been able to wake up early enough to see Maestro ’ s performances. It always seemed like they were at night when it was too dark for me to go outside and find the way back home. That wasn ’ t how he liked his performers, but I was sure that it would change once I started working here full time.
“ Hello, ” my dad said as he walked up beside me.
I turned to him with a smile before pulling him into a tight hug. He always smelled like home and I loved it.
“ How are you doing? ” he asked when he stepped away. “ You look exhausted today. ”
He was right, but that ’ s what I was used to these days. The amount of work Maestro gave me was getting harder every day and I felt like I was getting weaker instead. He had me do more and more with the music until one day it seemed like he couldn’t get enough out of me anymore.
“ It ’ s fine, ” I said in a soft voice. “ Just another busy week for me. ”
My dad laughed at that statement as if I was being ridiculous again. The only thing worse than not getting enough sleep is my father telling me to rest more often. He never believed me when I told him that working with Maestro had always been hard and he just got used to it over the years.
“ I think you need to talk to your Maestro about this, ” Dad said as he looked around at all of his other instruments and equipment in the room. “ He needs to listen to what you want instead of giving you more work without asking if it ’ s too much for you. ”
I just shook my head because there was nothing I could do about it. Maestro had always treated me this way. Like I wasn’t worth his time or effort and that made me feel so alone sometimes. It hurt when he ignored me even though I knew he saw me, but I didn ’ t have a choice in the matter.
I didn ’ t want to go home with my dad today. We had plans for dinner since it was Sunday. He always made sure to take some time off from his work so we could spend the day together as a family. The last thing I wanted was for him to know that I spent my entire weekend working with Maestro, even though I wasn ’ t getting paid at all.
“ Let ’ s go home, ” I said softly and then turned around before he had time to disagree. “ I don ’ t want to stay here alone tonight. ”
He didn ’ t look as if he was going to argue with me so instead he just nodded and we started walking towards the door where his car waited for us out front of the building. My dad always drove so it was nice sometimes, but I felt like I wasn ’ t doing my part when I let him do all of the work.
“ You know you could use a break, right? ” Dad asked me as he pulled out onto the road and headed towards home. “ Maestro isn ’ t going to fire you or anything if you tell him that you need some time off from your job. I think it would be good for both of us. You deserve something nice in your life, after all this work with music. ”
I just looked down at my hands and let out a deep sigh before speaking again. “ It ’ s not like that, Dad. He doesn’t do this to any other students or employees around here. I know they get tired of working for him too but he always gives them time off when needed. ”
My father didn ’ t say anything as we drove along the quiet streets back home where Maestro wasn ’ t waiting for me anymore at seven am tomorrow morning like usual. This was our normal routine on Sundays, even though it felt more like torture than relaxing time together with him in charge of everything.
“ I know what you are saying, ” Dad said finally after we had been driving along for a while without talking to each other. “ It ’ s not fair that he treats you differently from everyone else. But sometimes we just have to accept things like this as they are and move on with our lives. You don’t need Maestro to be happy, Aria. ”
My heart started to hurt a bit as I listened to what my father was telling me right now. He didn ’ t want me to feel bad about all of the work I had been doing for him but sometimes it felt like everything was starting to become too much for me and I just wanted out before he got angry at me again.
“ Maybe you should think about taking some time off from Maestro, ” Dad said finally when we were both silent for a moment as we continued down the road towards home together once more now that our conversation had come full circle back around to where it started again today without anything changing between us two anymore either way either right now or later on too.
