 the woods, whistling and hissing as they passed over Zealot's head toward other targets: two more men, two more women, a child. The man cried out, but only for an instant before a second arrow pierced his neck from behind. 
 
 This time he didn't scream; he just sighed and fell to the ground like he was finally getting tired of being up. Two of his brothers tried to reach him with their hands, but the forest had become too thick for them to wade through it quickly, so they ran back toward Zealot and took turns covering each other's body as arrows flew out of the trees. The woman was next, her arrow piercing her heart and killing her almost instantly. She fell to her knees and dropped the baby, who rolled into a pile of leaves, gasping and whimpering. 
 
 The final man fell before he could even reach his sword; arrows lodged in his shoulder and one in his back. He screamed as loudly as he could while fighting to remain standing, but it was no use. More arrows followed him into the forest until all he had left were a few of his comrades, who tried to crawl out with him while shooting at their pursuers. 
 
 Zealot stood behind one of them and watched as the man's head exploded when an arrow pierced his temple. He could feel himself bleeding heavily from the wound in his chest, and he realized that if he didn't do something quickly, the end would come for him soon enough as well.

 Zealot watched the man next to him fall onto his side when another arrow pierced him in the back. He knew that this time it wouldn't take long before he joined his comrades on the forest floor. 
 
 But there was still something he had to do first.

 Zealot turned and walked down into the woods until he found a small clearing with no signs of any recent activity from either side. He saw that the ground beneath him was covered in moss, just like the forest around him. In one corner, though, there were patches of dry dirt where the earth had been churned up and recently replaced by something else. It took only a few minutes for him to find what he was looking for: two small graves beneath which lay three bodies covered in cloth.

 Zealot untied his leather belt and wrapped it around the body of one of the men before turning and running back into the forest. He found another clearing just beyond where he had first entered the woods, a clearing with two bodies in it that had been recently killed. Zealot didn't have much time if he wanted to survive this day—or any other days for that matter.

 He tied his belt around one of them and then turned toward the trees once more, only stopping when he felt something strike him in the shoulder with a sharp pain that made him gasp at how much it hurt. He spun around and saw an arrow lodged into his arm; it had passed through without hitting anything else vital like bone or artery before finally coming out on its own accord as Zealot tried to pull away from whatever was holding onto it so tightly that even with all his strength he couldn't get free. 
 
 He ripped off the cloth around one of his hands and then took hold of what remained attached to him; he knew that if he wanted this wound treated properly then he needed help, but there wasn't much time before someone else would find out where they were hiding and come looking for them themselves.

 Zealot pulled hard against the arrow until it finally came loose from his shoulder with a loud pop followed by a sharp pain as blood ran down his arm into his hand. He watched as pieces of muscle fell from around where it had lodged itself inside him before tying up what remained of the leather belt around what was left behind after removing so much tissue that he was certain nothing would grow back there again anytime soon—not even if he had wanted it to in some bizarre way that only Zealot could understand. 
 
 [** 8 ]**
 
 Zealot took off running through the forest, not caring how much blood he left behind or what might happen if someone found him here with so many wounds and no weapons other than what was attached to his body right now.
