er right: the dudes in this book have gotten a lot better at their job than I ever was. But my job is to tell you how they do what they do, so here we go...

* ***** 1. DIVE! 
> _It's all about getting up off the bottom._ 
 
Dive, and everything changes. No more fighting against your buoyancy to stay down, no more swimming like a pencil to stay horizontal: you can turn, twist, roll, tumble, shoot upwards or deepen your descent at will. You are suddenly in control of your world instead of having it push and pull on you. 
> _You want to go somewhere? Dive._ 
Diving gives you instant freedom to move where the fish are feeding, where they're hiding from predators, or simply where the fun is. It's all about getting up off the bottom, which we'll cover in more detail later, but for now suffice it to say that diving makes everything easier, and can get you a lot further down than just staying horizontal at the surface. 
> _Diving has been an integral part of SCUBA since its earliest days._ 
Diving has been an integral part of SCUBA from its very beginnings: it was a natural outgrowth of the ability to descend and then ascend without rebreathers, which meant that divers could go where they wanted, when they wanted. And as we'll see later on, diving is essential to many exciting forms of diving such as trimix (diving with three gases in your tank), deep diving and overhead diving, so if you want to get into any of those activities, you're going to need good basic dive skills.

  * DIVE! is the first chapter in my book, _Dive! Dives &amp; Drills._ It's written for anyone who wants to become a better diver, or just get more out of their dives. _Dive!_ covers:
•	Why you should dive? (page 3)
•	How to dive effectively and safely (pages 4–18)
•	Diving skills for different types of diving (pages 19–53)
•	Deep-dive skills (pages 54–72)
•	Advanced dives, like drift diving, dry suit diving and overhead dives (pages 73–83)
###
  * If you're an experienced diver looking to hone your skills or try something new, I recommend going back and reading _Dive!_ from the start. The book is designed so that it builds on itself: each chapter adds a little more information than the previous one, with lots of drills that build up your confidence as you learn. And even if you're an experienced diver, you can still get some new ideas or learn about dives you haven't tried before!
###
  * If you've never scuba-dived before and this is the book you bought to help you decide whether you want to take a course, please don't feel pressured into buying a PADI Open Water Diver Course right away. There are lots of other books that will tell you how to do everything we cover in this one (and more) but if you're not sure whether you really want to dive, then I recommend reading _Dive!_ from the start and diving with a buddy when you can to see what it feels like. 
 
 You will dive deeper than I do. But just how deep? The answer is up to you... 
###
  * When you read this book, you'll be learning about dives that go beyond recreational depth limits – that is, deeper than the limit set by your training agency. I'm not going to tell you that you should dive without limits (and don't let anyone else do so either), but there are lots of reasons why you might want to dive a little bit deeper than usual. 
> _Here's some good reasons to go a little deeper:_
•	For fun – sometimes the fun is in going a little deeper, or staying down a little longer
•	To practice your skills and learn more about diving – many of our most challenging dive sites are beyond recreational limits; why not take it on?
•	To see something new that's hard to see from the surface – I once saw a 5m long fish underwater in New Zealand. It was one of only two in the world and it was at depth, so there wasn't much chance of seeing it otherwise! 
> _If you decide to dive deeper than usual, remember that you need to be responsible for your own safety:_
•	Check with your training agency what their limits are for the type of diving you plan to do and don't try anything that they recommend against. If in doubt, ask a local diver or instructor, but ultimately it is up to you and you have to take responsibility for your own safety. 
•	Plan your dive carefully – know what your depth limit is, how far away the dive site is from a surface supply of air (you may need to use more air than usual) and make sure that you can get back safely if something goes wrong. 
•	Let someone know where you're going beforehand so that they know when you should be home again – remember, there will probably be no one else underwater with you. 
###
  * This book covers a lot of different diving techniques and skills, but if you only take one thing away from _Dive!_ it's this:
**The best way to get more out of your dives is to practice dive skills.**
Most divers don't do much drilling at all. But the ones who do tend to get a lot more out of their dives than those who don't! 
 
> _Here are some good reasons to practice:_
•	You can do it anywhere and any time – you can practice with your buddy or alone; underwater or on the surface. You can even practice in an empty swimming pool or a bathtub if you want.
•	Practice makes perfect – the more you practice, the better you'll get at skills like buoyancy control and mask clearing. 
###
  * To practice effectively:
•	Know what you need to do – read _Dive!_ beforehand or ask for a buddy who knows how. 
•	Have all your equipment ready – remember that drilling is as much about your gear as it is about your skills, so make sure you have everything with you and know where things are in the water.
•	Practice your skills calmly and deliberately – don't do a whole bunch of different stuff at once; focus on one or two things that you want to work on. 
> _Remember:_
**If it doesn't feel right, then stop! Don't just go through the motions.** 
###
  * You might think that I'm trying to teach you everything about diving in this book... but don't worry too much. We all learn new things as we dive and there are hundreds of books on the shelves ready to tell you how to do them better than me. For now, just focus on what _you_ want from diving: if it's fun or adventure, then have some fun! If it's for a challenge, then get stuck in – but always remember that safety is the most important part of your dive and no amount of practice will make you better if you don't think about what could go wrong beforehand. 
 
 Why Dives? 
###
  * **Why dive?** I asked myself this question a lot as I was writing _Dive!_ Here are my answers:
•	To see things that others can only dream of – there's a whole new world down there, but it's hard to get people interested in the things they can't experience with their own eyes. Diving is about getting into that other world and experiencing it for yourself. 
•	For fun! – diving is about having an adventure and it should be enjoyable: if you're not having fun, then don't do it. If there was no fun in the water then why would we bother to learn all these skills? 
•	To challenge yourself – learning new dive skills makes us better at what we do as divers; but just because something is easy doesn't mean that we should stop trying for more! 
•	To push your limits – many of our most challenging dive sites are beyond recreational depths and most people will never get to see them without diving deeper. Why not go a little bit further? 
•	It can save lives - if you ever need help underwater, then you're going to need some skills! (and maybe even your buddy) 
###
  * The bottom line is that there are many different reasons for diving and _Dive!_ covers all of them – but it doesn't matter what reason you have for wanting to dive. The most important
