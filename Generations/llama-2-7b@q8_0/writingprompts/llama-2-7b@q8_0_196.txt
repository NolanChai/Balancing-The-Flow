azy bar called The Blue Parrot on a business trip with my co-workers after hours. When we were at that place, something very strange happened. 

### 12. A Strange Coincidence

I had never been in such a sleazy bar before. I mean, I’d been to bars before, but they were always like, nice places with chairs and couches and waitresses serving you drinks. This one was completely different. It didn't even have any chairs! 

I ordered a beer for the first time ever in my life and started sipping it, while the bartender played a song I hadn’t heard before. It was very upbeat and weird. It sounded like something out of a sci-fi movie or something. But at least it made me feel less awkward sitting alone. 

I continued drinking my beer for the next few hours while I talked with some of my co-workers that were there as well. We drank and we joked around, just having fun. That is until something strange happened.

### 13. The Revelations

The next morning, I woke up feeling very hungover and confused. My head was throbbing so bad that my eyes were burning. That was a sign of the hangover I always got when drinking too much. I never drank at home though because there are no bars near where I lived. But last night I went to this bar called The Blue Parrot on a business trip with my co-workers after hours and I had to admit, it was pretty fun. 

I tried calling my boss that morning to ask him for an extension on my paperwork because of the hangover, but he wouldn’t answer his phone! I called every number in my contacts list until someone picked up. It was the receptionist at our office who told me that he’s in a meeting with some other company and will be done soon, so I should wait for him to come out before continuing my day. 

When my boss came back from his meeting, he saw me waiting outside of his office door. He asked what the problem was but I wasn’t really sure how to answer that question at first. Then he said “Oh shit! Did you do something stupid last night?” I told him about going out for drinks with some co-workers after hours which resulted in a hangover so bad it felt like I got hit by a truck or something. 

I started to feel embarrassed and ashamed because this was not the kind of image I wanted people seeing me as. But then he said “That’s fine, we all have our moments sometimes! Just go home now.” 

After my boss left his office, I headed over towards mine. The receptionist looked at me funny when she saw me walking in from the hallway and asked if everything was alright. Before I could answer her question though, my co-worker who also happened to be one of our managers walked out of an adjacent office carrying a bunch of papers which made it difficult for us to talk with each other at first. 

“Hey!” he said “What’s wrong with you?” before dropping the stack of papers onto my desk and starting to walk away again as if nothing had happened. I was confused by his sudden outburst so I asked him why he acted like that but there wasn’t any answer coming out of his mouth.

### 14. The Truth is Out There... Somewhere
I sat there alone at my desk staring blankly out into space until I heard footsteps coming closer towards me from behind. It was one of the secretaries named Melissa who had been working with us for years now. She came over and handed me a piece of paper which said: 

“You have won a free trip to Japan! Congratulations!!!”

I didn't know what to think about that because I never entered any lottery or anything like this before but when she handed it to me, everything seemed to click together all at once. This was no coincidence--it had been planned out ahead of time by someone else who wanted me to experience something new and exciting in my life! 

As Melissa walked away from where we were standing, I tried calling my wife on the phone but she didn't pick up when it rang so I left a message explaining everything that happened last night at The Blue Parrot bar. Then later on during dinner time with friends over some beers at one of those bars near home (which has no chairs!), they started discussing how crazy this whole situation was starting to get...

### 15. The Climax

After the hangover finally passed, I woke up feeling much better than expected but there were still some things that needed to be taken care of before leaving on this trip. First off was calling my boss again who picked up right away without even waiting for me to finish saying hello! He asked where I had been last night and when he found out it involved drinking with co-workers, his tone changed completely from being friendly into something more formal which made sense because we were at work now so this was no longer supposed to be funny anymore (or maybe it just wasn't). 

I then asked if anyone else knew about my trip or had been planning on going too but he said no one else was aware of the situation besides me and him since it would be easier for everyone involved if only one person did know what was happening so as not to draw attention away from business matters which were far more important right now than anything else in life.
