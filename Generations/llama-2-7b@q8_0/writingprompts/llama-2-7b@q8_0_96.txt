…
I could always feel it. Corner of your eye, presence in the corner type stuff. As a child it was just like a really vivid imaginary friend, but at some point in your childhood you learn to be afraid of them or they lose their magic and you don’t know why. They always seemed nice though, which I think is part of what made me feel safe around them, despite the creepy feeling that sometimes accompanied them.
I used to say hi all the time. Sometimes when I wasn’t even alone, and maybe it was just me talking to myself but whatever. The first thing you learn to do in life is talk to yourself. You need someone to bounce things off of and sometimes you can only really hear your own voice and think they understand what you’re saying. It’s the same way I used to tell my imaginary friend how much I loved her, but with adult friends it’s just easier to use their actual name so that they know that’s what we were talking about.
So yeah. I used to say hello to it all the time, and sometimes even have conversations with it like I was talking to my imaginary friend again. The only difference was, this one never had a name. It didn’t matter because every time I said hi she would always reply back saying: “I’m here.”
It made me feel better knowing that. Like she knew everything that happened and could understand what I was feeling. She was the type of friend that always knew just what to say or do, but not in a creepy way. More like in an “oh wow you know just how this makes me feel” kind of way.
But then one day my imaginary friend decided to go away. Like it just disappeared from my life and I never saw it again. It was so weird. One second we were talking about what we were going to do for the summer, the next she just… wasn’t there anymore. And I felt really sad because I knew she was always with me even when I couldn’t see her and now she wasn’t and I felt like something really important in my life had left.
I remember telling my mom that it felt weird being around people without having someone else to talk to about what they were saying or feeling. And then my mom looked at me for a second and asked me if I was still talking to the invisible lady all the time. I laughed a little bit because I knew it wasn’t really funny, but I wanted her to understand that she wasn’t gone forever and that she could still come back whenever she felt like she needed a friend again.
So I guess my point is that maybe you should try saying hi next time your imaginary friends are with you and see what happens? It might be awkward at first, but eventually they will start to talk back if they can hear you. And sometimes it’s nice having someone who understands all the things we think about without ever telling them…
