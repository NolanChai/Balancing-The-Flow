ides and wind and trees, but we have no way of knowing that yet '' she whispered as she held my hand.
A strange thought indeed, for I had been content with her knowledge of the future. I could see no reason to want to live forever when my time would come eventually. Her words were a jolt of reality in an otherwise boring life. A few months ago I was 19 years old and in high school. Now I'm 19 and a sophomore at Harvard. My mother still looks the same, but somehow she feels different... older.
It's been two weeks since I died. Two weeks of wandering the Earth with the only living person I know. It hasn't exactly been fun or even particularly exciting, it has mostly been me sitting around trying to find a way to return home before my mother forgets about me all together.
I don't want to die again... ever.
Her eyes looked up at me and she smiled. `` You should have told me '' I said, feeling so stupid as the words came out of my mouth. She looked down, her long hair hiding part of her face. `` It was hard telling you I knew you were going to die. '' I replied. Her hands held mine tightly and she squeezed them reassuringly, like it would make everything alright again.
My heart skipped a beat as the blood rushed out of my head, down into my body, back up and then back down again in a never ending cycle until it came to rest in my feet.
I'm not sure if I was holding her hand or she was mine when the darkness fell over us. It didn't last for long, but I remember how it felt. Her hand went limp and I knew that her eyes were closed tightly.
`` Maybe there is something more than tides and winds and trees '' a voice said in my mind as if someone else was talking to me. `` But we have no way of knowing yet. ''
I had fallen silent again, letting the soft words of the young woman fill the silence. She turned back to look at me and her face lit up with a smile. I knew then that she was still alive in my heart; if not for eternity then for as long as it took her to say goodbye to our world.
`` You should tell your mother what happened when you get home, so maybe someday someone else will find out and they can come visit me too! '' She laughed happily as she sat down next to me on the park bench. I smiled back at her before getting up to walk away from her forever.
It's been two weeks since I died; two weeks of wandering around with no home or family, trying not to think about all those who knew my name but would never see me again in person or speak to me ever again over the phone call like we did every day before...
