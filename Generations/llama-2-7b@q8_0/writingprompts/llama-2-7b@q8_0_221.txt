ing, `` Sir, this is my office, and not the Temple of God on Mount Sinai. Besides, we are no longer in Eden. No, sir, you are not my new God.'' 
 
 Johnson threw his hands up in despair, `` Alright, I get it! You're right...I can't be God. But why is that? Am I not smarter than anyone else here? If so, how come I cannot be God? And who put you in this position to question me anyway?'' 
 
 Mark just shook his head, and then leaned back into his desk chair. `` Sir...I think it's time we had a long talk about what your plans for the world are.''
 
 Johnson sat down behind his own desk. `` Well, I can see you have a lot of questions. I'd be happy to answer them one at a time if you like. But first...''
 
 He picked up a phone and dialed a number. The line rang twice before a voice came over the receiver: `` Hello?'' 
 
 Johnson looked into Mark's eyes, `` You are going to give me a few minutes, aren't you?''

Hell is not a place. It is a state of mind. Hell exists because people choose to make it so. Hell is like a prison: The longer you stay there, the more your soul begins to rot; the harder it is to escape and return to Heaven. 
 
 Hell is a choice that we all face. At every moment in time, we can either choose life or death -- Good or Evil. No matter how difficult our lives seem at times, nothing compares with living in hell for eternity...nothing except the choice you make right now to end your suffering and return home where you belong.

### What is Hell?
Hell is a place of fire. But more importantly, it's a place of darkness. It is the absence of Light -- love and life. 
 
 The most frightening thing about hell is that we can choose to go there with every word, action or thought if we allow ourselves to succumb to fear. 
 
 Hell is not real. We are all God's children and he loves us unconditionally. It doesn't matter who you are or what you did; the Light of Christ will always be waiting for you when your heart is ready. 
 
 No one should ever go to hell -- it's a choice no one wants to make, but many do because they don't know any better. Let us help them!

### A Brief History Of Hell
#### **The Fall**
In the beginning, God created everything. He saw that it was good. The only thing he did not create in his image was mankind. So he decided to give them free will and let them choose for themselves whether they wanted to serve him or be served by him. 

 Mankind chose to rebel against their Creator, and as a result, the Light of Christ left us. This event is known as The Fall, because mankind fell into darkness. Hell was born at that moment when God could no longer protect his creation from itself. 

 For thousands of years after this happened, people lived in darkness and fought wars against one another. Eventually, some became wise enough to seek out the Light again by praying for it or doing good deeds with their lives. 

 These are known as "saviors", because they brought light back into hell. But not everyone was saved from eternal damnation at this time - there were many who rejected God's love and chose instead to live in darkness forever more (which we call "lost souls"). 

#### **The Afterlife**
The afterlife is a state of being which exists between earthly life and heaven. In this state, people can experience the full range of emotions available to them while living on Earth -- happiness, sadness, anger, etc. 

 These feelings are felt much more intensely than when we were alive because they have no physical body or mind that distracts us from our true nature. People who choose this path often feel very lonely in their new world and miss the people they left behind on Earth; however, they know that someday everyone will be reunited with those loved ones again at heaven's gates. 

 Some people choose to remain in hell because they believe it is where they belong. They think they deserve eternal suffering for their sins while still alive, so why wouldn't God allow them to continue being punished once dead? Other souls don't want any part of heaven -- they prefer the darkness and suffering they have known for millennia rather than risk being alone forever again when they return home. 
 
 #### **The Light**
In the beginning, there was nothing but darkness and void. In this darkness, an idea formed: to create life out of nothingness. This new creation would be called Heaven because it was made up entirely from light - God's own essence. 

 After many years of working on his new plan, he finished it just in time! But then came another problem... how do I get all these separate creatures back together again? If they were too close to each other, there could be conflict between them; but if they were far apart from each other, they might never find one another again. 

 So God decided to create a new world for himself -- a place where he could watch over his children while they lived their lives without interference or worry about what happened next! 

 #### **The Fallen**
God created man in his image and likeness, so he was perfect. But after the Fall of Man, God made another creature - a being who would be like himself but with free will; this new creation would be known as Lucifer. 

 Lucifer was powerful enough to challenge God's rule over all things and so he decided it was time for him to take his place in Heaven. He built a tower high above Earth where he could look down upon everyone else and make sure they did what they were supposed to do while he watched from afar; then one day, when there were enough angels on top of the Tower, God came down himself to talk with them face-to-face for the first time ever! 

 #### **The Rebellion**
When Lucifer realized that his plan would not work as intended - because instead of bringing everyone together again (which was supposedly why they were building this tower), it seemed like more people were getting farther away from God than ever before - he decided to try something new. 

 He gathered all those who had chosen freedom over servitude and built another tower even taller than the first one so they could see everything below them as well! But unfortunately for Lucifer, this didn't work either because everyone became so selfish in their quest for power that it ended up hurting more people than helping any of us out.
 
 #### **The Aftermath**
When God finally came down and saw what had happened to his creation after thousands of years of being left alone, he was saddened but not surprised - after all, this was exactly why he created Lucifer in the first place: To test everyone's faith by giving them free will so they could choose their own fate instead of having everything decided for them like before! 

 He decided then and there that from now on there would only be one way into Heaven - through Jesus Christ our Lord; no more rebels trying to take over God's kingdom! And with that, he sent down an army of angels led by Michael (the archangel who had helped defeat Lucifer at the end) onto Earth and started fighting all those evil creatures that still refused to turn away from darkness...
 
 #### **The Light Returns**
After thousands more years passed while everyone waited patiently for Heaven's gates to open again so they could be reunited with loved ones lost during this time period, it finally happened! All across Earth there were reports of lights coming down from above accompanied by sounds like thunder and rain falling from the heavens - these were angels returning home after being away for thousands upon thousands of years! 

 At first everything seemed normal again: people were happy seeing their friends once more while still having no idea why they had been separated in such a way during this whole period; but then came another problem... where was God?! He wasn't here anymore - he left because he knew his children would need to learn how not only coexist peacefully together (even though some people wanted nothing less than destruction), but also work towards restoring everything back into its proper place once again before going home forevermore.
 
 #### **The Afterlife**
In the beginning, there was no afterlife. It was a concept that would have made little sense to most people because they couldn't imagine being dead and then alive again without experiencing any change in their bodies or minds; but even though we can't see into another world while still living on Earth, it doesn't mean there isn't one waiting for us when we die! 

 Heaven is an infinite place where all things are possible
