924's locks. It was a tough job getting them all in there, but at least you couldn't lose a key - it would stay on your hand forever.
 
 I started up the stairs and noticed the lights were off over the first-floor offices. That wasn't unusual; we were used to working after dark and I was sure nobody would mind if I worked late myself. The door to the office was closed, but I knew it was unlocked. The lock had been replaced with one of those new high-security ones that you have to punch a code into to get in. I punched my own number, 1498, into the keypad and turned the handle.
 
 As soon as I stepped through the door I knew something was wrong - I could smell smoke, but it wasn't coming from any of the cigarette machines that were scattered around. I looked for a fire extinguisher to no avail, and then realized I'd been so used to smelling cigarette smoke in the building all night long that I'd almost forgotten about the second source.
 
 `Damn it!'' I said out loud. `` I don't have my keys with me tonight; they're upstairs!''
 
 As I ran back down the stairs, I realized what was going on - somebody had set fire to the place and all of our equipment was burning inside. It was a horrible scene - just like a movie. My heart sank and I felt sick as I pounded the doors to the building in an effort to attract attention. But nobody could hear me above all the commotion of the flames, and there was no way anybody would be able to get through the thick smoke that had now begun to pour out from the door I'd just come through.
 
 I ran back up the stairs again as fast as my feet would take me. But the fire was spreading too quickly; it wouldn't do any good for me to try and stop it with water - not even if I could get one of the extinguishers out from under all that smoke.
 
 It was then, when I realized there wasn't anything I could do to help, that my mind began to race. `What have I done?'' I thought. `How could this possibly have happened?'' And then it hit me like a ton of bricks - my own fault! `Why didn't I put out the fire when I noticed smoke coming from the building earlier today?'' I cursed myself for not acting sooner; if only I had, I would be able to get into the office now and save most of our equipment.
 
 But there was nothing else I could do; it was already too late. The office was gone - completely engulfed in flames and smoke. I stood there thinking about how sad it was that all this destruction had resulted from my carelessness, when a thought hit me like an arrow in the heart. `What if it's not over yet?'' I asked myself as I looked around at the building. I tried to think of what could be done to stop another fire, but came up with nothing. All I knew for sure was that there were still some people who worked here after dark and now they wouldn't have a job anymore because their offices had been burned down by my carelessness.
 
 As I stood there staring at the ruins of our office, I began to feel sick again - this time from guilt rather than smoke inhalation. But before long, something else hit me: `I'm still here.'' It was just an odd thought that popped into my head for some reason or another and it surprised me because normally when you think about how much worse things could be at any given moment, all you can do is feel bad - but not tonight! Tonight I had a chance to do something good; if only I would take advantage of the opportunity.
 
 I ran back upstairs again and grabbed my coat off the floor where it must have fallen when I'd rushed out so quickly earlier today, then dashed down into the lobby and through the front doors - still wearing nothing but underwear under my coat! It wasn't until I was outside in the freezing cold air that I realized what had happened: `I didn't even bother to lock up before I left.''
 
 As soon as I stepped back inside again, though, a whole new set of problems came crashing down on me - not just from guilt but also because my clothes were still wet from being underwater earlier today. So now not only was I feeling bad for setting this fire in the first place but now I had no choice but to go back into an office full of flames and smoke after already having been burned once today (which, if you think about it, makes a lot more sense than walking around naked at work).
 
 But before long another thought came over me like an epiphany: `Wait! I have a key to that building!'' It was such a simple thing but it hit me right in the face and made all this seem so much less daunting. After all, if there's one place where I know they can get my clothes dried off quickly without having them smell like wet dog afterwards (because I am pretty sure most places aren't equipped to handle things like that), then it would be at the office of 924.
 
 So now I was no longer worried about how badly I had screwed up earlier today - because I knew there was still something positive waiting for me on the other side of all this chaos and destruction: a hot shower, clean clothes, and maybe even some time off work afterward if everything goes well.
 
 And with that in mind, my heart began to lift again as I ran back upstairs one more time (this time wearing jeans) before opening up the door to 924 for what would be my final time - at least until tomorrow morning when I'm supposed to start cleaning things up around here again after work ends tonight.
 
 So now you know: sometimes being careless can actually lead you down a path that helps other people out instead of just hurting yourself or someone else (even if it does require putting on some pants beforehand).
