The 70s were a time of great strife in America, with the nation locked into an ongoing conflict in Southeast Asia and dealing with the economic effects of a recession following the Vietnam war. It was also a decade of great change in American society, as people began to realize that certain civil rights (like those pertaining to race) could no longer be ignored.

One particular aspect of society was dramatically affected during this time period: fashion. People suddenly began to think more carefully about their outfits and appearance, and the 1970s are often remembered as a time when people wore their hearts on their sleeves, both literally and figuratively. The clothing styles from this decade were generally characterized by bright colors (especially orange), loud patterns, and tight fits.

The fashion of the decade was also heavily influenced by disco music; tight clothes made it easy to dance to disco music without having to change outfits every song. This was especially true for men who wanted to wear tight pants and short-sleeved shirts instead of long pants or suits like those commonly seen in other decades.

In terms of clothing materials, polyester became increasingly popular during the decade as it provided an affordable alternative that could be machine washed easily after wearing it out dancing all night long at one's favorite disco club! The rise in popularity led many people to buy clothes made entirely out of this material; however, some critics argue that synthetic fibers like polyester tend not to breathe well and cause sweating problems for those who wear them frequently during hot summer days.

## 1980s

The fashion trends from the 70s continued into the early 80s as people began to experiment with new styles while still holding onto some of their favorite looks from years prior. This was a time when people were especially interested in trying out different hairstyles and makeup options; this interest is often reflected on television through shows like _Saturday Night Live_ (SNL) which featured skits involving fashion trends as part of its comedy routines throughout this period.

Another aspect of 80s fashion was an increase in the use of neon colors to create bold designs that would stand out against other clothes on display at parties or concerts. For example, many people began wearing bright yellow shirts during these years because they believed it made them look like superheroes who had just come back from defeating a villain in outer space! This trend was even reflected by some politicians: former President Ronald Reagan often wore brightly colored shirts when he delivered speeches about his administration's accomplishments during this time period.

## 1990s

The decade of the nineties saw a return to traditionalism in fashion, as people began wearing clothing that was more conservative than those worn during previous years (such as turtleneck sweaters). However, there were still some aspects of 80s-style clothing such as neon colors or tight fits which could be seen from time to time despite this shift away from extreme styles like those seen before.

Another change that occurred during these years was an increased focus on individuality when it came to dressing up; people began to wear clothes not just according to what was popular but also because they wanted their outfits to represent who they were as individuals, rather than just following trends blindly without considering whether or not something fits them properly. This desire for self-expression led many young adults (and even some older ones) away from wearing clothes that had been mass produced by companies like GAP and toward buying more expensive items made by independent designers instead; this was a major shift in the fashion world at large!

## 2000s

The naughties, as they are often called, saw another change in the way people dressed. This time around it wasn't just about individuality but also about comfort; clothing became looser and less structured than before (for example, baggy pants). In addition to this shift towards relaxed attire there was an increasing emphasis placed on sustainability throughout these years; more companies began making clothes out of materials like organic cotton which does not require chemicals or harmful dyes in its production process!

## 2010s

The current decade has seen a shift back towards traditionalism yet again, but this time it's all about comfort. Clothing is still looser than before (for example baggy pants), but now there are many more options available that combine both style and functionality; think athleisure wear or yoga gear!

In addition to being comfortable, today's trendy looks tend towards minimalism – meaning they don't try too hard with colors or patterns. For example, white sneakers paired with jeans seem like an easy go-to look these days because it goes well together and isn't overly complicated.

## 2020s

The future is full of possibilities! It's hard to say what trends will come out on top in the next decade, but one thing is for sure: comfort is still going to be a big factor in how people dress. In addition to being comfortable, today's trendy looks tend towards minimalism – meaning they don't try too hard with colors or patterns. For example, white sneakers paired with jeans seem like an easy go-to look these days because it goes well together and isn't overly complicated.
