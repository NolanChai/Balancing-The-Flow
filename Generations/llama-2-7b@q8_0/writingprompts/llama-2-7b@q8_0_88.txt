1970 all over again. 
 And then, nothing.
 The last thing he remembered was being in some weird house on the beach with the cops banging down the door, and here he was now: lying naked on a bed, an IV needle sticking out of his arm, surrounded by pills, liquor bottles and empty beer cans. 
 Don's eyes focused on a mirror hanging over the dresser in front of him. In it, reflected back to him, was a nude man with a thin mustache and longish blond hair: The young version of himself, he thought. He felt his body and noticed that the muscle tone had all but disappeared. 
 Where were they? Where had he been taken? What kind of hell hole was this? 
 He tried to move, but couldn't. He was strapped down to the bed by leather restraints. His hands, arms and feet were secured at four points on his body, rendering him immobile. 
 And there was a strange smell in the air: A mix of incense and something else that he didn't recognize... 
 Something not human. 
 The memory of that horrific night came rushing back to him—the attack by the beast with bloodshot red eyes, teeth like fangs, a mouth full of long sharp incisors... it had ripped out his throat and nearly killed him before he managed to slit its jugular vein. 
 Was that really all it took? Did this place just heal up wounds? 
 It didn't make sense: He'd been unconscious for several hours, but his body looked as if nothing had happened to him in months... years even! 
 And where was that horrible beast now? Had they gotten rid of it? Or did the thing still lurk about this house and perhaps somewhere else in the surrounding area too? 
 He remembered a large garden out back, with what looked like an old abandoned greenhouse. Maybe something had happened to him there...? 
 Don struggled to sit up on the bed but was stopped by the straps that secured his body to it. He tried to turn his head towards the window and noticed for the first time a small hole in one corner of the curtained window, directly next to the wall. 
 It was large enough to let someone peep inside. 
 Had he been spying on him? 
 What else could they have seen? 
 The truth hit Don with the force of a fist: He'd been raped! 
 He started shivering uncontrollably and tried to yank at his restraints, but his hands were tied tightly behind him. 
 Where was he? Why had they done this? Was he going to die here... like in that other house on the beach? 
 He struggled some more before deciding to try something else: He turned towards the corner of the room where he'd last seen his clothes lying, and screamed out loud: "I want my clothes!" 
 No one answered. There was no response whatsoever! 
 Don then yelled at the top of his lungs: "Where are you? I know you can hear me! I want to get dressed, now!" 
 Again nothing. He'd been left alone and was completely defenseless... 
 Except for the knife he had hidden between his shoulder blades when they brought him here. If he needed it badly enough, Don knew, it could come in handy. 
 It would have to be enough for now. 
 He tried to calm himself down by taking a deep breath and then yelled again: "I want my clothes! I'm going out of here naked!" 
 This time he felt something: The door behind him was being opened. A few moments later, the young man in the mirror appeared in front of Don, holding several pairs of his boxers and pants. He stood there for a moment, looking at him silently, until finally handing him some clothes and leaving again. 
 Don struggled to get dressed, but was still unable to move, so he had to do it himself. It took a lot longer than he'd expected because his body was in shock. The pain felt as if he were burning up inside from the top of his head down to the tips of his toes! 
 When he was finished changing, he sat on the bed and closed his eyes for a moment, trying to regain some control over himself and his thoughts. He knew that if he could find out why they'd brought him here—and how he might escape from this place—then there would be hope for him again... 
 But the problem was: Where had they taken him? Who were these people who'd left him naked on this bed, then gone and put a knife between his shoulder blades? Why hadn't they killed him? Wasn't that what he deserved for what he'd done to that poor woman? 
 Had they been playing with him...? 
 Maybe that was it—maybe the woman he had raped had been in on the joke! 
 But if so, why hadn't she just told them herself? Why had Don had to pay for her crime? 
 Don thought back to all the other times: The many women who'd allowed him to have sex with them. They'd all wanted it—it wasn't his fault that they couldn't say no! 
 He hadn't forced anyone, not even when he was drunk and high on drugs; he'd always asked first whether it was okay or not... 
 But still: Why had this happened to him? And why now? 
 Don could hear himself screaming at the top of his lungs. The sounds were deafening, but no one seemed to care in any way! 
 Maybe he'd been left here as some kind of punishment...? But for what exactly? 
 He remembered everything that had happened with the girl on the beach... how she'd invited him into her house and then tried to seduce him. Don couldn't remember much else except feeling disgusted by the whole experience, and then being attacked! 
 That was it—the girl had been trying to get herself raped... or at least that's what he'd thought at the time! 
 But now he remembered something else: The way she'd acted afterwards. She'd seemed so happy with him, as if nothing had happened between them. It hadn't taken long for her to forget what had happened and start talking about other things again... 
 He could understand that: Don knew how easy it was to fall into a state of denial when something terrible happened! 
 But the truth was still out there—it couldn't be denied forever. And sooner or later, someone would find him here. They wouldn't let him stay like this for long before coming after him... and then what? 
 Don thought back to what had happened to him at that other house: The police had come in and arrested everyone who was there! 
 Were the cops really going to come to his rescue again? Maybe he should have tried harder to get away—but by then it was already too late... 
 And if they didn't help him, what would happen next? What would they do with him then...? 
 He could still feel those sharp incisors biting into the side of his throat and sucking out all the blood... 
 Don felt like he was going to throw up. The smell of his own vomit made it even worse, as did the sound of the man in the mirror laughing at him through a gap between two closed doors on the other end of the hallway. 
 It seemed that for now at least there would be no help coming... 
 No one was going to rescue him from this nightmare!
