 last us a year.
I needed another source of food. If it weren't for that, we would have starved by now. And if this is what happens to me and my child when times are good, what would happen when they get worse? I had always tried to make the best out of whatever circumstances I was in, but I could see that wasn't going to be possible much longer.
I turned on the radio. The news was all bad: war, famine, pestilence and death. I had always taken it for granted that life would go on as normal—that no matter what problems existed, we were safe in America. That was what they said at school. But now things seemed to be spiraling out of control and there wasn't a damned thing anyone could do about it.
I took the child back into my arms and stroked its hair as I thought about my options. In spite of my best efforts, my life had been going downhill for some time—and now I was alone with this child to deal with what would probably be a very short life span. It broke me up, but there were things I couldn't do anything about, and it was better just to accept them and move on.
I decided not to stay in the shelter any longer than necessary. I had been doing that for the past three days because the radio said we were safer down here when they started the bombing. The child was growing thinner by the day as he waited with me, but it didn't seem to bother him too much.
I stood up and stretched. There wasn't much room in the shelter, so I decided against a shower. But I wanted some fresh air before I left for good—so I put on my jacket, grabbed a gas mask from the cabinet above our heads and took the child outside.
The sky was dark gray with smoke; I could see fires burning in the distance. There were people up ahead, standing around looking at something. I joined them and peered through a pair of binoculars that someone had brought along.
It looked like there had been an explosion and everyone who lived in this part of the city was dead. The child said nothing as he pointed to a house nearby where someone had taken shelter; it wasn't safe anymore now that they were gone, so we went back inside ours again. I felt a little bad for the people who lived there—they probably didn't know what hit them when the bomb fell—but I couldn't afford any emotions right then if I was going to survive.
I was sitting on the floor with my legs crossed and leaning against the wall when it happened: something came flying through the air like a missile, but instead of exploding after impact, it simply plowed into the ground. There were no explosives inside of it; just some kind of fuel that ignited when it hit hard enough to shatter glass around it—which was pretty much everywhere in our neighborhood at this point because all windows had been blown out by previous attacks.
The child started crying then, but not out of fear or pain; rather he was afraid we were going to die now too so I held him tight while trying hard not to let go even though my own legs felt like they were about to give way from exhaustion at any moment now.
We huddled together in silence for a few seconds before the child finally spoke: "Dad...I want you to take me back inside our shelter." I nodded without speaking because it would have been difficult enough just getting him through these last few hours, but if we stayed out here much longer there was no way either of us could survive—especially since all electricity had been cut off due to damage sustained by the nuclear attack.
I grabbed the child's hand and led him inside our shelter once more where he immediately curled up against my body while I sat cross-legged on top of my bed mattress so that both our heads were just above ground level—which meant any radiation would pass right through us without harming either one in particular (though it was still possible we could get sick if exposed long enough).
When morning came around again after spending another night trapped inside this cramped space with no food or water left, I began making plans for how best to continue surviving until help arrived—but even before daybreak had finally given way to light, I knew one thing: there wasn't going to be any more time left than what we already had because it felt like every second counted now.
