 in the garden at our house enjoying the warmth of the sun as I had been reading for some time now. My brother who is an architect by trade has a particular interest in architecture and history of which he studies in his free time, he had just finished with what we have come to know as 'The Rise Of The West' and was sitting on the other side of me looking at the same book. 
 
 He had been studying all of history in this way for some time now, focusing on the rise of Rome to its eventual fall. I think it is fair to say he has become somewhat obsessed with these sort of things. My brother has a passion for architecture and design and even when he isn't looking at books like that he looks to be learning as much about it as he can, this means we see each other on the internet a lot more than you might think. He is studying at an Architecture School in California so I am usually up later than him reading these days, I have been trying my hand at writing lately and hope to one day write something that will get published (in my spare time haha). 
 
 Well this morning we had a good long chat about the history of Rome and what had happened there over the course of the years it had been in power. My brother was telling me about all the great buildings and works of art they created and then suddenly he said 'what is that?' and pointed to an image on his book. I looked up and saw it too, it was a picture from around 1700AD. 
 
 It was a building in Rome, not a normal one either. It seemed almost like a ruin at first but the closer we got the more I could see what he meant by saying 'great', the detailing of this building was absolutely amazing to say the least and it looked as if it were new and hadn't been there in any photo or picture that i had seen before. 
 
 My brother said 'you won't believe me when I tell you what I think its purpose is' and at first i didn't but then he told me, he said the building was a sort of machine, he explained further and said the reason for this building looking like it had been there forever wasn't because it was old, but rather that it was hidden from sight. This building had been designed to look old to those who did not know its true purpose. He told me about how this building would have looked from the ground, from a distance and he said it would be almost impossible to see that anything was there at all. 
 
 As we continued looking at pictures and books, my brother took out another book which had been lying on his lap all this time. I started reading it over his shoulder and i couldn't believe what i saw when i read the title. It said 'The Rise And Fall of The West: A New Theory.' He handed me a picture of the building that i could have never seen before, he had taken it from a satellite image and i was amazed at how clear the image looked. I stared in disbelief, this was an unbelievable theory to be true, but it just wasn't possible that these pictures were old and someone had made them look like they were older than they were. 
 
 It took me a few seconds to understand what he was saying but then i got it, 'the building is still there, the entire city is still there!' I couldn't believe this was true. We sat down and looked over the pictures for about an hour or so, we had found out that this amazing ancient city of Rome had been built with a purpose which no one had ever imagined before. The purpose of it being to hide itself from those who did not know what they were looking at. 
 
 I thought to myself as i sat there reading about the theory; 'wouldn't it be great if this was true, but how could we possibly find out for sure?' We both knew that this discovery would be one of a kind and the two of us would not have been able to keep our mouths shut about it. 
 
 The idea behind the theory is that Rome had built this building and city in order to hide from anyone who didn't know what they were looking at, so that people wouldn't know that Rome still existed somewhere. But how could we prove this? It wasn't until a few years later that i came across an old article on my brothers laptop which mentioned something about 'The Great Pyramid Of Rome.' 
 
 The pyramid was the most well known and popular building in all of history, it had been built as a tomb for pharaohs and also as one of the seven wonders. It was famous around the world and people traveled to Egypt just to see this amazing wonder, however i found that no one knew about this pyramid being hidden by Rome for centuries before. 
 
 I read on further in my brothers article and it said 'it is believed that The Great Pyramid Of Giza was built as a tomb for a pharaoh who died around the same time as the building of this wonder, but in fact it may have been built by Rome to hide its existence from those who did not know what they were looking at. This pyramid could be one of the oldest and most famous buildings in history.' 
 
 As i read on further about the theory i found out that many other wonders had also been built for a purpose similar to this, but it wasn't until we went to Italy ourselves to see if any of these places were still standing that we saw proof that what my brother had told me years before was in fact true. 
 
 We visited Rome and found out that the great city had not been destroyed by wars or time, as many believed. It was hidden from view for centuries, only for us to find it today with the help of our technology and satellite images. The buildings which i saw on my brothers computer were actually real buildings in this ancient city! 
 
 I thought about what we had found out after reading these articles; 'if there are buildings that have been hidden from sight for centuries, then who knows what else is still hiding today?' It seems that many things could be built in a way so that they look like they were made thousands of years before. There has been a lot of talk about the possibility of time travel being true but i think it's more likely than we thought. 
 
 I know this theory might seem farfetched to some people, but if you look at how many buildings and wonders there are in history that have been built by Rome then why not consider the possibility? Perhaps someone will find out more about these hidden places in time before too long. Who knows what else is out there waiting to be discovered?
