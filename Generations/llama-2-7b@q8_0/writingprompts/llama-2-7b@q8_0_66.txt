 go... before it gets away again, I think. '' You say in a very serious tone of voice.
After some time you arrive at a huge plain filled with ruins. The entire area has been covered by a massive sand storm which made things much harder to spot. Fortunately for your party, Nyarlothep's treasure is easily spotted as there are two gigantic tents near the ruined temple that was being guarded by the giant crab.
You and your companions approach one of them while the others wait outside. The tent looks to be made out of some type of thick woven fabric, though it is easy for you to see through. It seems to have a very strange interior layout, with several small rooms leading up towards a larger main area.
It appears that there's another giant crab inside the tent... but not just any ordinary one! This creature was enormous, easily more than twice the size of its smaller brethren. In addition this one seemed to have been fused together with some kind of massive treasure chest, with several other chests stacked atop each other and held in place by what looked like a giant spider.
The crab turns towards you as soon as it senses your presence, but doesn't attack. Instead its mouth opens and the large round object inside comes out and drops to the ground! The object itself was about two feet across and made from gold... a perfect sphere in fact. You can see a tiny hole on the side of the thing and then suddenly it opens up into an immense treasure chest which you had no idea could exist.
>Take the huge treasure chest to the outside!
>Wait for your companions to come back.
>Tell Bruntus to help you get the chest to where the others are waiting...
>Take the other treasures and leave now that you've got what you came for.
>Slice the crab open and try and find out if it's just been storing treasure or has anything else going on inside of it!

We don't know if there is something inside it, but we do know that the crab is not going to be happy about us taking its prize away from it.

>Tell Bruntus to help you get the chest to where the others are waiting... You say in a very serious tone of voice. ``We need to take this back to our friends, now!'' You say while pointing at the giant treasure hoard.
``Uhhh... sure. But I ain't helping nobody with it if that thing's gonna be hurtin'. '' Bruntus says as he grabs the gold object from where it had fallen and starts to walk out of the tent. You follow behind him, trying not to make any noise while doing so. The sandstorm has died down since you arrived in this place though... it seems that the entire area is quiet aside from the crashing waves and wind.
As you come closer to where your companions were waiting, you realize that there's an even larger tent set up not too far away from them. In fact it looks almost like a city was built here by some great civilization... or at least what's left of it. You can see the outline of a temple on one side and then a large tower right beside it with what appears to be several smaller domed buildings near it as well.
There also seems to be something wrong with this giant tent though, as there is some kind of ripple in its walls that makes them seem like they're made out of water! You can tell that there's no way the creatures inside could have done anything to damage such a large structure, so what exactly was causing it?
You get close enough to see your friends standing outside waiting for you, but their eyes are turned towards something else. You follow their gaze and then realize why they were looking in that direction! The huge treasure hoard is being carried over by one of the smaller crabs which is now making its way to where your friends are waiting.
Once it's there it makes a noise similar to what you heard from the one guarding the entrance earlier and then opens up into a large treasure chest that seems to have been fused together with the body of this giant creature!
The creature itself remains silent but its eyes glow red as if it was angry. It then turns around, leaving the large golden chest behind where it stands and starts walking away from your group towards another smaller tent near them which is made out of some type of thick woven fabric, though it's easy for you to see through.
You watch this crab closely as it gets closer, but the sandstorm has died down since you arrived in this place so everything seems quiet aside from crashing waves and wind. The creature keeps walking towards its tent until suddenly a giant metal door opens up! It then walks inside with another crab coming out to take its place atop an enormous treasure chest which was being guarded by several other smaller crabs outside this building before they left for some reason...

>>Tell the others that you're going in to look around inside. This is a trap we are not falling into again! You say in a very serious tone of voice. ``I'm going in to take a quick peek, but I won't be long... so don't go in there yourself or else we might have some problems!''
You say while pointing at the large tent where one of your friends was heading towards with what looks like a bunch of treasure. ``I can handle myself and these guys will watch our backs, though you might wanna wait outside just in case something happens?'' You say as you walk up to the entrance of this building and begin looking around inside.
The first thing that catches your attention is how bright it is... much brighter than any normal tent would be! You see that there's a large circular window on one side which lets in sunlight from outside, but then you realize that the walls themselves are made out of something that reflects light back at you instead.
You also notice some kind of writing painted onto them, though it's in an unknown language. As you continue looking around inside though, you see that there is much more to this place than just its exterior! It seems like every single surface is covered with decorations, statues and even some strange pieces of machinery scattered all over the place.
You also notice several cages full of what appears to be slaves as well... or at least captives from another civilization? They are bound together with metal chains but they seem happy enough despite being kept here for who knows how long? You can see that their faces have been painted white and then some kind of symbol has been drawn onto each one.
You continue walking towards the middle area where you notice a large stone table made out of gold, silver, and even some other rare metals! There also seems to
