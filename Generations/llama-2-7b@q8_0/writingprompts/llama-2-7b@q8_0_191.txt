 that morning and took my sister and mom into town. My wife and her grandma stayed back home and prepared for the day. It was very emotional when we arrived at the church as you can imagine with this type of occasion, but even worse knowing my dad had been there many times before in his life to witness other funerals. 
 We went through a lot of the same people who were there during our father's visitation on Thursday. A lot of my family was out of state or out of town so it was very difficult for all of us, but especially hard for my wife as she had just lost her grandfather and now was losing another one of her grandparents. We drove back home to the house and spent the next couple hours trying to get everything ready and organized with everyone else before we left for the graveside service later that day. 
 The family decided it would be better for my wife's mom, aunts, uncles and cousins to take a van and follow us in a second vehicle as they were all leaving early from work or had classes, etc.. They were very happy to help because we knew this was going to be an emotionally draining day. The trip went by very fast but it also felt like it lasted forever with the thoughts of losing two family members over such a short period of time and in different ways. 
 We arrived at the cemetery about twenty minutes after my wife and her mom had left for their vehicle. I'm not sure how many people we had in our immediate family, but there was about thirty-five in total that had gathered together to witness this very difficult occasion. 
 As everyone started to walk over to the gravesite I began to notice a few things... it was the middle of January and it was forty degrees outside with snow on the ground; my dad's best friend, a man he grew up with in his youth, had died six days earlier from complications after brain surgery; the only reason there were so many people at my dad's gravesite today was because I had a lot of family who lived out of state and came back for this occasion; most importantly, it felt like all of these events were connected somehow but I couldn't explain exactly why. 
 As we made our way to the open grave I took notice of the snow falling from the sky and how beautiful it looked as each flake fell from the sky towards us. It was a very peaceful feeling knowing that my dad had been waiting for this moment, he died on a Friday night so by Monday morning when the sun was shining brightly in the morning sky, he could see his new home...the land of the saints. 
 During the ceremony I felt like we were all watching a movie or something because it seemed like things that had happened previously and throughout my life just fell into place as they should be. It was the first time I can remember hearing my dad's best friend's voice on tape since he had passed away earlier in the week. We all cried together as one of his brothers spoke and even though this was a sad occasion, it was also a very happy day because we knew we would see him again when Jesus returns to the earth. 
 The funeral home staff asked if they could use a song I wrote for my dad's visitation service which was fine with us since he loved his music and was always singing along with whatever the radio station played. After the ceremony everyone left except for my wife, her mom, my brother-in-law, sister, aunts and uncles to say our final goodbyes as they had done with their grandpa just five days earlier at his funeral. 
 Everyone started leaving one by one after about twenty minutes until there was just the three of us standing over his grave. We talked for quite some time before finally saying goodbye. I told my wife and her mom to wait in the car while I walked around one last time and made sure everything looked okay as we were going back home with him for a few days before burying him. 
 As I was walking around the cemetery, it felt like he was standing next to me showing me how beautiful his new home was, what was waiting for us when we got there. It had been raining pretty hard since we arrived so all of the roads and sidewalks were covered in puddles which gave off an eerie feeling that something bad was going on or about to happen. I don't know why but as soon as I walked over to my dad's grave, I turned around and there was a man standing just out of view behind the bushes with his arms outstretched towards me saying 'hey it's okay'. He then disappeared into thin air which left me shaken up for quite some time. 
 As we got back in the car to leave my wife said she wanted to say goodbye one more time so I told her that was fine since she hadn't yet seen him and I didn't think it would hurt anything if she did. We pulled into the cemetery again where there were quite a few people gathered around the grave site for his service later that day, but my dad had already been lowered down into the ground before we arrived. 
 We drove home and stayed in our bedroom for about four hours just talking and reminiscing over some of the great times with him growing up, which were plentiful to say the least. My wife's grandpa passed away on a Thursday so she had spent the weekend at his funeral and today at my dad's; she had hardly eaten anything for the past 48 hours or slept very much either which was taking its toll on her body. 
 I could see that this was going to be an extremely difficult day for her but after talking with my sister, brother-in-law and aunt earlier in the day about how we should spend our time together before he is buried they suggested that she go back upstairs so everyone else could spend some more quality time together. I felt like this would be good idea since it was just too much for all of us to take on at once but with her being the youngest in the family (she's twenty-two), I knew this was going to be hard for her because she didn't want anyone else to see him before she did. 
 I had a feeling that if we waited any longer it would start snowing again which seemed like it was very unlikely since it had been raining most of the day, but as soon as we walked into our living room I could tell it was about to start up because there were large clouds overhead and wind picking up at an alarming rate. The house was dark except for the Christmas lights hanging on our front door which made things look even more eerie. 
 We decided to take a nap before my wife's grandma arrived so we could get some rest before she came over later that evening since this would be her last chance to see him as well before he was laid to rest tomorrow morning with full military honors at the local cemetery next door where many veterans are buried.

BACK HOME AGAIN IN AMERICA
We woke up around midnight that night and went back into our bedroom, but it was already dark outside so we decided to stay up for a while before going to sleep again because I knew things were about to get very busy with my dad being buried tomorrow morning at the cemetery where all of his family is buried as well. It had been snowing for quite some time now and everything outside looked like it was covered in white powder which gave off a very strange feeling that something bad might happen before we got there or after we arrived back home again with him later on today. 
 My wife said she wanted to take another walk around town so I told her if she needed anything from me just let me know because I'd be up all night watching the clock tick away until it was finally time for us to leave and head off for his funeral tomorrow morning. She went out into the hallway where everyone had been sleeping before heading back downstairs again so they could stay there until we left or until her grandma got home from work which ever happened first. 
 I laid on my bed thinking about what was going to happen next as my wife walked around town alone at night during a snow storm with only one other person nearby who might be able to help if something went wrong, but when it comes down to life and death situations like this, there's really nothing you can do except pray for strength so your mind stays focused on whatever needs doing next. I had already made arrangements earlier that day after speaking with my aunt about what would happen at her house where we were going to bury him tomorrow morning since they live just minutes away from us here in town which makes this whole thing go much easier than if it was somewhere else in the country or out of state. 
 I tried to stay awake until around two o'clock before falling asleep because my wife hadn't come back upstairs yet but when she did arrive later that morning, she had already taken care of everything herself and made sure we were ready for whatever might happen next which was nice since it gave me time to rest and think about what needed doing while I waited around all day for her grandma to get home from work.
