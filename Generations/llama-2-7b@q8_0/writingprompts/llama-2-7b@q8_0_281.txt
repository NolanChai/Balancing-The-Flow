otting up my shirt right there. 
 
 My dad was kind of a big deal in the neighborhood so people knew who we were and stuff and I remember this guy yelling out to my mom, "Hey! What's your daughter doing on the roof?" And I guess she didn't want him to know because he said something like, "Hmmm. You sure? She don't seem old enough to me." 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, but it was a big deal back then and stuff. 
 
 Oh yeah! It was big time. And Mike here couldn't even walk without holding on to something. 
 
 I did all the heavy lifting. 
 
 What? No, don't be stupid. Of course you didn't. You were just a little girl. I helped her but I wasn't the only one. 
 
 Yeah, there was like two other guys and we got in a lot of trouble. My mom always told me that she loved it when people saw us working together and they'd say something nice to my dad or something because that meant he was doing his job well. 
 
 Yeah, but you know what? He didn't really do anything. Like he didn't have to work hard at all. I mean, sure we worked our asses off but when it came time for him to put the roof on by himself? Nothing. 
 
 Oh no, that was just you two. But I gotta tell ya something real quick here. We got into a lot of trouble with that roof. We almost didn't finish it at all because of what we did one night but luckily there were some guys working for my dad so he took care of everything and told them not to say nothing, you know? 
 
 Yeah, I know. He was always like that. I guess he didn't want his reputation to go down any more than it already had. 
 
 I think it did. 
 
 What do you mean it did? 
 
 Well, I mean, look at this place. Look around. This is nothing but a shithole! We gotta get out of here. Come on! 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah. Okay. Let's go.
