read, but it did have one negative aspect: he never got to go home at night. 
 One day Teddy came to work only to find that all the staff were gone.  "Hey, what gives?" thought teddy.  
 So Teddy decided to investigate and started wandering around. It was not long before he found a door that had no name on it.  Teddy thought to himself "What is behind this door?  Who knows where I am going to end up!"  so with courage in his heart, he knocked three times and walked through the door. 
 A few minutes later an old man came running over from a nearby room and shouted: "I told you not to open that door!"  but Teddy didn't hear him as the old man was too far away. 
 Teddy could n't believe what had happened, he had walked into the office of his boss! Teddy was worried; would he be in trouble?  "I hope so" thought teddy. "If I get fired, then at least I will have a job to go home too!"  
 The boss was very happy that someone had finally come into his office. He decided to make it easier for Teddy and let him stay there rather than in the staff room! 
 So the next morning Teddy arrived bright eyed and bushy tailed, as he knew he would have a warm bed with fluffy pillows and hot cups of tea waiting for him.  
 But all was not as it seemed; his boss was the devil. He had brought Teddy into the office because he wanted to steal his soul! 
 One evening as Teddy walked down the stairs, he heard a loud bang behind him and looked over his shoulder in alarm. The staircase he was walking on had vanished into thin air; he had been standing on it all along.  He was now at the bottom of the stairs!  
 As soon as Teddy had calmed down he realised that there were no other doors in this room and so the only way out was to climb back upstairs again. The devil must have seen his hesitation and decided not to bother him anymore.  "Well, I'm going home now" thought teddy as he climbed back onto the staircase and started walking upstairs.  
 As soon as he reached the top of the stairs Teddy realised that this was no ordinary set of stairs! They were a magical staircase; they had disappeared again but they were now heading in a completely different direction from where they went before. 
 Suddenly Teddy came across a door with no name on it, just like the one he had seen before. He knocked three times and walked through the door to discover that his boss was standing there waiting for him!  
 The devil said: "I don't think I will be keeping you after all."  Teddy thought this was strange because he did n't know why not; but then realised that the devil had been planning on stealing his soul. He had put Teddy in an impossible situation and so now had to let him go! 
 The next morning Teddy arrived at work as usual, but when he entered his bosses office he was surprised to find it empty! There was no one there for Teddy to talk to or even be angry with; all the staff were gone again!  
 "I'm glad that's over" thought teddy. "I did n't like being alone, and I hate not knowing who I am going to work with from day to day."  He hoped he would never walk into another door with no name on it ever again...
