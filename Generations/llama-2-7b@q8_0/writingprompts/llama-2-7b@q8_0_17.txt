 but he has ceased listening.
He cannot breathe, or move for a moment. The room seems to spin around him. He looks at the clock on his desk and sees that he has been here far too long. But still he remains, with the woman standing before him, holding onto her words like she is grasping for life itself.
He does not know what he had expected when they met this morning, but this was not it. He would have preferred to be given a chance to think, rather than having his entire day disrupted by unforeseen events.
He is a man of reason and logic; the woman before him has none of these qualities. He shakes his head in wonder and sadness at what she just said. This woman will not be leaving until she gets her answers, which means that he will be staying with her as well. And he does not like it one bit!
He takes a deep breath and lets out the air in a long sigh. “I would love to tell you all about my past, but I do not remember much of what happened to me after my accident. However, I am very interested in finding out where exactly my memories are from. If it helps at all, I feel as if they have been removed and hidden away for a reason.”
She seems to be deep in thought for several seconds. Finally she looks back up at him, her face filled with sadness. “That is the thing…I can’t tell you where your memories are from,” she tells him softly. He frowns.
“Why not? That would seem like a very important piece of information to have.” “Because I don’t know. I just know they’re not with me anymore.” This is so frustrating, but there is something about her that makes it hard for him to give up on his mission. He feels like he needs this woman by his side right now, even if she isn’t much help at all.
“Well then let me get you some coffee or tea and see what we can come up with together,” says the man calmly as he stands up from behind his desk. “It looks like it will take a while to sort through everything anyway.” He turns towards her briefly before returning back to his computer screen; his mind racing wildly trying figure out how this all happened, where she came from and why she was chosen by the mysterious organization that hired him for this mission in particular.
