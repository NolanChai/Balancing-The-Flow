ispily in the breeze. The sun was shining through the windows with such intensity that it left a shadow on the floor.
I strolled downstairs and into the kitchen to discover breakfast laid out for me by my mother. I poured myself some coffee, took a sip, then sat down at the table. My parents were already there eating their own breakfast.
`` What's wrong with you?'' Dad asked. `` You look like hell.''
I laughed and shook my head. `` I was up late last night with work,'' I replied, staring into my coffee cup.
`` Work again?'' Mom said. She looked at me over her glasses as she cut another slice of toast for herself. `` What are you working on now, anyway?''
I shrugged. `` Some sort of mystery story,'' I muttered, barely listening to what they were saying anymore.
`` We're getting a phone call from Grandma in about an hour or so,'' Dad informed me as he finished his breakfast and stood up from the table. `` We'll be going over to her place right after that for some brunch. You coming?''
I shook my head. `` Nope, I'm not hungry today. Besides, you guys go on without me. I need to get back to work.''
Mom and Dad glanced at each other, then nodded as they left the room, leaving me alone at the table. The sun was starting to creep up toward its apex in the sky, which made the whole place seem rather gloomy.
I stared down into my cup and sipped some more coffee. I hadn't realized how hungry I actually was until just now. I thought about calling for something at McDonalds, then shrugged it off. They wouldn't be open yet anyway. Instead, I decided to head over to the local library to check out a few books in order to fuel my writing.
I sighed as I got up from the table and walked into the living room. The sun had just started its descent back towards the horizon by now, casting a shadow on the floor that was beginning to darken slightly. It wasn't very hot yet; it was still fairly chilly out even though the summer season had already begun.
I pulled my jacket on and headed outside for some fresh air. My house was located near the edge of town, at the end of a short lane that connected to the main street. I didn't mind living in such an isolated place, because it made me feel like I could think more clearly. It helped with my writing process too, especially now that I had started getting so deeply involved in the plot as well.
My house was just a few blocks from the library itself; I walked over there and entered through one of the many doors on either side. The place was always quite crowded this time of day, mostly because it's when most people went to read books or do research for school projects. There were several large tables scattered throughout the building that usually held a few students at a time; it didn't take long before I found myself sitting down beside one such table as well.
I opened up my laptop and started typing away furiously, trying to get everything onto paper before my fingers wore out completely! As usual, my mind was racing with ideas about what should happen next in the storyline; if only there were more time in which I could write it all down...
It took a while for me to realize that my heart was beating so quickly and that sweat had started pouring from underneath my shirt collar. A quick glance around confirmed why this might have been happening: everyone else who was working on their own projects seemed just as distracted by the same thing!
`` Oh no,'' I said out loud before I could stop myself from saying it. `` This is bad...''
