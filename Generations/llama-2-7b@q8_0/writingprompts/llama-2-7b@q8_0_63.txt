stand, tears began to pour from my eyes. It seemed as though he had no idea how much I loved him or how much he meant to me, but at that moment I knew there was no way of telling him, for I could hardly talk. I wanted so badly for him to understand the feeling in my heart and the tears would not stop.
John stood up from his chair and walked towards the kitchen sink. "Are you okay?" He asked in an unsure tone, as if he were scared that he might say or do something wrong. I nodded yes and sat back down at the table, wiping the tears from my eyes with a tissue.
John walked over to me and knelt down on one knee, his hand reaching out to hold mine. He gently kissed my tear-stained face, then wrapped his arms around me and drew me close to him. "What's wrong baby? Tell me what is troubling you." I looked up into those hazel eyes that could tell me everything. "Nothing," I whispered.
John pulled away from me and stood up, taking my hand in his once again. He walked over the the sink, pulling me along with him. John began to turn on the faucet, letting the water run hot and cold as he washed our dishes. The sound of running water muffled his voice. "I'm sorry I worried you baby." I squeezed his hand and gave him a small smile, trying my best not to cry in front of him again.
"What is it that's troubling you? Is there something you want to tell me?" John turned around with a puzzled look on his face. "I don't know what I would do without you. I love you so much, but I just can't seem to make you happy." My voice began to crack and the tears continued to stream down my cheeks. "Please don't cry baby, you are hurting me by doing this," John pleaded, trying to comfort me with his soft touch.
John turned off the water in the sink and placed a hand on my shoulder, rubbing it gently. He leaned against the counter-top and rested his elbows on the surface, looking at me. "I don't know what to say or do." His words seemed so empty, as if they were being choked out through his lips.
John wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me closer to him. He bent down and placed a kiss on my forehead. I looked up into those hazel eyes once again and could not help but smile at him. I had never seen John so unsure of himself before; it made my heart swell with love for him.
"What if we went away for the weekend?" He asked, still looking down at me. "I think you need some rest baby," he said in a soft tone. I nodded yes and looked up into his eyes, wanting to tell him how much he meant to me but could not get the words out.
John kissed me once again and held onto me as if he would never let go. The sound of the water running was muffled by the softness of his breath on my cheek. I reached up with one hand and began to gently caress his face, feeling it warm beneath mine.
