However, I am now stuck in the void! I can move around in it, but after 5 minutes my character starts running around like crazy (he is invisible, though). If you get stuck in there too, just use teleport to escape it. The void is just a strange side-effect of an infinite space, and cannot be interacted with, and I can't really do anything about that at this time.
EDIT: You should not die from this glitch. Your character will continue running around until you move again. It does not "freeze" in one spot.
EDIT2: This has been fixed, thanks to @Ashes_Fall who reported it!
This is a strange glitch that can occur if you have an area that has more than 300 tiles. After teleporting into the void for some reason your character will start running around like crazy.
Thank you all for reporting this issue. I am currently testing this fix, but it may take me a while to get back to you because my laptop is old and slow and I'm not always home when I can play test.
