ssion and torture. A cruel general, he ordered the execution of anyone who opposed his regime. The New Way was born. His most ruthless act would be to ban books as a means of keeping the population docile.

 In 2015, he had just been overthrown by the Rebels and their leader, President Nimble, and peace has once again reigned in the land.

 Our hero, Ikari, is a young boy who had just come across a book that was banned, and the rulers were trying to find out where he got it from. In order to escape persecution for his crime of having the book, he goes into hiding with a family. 
 
 While in hiding, Ikari is discovered by Kino, an elderly man who runs a small inn on the beach. Kino decides to take him in and let him live at their home in exchange for helping them out around the inn and keeping it safe from robbers that might come their way. 
 
 With time, Ikari learns more about his new family, and as well as himself. He slowly gains confidence in himself to pursue his dream of becoming a great novelist like Kino. In fact, one of the main reasons he left home was because his father told him not to write or draw anymore due to his own lacking skills as an artist.

 But, this is the New Way; and though peace has finally been achieved by President Nimble, it seems that things are about to change again soon.

 This story follows Ikari's struggles in pursuing his dreams while also living in constant fear of being discovered by General Iso's army.
