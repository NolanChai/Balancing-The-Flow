 be one helluva weekend, that's for sure.
I popped a mint into my mouth and let it dissolve slowly. Then I closed my eyes and listened to the rain hammering against the window panes while I waited for my hostess to join me in front of the fireplace. The weather forecast had been pretty gloomy, but this wasn't going to stop her from turning up on timeâ€”she'd already proven as much once before.
I smiled and reached for another mint. As if she knew that I was thinking about her, my hostess arrived in the form of a black cat with amber eyes and long hair. It jumped into my lap, curled up there, and purred happily as it waited for me to open the tin of mints so that it could take its pick.
"This is going to be fun," I said out loud.
I had a feeling this weekend was going to be anything but boring.
