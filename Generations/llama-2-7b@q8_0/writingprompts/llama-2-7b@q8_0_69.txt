 fthe hallway he opened one and motioned for us to go inside. He stood aside as I entered.
The room was small and cluttered with odd items, all neatly arranged in rows against the wall. A single table sat in the center of the floor beneath a hanging light bulb. On it rested an object that made me stop short. It was the largest skull I had ever seen, twice as large as any human head I’d ever come across and at least three times more massive than any animal cranium I’d witnessed before. The eyes of the skeleton were small, but seemed to stare right through me with a fiery intensity I did not like at all.
“This is just one of them,” said the tall man. He stood with arms folded in front of me as I examined the skull. “There’s several more.”
“Are they real?” I asked. The room suddenly felt very confining, and my mind raced for an escape plan. If there were really any other skulls in the house, I might be able to make a break for it, but if these bones were just a collection of props… “You said you’d been here before.”
“I was sent once,” he told me. “But they weren’t real.”
I stared at him and saw that his eyes were not the same as those of the skull. They held an intelligence, but there was something behind them, a presence I couldn’t quite comprehend. I glanced down for reassurance only to find it missing. The floor beneath me was empty and cold.
“This is the last time,” he said calmly. “I will not return.”
My voice shook as I spoke, my tongue becoming thick in my mouth. “What do you want?” It was an impossible question; what could anyone want here? But my eyes were on the door behind me, and there would be no other exit once it closed.
He motioned to the skeleton. “I am curious about the skull.”
“Curious?” My mind spun with confusion. I turned back toward him. His mouth was curved in a smile, but it lacked warmth and was not for me at all.
“You can take it,” he said simply. “They’ve never come after you before.”
The words were spoken so softly that for a moment the only thing I heard was the blood pounding loudly in my ears. The skull seemed to glow beneath the fluorescent bulb as if lit from within. I took a step closer and touched the bone, running my fingers over it’s surface. It was smooth, but cold, and I stepped back, afraid to get too close.
“What do you think?” The tall man asked. “Do you want it?”
My mind was still spinning. Was he serious? Didn’t he know that taking the skull meant risking everything? If there really were more of these things, I might never make it home alive! My fingers curled around the handle of my pen knife and I drew the blade from its sheath.
“It would be a shame if you hurt yourself,” said the tall man. He folded his arms again in front of him as he waited for an answer, and I looked to the skull once more, staring down at the empty eye sockets and wondering what it would feel like to have its gaze turn upon me.
I was afraid of many things in that house: The tall man, the silence, the empty floor, but most of all…most of all, I was afraid of the skulls eyes. And in spite of everything else, in spite of every rational thought that had come before, my fingers tightened around the pen knife and I stepped toward him with a determination I did not understand.
I raised my hand over his face and held it there, motionless.
The tall man said nothing as he waited for me to draw the blade across his cheek. My arm began to shake. I glanced down at the skull once more. It was silent and still, staring out from behind me with it’s empty eyes, and in my fear I could not tell if that gaze was anger or pity.
“Please,” said the tall man. “Put it away.” He held his hand up as he spoke, but did not move to try and stop me.
I knew I should put down the knife. It wasn’t real, no one would get hurt if I used it on him; it was just a game to see how far I could go. But the skull was there in front of me, so close I could almost feel its breath upon my face.
“I have been here before,” said the tall man. “You can take it.”
His voice held something different now, something more…something more like sadness. And when he reached out to touch my hand as if to calm me down, I did not know why. But still I drew the knife across his cheek and his face spun with pain. A cry of anguish escaped his lips and he pulled away from me, dropping to one knee at the floor in front of him.
“I’m sorry,” I whispered as he clutched at the side of his head. His blood began to pool across the tiles beneath us and the skull seemed to glow more brightly still. “It wasn’t real…”
He wiped the tears from his eyes with a shaking hand. “Of course it was.” He looked up at me as he spoke, his face still flushed. “This is very real.”
I stood silent before him. I had been so afraid of what might happen if I used the knife upon this stranger and now…now, when I realized that nothing truly awful would come of it, my own blood ran cold with regret.
“You can take it,” he repeated quietly as I stared down at the skull. It seemed to be smiling. “They’ve never come after you before.”
