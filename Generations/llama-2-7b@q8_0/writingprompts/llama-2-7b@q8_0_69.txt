. It's adorable and makes me so happy every time I walk into the house!
The other day, she brought home a piece of art that she was very proud of. It looked like an abstract painting to me. The colors were all muted but very well chosen and it looked almost 3-dimensional. After a little coaxing, she told me that it was her picture of the rainbow! I thought it was a great example of what "art" is; when you're drawing something from your mind, not simply copying what you see on the paper before you.
The point of this post? It's okay for kids to be creative. We can encourage them in that, we should let them have fun with their art and never tell them they aren't doing it "right". I don't want her to think she needs to draw realistically. This is what she sees when the sun shines through a rainbow after all!
It was very special for me to see my little girl so proud of herself. We had a good talk about that too, and how if someone tells you your art looks "weird", they really just mean it's not their style. It doesn't mean it is bad or wrong. She thought that was pretty cool!
