 long stretch of motorway with no turning off for miles. 
 How does this work? 
 I glance up at the map again to check where I am now and where my destination is, then realise with a feeling of dread what this means. This route is all one way: it's only possible to travel from London westwards on the M4.
`` Shit!'' I say aloud in despair as I look up the road ahead at the heavy traffic flowing through Heathrow.
I pull a U-turn and start heading east. A few minutes later, I see my destination: the exit for the M25 southbound. But when I get there, it's jammed solid with traffic and I can't get in. I sigh again and pull over to the side of the road. There must be another way. I take out the map and start looking at it more carefully.
It is, but not much good to me now. I can see how far away my destination is on the map – too far for this journey without a plane or train.
I do the only thing I know of to try: I head in the opposite direction. It's a long way back and I haven't got all day, but at least it will take me somewhere nearby where I might be able to get help finding a way out.
I sit there for several hours, but nothing is moving anywhere near my destination, so eventually I decide that I should head in the other direction and start making plans how to do this. It's an uncomfortable journey and by the time I reach the point where it was I first attempted to get home from, I am exhausted and grumpy. But at least now I know something of what I want to do.
This is not the first time I have been stranded far from my home in this way. The first time I tried travelling on foot across Europe, I got hopelessly lost somewhere in southern France for a week, before making my escape by climbing into a cargo train.
The second time was when I had to fly back from Moscow after a conference and then found myself without the right visa to get anywhere else in the USSR, so was stranded in Riga until an English-speaking Latvian businessman offered me his spare room for as long as I needed.
This third time is worse – there isn't any other place that I can think of which I know well enough to stay at for a few days. The only place I know anywhere near my destination is Oxford, and I am not going there again on foot!
I don't know how I will get home now; all I can do is keep heading in the right direction.
This is what it must be like to live on Mars with no spaceships or teleporters – you simply have to stay where you are.
As I sit on my chair in my hotel room, gazing out of the window at the London skyline across the river, I feel very far from home indeed. 
Chapter One: The first night
I am hungry and tired as I wander along the street with no clear idea where I am going. It's not like me to be lost in this place; but then it isn't often that I have been here at all, never mind alone for days. It is a long time since I was last here and I don't recognise any of the buildings or shops around me.
I pass a couple of people on the pavement, dressed in similar clothes to my own: dark trousers and black t-shirt with the sleeves rolled up. They seem as lost as me; it looks like they have been here for longer than I have. But then they are probably just visiting this city too – tourists.
I turn a corner and see something on the next street that catches my eye: a cafe window with lots of different types of bread on display, alongside big plastic tubs of jam and peanut butter, and jars of honey. I'm getting hungry and desperately want a sandwich!
I step inside to find the place is empty apart from one woman who is sitting behind the counter and reading a newspaper. There isn't anyone else around. It looks like it has been open for some time, since there are lots of dirty dishes in the sink. I get to the front of the queue: `` How do you want your sandwich?'' the woman asks me.
`` With bread and butter please!'' I reply, laughing at my joke. She doesn't seem amused by it as she says, `` You don't have any money!'' and starts to walk away. I follow her to the counter and say that I do actually have some cash with me.
`` Then get a cup of tea while you wait for me to make your sandwich,'' she replies in English without turning around to look at me. `` It's not ready yet.''
She starts cleaning up some dirty dishes from the sink and then walks away into another room behind the counter where she can be heard talking with someone else I assume is working here too.
`` I want tea!'' I shout, but they don't reply at all so I start looking around to see if there are any other cafes nearby that might serve food. There isn't anyone here who speaks my language or seems willing to help me get something to eat; it's going to be another long wait!
It feels like the longest wait ever as I sit alone in this place with nothing to do but stare at the dirty dishes being washed by someone behind one of those white screens that you see in all cafes around here. They must work really hard because there are so many things they have to clean – from plates and glasses, cups filled with coffee, milk or tea, trays carrying slices of bread or sandwiches made on them; even though everything looks dirty at first glance it turns out that most of these items aren't dirty after all.
I want to ask someone else here if they can give me something to eat but there isn't anyone else around at the moment, so I have no choice but wait until my sandwich is ready - even though now I don't really fancy it anymore!
It turns out that this woman who served me was right about how long she had been waiting for her order; she only wanted one sandwich which took longer than expected because she didn't want just any bread or jam – she wanted strawberry jam so the whole process was slower as they needed to wait until there were some berries available on the shelves before they could make it into something tasty enough for her tastebuds.
But once that was done and all other tasks completed then finally I got my order: one sandwich with bread, butter and strawberry jam on top - which wasn't bad at all!
It took a while to finish eating everything so by the time I left there was almost nothing left inside me. I walked around outside looking for somewhere else where they might have other types of food available like meat or chicken but couldn't find anything suitable anywhere nearby - unless I wanted something really simple and basic instead (which isn't always easy).
Eventually after walking all over town, passing many different shops with interesting things inside them, some selling jewellery while others offered clothing or electronics products; then finally came across another café where people were sitting around drinking coffee together - so now I had something else other than water! Finally satisfied after having nothing but cold water from fountain taps all day long today it was time to head back towards my hotel room again.
I've never felt more tired before in my life. 
Chapter Two: The second night
I'm sitting alone on the edge of a bed, looking out at the dark sky outside. It is so quiet here that I can almost hear myself think. In this place where there are no other people or cars moving around me, it feels like all I have left inside my own mind.
But then something else occurs to me: maybe I shouldn't be sitting on this bed at all. Maybe I should instead get up and start walking again; away from here, towards whatever lies beyond these walls - wherever those may lead!
I don't know where to go or how long it will take for me to arrive there but one thing seems clear: I am ready for more adventure than just being stuck in this room by myself all night long waiting patiently until morning arrives so that others can come check up on my wellbeing again.
I stand up and walk out of the room, closing behind me as quietly as possible without making any noise at all (it's hard to do when there are no walls or windows around). Once outside I pause briefly before stepping off into darkness; then again - this time with purpose!
As my footsteps echo across the empty space between buildings and onto pavement, I know that I am heading somewhere new - away from where everything has been before now. My next move is going to take me somewhere else entirely different than here or anywhere near it either!
It's dark out there so much easier for someone like me who likes adventure to navigate this way: without having lights shining into their eyes from every angle possible - no one knows where I am headed or even if they care at all anymore. But then again, maybe some people still do? Who can tell?!
I don't want them to know though
