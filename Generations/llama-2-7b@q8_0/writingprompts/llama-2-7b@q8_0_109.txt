ve myself of oxygen. My blood fills with energy and my eyes widen. It's been a while since I used this technique to access another mind—not as long as it was back in high school, but still. I have to get back into practice.
It doesn't matter how much I like someone; it only matters if the person is strong enough to block me. And even then there are tricks that can be used. In this case, my target is not just anyone. It's Kendra. She's in a class of her own. The only girl in the whole school with the strength and skill to protect herself from mind reading.
And I need to find out what she knows about the missing girl—or boy, for that matter. Who was it? And where is he or she now? Kendra seems to be one of the few people who've heard of him at all; apparently, a bunch of people had seen someone hanging around the school before things went sideways.
I take another deep breath and think about what I know—or rather, don't know. Like where to start? What do I _want_ to find out? And why is it important that I find out?
I try to ask these questions in my mind, but the answer is always the same: I just want to know more. That's all I need for now.
Then I close my eyes and focus on Kendra. On her face, her hair, what she eats—every detail of everything that makes up her existence. It isn't so easy this time because it's been a few years since we last saw each other. So I try to go back in time.
I see myself walking down the hallway behind Kendra and Aimee when they were both seniors. It was the first day of school, which means everyone was super excited about making new friends—or reconnecting with old ones. We had been roommates at a summer camp the previous year, and we'd grown pretty close.
I remember feeling awkward and nervous as I caught up to them after class. I knew Kendra was popular, but it didn't really occur to me until then that she might actually be famous, in some sort of way. Her picture had been on the news when our camp counselor went missing—a girl who also worked for a secret organization called Serafina.
I remember being scared for Kendra, because I was still a kid back then and it seemed like she should have been scared too. But that wasn't her nature at all. Instead of being worried about herself or the disappearance, she made sure everyone else was okay—me included.
Aimee was pretty cool too, but Kendra was _really_ good at making friends and taking care of others. She had been nice to me that first day of school, but I think I'm not the only one who noticed how different it felt from her usual manner toward everyone else in the hallway.
I can't remember the details about what we talked about exactly, but they were all laughing and joking around like usual when Kendra suddenly stopped and looked at me. Her eyes grew wider than usual—a little too wide for my taste because I was sure she had just read my mind. And maybe she did. Or perhaps it was the fact that her mind was reading everyone else's, as well.
Aimee walked by then with another girl who seemed really excited to be hanging out with them both—and Kendra introduced me to her too. She smiled and asked if I liked movies or music or books; she wanted to know everything about my life because it was so new to her. And in that moment, she made me feel as though _I_ were the most important person on earth.
My stomach starts hurting again from all this thinking—I don't like it when I focus too hard and my body reacts negatively. But I can tell I am getting somewhere with Kendra because there is a sense of warmth building inside me now, as though she's sending out waves of energy or something. And at the same time, I feel kind of dizzy. Maybe this will be easier if we go back further in time to when we were both kids.
I see myself at camp, and then Kendra appears too—she is walking toward me on a trail somewhere. We are holding hands and talking about something funny that just happened with our counselor or cabin mates. But before I can remember what it was, she stops in the middle of the path and stares down at her feet. Then she turns around to look at me—and I know immediately that whatever we were discussing is no longer important because her expression has changed dramatically. Her face is contorted with something between surprise and fear or maybe even anger, but I don't know which one it is for sure because she's holding herself very still like a statue made out of clay that doesn't want to break into pieces yet.
I can hear the voices around us now: someone saying they saw another kid running away from our camp; someone else calling out Kendra's name as though he were looking for help—or maybe just trying to find her. But no one answers him because nobody knows where she went or what happened next.
And I know exactly how he feels because it is only a matter of moments before my stomach drops like it did with my other friend in high school, the one who disappeared without a trace. It's the same feeling every time—a heavy weight inside me that tells me something terrible has happened and there is nothing I can do to stop it from happening again.
I open my eyes suddenly, startled by the sound of my alarm clock ringing in my ear. A moment later, I hear footsteps moving toward the bedroom door; a second later, Kendra walks in wearing blue pajamas with little white stripes on them—the kind that girls wear to bed when they are too lazy or busy thinking about other things like homework assignments due tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM (or so it seems).
She glances over toward my desk where I am sitting in front of my computer screen; then she frowns and walks over to me as though something has just occurred to her about what might be on the screen. She sits down beside me and looks at everything from our group project due Monday night until next weekend when we will be traveling back home with our parents for summer break.
Kendra turns off my computer before she leaves again, saying good night and thank you for all of your hard work this semester—a class in which none of us ever actually showed up on time because there was always something else happening somewhere else that seemed more important at the moment than sitting through lectures about Shakespeare or Greek mythology.
But I'm not worried anymore because Kendra has already promised me she would come over after dinner tonight and help me with my homework assignment; plus, tomorrow morning is Sunday so there won't be any classes for a whole week. And I know we are going to get through this together somehow because that's what friends do—they stick around when things aren't perfect but also make them seem better than they really are anyway!
#  CHAPTER FOUR
The first day of school is always the hardest, even though it isn't technically a holiday. It doesn't matter if your new teacher is hot or not—you have to deal with all of those people who think they know everything about you already because they read your mind (or at least pretend that they do).
The only good thing about being back in school for another year of high-school hell: I get to see my friends again. And if there's one thing I love more than anything else on this planet, it's hanging out with other people who have no idea what they are doing or where they belong—especially when those same people happen to be cute girls from the popular crowd at school (even though their looks might not last very long).
It feels like forever since I saw Kendra last; she was so excited about coming home after living in a dorm all summer that her parents had taken her out of school early just for fun. But now they're both back at work, leaving me to take care of the house alone—which means cooking dinner every night and doing my own laundry too!
I try not to think about how much money I spend on food because there isn't any way around it; if you want good-quality ingredients for healthy living then sometimes those things can get expensive fast (especially when they're organic).
At least she likes my cooking. That's what matters most right now anyway! I'm sure her parents will appreciate all of this too once they return home tomorrow evening after being gone so long; maybe even thank me for keeping an eye on things while they were away!
I walk through the kitchen toward the living room where Kendra and I usually hang out when we're not doing homework together. It looks like she's already set up her laptop next to mine—no surprise there because she always seems to be working or studying something new these days (probably because summer break isn't quite as relaxing anymore now that college is in sight).
But before I can sit down at my desk, I hear another door slamming shut somewhere else inside our house; someone has just come home! The sound of heavy footsteps approaching from behind makes me
