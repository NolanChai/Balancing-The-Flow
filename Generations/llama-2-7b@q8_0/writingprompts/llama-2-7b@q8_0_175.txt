...'' 

 `` I know, but it's worth checking out. Just wait. I'm setting up an animation now.'' 
 
 Edmunds leaned back in his chair and waited for the display to refresh itself with Johannes' new information. It appeared on-screen within a few seconds. 

 `` Take a look, Doctor. There it is.'' 
 
 The screen showed two images of an orbiting space station. The top one was the image from the camera mounted in the window of the control module and had been captured only minutes earlier. In stark contrast to this image was the bottom view. This one was from the infrared sensor on the same spacecraft, a day-old picture taken as it drifted past the station. 
 
 Edmunds looked back up at Johannes. `` What am I supposed to be looking for?'' 
 
 `` Over there. Look over there. '' 

 Edmunds turned his attention to the top image, but all he saw was a blurred mass of green and blue. `` There's nothing here. This is just an empty view out a window.'' 
 
 `` No, Doctor, that's not it. Look closer.'' 
 
 Edmunds studied the image inch by inch, his eyesight starting to blur after a few minutes of staring at the picture. Finally, he gave up and looked over at Johannes with a questioning look on his face. `` I don't see anything. What am I supposed to be looking for?'' 
 
 `` Look again, Doctor... closely. '' 

 Edmunds leaned closer to the screen and squinted. Slowly, it dawned on him what Johannes was showing him: There were two tiny white dots in the top image. One of them had a faint green halo around it that resembled an inverted tear drop, while the other dot had no such halo but did seem to be slightly larger than its companion. 
 
 `` How long have they been there?'' Edmunds asked after he'd stared at the image for a few seconds longer. 
 
 Johannes hesitated before answering. `` I think we would both agree that it was only a couple of hours ago, perhaps three at most...'' 

 The two scientists fell silent and continued to watch as the tiny dots slowly moved across their screen. Eventually they grew to become larger in size as they approached the space station's window and then quickly vanished from view after they were obscured by a passing cloud. `` This is amazing!'' exclaimed Johannes with obvious delight, his hands still clasped in front of him on the keyboard. 
 
 Edmunds sat silently staring at the screen for several more minutes. Finally, he turned and looked over at Johannes. `` What do you make of this? ''

 `` I think it's pretty clear that we have a pair of alien visitors to our planet...''

 ``Aliens...'' repeated Edmunds with an air of incredulity. `` How can you be sure, Johannes? There is no evidence...'' 

 ``This isn't the only picture they are in, Doctor. Look at this one from today that came through last night. This view was taken during our first pass of the day as we approached the station. We've got two more views to come through tomorrow. I just hope there is enough time for the transmission to reach us and get processed before they have their second flyby...''
 
 Edmunds looked over at Johannes' monitor screen, where a new image had appeared that was slightly larger than the ones from this morning. This one also showed two tiny green dots moving towards the camera. He stared at the picture for a long time and then shook his head in disbelief.  `` It can't be!''

 ``I know, it doesn't make sense does it? But that is what our sensors are showing us. And I have no idea how these creatures could be so small or light, yet be able to survive the trip across space all by themselves...'' 

 Edmunds shook his head again and sat back in his chair with a look of bewilderment on his face. `` They can't be real! '' he said after a few moments of silence had passed between them. `` It must have been some kind of trick or optical illusion that Johannes managed to create from our own camera images...''
 
 Johannes looked at Edmunds and then back down at the screen in front of him, his lips set into a tight smile. `` I'm sorry, Doctor, but the proof is staring us right in the face. These dots are real. There is no doubt about it. Now all we need to do is figure out what they are and where they came from...'' 

 ``And what exactly do you intend to do with that information?'' asked Edmunds, his voice betraying a hint of impatience. ``I thought we were supposed to be waiting until the next pass to see if there is any more data to collect on these objects before we even bothered considering what our next course of action might be...'' 
 
 Johannes looked over at him with an air of amusement, as he responded:  ``Well, Doctor, I guess you are right. The time for waiting has passed. Now is the time to act...''
