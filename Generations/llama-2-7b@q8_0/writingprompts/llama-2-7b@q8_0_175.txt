�in the way we know it today.
As we enter the second half of the twenty first century, science fiction novels are gradually taking over from the rather old-fashioned space opera genre. This development is most obvious in Germany where authors such as Andreas Eschbach, Frank Schaetzing and Karin Tidbeck have made a name for themselves with novels that use all kinds of strange narrative forms to tell about the future.
I think one could also say this for the latest novel by the Belgian author Johan Harstad. The novel is set on Aries-Centari-IV, an earth-like planet that seems to have evolved in exactly the same way as our own home world. After a brief prologue and an epilogue, we find ourselves thrown into the middle of events as they take place on a university campus. We are told about the experiments going on here by a young science student who is writing his PhD thesis on the subject. It�s a very interesting way to tell us what�s happening. As someone who likes to read novels that play with narrative structures, I found this approach quite refreshing and original.
The only problem I have with this style of writing is that I really had difficulties keeping track of the characters involved in the story and their role within the events taking place on campus. Apart from that, the novel offers an interesting story with some good characters as well. The whole setting itself is very different from what we�re used to finding in science fiction novels today. It�s definitely worth checking out if you like your future a bit more down-to-earth than many of today�s space opera stories are willing to be.
