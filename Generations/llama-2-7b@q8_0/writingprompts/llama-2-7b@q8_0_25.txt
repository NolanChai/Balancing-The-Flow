 time in six months that this had happened. The fact was, however, that this particular day was more memorable than usual because on my way into work, as usual, I ran into my friend and coworker, who had been telling me about his plans to buy a new car and how much money he needed for it.

`` It's okay,'' he said. ``I just have to get the down payment for this car by tomorrow, or I might have to put off buying it again.'' 
`` Don't worry about it. Just keep thinking positive thoughts and visualizing yourself with your new car!'' I encouraged him as I took my place at my desk. 
 
 A couple of hours later, a message arrived from the sales department telling us to clear our calendars for the next two weeks because an important client was arriving in town tomorrow, and he would be spending the day with us. I had just put down my pen when I heard my friend calling out to me from his desk across the room. 
`` Hey, there's something going around about a guy who wants to buy a car - maybe it was you?'' he asked. 
`` Well, that might be me, but I don't know anything about it.'' 
 
 I didn't believe him at first, so I just walked away and went back to work. But after two more hours of being called into my boss' office because she wanted an update on our newest client, I realized that there was something really strange going on here. My friend was definitely talking about the same guy we had been working with all day! 
 
 That evening as I sat in front of my computer and thought about it more deeply, I remembered how my friend had told me he needed money to buy his new car, so when I got home that night, I went online and looked up ``how to manifest money'' in Google. Then, after reading a few articles on the subject, I decided to try something out for myself: I would visualize all of the money I could possibly make in one year - enough to buy my own car!
 
 The next day at work was even more stressful than usual because we had just been informed that our client wanted us to show him around town on Saturday.
`` And you know what that means,'' my boss said as she stared into my eyes from behind her desk. ``You're going to have to stay here until midnight!'' 
`` No problem,'' I told her with a smile before turning away and heading back down the hallway toward my office, where my friend was already waiting for me. We spent about an hour talking about all kinds of different subjects - none of which had anything to do with our new client. Finally he turned around and looked at me with his big brown eyes. 
`` I want you to come over tomorrow after work and bring some money,'' he said quietly. ``I need help with my down payment on a car.'' 
 
 `` What?'' I whispered back as I put my head in my hands. ``But why didn't you tell me sooner?'' 
`` Well, because if you don't get it by the end of this week, then they might have to postpone buying their car until next year - and that wouldn't be very good for business! So I figured I would wait until we actually had some clients coming in before I told you.''
