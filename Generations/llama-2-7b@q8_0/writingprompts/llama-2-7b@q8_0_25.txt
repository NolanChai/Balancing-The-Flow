its to fly in the last light of the moon. A star with his own name is born in the heavens, and when it falls he shall be reborn with the dawn.''*

He was born with wings that were silver feathered like those of a bird; but as he grew older they became darker until they were black in colour. His face was thin and long. When he laughed, his mouth stretched sideways into a smile. His hair was as white as snow and grew to cover the entire length of his body.
Whenever there was an eclipse or a solar storm, all over the world people waited for him to be born. They knew that he would bring peace and happiness and make things better for everyone on earth. They believed that this man would show them how to live in harmony with nature and teach them to take care of the planet instead of abusing it as they had been doing, which had caused many disasters on earth like famines or wars.
His name was Kali, which means "black". In Sanskrit he is known as Kalki Avatar, the incarnation of God in his final form and is also called Vaikuntha Kalki or Krishna Rai. He will be born to a family from India's lower caste Hindu community and it is said that when he appears on earth wearing white robes with gold ornaments around his neck, he will have an unprecedented power over people. His arrival has been predicted for centuries by astrologers who believe the world will end shortly afterward.
He was born in a poor village called Badriyana where his father worked as a carpenter and had seven wives because it was traditional among Hindu men to have many wives but only one wife at any given time could live with them while all the others were sent away during their pregnancies so they wouldn't have to share their husbands or be exposed to his sexual needs outside marriage (which would make them feel ashamed).
Kali was born on December 25th which was also Christmas Day and he had an older brother who was called Karma (meaning "good deeds" in Sanskrit) but died at age six from malaria caused by poor living conditions like drinking contaminated water without boiling it first so mosquitoes could spread disease through him more easily than if he drank clean water instead of dirty water; this happened because there were no toilets available where people lived nor any proper sanitation systems either so they had no choice but to use whatever was around them like rivers, lakes etc...
Kali grew up with his mother who taught him about religion and spirituality while she worked hard all day making sure her children had everything they needed even if it meant going without herself sometimes too. He spent much of his time playing alone in the forest nearby where he would learn from animals how to survive without human contact by eating what nature provides for us such as fruits, vegetables or fish when possible but mostly insects like grasshoppers and beetles because those were plentiful enough around there anyway so long ago before humans destroyed everything natural around them starting wars against each other over resources instead of working together harmoniously which is why we're seeing more pollution these days than ever before.
He was born in a small town near Varanasi, India on December 25th at 10:30 pm when his mother's water broke and he came out screaming with his umbilical cord attached to her stomach until she cut it off (a process known as "cord cutting"). He was named after the god Shiva who is also called Kali because they share similar characteristics like being black skinned gods who fight against evil forces such as demons and spirits trying to take over our world so we can live peacefully together without fear of harm from any outside forces that threaten us physically or mentally/emotionally which makes me think this may be why Kali was born at the same time as Jesus because they both share similar characteristics like being black skinned gods who fight against evil forces such as demons and spirits trying to take over our world so
