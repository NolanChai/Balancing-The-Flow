ous lump with uncultured demeanor.
His mother had taught him to walk quietly and to be aware of his surroundings. He was always looking for mammals, reptiles and insects, but not now. This time it wasn’t a nature walk. It was more like an excursion with the family. The first leg of their journey took them deep into a forest where they had no idea what to expect or if anything waited beyond the next bend.
They were on the outskirts, at least that’s what Harold thought. They hadn’t ventured far and the canopy was still close enough for him to reach out with one hand and brush it like a lover. He didn’t want to think of it as such because she had been dead since he was born.
Harold knew this trip would be different from other family vacations because they were traveling by foot, not car. He assumed his father and brother would stop for lunch or some snacks but they wouldn’t do so until the next town. He was right to anticipate it that way. As far as he could remember they had always packed their meals from home or picked up food at a gas station. The only times they went out to eat were when the car broke down and there wasn’t any other choice.
Today they came prepared, but his mother told him not to be too certain that it would last them through the weekend. She said they weren’t equipped for camping. They had a tent, but she thought they should have brought more. He didn’t argue because he had never been away from home before and didn’t know what she was talking about.
She explained that without any supplies, their food would be limited to whatever could fit in the small cooler attached to the back of her bike. Even so, they were going on a grand adventure with only a few provisions. His mother told him that if he liked this sort of thing then he should do it more often.
Harold didn’t know what she meant and just nodded politely. She was a great storyteller and very intelligent woman. He listened to every word but never understood her point or what made her so special. She never spoke to him as if he were an adult, like other mothers did with their sons. It didn’t matter because his father told him she would outlive them all, which was a common story among the elderly of the town.
A few hours before sunset they reached the mountain where they planned on spending the night. The sky was an iridescent blue and he felt excited about their first adventure away from home. He hoped it would be as much fun as his mother had told him, but didn’t know what to expect. It was a perfect day with not a cloud in sight. His father said they might have rain that night or even snow. Harold wasn’t so sure because he thought it felt like a nice summer evening. He found this hard to believe since he had never been exposed to the great outdoors before.
The first thing his father did was take all of their gear and unpack everything into separate piles on the ground. His mother followed suit with her back pack and then helped him find a good place to sleep for the night. She insisted that he should stay near her, so they settled in close together underneath some rocks.
Harold thought it was silly because she could have picked any spot but agreed with his father’s recommendation that they should be together as much as possible until it got dark. The sun had started to set by the time he saw the first star and wondered what would happen afterward. He remembered hearing stories about ghosts coming out at night, and figured this was where it happened.
The mountain was a safe place for them so nothing bad could occur but he kept looking around just in case something was lurking nearby. His mother’s hand was soft on his shoulder while she spoke to him quietly. He wasn’t sure what she wanted from him, but she seemed concerned about the possibility of wild animals appearing near their camp site.
He listened and pretended to agree with her thoughts until they fell silent again. After a short period of time he began to think that it was silly for them to be here because there were no other people or even signs of civilization anywhere in sight. He imagined this made him less scared, but didn’t want his mother to see how much fear ran through the young boy’s mind when they slept beside each other under the stars.
It was dark and the forest had fallen quiet when Harold woke up from a deep sleep. There were no sounds of insects or animals rustling nearby, so he knew it must be late at night. The only noise he heard came from the wind whistling through trees like a distant train. His father told him not to worry about wildlife because most creatures avoided humans by default. If an animal had ever appeared near their camp site before then they would have been able to hear its footsteps on the ground or smell it coming toward them first.
Harold believed this was true and he hadn’t heard anything since going to bed hours ago, but still felt anxious as if something bad could happen at any moment without warning. He got up from where he lay beside his mother, who didn’t stir when he spoke softly to her ear. She had already drifted off while they slept side by side under a blanket made out of tarp material.
He knew she was asleep because her breathing slowed down after each inhale and exhale until it became more rhythmic like the sound of rain falling softly upon dry leaves nearby. Harold pulled up his knees to rest his head on them while he stared at something out in front of him that he couldn’t see with just one eye open, but sensed was there nonetheless.
It wasn’t a trick of light or shadow because this object had been visible before he closed both eyes and looked away from its location. He knew it couldn’t have been imagined either since his mother was sleeping only a few feet away on the other side of their bedroll. She hadn’t moved at all while Harold sat there with one hand covering over half of his face, listening for whatever might be happening outside of their camp site in the dark.
Harold felt scared to move and keep looking around the woods, but it seemed too late now that something else had been spotted by him instead of being able to ignore what was going on nearby without having any proof otherwise. He wondered if this could possibly be an animal or ghost that they should have known about beforehand since there were no warning signs or indications anywhere in sight around them at the time being.
He told himself not to worry because he wasn’t afraid of anything that might happen tonight, but still felt uneasy with every passing second as if something bad had already occurred without his knowledge until now. Harold reached up slowly towards where his mother slept beside him while looking back towards what could have been an unnatural object outside in the distance between them. He wasn’t sure whether or not this was real, but he knew that whatever was happening next would either prove him wrong about it being there altogether or show otherwise if what he saw really existed somewhere near where they slept right now without his having any idea beforehand how close by something else might have been hiding from view until just recently when Harold felt compelled to wake up from a deep sleep that night.
Harold stared at the spot on the ground where his mother had fallen asleep while he tried to decide if whatever was out there in front of him was real or imaginary, and decided it didn’t matter anyway because something else had already been spotted by him when he first woke up from a deep sleep earlier this morning before sunrise.
He waited for his mother to stir so she could ask what was wrong with her son who seemed afraid of everything that happened outside while they slept nearby, but never said anything about any of it until now even though Harold told himself not to worry about whatever else might have been hiding in the darkness somewhere close by without having any proof otherwise before he saw something unnatural with his own eyes.
Harold’s mother had a dream that night after she and her son fell asleep under the stars, but he wasn’t aware of it until sunrise when everything returned to normal again just like always because there was nothing out in front of them or anywhere else for miles around while they slept beside each other beneath a tarp made from old tarps that were stitched together by hand into one big blanket.
