The police had questioned you for some time before letting you go home only to find yourself confronting a dead body by the front door of your place. It would have been worse if it had been one of your neighbors, but this stranger's death seemed to be no big deal since he was obviously not from around here and nobody really knew him except for that old lady down on 7th street who lived with her cat named Sasha Fierce.
But the weirdest thing that had happened today was when you got home it appeared as if there were other people in your place! And what the hell are those creepy things following me around? And why did that one just try to eat my face off?
