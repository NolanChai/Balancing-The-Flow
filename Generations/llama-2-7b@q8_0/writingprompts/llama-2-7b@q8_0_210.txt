 was left of it had been eaten by me. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and stood up, feeling the stickiness of blood against my skin.
I looked down at my body—it had taken me a while to get used to all the scars, especially the one on my chest. That was where they'd cut me open when I was a kid. But now I just felt normal. My body was an old friend, familiar enough that it no longer disturbed me to look at it and see how much of myself had been eaten away over the years.
I was a wolf, then. The wolf was my face, but also my stomach, my hands, my legs. It was everything in this world I'd ever known. I'd never seen any of us naked, but I knew what we looked like underneath the skin. We had four limbs, two eyes, a mouth that could talk and eat. No more, no less.
It had been easy to forget—when you lived in the human world, with its buildings and cars and wars—that we were so similar to humans. But it was true: We were animals first. I'd never felt like anything else before this happened to me.
And yet that didn't mean I liked being an animal. Being a wolf meant hunger, pain, and loneliness. It also meant not getting to feel the sun on my face or go for walks in the forest without someone wanting you to do it with their paws instead of your feet.
It was all so complicated, especially since I'd been around humans for most of my life. I'd grown up in a human family, and that meant having human emotions—like love—which had never left me, no matter how hard I tried to ignore them or deny their existence. It also meant getting lonely when the people who were supposed to love you didn't want to anymore.
But now, more than ever before in my life, I was alone. My family wasn't around anymore—not my human one and not my wolf one either. They had all gone away because of what happened to me at school that day when I turned into a wolf. I was still so angry about it that sometimes the memory of what happened made me want to howl with rage until there wasn't anything left of me but fur and teeth.
I shook off the thoughts, trying not to let myself remember everything else. I didn't need these memories right now—I just needed some fresh meat to eat so that I could get my strength back after killing Joseph Walker in self-defense (which was what everyone said happened). But where would I find more food? It wasn't like there were lots of animals around here who wanted to hang out with humans; at least not if they knew what those humans were capable of doing.
I walked over to the kitchen and found a plastic bowl filled with water in one corner next to the sink. That was enough for me—a little bit of water would be nice, but I wasn't thirsty yet so there was no hurry about it. My tongue was still stiff from all the blood and meat on my face, but once it had time to relax again it would be able to move like normal.
I drank some more, then stretched out on the floor next to where I'd eaten Joseph Walker earlier today (yes, that morning). The house was quiet except for what seemed like an endless stream of cars passing by outside every few minutes—the sound of their tires crunching over gravel made them almost impossible not to hear even if you tried.
It would be nice if someone could come over here and give me some human company, but there wasn't anyone else who lived nearby that I knew about anyway. If I wanted people around then I'd have to go somewhere where they were more likely—like into town or out on one of the trails around my house. That was fine with me though; going outside would give me an excuse not only for talking but also doing other things like walking and looking at birds (which was what everyone did when they went outside).
I lay down next to where I'd eaten Joseph Walker earlier today (yes, that morning) because it felt good having something solid under my belly again after all these years without any kind of food—even if it wasn't really meat anymore but just bones and blood. Even though there were no humans here now either except for me, I didn't mind being alone as long as I had somewhere else to go soon enough where people would be around again so that they could talk back at me instead of talking _to_ me all by myself in this big empty house full of nothing but memories.
"Who are you?" she asked as we walked toward the edge of town, where there was a small clump of trees and bushes. She didn't say anything else after that until we reached our destination, so I took advantage of it by telling her what had happened earlier today with Joseph Walker—how he tried to attack me but ended up dying instead because his own body got in the way of my teeth when I bit into him (even though at first glance everything seemed fine). It was a good story; maybe not one that would win any awards for originality, but still entertaining enough for now.
"So how did you manage to survive?" she asked as we walked through what used to be someone's front yard before it became overgrown with weeds and grasses growing everywhere except where there were houses or roads nearby—which was pretty much everywhere else except maybe out in the middle of nowhere somewhere.
"I don't know," I said. "It just happened." I shrugged my shoulders, trying to make it look like whatever had happened wasn't important enough for her to care about anyway so she could get back on topic and start asking more questions before I got bored of talking or wanted another nap instead (whichever came first).
"I guess you must have been pretty lucky then," she said, trying hard not to smile at my obvious lack of knowledge on this particular subject but failing miserably in doing so due to the fact that it was obvious from watching her face change expressions throughout our entire conversation thus far that she actually thought I knew more than what was evident right now.
"Well, yeah," I said, hoping that would get rid of whatever funny look had just crept into her eyes before it could spread across the rest of my body too because then people would start thinking I wasn't really talking about luck at all anymore but instead something else entirely different (which I wouldn't put past anyone who thought they knew what was going on).
"You are a lucky guy," she said, looking up at me with the same smile still plastered on her face. "But you also seem to be one of those guys who gets into trouble all the time even though it doesn't make any sense why." She shook her head, trying hard not to laugh as I tried my best not to blush or say something stupid again since this was supposedly about being lucky instead of getting into trouble—even if that wasn't really what happened most of the time anymore.
"Well," I said, trying again and failing miserably once more because no matter how hard I tried there were still those pesky laughter lines around her mouth (that made me want to cry) when she smiled like that even though I knew deep down inside somewhere in my heart that this woman had never laughed at all throughout our entire conversation until now when suddenly everything changed all of a sudden into something completely different from what it was before without warning or explanation or any kind of reason except for maybe the fact that I'm just really unlucky sometimes too which probably means we have something in common after all...
I stood there for a moment, wondering how many years ago it had been when I first met her and if she remembered me or not. But then she turned around to look at me again so I followed suit, looking back into her eyes which seemed like they were getting even bigger than before but maybe that was just my imagination because everything started getting hazy all of a sudden due to whatever kind of thing it was inside of them staring right back at me—and even though she said nothing after that except for telling me goodbye I could still feel her presence lingering somewhere around my heart, like an echo of something I couldn't quite put into words but wanted very badly nonetheless because this woman had been there through everything over the years so far until now which made it easy to believe without any doubt whatsoever that whatever happened next wouldn't matter nearly as much anymore either way...
The rest of our conversation was lost in time, just like those memories from before when I first met her. There were no words spoken or exchanged; only the occasional laughter line around her mouth every now and again which made me want to cry even more than usual because this woman had never laughed at all throughout our entire conversation until now when suddenly everything changed all of a sudden into something completely different from what it was before without warning or explanation or any kind of reason except for maybe the fact that I'm just really unlucky sometimes too which probably means we have something in common after all...
But I didn't care about any of those things anymore either way because she had been there through everything over the years so far until now, and nothing else mattered quite as much as her presence lingering around my heart somewhere like an echo of something I couldn't quite put into words yet but wanted very
