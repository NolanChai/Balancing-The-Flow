 men admire and women sigh over? That was my goal for this suit.
The idea came from a combination of several things. I love a good suit, but I don't think enough men wear them nowadays, they have become such an undergarment, so to speak, and we are all the better for it. But as much as I like suits, they often seem so uncomfortable... The jacket always has a lapel that is too narrow or not wide enough. They never fit over the shoulders just right, or in the arms where you feel pinched by them. And then there are the pants, which are often too tight and short for comfort (and sometimes even too long). I'm sure everyone knows what I mean...
I know I can make my own suit better than any one else because I can do it exactly as I want, but that is not why I am making this. This is more of a learning experience for me. So, without further ado... let the fun begin!
It started with the fabric. It was a very thin, smooth, black wool which I bought at Fabricland (my local JoAnn's) in a 60" wide cut. I knew that this would be a very difficult suit to make because of how narrow the wool is and how delicate it must be treated... but it was worth a try.
I got to work on the jacket first, which consisted of drafting the pattern, cutting out all the pieces, fitting them together and then making a toile (a miniature version). I was really nervous about this part because I had never sewn with wool before! So I read through my book on tailoring and studied photos of suit jackets online.
I decided that since it is such a skinny fabric, I needed to have at least 1cm between the centre back seam of the garment and any other point where the fabric curves or folds... so I made a mock-up of my pattern pieces on cardboard first, then cut out all the actual pattern pieces.
The wool was so fragile that when cutting it with scissors it would snap! So I bought some good old fashioned seam ripper scissors and used them to make the straight lines and then I hand-cut around any curves or folds, keeping everything even as best I could. I had a really hard time fitting everything together at first because I wanted the sleeves to fit perfectly when they were folded up...
...but once I got all my pieces fitted it was much easier to stitch them together and make adjustments as necessary. This is where I learned that wool takes a little more hand-sewing than other fabrics!
I decided to use a double needle for the main seams, which I thought would be strong enough. And for all the edges of my collar I used bias tape because it is such a delicate fabric and I wanted to protect the wool from fraying. The jacket took me quite some time because of how difficult it was to cut, but I am really happy with how well it came out!
The pants were much easier than the jacket... they had been pre-fitted by someone else so all I did was put them on and adjust where necessary. For this suit I decided that a single needle would be better because I didn't want to rip through any of my fabric, plus there are no side seams like with jeans or chinos...
I also knew that the pants were going to be very difficult to fit so I had them made in the store. They cost about $100 which was expensive but well worth it! I just needed to take them home and alter them a little bit and add all my details like belt loops, side seams, etc.
So there you have it - the beginning of my suit! It's still not finished but I will definitely post more once it is done. For now I am really excited about how far I have gotten with this project :)
