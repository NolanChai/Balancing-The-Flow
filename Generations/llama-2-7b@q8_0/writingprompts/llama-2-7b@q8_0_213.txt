You approach a shady character standing in front of a closed door, in the heart of the city. No signs on this one, you know that your companion is right on track. You knock and the door opens to reveal an empty room with a barred window and a single bed. Above the bed is a small portrait of a man holding two guns.

**The Story:**

Once upon a time in New York City, there was a notorious gangster named "Yo Dawg." He was known for his violent temper and ruthless ways, and he ruled over all of the city's underbelly with an iron fist. But one day, something happened that would change everything...

**The Clue:**

You notice a small bottle hidden behind the bed frame. You pick it up and find that it contains what looks like some kind of strange liquid.
