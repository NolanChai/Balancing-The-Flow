 Santa's not real. But I love Christmas time because it means that Jesus is real.
 `` Oh! And Santa does exist. Just don't expect him to be able to deliver any presents this year. He's a little bit busy trying to help the children in need all around the world. You can help him do so by buying presents for kids that you know that are less fortunate than you!''
``But Santa... '' 
 
 `` He'll be back next year, I promise you! But not until he has helped every child in the world have a Merry Christmas. And don't worry about me. I'm helping too by giving my whole allowance to charity this week!''
