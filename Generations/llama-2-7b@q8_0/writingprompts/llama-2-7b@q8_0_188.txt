emen'', I say, flipping it over in the light and then placing it on top of a stack of other similar items.
 
 ``It's not all that expensive really.'', I say as if to cover for my earlier comment about the 'fourth tons'.
 
 `Hmm...' they both say at the same time, obviously having no idea what I was talking about when it comes to 'lots of stuff'.
 
 I hand them each a pouch. They are the only people who can pay with cash on the site and as such will be getting some of the best stuff here for free or heavily discounted.

They nod in understanding, pull out some bills from their pockets and leave. 
 It was a long day, I have never sold this much stuff to strangers before. I know it's not my place as an employee to sell goods but there were only two of them and I just wanted to get them away from the site so that they could buy without the other visitors watching. 
 As they walk past me in the corridor, I see their backs for a few seconds before they go out through one of the arches and are gone. 
 I feel satisfied with my day's work, I had given them the best stuff to help them on their travels and I hope that they enjoyed themselves here as much as I have doing my job.
