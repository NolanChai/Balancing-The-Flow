'd boys and their girlfriends to drive down the street, take their tops off and show off their naked bodies! And they did it every night. Every single fucking night! It was always the same four or five cars that would come down my road at about midnight on a Sunday night.
 
 I've lived out there for years now and, like clockwork, they all do this every weekend. They seem to think it's fine for them but no one else can see them. But it's not true because I can see them. And so can my neighbors.
 
 The first time this happened was when a friend and I were out in my car having a couple of drinks at a bar about fifteen miles away from my house. We were talking about the weather, you know, what a typical Sunday night conversation is for young people. As we were leaving the bar, it started to get late so we decided to drive straight home instead of stopping by a gas station or convenience store on our way back like most normal people do.
 
 That's when I saw them! I had no idea what they were doing at first but as soon as I realized, I just about lost my mind! I couldn't believe it and was freaking out so bad that I almost crashed into another car on the road. I had to pull over a few times because I got so excited thinking about them, I nearly drove off of the side of the road.
 
 Now, these kids weren't just doing anything ordinary like walking around naked or making out in their cars either. Nope! They were showing each other and everyone else their nipples, pussies, vaginas, dicks, balls and assholes!! I couldn't believe what was happening.
 
 The first thing I did when I got home was to call the police but they just laughed at me on the phone, said it happens all the time out there. After that, I was really mad! So angry, in fact, I couldn't even sleep for a few nights because of them and how they were making such a big show of their naked bodies every weekend night!
 
 At first, when this happened, I tried to go over to the house where the kids lived and let them know that their parents would probably not be happy with them. They seemed shocked at first but then told me how they were just kidding around and didn't mean any harm by it. I was furious!
 
 Then, I started posting signs all over my property telling them to stop doing this to their bodies in front of everyone else but the next night when they came back again, there were even more cars with a lot younger kids than before so maybe I should have waited and done something better. Maybe not just post those signs at all!
 
 I thought about it for days until finally one morning after seeing them do this for the thousandth time, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I didn't know what to expect but felt like I had to do something before it got too crazy. So here's what happened:
 
 The next Sunday night when they came down my road again, instead of just staying home as I normally did and watching TV or reading a book until they left me alone, I grabbed an old shotgun that belonged to one of my uncles who passed away years ago and walked outside with it. As soon as those kids got within range on their cars, I took aim at each of them one-by-one until every single person driving down my street was gone!
 
 It didn't matter if they were naked or not because all that did was make me madder than before so I shot at each car until there weren't any left. Then, when I went back inside and closed the door behind me, it dawned on me what had happened:
 
 _I just killed four teenagers for showing off their bodies in front of everyone else._

### What would you have done?
