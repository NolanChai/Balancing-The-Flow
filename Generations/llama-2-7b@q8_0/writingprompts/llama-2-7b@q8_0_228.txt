 asks me to rate how badly I am hurting. 
 
 A lot of things start going through my mind as they cut off my shirt. There's the fear of losing my arm or leg, and maybe not waking up at all. The last time I was here is a blur because of anesthesia, but I can still see the doctor in front of me telling my family that I had suffered an "incident." 
 
 Then, there's this: that the next few seconds will decide how much pain I feel for the rest of my life. 
 
 If it goes bad, I'll spend a long time on these pills they put me on when everything gets overwhelming. And if things go good, they can stop the pills and then I can move past this whole thing without getting stuck in a spiral of anxiety and depression. 
 
 The nurse asks again how much it hurts. I tell her that I have to think about it, because it's a pretty big deal for me right now. She laughs and tells me to let her know when I get back from the bathroom. 
 
 ``Don't forget to bring the pain medication with you,'' she says, as she gives me a smile that makes my heart sink into the pit of my stomach. 
 
 *Why am I thinking about this?* is my second thought. 
 
 I can tell by looking in the mirror that it's going to be a long day for me. There are more than twenty people around me, and all they care about is how much pain I have. I don't know what I want them to do with this information; but I know that I need to make sure I take my time making the choice. 
 
 When I get back from the bathroom, I can tell immediately that it has been a long time since my last dose of pain medication. They're all looking at me like I'm a criminal, and they ask me again if everything is okay. I nod yes, even though nothing is right anymore. 
 
 *What the fuck am I doing?* is my third thought. 
 
 My head feels like it's on fire as I tell them what they want to hear about how much pain I have. They give me a few pills and take me back to my room, where all of this seems like such a strange memory from another life that never happened. 
 
 *Why am I thinking about this?* is my fourth thought. 
 
 The next thing I know they're wheeling me into surgery, and there are at least four doctors in the room with their hands up as if to say "I can fix it." It's only when they put the mask over my face that everything goes dark. 
 
 *Why am I thinking about this?* is my fifth thought, just before I drift off into an uneasy sleep.
