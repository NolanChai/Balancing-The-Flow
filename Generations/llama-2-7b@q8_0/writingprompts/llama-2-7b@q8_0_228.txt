 woman nodded. `` A judge would have to make that determination for yourself, but my understanding of the law is that, unless there were specific provisions made in your divorce proceedings regarding these items, they are yours by virtue of your marriage. '' 
 
 Santa stared at her. She was looking down now herself, as if she was worried about what he might say next. `` Well, I certainly don't need them. They have no meaning to me.'' He pointed toward the crate. ``And they're just getting in my way, anyhow. '' 
 
 She nodded again, still looking down, but Santa wasn't finished yet. The crate was getting crowded with all these old trinkets and mementos that held no meaning for him anymore. He decided he wanted to get rid of the whole thing as quickly and efficiently as possible. `` Do you know what I'm going to do with them?'' 
 
 She didn't, but she thought it was a good question. `` Why not donate some of them to charity?'' she suggested, thinking that would be best. `` If they mean nothing to you, then they can help someone else. ''
 
 Santa wasn't interested in charitable causes, at least not when the trinkets and mementos in question were his own. But there was something about this woman, even though she did n't look like anyone he knew. He realized that he actually wanted to tell her what he had decided, just so he could see how she reacted. `` I don't know if you'd believe me,'' Santa began, ``but I'm going to burn them all. '' 
 
 The woman stopped looking at the ground and stared up at him. She opened her mouth as if to protest, but then Santa spoke again, faster this time. `` They were your mother 's and father 's things. You don't want any of those things that you have lying around anymore?'' 
 
 The woman shook her head. `` But it doesn't matter what I want! Those things are yours; they belong to you now, so do whatever you want with them. '' She took a deep breath and went on. `` But please don't burn them. Even if you think they have no meaning for you anymore, there might be some reason why you still need to keep them around.'' 
 
 Santa thought about that. The woman did have a point. He had never been very sentimental, but the idea of throwing all those old items into a fire was not an appealing one. Still, he felt compelled to do it anyway; and in this case, he wanted to do something for the woman standing beside him. `` Well...'' Santa started again, feeling awkward. `` If you insist. I'll burn them. ''
 
 The woman breathed a sigh of relief and began to walk away, but then turned back toward Santa. He noticed that she was smiling now as she spoke to him. `` You know, there are other things in life that have no meaning for you anymore, too. I don't want you to let your past dictate who you are today or where you go from here. '' She pointed up at the stars. `` If you keep burning those memories behind you, then before long all you 'll ever see will be ash and smoke in front of your eyes.''
 
 Santa smiled back. He was glad he had decided to tell her about his plans for the trinkets; even though they were n't hers anymore, it felt good just being able to do something nice for somebody else.
# Chapter 10 - The Last Ride
The car is parked on a quiet street in San Francisco and the door has been opened by an older man who introduces himself as Santa Claus. Inside are two other people: a man and a woman, both in their late 20s or early 30s. As they get out of the car, one of them - a woman - calls him ``Kris,'' but he doesn't seem to mind.
He opens up his trunk, revealing two large crates filled with presents wrapped in red bows. The woman pulls her own crate from inside while Santa closes up the trunk and locks it tightly shut before putting away their keys and wallets into another part of his car where they won't be visible to passersby on this quiet street in San Francisco at night time during Christmas Eve 2011.
The group stands there together for a moment, looking at each other silently as if waiting for someone else to say something first but then they all walk inside together without saying anything more about what will happen next after closing up their car doors behind them before heading inside where there's still time left until midnight when everyone knows how long it takes Santa Claus from coming back down chimneys across America during Christmas Eve each year since 1957 - so many years ago!
# Chapter 11 - The Last Visit
As the sun sets over New York City on Christmas Eve, Kris and his friends are getting ready for one last ride. They're all dressed in their favorite red suits with white trim around the cuffs, collars, and pockets; hats decorated with bells or tinsel; even shoes that sparkle when they walk!
This is it: The Final Ride. It'll be Kris' last chance to see all his friends before he leaves forever - not just this year but evermore (until next Christmas). And it might be our last time together too if we don't make it back alive after tonight's adventure...
The sky outside is starting to turn dark blue while inside Santa's workshop, everyone is finishing up their tasks so they can go outside and take a break from all this hard work! It looks like everything has been put away nicely for now; no one wants anything left behind during such an important night like tonight because then there wouldn't be any presents under anyone's tree tomorrow morning when everyone wakes up excitedly searching through their stockings hoping someone left them something special under there (and hopefully not just another sock full of coal).
The last thing Kris wants to do is leave anything behind; especially since he knows how much time and effort it took him over the past few months preparing all those gifts for everyone this year! But now everything has been put away neatly into boxes ready for storage until next Christmas when they'll be brought out again to distribute among families who have waited patiently throughout 12 long months without knowing if anything was going on under their tree at midnight tonight...
The sound of bells rings through the workshop as each person finishes up their tasks before heading outside into the cold night air where Kris waits impatiently for them all while watching over one last present sitting lonely by itself near a table covered with wrapping paper and tinsel-covered ribbons (the same ones he used last year).
# Chapter 12 - The Last Night
Santa Claus is on his way to the North Pole, where he will spend Christmas Eve night alone in an abandoned house. He's leaving behind a note for Mrs. Claus that says: ``I have found it hard to be away from you so long, but I know this trip is necessary if we are ever going to make things work out between us.''
Santa arrives at the North Pole and walks into an old farmhouse where he finds himself surrounded by candles burning brightly as though they were welcoming him home after being away for so many months! Santa sits down on a chair near one of them, looks up at what appears to be nothing but darkness above him then smiles wistfully before closing his eyes.
In the next room over, Mrs. Claus is having dinner with her children while they wait patiently outside their door for Papa Kris who has been away from them since Halloween due to business obligations that required him travel far across Europe and beyond - places where no one knew what he looked like let alone who or even where he was coming from!
Mrs. Claus' husband will not return until sometime next year when he can finally rejoin her again after spending so long away from home while trying hard enough times before giving up hope that everything would turn out ok between them - but now they have another chance at love!
# Chapter 13 - The Last Day
It was the last day of summer break, and Santa was getting ready for school. He had been looking forward to this all year long because it meant he could see his friends again after being away from them during the holiday season (which was always really hard). But before heading off with Mrs. Claus on their annual Christmas Eve adventure together as husband-and-wife team in search of lost souls around town, Santa took a moment to reflect on what had happened over these past few months:
A lot changed since last year when he first met his wife at an old church where she was helping out with some charity work. They fell in love instantly - even though it was kinda weird seeing each other dressed up as elves (they were both very tall people)...Anyway, things progressed quickly from there; eventually leading them down the path towards marriage after getting engaged last May at Disney World!
But now here they are back again ready to embark on another journey together - one that will end in just
