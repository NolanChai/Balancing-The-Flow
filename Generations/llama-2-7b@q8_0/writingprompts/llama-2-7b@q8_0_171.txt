try in art as well as music so this is probably what drew me to it initially. My first foray into circles was at about age 13 when my mom had bought a pad of blue, marble-textured sketch paper and I started drawing the same pattern over and over on that paper until I'd filled up an entire page! I didn't have any idea what to call it or even if there was anything called that. The first time I actually heard someone refer to that particular pattern as a Zentangle, I thought they were talking about one of my tattoos which is also a circular pattern.

### What is Zentangle?

Zentangle is an easy-to-learn method of creating beautiful art from repetitive patterns that is fun for people of all ages to enjoy. 
 
 My approach is based on the Zentangle Method created by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas (http://zentangle-method.com/). The name "Zentangle" was coined by a student of theirs, Richard Ewing who had been doing this art since about 1993 without ever knowing that what he was doing had it's own name!

### Who is Zentangling?

All kinds of people are creating Zentangles including children, artists, architects and even corporate teams! There are also thousands of Zentangle teachers all over the world who are sharing this art with their students.

### What does it look like?

Here's an example from the [Zentangle blog](http://zentangleblog.com/2014/12/17/monday-motivation-the-future/). It doesn't really matter what you draw - circles, curves, triangles or any other geometric patterns will all do! I like to draw my patterns in black, grey and white but often I use colored pencils as well. You can also add shading with a sharpie marker for added effect.

### How long does it take?

This is an interesting question since most Zentangle art isn't something you create once and then frame up on the wall! It's more about creating something that is beautiful in its own right but also has the potential to become part of a bigger project such as a quilt, mural or collage. I sometimes spend 10 minutes drawing my patterns which can be enough for an individual pattern but when it comes time to actually create my artwork, I'm often looking at hundreds if not thousands of drawings that I've created over the past year.

### Where does the name come from?

I was searching online and found a site that had a great article about Zentangle [here](https://www.artistsnetwork.com/techniques-and-skills/zentangle-exploring-the-universe-of-patterns) which is where I learned that the name "Zentangle" was coined by Richard Ewing back in 1970 as a play on words when he was using an alphabetical list of patterns and letters to create his art.

### How do you start?

The best way to get started is with a pencil and paper! If you're new to Zentangle, I recommend [buying yourself some pencils](http://www.amazon.ca/s?k=pencil&ref=nb_sb_noss), [paper](http://www.amazon.ca/s?k=sketch+paper&ref=nb_sb_noss) and a book on Zentangle! You can find several different books online and in your local library but the one I recommend is by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas - called "The Art of Zentangle" published by Sterling Publishing.
