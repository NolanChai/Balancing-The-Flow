 Mom sat on her bed with her head down and sobbed into her hands.
I stood at my place along the wall of our small New York City apartment. My chest ached and my heart felt full and heavy, like an overstuffed backpack. I had to go home from school early that day because my mother was sick.
Mom's friend and neighbor, Mrs. Weaver—the only white person we knew in our neighborhood of Italian Americans—had stopped by with a plate of brownies she baked just for me. That afternoon I took the first bite while sitting on the couch next to Mom. The brownies were sweet and chewy and the chocolate was almost black, like molten lava, but it was hard not to notice that my mother was crying.
"Here," Mrs. Weaver said, handing me a second piece of brownie and a glass of milk. "I know this is sad for you." Mom thanked her with a weak smile as she wiped the tears from her face. I didn't say anything to my friend, but I thought it was so nice that Mrs. Weaver was giving me something special even though we were going through hard times.
I remember the first time the sound of another person's pain pierced my soul and broke my heart into a thousand little pieces. It was 20 years later, when my father died. I was sitting at his hospital bedside, watching him struggle for breath in between bouts of agonizing pain.
I knew that this was the time for me to pray. So I knelt at his bedside and asked God to heal him. "If you can," I whispered, my voice barely audible over the loud beeping sound of the machines beside us. "If it's not your will . . . if it's not time for me to lose Dad."
I stared at his pale face and closed eyes, thinking that I couldn't bear losing another parent so soon after my mother passed away. But then his eyes flickered open. "Don't stop praying," he whispered. Then I watched him take his last breaths as he gasped for air, finally letting go of his pain.
I remember the first time someone else's happiness lifted my spirit and filled me with hope. It was 2017, and I was standing in line at Starbucks when a woman tapped me on the shoulder. She had just handed her barista an order and was about to walk out of the store, but she hesitated when she saw my name tag.
"Is it true?" the woman asked. "You really have a book called _The One Year Love Language Minute Devotions_? I thought you were making it up."
I smiled back at her and nodded yes, and then we started laughing together. She told me that she'd heard about my new devotion book but didn't believe me until now when she saw the words with her own eyes. "Thank you for writing this," she said to me, clutching a copy of _The One Year Love Language Minute Devotions_ in her hands.
"You're welcome!" I smiled back at her. "I hope that it helps you on your journey toward a closer relationship with God." She thanked me again and then headed out into the bright sunshine outside, holding her copy of my devotion book over her heart.
When I was growing up in Brooklyn, New York, my dad was very strict about how we were supposed to act in public. He believed that if you behaved yourself while walking through the neighborhood or when people were around, then God would take care of everything else.
I remember the first time someone did something kind for me without asking anything in return—not because I wanted them to but just because they felt like it was the right thing to do. It happened one summer when my parents took a vacation trip up north and left us alone at home with our grandparents. We were both very excited about going somewhere where there were no rules or curfews, but then we realized how difficult it would be living in an apartment without electricity or running water for two weeks straight!
I remember the first time someone reached out to me and made me feel like I wasn't alone in this world. It was 2013, when I was sitting at my desk in the library, reading an article about the death of a child who had been shot by police officers in Ferguson, Missouri.
The story broke my heart because it reminded me that life isn't fair—and sometimes people are treated unfairly or even killed for no good reason. I wanted to help make sure something like this would never happen again, so when I saw a sign advertising free yoga classes at the library next weekend, I decided to go check it out for myself.
I remember the first time someone offered their advice to me and how much it meant when they did. It was 2008, when my best friend from college came over to visit me in New York City after graduation.
We had known each other since we were kids growing up on Long Island together but now that we were both living on our own for the first time ever, it felt like we had been separated forever! We spent hours catching up on everything going on in each of our lives while I showed him around my new apartment before heading out for dinner with some friends later on that night.
I remember the first time someone offered to help me and how much their kindness meant to me at that moment. It was 2013, when I was feeling down because my boyfriend had broken up with me after three months together. My parents had told me they didn't want anything more from me than what I could give them: money or time. And my friends were busy with their own lives—they weren't available when I needed someone most!
I remember the first time someone cared for my well-being and made me feel like I was important to them. It was 2015, when a friend from high school came back into town after living abroad for many years. I hadn't seen him in over 10 years but he still remembered our shared interests—like music—and how much fun we used to have together!
We spent hours catching up on everything going on in each other's lives while he showed me around his new apartment before heading out for dinner with some friends later that night. I remember the first time someone cared about my feelings and made me feel important, even if it was only momentarily—and how much their kindness meant to me at that particular moment!
I remember the first time someone showed up in my life unexpectedly when all hope seemed lost or when things were looking bleak. It was 2016, and I had just moved back home after dropping out of college because I didn't think it was worth going anymore (or paying for) with no job prospects on the horizon! My parents told me they wanted nothing more from me than what I could give them: money or time—but they also said that if there were ever any problems at home again then they might be able to help me out financially by sending some money over every now and again so long as we didn't abuse their generosity too much!
I remember the first time someone came into my life unexpectedly when things seemed bleak. It was 2018, and I had just moved back home after dropping out of college because I didn't think it was worth going anymore (or paying for) with no job prospects on the horizon! My parents told me they wanted nothing more from me than what I could give them: money or time—but they also said that if there were ever any problems at home again then they might be able to help me out financially by sending some money over every now and again so long as we didn't abuse their generosity too much!
I remember the first time someone gave me an opportunity to learn something new and how much it helped me in my life. It was 2017, when I decided to take up golf after watching a professional golfer on TV one day playing in a tournament at our local country club here on Long Island.
I had never played before but felt like this would be an opportunity for me—and it turned out that he taught lessons there as well! He told me all about the different types of clubs available (iron, wedge etc.) and explained how they should be used; then gave me some pointers about swinging correctly so my shots wouldn't go too far or hit any trees around us during our practice round together later that afternoon.
I remember the first time someone shared their knowledge with me and how much it helped me in my life. It was 2019, when I decided to take up golf after watching a professional golfer on TV one day playing in a tournament at our local country club here on Long Island. I had never played before but felt like this would be an opportunity for me—and it turned out that he taught lessons there as well!
I remember the first time someone came into my life unexpectedly and how much their kindness meant to me when things were looking bleak or when hope seemed lost altogether...
I remember the first time someone shared their knowledge with me and how much it helped me in my own journey through life; they had been there before so they knew what I was going through, which gave me strength
