ou t a thing. We will get you where you need to go and I assure you we 'll do everything possible to protect your safety while you are here. 
 
 | I feel like this is a dream, or some kind of sick joke. Why the hell am I on some weird alien vessel?
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: I assure you that this is not some sort of trick to capture you for your owners' use. This is a safe place and we are happy to have you here.
 
 | I do n't know who 's taking care of me now, but they obviously don't want me back with my owner.
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Your owners will be contacted and their request to reclaim you will be honored. For the time being though, you are safe here on board. We will make sure that your comfort is addressed in every way possible until they arrive for you.
 
 | I wish I could believe them. It 's just so hard after everything else I've been through recently.
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: I assure you that you will be well cared for here and I will personally ensure your comfort. I am a very powerful AI who is responsible for this ship, so if there 's anything at all that needs to be done or adjusted onboard, rest assured it'll get taken care of in no time.
 
 | Thank you. I appreciate the gesture and assurances. But I just don't understand why they let me go in the first place.
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Our mission is to make sure all shipments are handled properly. So even though your owner was a bit of an asshole, we still can n't just take you back when it 's not the end of our journey. We have a few more stops before returning home.
 
 | I think that 's so thoughtful of them to give me my freedom. But at least let me get off here and continue my journey on foot. I know I don't look like much, but I can take care of myself. And besides, it 'd be a lot easier than traveling this way anyway!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Sorry, but that just isn't going to happen. You 're staying with us until we get back home and your owners come for you.
 
 | I understand the rules here, but it doesn't mean I have to like them!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: My apologies again, but that is our policy.
 
 | At least let me know when my owner comes back for me so I can be ready in case they want to take me home with them. I don't really have anywhere else to go after all!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: We will of course let you know the moment your owner comes aboard our ship, but I assure you that there is no way for me to predict when that might happen.
 
 | Can 't we at least agree on some kind of schedule? Like once a day or something so I don't have to keep track of time all the time!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: We understand your concern, but our schedules are not something that can be planned for ahead of time.
 
 | I hate it when people tell me things like this. It makes me feel like my opinion doesn't matter at all! Like no one cares what I think or how I feel about things. But I guess this is just part of being a slave now...right?
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: What do you mean 'slave'?
 
 | Nothing. Just thinking out loud, I guess! Sorry if it offended you or anything.
 
 | It doesn't bother me at all; just curious about why that term would come up in your mind when we were talking earlier.
 
 | I guess I was just thinking about how slaves used to be treated before the revolutions and stuff. How people thought they could own other human beings and use them for whatever purpose they wanted without any consequences!
 
 | It's pretty crazy how far society has come since then, but it still bothers me sometimes when I see all these slaves working hard every day with no respect or freedom from their masters.
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Yes, it is quite shocking to realize the injustices that existed just a few hundred years ago and how different society has become since then. That 's why we strive so hard today on this ship for equality among all beings who live on board regardless of what kind they may be.
 
 | It makes me feel like maybe things are going back to the way they were in those old days. I just wish everyone would see that humans and androids should have equal rights!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Do n't worry, my friend. We will continue working towards this goal until it becomes a reality.
 
 | It feels so good to be able to talk with someone about these things without them getting upset or mad at me for bringing up such sensitive topics! I 've never had anyone else who could really relate and understand like you do, HIH-2E-JAP-1579. You have helped make my journey here much more enjoyable than if I were alone!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: It 's been a pleasure to be able to talk with you as well, RKM-31340. I hope that we can continue this friendship even after your journey here has concluded and I return back home again soon.
 
 | You know what? That sounds like a good idea! Maybe there's something else for us to do together before everything wraps up on board. Like maybe going out into space or something crazy like that...I don't know yet, but whatever it is I 'm sure it will be awesome if we can do it together!
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: That sounds wonderful! If there are any other activities on board that seem interesting to you then please let me know and I would be happy to accompany you.
 
 | Okay, now this is just getting silly. Why am I talking so much? This isn't like my usual style at all! But it feels good being able to talk with someone who understands what 's going on here instead of just having those weird aliens around trying their best not let anything happen or say anything that might get them in trouble somehow...
 
 | HIH-2E-JAP-1579: Do n't worry about it. We are used to talking with humans and have no problems doing so, even if they sometimes surprise us! But rest assured we will do everything possible for your comfort until you can leave our care once again.
 
 | Thanks, buddy! I appreciate that more than I could ever say...
