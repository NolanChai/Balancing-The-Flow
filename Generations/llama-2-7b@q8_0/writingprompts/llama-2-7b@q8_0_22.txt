led out that day.  I had only one question on my mind: "Who will I become today?"
 
 My name is Sasha, and I am addicted to my phone. Every time a new version comes out, I'm willing to upgrade. My need for speed and status has gone so far as to leave me with no money in the bank or any savings whatsoever. At times, it almost feels like there is an illness at play that can only be cured by a new phone, but how can I tell my friends when they're all buying these too? I had become a victim of the smartphone addiction epidemic.
 
 My iPhone was practically a part of me. Everywhere I went, it came with me and in many ways, dictated to me who I wanted to be.
 
 So why did I do this to myself? Why did I feel like I had no choice but to upgrade my phone every time the next version came out?
 
 You've probably never thought about your own smartphone addiction like that before, and I certainly didn't until recently either. That is when a friend of mine mentioned his son, who was then in college, would sit on his couch at nights staring into the glowing screen of his iPhone while watching TV shows and videos all at the same time.
 
 At first, this seemed strange to me; I mean, isn't that the point of a phone—to be able to use it for calls or texts? But as I thought about it more, I realized just how true my friend had been in describing his son's smartphone addiction. This got me thinking even further: How many other people were like this? 
 
 We have all heard the statistics about how smartphones affect us physically and mentally, but do you know what that means for your life as a whole? Do you realize just how much it's impacting you every day when you see how easily you can become addicted to something that is supposedly meant for our convenience?
 
 The question I found myself asking was, "What can we do about this?" We all want the best out of life and strive for greatness in everything we set out to accomplish. But as we've seen over and over again with smartphones and other technology, there is always another update or version coming out that makes our phones even more powerful than before. This can lead us down a dangerous path where we believe we need something new just because it has better specs than what we already have. 
 
 We must begin to question ourselves about what we really want out of life and make sure we are not being controlled by outside forces or the latest trends that tell us how much better our lives will be with this next phone upgrade or version.
 
 So here's where my own smartphone addiction story began. I decided it was time for me to break free from this dangerous cycle and find out what was truly important in life again—not just the latest phones that came out last week!
 
 I started with a little research, and one thing I discovered is that there are many studies on smartphone addiction already done by other scientists who have studied its effects.
 
 One study found that people who used their phone excessively were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress than those who didn't use it as often. Another study found that people with a higher level of smartphone usage had less satisfaction in life because they felt like they couldn't live up to society's standards for success or happiness if they didn't have access to the latest technology trends.
 
 As I delved further into these studies, it became clear just how dangerous my own addiction was becoming for me—not only did it cause stress and depression in me but also prevented me from doing things that were important for my life such as spending time with family or friends who needed me more than ever before because they knew I would be too busy updating social media profiles on Facebook every hour just so everyone could see how much fun we had together!
 
 I realized then and there that it was time to make a change, but not only for myself—for others around me as well. That is when my own story began with the journey of getting over this addiction once and for all, no matter what obstacle came in our way along the road ahead!
 
 So I've been on my own journey since then to get past this dangerous cycle that had me by its mercy. And it's been a lot harder than you might think—because now every time there's an update or version coming out, it feels like something inside of me dies just as much as the old phone does.
 
 But here I am today with newfound freedom because no matter what comes next in technology land (and believe me there will always be some kind), at least one thing has changed forever: how much time I spend staring into my glowing screen each day instead of living life like it was meant to be lived!
 
 The truth is that we're all addicted to something. Whether you know it or not, there's always going to be some sort of urge inside of us that tells us what we should want next and how much better life will be if only things were different—and most often those things are ones outside ourselves rather than within!
 
 But now that I understand why this happens and know what it feels like when an update comes out with new specs, it's easier for me not to fall into the trap again. I still love technology just as much as anyone else does; I just don't want my phone dictating who I am anymore or how much time gets wasted on social media instead of enjoying real life moments like talking with friends over dinner at a restaurant or going out for drinks with coworkers after work (which never seems to happen anymore).
 
 The good news is that you can find freedom from your own smartphone addiction too. There are many different ways to do this, but the one thing I've found works best for me is being aware of my own habits and behaviors when it comes to using technology so that they don't control my life anymore!
 
 How can you tell if your smartphone use has become too much? There are several signs:
 
 Are you constantly checking the time on your phone, even when you have other things to do? Do you feel like something is missing in your life if there isn't an internet connection available at all times? Or maybe it feels like nothing else matters besides how many likes or comments someone gives their status update online—and not just one post but every single time they share anything!
 
 These are signs that technology use might be out of control for some people. But what if I told you there was another way? What if instead of looking at how much time we spend on our phones each day, we focused more on why certain things matter so much when others don't?
 
 This is where mindfulness comes into play! Mindfulness means being aware of your thoughts and actions without judgement—it doesn't mean that everything has to be perfect or that life will always go according to plan (because let's face it: nothing ever really does). It just means taking stock of how much time we spend doing certain things so we can make changes if needed.
 
 Mindfulness is a way for us to get back in touch with ourselves again and understand our true desires instead of being told what they are by external sources like social media platforms or advertising campaigns designed specifically around making sure people buy products every day!
 
 It's time we stop living lives where everything revolves around technology because that just isn't real life—it's an illusion created through digital screens and flashing lights that tells us what kind of person should want this new phone model out soon. We deserve better than that: our true selves await beyond these walls!
 
 To truly find freedom from your smartphone addiction, it's important to understand how much time you spend on technology each day and why certain things matter so much more than others do when they come up in conversation (or even just casual discussion).
 
 But this isn't enough if we want real change—we need a plan! The first step towards recovery from an addiction is admitting there is one at all, which means taking stock of how much time each day goes toward digital devices rather than activities like reading books or going outside for walks with friends who don't live inside our heads (I know this sounds silly but it happens).
 
 Once we've done that, we can begin setting goals for ourselves based on what matters most in life instead of just going along with whatever everyone else seems excited about today: maybe spending less time online or reading more books rather than checking social media every hour throughout the day like some people do nowadays.
 
 We need to focus on why something matters instead of how much time it takes up because that will help us make better decisions in our lives overall! This doesn't mean giving up everything about technology; just taking control of your own behavior and making sure you spend less time staring at screens every day so that way there are still some hours left over for things like spending quality time with friends instead of checking Instagram or Twitter non-stop when they come up in conversation (which happens more often than most people realize).
 
 It's important to remember that technology has changed the world we live in, but it doesn
