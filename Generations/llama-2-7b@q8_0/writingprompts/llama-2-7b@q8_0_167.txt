100 percent that they are going to leave you. That is something I never want to do to anyone; therefore, why would I subject myself to such heartache?
I have been with my husband for almost three years now. He's the best man I've ever met in this life or any other. He treats me like a queen, he makes me feel like I am the most important person on the planet, and he has never put a hand on me, harmed me in any way or even raised his voice at me. He is honestly my dream guy.
I've been with him for almost three years now and we are only 21. We met through friends when I was 17 and he was 18 (we were both underage). We had a couple of bad breakups over the last two-and-a-half years, but we always found our way back to each other. I've never stopped loving him because there is something about him that keeps me coming back for more every time he screws up and hurts me. He has his demons, though.
His mother abused drugs when he was younger, so he had a tough childhood. His father left when he was young to be with another woman. He grew up in foster homes, and now that he's older he gets really angry at the world for the way he was raised, for what happened to his parents. Sometimes I feel like we are more friends than lovers because of these things.
I would like to get married one day and have kids with this man. It's scary to think about that because it means that I have to be 100 percent sure that he is going to be the father of my children. He has said that he wants to settle down, but lately his actions don't match up with what he says.
Whenever we argue now, he gets angry and will say hurtful things. I have stopped being upset by this because I know it means that he is trying to hurt me like my parents hurt him as a child. He gets really intoxicated when he fights, and lately when he starts to fight, he can't stop; once he starts going, he goes until the end.
He has tried rehab twice now and he is in there right now for the third time trying again because of his anger issues, but I have no faith that it will work. He says he knows this won't change and he apologizes to me every day, but how can someone who fights with you one week apologize to you the next? How am I supposed to trust him when everything in me is telling me he is not going to be better?
He doesn't hit or hurt me; he doesn't abuse drugs. He just gets angry and says things that aren't true, but that I know are coming out of his frustration. I don't want to leave him because I love this guy and I want nothing more than for us to have a happy family one day, but I also don't want to stay with someone who is never going to change. How do I make the decision that I am going to end it for good?
I know there are a lot of people out there that think divorce and separation isn't really breaking up at all; they feel like you should just leave him and let God sort things out. They believe that if two people come together, then they belong together forever, no matter what happens. I can agree with this statement on the surface, but when it comes to my relationship I think that there needs to be more to it than simply love.
I've always believed in marriage being a union between two soulsâ€”and not just two bodies. I know it doesn't work like that for everyone, but I do believe that if you are meant to stay with someone for the rest of your life, then God will bring you back together no matter what happens or how long apart you are.
In my situation, though, I don't think this is going to happen. I know he has his demons and I know that it is not easy for him to control them all of the time, but at some point in life I have to accept the fact that there comes a point where you need to just let go of the past and move on because it's never going to change.
I think it would be good for me to end this relationship because my heart can't take it anymore; his anger is getting more intense as time goes on, and I am worried that one day he is going to hurt me in a way that I might not ever recover from. I don't want him to do something stupid just like his dad did, and I know my parents did the same thing with us when we were younger, so it makes me even more angry about this whole situation because they all feel like they are victims of something instead of being the cause of what happened themselves.
I think that if you love someone enough, then you will let them go to be happy in their life too and not just stay with them for no reason except that you want them close by. I have given everything I could possibly give him over these years we've been together, but it still hasn't changed anything between us because he doesn't think his actions are wrong or bad enough to change any time soon.
I know I am only 21 and still young in age compared to most people on this earth who have already gone through so much pain in their life with relationships that didn't work out, but at some point it becomes too much for anyone no matter how old you are or what type of personality you may have.
I wish I could just end everything now because every single day feels like a new battle with him and his demons, but I can't because I love him more than anything on this planet. I know if I leave him right now without telling him the real reason why then he will never understand how much it hurts me when we fight and argue over things that have already happened in our past together instead of moving forward into a new future with each other.
I don't want to be with someone who can't change; I want someone who wants to change but just needs help finding their way again after they have hit rock bottom like so many people do before finding out what really matters in life and how important it is to treat everyone around you respectfully no matter who they are or where they came from.
I have given him every opportunity possible over these past three years, but now I need to give myself one too by ending this relationship once and for all because there will never be a happy ending if we continue like this forever more with nothing ever changing between us even though deep down inside of both our hearts' desire is love only happiness can bring.
I am not sure what the right thing to do is here; I want him in my life, but I don't think he wants me around anymore either because when we fight it gets so intense that it feels like we are about to kill each other at times instead of just saying sorry and moving on as friends should do after things get out of hand.
I think this letter will help me move forward in life by telling him how much I love him but also how hard it has been for me too during these past three years without knowing if there is any hope left anymore between us since he seems determined never to change who he really is no matter what happens from here on out.
I want someone who will love me forever because that's all you can ever ask for in this life and nothing less than that matters when it comes down to being happy again like before when we were first dating each other all those years ago now long gone into oblivion now only memories remain left behind of what used be once upon a time between two souls forever entwined together as one for eternity!
