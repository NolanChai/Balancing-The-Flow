 is what you want. And a nice black shade over here so you can see what you're doing.
And once again we have our brush in place, and we'll just start with the base coat. So that would be your first layer of paint on there. It looks pretty dark right now but it will get lighter as it dries, and I will get more into my techniques later on. But for now you want to go ahead and start applying that base coat.
You see how thick it is? You can always thin this out with some water. Don't worry about making it too watery, you just don't want to put a bunch of paint in there at one time. It'll make the lines thicker later on so I suggest a very little bit of water, if any. And now that we have our base coat laid out and we're just waiting for it to dry, we can go ahead and add some detail into our design by painting the linework.
Now this will be in contrast with your base coat color because you want your lines to stand out from the background. I like using white for my details because I think that's easier to see, but feel free to use any color that you want. And it doesn't have to be all one solid color either. You can do things in different shades and even with some of your colors and patterns mixing together.
But for now we are just going to go ahead and start by drawing a linework pattern, so I will go ahead and get into my first few lines and then show you the rest later on in this tutorial. But you see how that works? And it's very easy once you understand the basics of using the brush tool and what not.
And once again we can always thin out our paint if needed by using some water but I do not suggest doing that for your details. You want to keep everything pretty thick right now, so once again just a little bit at a time. And once you get all those lines laid down then it's time to go ahead and start filling in the spaces between the lines.
Now this is where things can get tricky because it does not have to be perfect but I think it looks better if everything is nice and neatly filled in. So, we will just go ahead and start with the top area, so you see how that works? We fill everything in between our lines then we move onto the next section. And we'll do this for each of these sections until we get down to where we have all these little boxes now.
And I always like doing things in a pattern. You don't have to, but it makes it look nicer and I think easier on your eyes. So you want to take some time now, let everything dry up for a bit, and then start filling those lines in. It doesn't have to be perfect either. If you make little mistakes that's fine because once again we will fix this stuff later on with Photoshop but right now it's important just to get your painting down on the canvas.
And I always like doing things in a pattern as well, so if you are just starting off and you don't know where to start or what not then that would be a good idea for you. And once again we will go ahead and start filling those lines in right now. And let everything dry up before the next step, but we can do some other stuff while this paint is drying.
Now when I am doing these paintings they always take me a really long time to get them perfect, so that's why I suggest just doing the basic layout first and then filling it in later on. And once again if you make mistakes then Photoshop can fix it for you later on, but right now we are going to go ahead and do some other things while this paint dries up.
So like I said before you could start by adding some other color details into the design. So that would be a good idea for you if you want to try doing something else while your paint is drying. Or you can also just relax while it's drying, go get a drink or whatever, but at least have a plan in mind on what you are going to do next.
Now I like adding some other details in the background, so we will go ahead and draw our next set of lines using a different color paint and then fill them in. And let this dry up again for a bit before doing anything else, but once again if your base coat is too dark then you could always thin it out with a little water to make some lighter shades or whatever not.
And we will go ahead and move onto the next area now that we have our basic paint down on there. So this would be another set of lines drawn in, so we'll start by drawing them first and then filling those in as well. And once again you don't need to worry about making everything perfect either because if something happens with Photoshop it's okay later on.
And you can also go ahead and add some other details to your design as well while the paint is drying like adding more shades, colors or patterns into your design. Just remember that these things do not have to be exact, so if you make a mistake with Photoshop you can fix it later on. Now I'm just going ahead and show you what my base coat looks like right now, but this paint dries pretty fast so we will go ahead and move onto the next step.
And once again we are always looking for the perfect balance of colors because if you use too much one color then it makes your painting look boring. And I've used a few different colors on here already so that's why this looks really nice, but if you want to use just one solid color then go ahead and do that as well.
But for now we will continue drawing in our next set of lines using another color paint because they won't be exactly the same color as your base coat, they will have some difference between them. And once again you don't need to worry about making everything perfect either because Photoshop can fix any mistakes later on.
And we will continue drawing in our next set of lines using a different color paint and fill those in as well. Now this is what your canvas looks like right now, so if you want to start adding some other details then that would be a good idea for you. And once again remember that these things do not have to be perfect either because Photoshop can fix any mistakes later on.
And we will move onto the next area of our canvas and continue drawing in more lines like this using another different color paint. Now it doesn't have to look exactly like your base coat, so feel free to use whatever colors you want as well. And once again you don't need to worry about making everything perfect either because Photoshop can fix any mistakes later on.
And we will continue drawing in our next set of lines using a different color paint and fill those in as well.
