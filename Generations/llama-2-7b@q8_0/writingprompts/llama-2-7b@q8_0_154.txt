king machine on with the pump still attached. But those were honest mistakes. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone, right?
But after meeting Gavin, everything changed. And now I 'm not so sure . . .
Every day for a year, I've tried to be the best person possible—but what good does it do if no one believes me? Gavin may be the first boy who isn 't afraid of my dark side and maybe he's even falling in love with me. But when you're as deeply flawed as I am, can a guy like him ever look past the damage?
I have never been attracted to anyone who has done anything close to what Gavin did, but here it is. There are reasons why I shouldn’t fall for this bad boy, but there are just as many reasons I should. I don’t know if my heart can take a chance on someone like him or if he even deserves me at all.
In My Bad Boy Ex-Best Friend by Annabelle Costa, seventeen year old Ariel is in love with her best friend Gavin. She loves how he makes her feel and she also knows that they’ll never be more than friends. In spite of this fact, Gavin does something to Ariel that breaks both their hearts into pieces. The book follows their lives as they navigate through their painful past and present while attempting to discover whether or not they will ever find love again.
This novel was a very sweet, touching read, but it took me a couple of chapters to get completely immersed in the storyline. The author writes this novel in alternating points of view from Ariel's and Gavin's perspectives. I found myself enjoying Ariel’s point of view more than Gavin’s because she was so realistic with her emotions and reactions to certain situations.
Ariel is a sweet, innocent girl who has never done anything wrong or bad in her life until the moment that everything changes forever. She’s the kind of person you can't help but love, especially after learning more about her past. Gavin is the type of guy I would have fallen for in high school because he is such a sweetheart. His character has some redeeming qualities to him, which made me like him even though he did something so awful and painful.
One of my favorite things about this novel was that it was realistic. It portrayed what could happen after someone does something bad in high school and how they might try to make amends for their actions later on in life. This storyline was very heart-breaking at times, but also hopeful when the characters were trying to find love again. I’ll definitely be looking out for more from this author because she writes beautiful stories!
