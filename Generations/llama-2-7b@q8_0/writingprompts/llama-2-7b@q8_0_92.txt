ow about our day-to-day activities. So I signed in on Facebook, and then one of my friends shared the following link: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Arabian-Amulets/108342678225682?ref=ts&v=wall
At first glance, I thought it was a funny joke or something like that (it's the only thing I could think about when I saw ``Satanic Symbols''). So I clicked on the link. Then I read:
This is an Arabian amulet with magical powers to protect from evil eye, black magic and any type of witchcraft and harmful spells. It also has healing properties.
The first thing that came out of my mind was ``What??? Satanic Symbols are now a part of Islam?!'' I know it might sound unbelievable to some people, but in reality, wearing such amulets is not only acceptable and permissible in Islam; rather it's encouraged and strongly recommended by many scholars.
I did some research on the topic and found that:
- the devil is called Shaytan (شيطان) in Arabic, and wearing these amulets has nothing to do with Satanism.
- The symbol of the Star of David (also known as the hexagram or pentagram depending on how you look at it) does not have anything to do with satanism either. It's an ancient Hebrew symbol that means ``God is One'' and ``Perfection''. However, Satanists use this symbol and call it their own!
- In Islam, the number 666 (known as the Number of the Beast in the Christian bible) has nothing to do with satanism. It actually refers to Prophet Solomon, peace be upon him.
Arabian amulets have been used in Arabia for centuries and it's part of our cultural heritage. In the book ''The Forty Rules Of Love'' by Shaykh Nurjan Mirahmadi (may Allah guide us), he mentions that wearing amulets is recommended, based on many authentic traditions from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
For example, Ibn Abbas narrates, "Whenever the Messenger of Allah came out to deliver a sermon or offer prayer, he would put an amulet around his neck.'' The Prophet's companion Uthman bin Talhah reports that once when they were on a journey and the Prophet had been wounded in the leg by a stone, one of his companions suggested to him that he should make use of an amulet, which would cure the wound. The Prophet took off the amulet from Uthman bin Talhah's neck, applied it on his wound and then threw away the amulet. After this incident, whenever someone asked any of the companions to give him an amulet they refused saying that it had already been given to them by the Prophet himself and thrown away.
Ibn Abbas narrates, "Whenever the Messenger of Allah came out to deliver a sermon or offer prayer, he would put an amulet around his neck."
- Ibn Jarir reports that when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) left for the Battle of Tabuk, he took with him certain amulets. When the companions asked him about them, the Prophet said, "It is from Allah's mercy; I like it to have near me."
- Jabir bin Abdullah reports that when the Messenger of Allah Muhammad (peace be upon him) was wounded in one of his battles, he tied a knot around the wound and asked for amulets from the companions. They gave him several amulets until they had exhausted their supply. The Prophet then took them all together and tied them around his neck.
- Abdullah bin Umar reports that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to tie an amulet around his leg when he went out on journeys.
The Prophet's companions, the Sahaba, used to wear them and they were accepted by their contemporaries. The first generation of Muslims had no objection against wearing these amulets since they received them directly from the Messenger himself! It was later that people began to think of these amulets as something magical or evil, because it is not common for any society to accept the superstitious beliefs of another.
Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) also said: "Our companions would put these amulets on their children and take them out in battles with them, as they used to believe that if one wore such an amulet he would not get killed."
One day the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) passed by a group of his Companions who were engaged in discussion about magic. The Prophet asked: "What is this?" They replied that they were discussing magic, and some of them said that it was true while others denied its existence. Thereupon the Prophet remarked: "How can you deny what I have seen? One night during the battle of Hunayn when my Companions fled, I turned back to help them and there were only twenty men with me. We fought against the enemy for three nights and four days and by the will of Allah we were able to beat him and chase him away. Then we returned to Medina as winners. On my return I was fasting and I performed two rak'ahs in the morning prayer, then went out for another raid, but when I came back in the evening I was told that Abu Sufyan had arrived at my doorstep seeking peace. When he entered, I said to him: 'Do you know that Allah has given us superiority over you? So if you want to save your life and belongings, then withdraw from Medina.' He replied: 'We will not withdraw from this town until we meet either death or punishment from Allah at the hands of Muhammad.'
So I went to bed in my tent with two men sleeping by me. Suddenly one of them awoke screaming and said, "Messenger of God, enemy troops have entered the camp." When I saw that he was right, I awoke the other man who also confirmed that they had entered our camp. So I went out to meet them. After saying my prayers, I came back and said: 'O Allah! Make us victorious over these unbelievers.' Then we attacked them and drove them away. We continued to attack them till they returned to their camps on the fifth day." When Abu Sufyan was asked what had caused this disaster for him, he replied that it was because of a black woman who practiced magic.
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Were it not that I have come to know from Allah what you cannot possibly guess, the woman would certainly have cast a spell on you all." And when Abu Sufyan went back and told his companions about this, they consulted some of their leaders who were experts in magic. They said: "We are well aware that Muhammad is an honest man and has never seen a magician. But he knows very well that there is no power in what you do other than the power which Allah has given to him; and he knows also that none can protect himself against your spells except by means of something stronger than yours."
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) then sent for Umamah bin Zainab who was a woman expert in magic. When she entered the presence of Allah's Apostle, he said to her: "Umamah! Do you know that magic is prohibited?" She replied: "Yes." He asked: "Do you practice it?" She replied in the affirmative and he ordered his Companions to chain her up.
Then the Prophet went out of her presence but soon returned, taking some dust from the ground. When he had finished doing so, he said: "Umamah! Do you know that this is a cure for every disease?" She answered: "Yes." He asked her: "Do you believe that there will be no resurrection on the Day of Judgment?" And she replied in the affirmative.
Then Allah's Apostle said to his Companions, "Umamah was a magician. So what do you think should be done with her now?" They said: "She should be killed." He agreed and they killed her. Then the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) went back inside his tent where he found Abu Sufyan sleeping on one of his mats, so he threw it away from behind him to wake him up.
When Abu Sufyan heard this story, he realized that Allah had protected His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from harm through the magic and evil of Umamah bin Zainab and all other practitioners like her who tried to harm his Companions by means of spells or incantations.
