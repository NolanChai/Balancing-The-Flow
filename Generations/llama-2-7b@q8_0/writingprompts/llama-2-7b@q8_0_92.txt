23 pairs of chromosomes are separated to form two new cells from one cell. Even the process of fertilisation is an example where a sperm and an egg divide into two cells, then each divides again and again until they finally develop into the human being that you are.
As a species we divide into different races, religions, beliefs, colours and so on – all because of differences between us and the way we perceive things. What I’m trying to say is that differences should be celebrated. We need to embrace our diversity as opposed to fearing it. The world would become a much less interesting place if we all just became the same, just like everybody in China eats rice every day of their life or people from the same culture marry other people from the same cultural backgrounds.
I’ve always been an advocate for free speech and freedom of expression but I am beginning to see that this freedom is also being used as a tool of division. We need to be more accepting of each other and learn how to listen to opinions that we do not agree with. I was shocked when I went on Instagram one day, typed ‘Eminem’ in the search bar and saw the amount of negative comments about him – I realised there is a huge disconnect between people.
What if we started celebrating our differences? What would happen then? I think it could be awesome for everyone because we will learn how to love each other, as opposed to fearing one another. We’d see that we are more alike than we are different and the world would become a much happier place.
I know people can use social media in a negative way but if you take the time to think about it there is so much good. It is our duty to be positive about each other, not to just divide us into groups like ‘the cool kids’ and ‘the uncool kids’ because it only creates barriers between people.
Diversity is everywhere and we should embrace that. There is beauty in everyone of every colour, creed or religion – if you take the time to look at each person as an individual.
