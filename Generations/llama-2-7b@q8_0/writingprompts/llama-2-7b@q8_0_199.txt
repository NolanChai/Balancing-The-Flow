ether comprehend nor find comfort in the fact.
Ashen and cold, my body was moved into a vessel, one that appeared as a glass cylinder, with the lid on top of it. There was nothing to do but wait as the machine hummed, running its routine checks. Then, finally, I woke up.
I found myself in a large room. There were two doors across from each other and a small desk just past the doorway. On the desk was a terminal and on top of it sat a cup of hot tea with an untouched sandwich. It was all so familiar yet new at the same time. My mind had been wiped clean and I knew nothing.
The only thing that made me feel even slightly at ease was the sound of voices down the hall. They seemed to be discussing something about me, but as I approached, I heard my name mentioned twice. Fear struck through my chest and then the doors opened. A tall man in a blue suit stepped into the room and spoke. "Oh, good morning. It is very nice to meet you at last."
I stood there silent, unable to speak or even think straight. The man smiled at me and extended his hand for a shake. I shook it limply and he let go. Then he sat down on one of the two chairs across from each other. "You are wondering how long ago this all began." He said in that same friendly tone.
I nodded, my fear becoming a rage at being treated like some kind of animal in a zoo.
"Well, let me explain," he stood back up and walked over to the desk, then pulled out a chair from underneath it. "Sit." He said, pointing to the seat behind him. I did as I was told but sat very close to his face, making sure I had some space between us in case something went wrong.
"I am here today because of a certain event," he continued. "Something that will forever alter the future and affect your people more than you could ever imagine."
As he spoke, my anger was turning into confusion, then to fear once again. "Why are you telling me this?" I asked. My voice was weak, barely above a whisper.
The man smiled at me with those sharp teeth of his as he spoke again. "It is a long story, one that will take many hours and days to tell." He said calmly. Then, he looked straight ahead. "But it all starts here."
I sat there and listened to him speak, but I could not comprehend any of what he was saying. The words were foreign to my mind as if a language so old, I'd never been able to understand it before. And for the next two hours he talked. All about how we met in another timeline that had long since passed and died when time collapsed on itself.
Then the man got up from his chair and went over to me again. He sat back down across from me, but this time close enough for our knees to be touching. "I wish I could tell you what's going on," he said softly so only I could hear him. "But it is beyond my understanding as well."
I nodded slowly and tried to say something, but found myself speechless again. So instead of words, all that came out were tears. The man sat there patiently as I cried into his lap. Then he reached over and touched my head softly before standing back up once more. "Do not worry," he said with a smile as he walked towards the door. "Your journey has only just begun."
That was when I saw him for who he really was. He had been wearing a mask, but it slipped down his face and showed me what was hidden beneath. He was an angel. An old friend from long ago. The one I'd known since time began. And as he walked out the door, I knew that this was just another part of my journey.
