 The blood ran out of my ears. Then blackness came over me and I passed out.
I woke up in a hospital bed with tubes running into my arms. It hurt like crazy when I moved them. My face, too. It had swollen so much that the skin was sticking to my cheek bones. My eyes felt as if they were filled with cotton and there were blisters around one of them. My whole body ached from head to toe. 
I don't know how long I was in hospital, but it must have been a couple of weeks because I had to learn to walk again. They told me my brain would heal eventually, although I wouldn't be the same again. They said that I'd have short-term memory loss and suffer from migraines for the rest of my life, which might explain why I couldn't remember who I was or how I got to London in the first place. 
I didn't like being cooped up in a hospital bed with strangers coming into my room at all hours of the day and night asking me questions about what happened to me. They weren't as gentle and caring as they promised, either. I knew how to look after myself and I refused to let them do things for me. I could get out of bed by myself.
They couldn't understand why I kept saying I had no memory of anything at all. I didn't understand it either, but I did have a feeling that there were secrets inside my head that were going to come out sooner or later. They wouldn't stay hidden for ever and they would be very dangerous once they came loose. 
I felt sick and feared what the consequences might be if these things broke free. I knew that something bad had happened, but I didn't know how serious it was at the time. I couldn't remember anything except my name - Jessica Willard-Little - and that I lived in London with my mother.
I wanted to find her. Wherever she was I knew she must be worried about me. It had been over two weeks since she'd last seen or heard from me and the police thought I might have been kidnapped, but there were no leads on my disappearance. My name, age and address weren't in any of the databases. No one knew who I was or where to find me. It didn't take long for the authorities to conclude that they had a missing person's case on their hands. 
I needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. After I left the hospital, I would go home and explain everything to my mother. I wanted her to know how much I loved her and how she was always in my thoughts. I never meant to upset or hurt her. She had been so good to me for such a long time. How could anyone not love her? 
It took months before I recovered from my injuries, but I persevered and kept telling myself that things would be all right. Then one morning when I was having breakfast with the nurse, a detective came into my room to inform me that someone had reported me missing and that they were looking for me as well. He said the police were investigating. 
My mind went blank again. This time there wasn't a single word in it. It was empty like a cavern filled with darkness. I tried not to look at him, but when he left, all I could think of was going home and finding my mother. Wherever that might be, I wanted to see her face and hold her close to me once more. 
That same day a policeman came back into my room, sat down next to me on the bed and asked if I knew where I'd been for the past two years. When I said no he showed me photographs of different places in England: London, Manchester, Bristol, Brighton - all the major cities except Glasgow. He flicked through them until we came across one that made me gasp when I saw my mother in it. The picture had been taken outside the Old Town Hall on a busy street and she was holding her handbag by its strap. There was no mistaking who it was. 
The detective didn't believe that I had forgotten where I lived, so he wanted to know why I left home and where my mother might be now. It was as if there were two of me inside my head. One wanted to tell him everything while the other knew it would get me into trouble for not revealing anything. 
The policeman said they had checked all the missing person reports and nobody in England, Wales or Scotland reported a girl matching my description. My parents weren't married anymore, so he didn't know who else to contact. He asked if I wanted him to get hold of someone from social services or the police over there - that was where my mother had moved to after she split up with my father - but I said no and that I would ask them when they came looking for me. 
I didn't tell anyone else about these pictures, not even my doctor because he was as confused as I was by what had happened to me. When the police left, I asked the nurse how long I could stay in the hospital until I found out who I was and where I belonged, but she said there were no more funds available for me now that they'd determined that my injuries weren't life-threatening anymore. 
I didn't want to spend another night away from home so when they suggested going back to London I agreed immediately. They told me that the only reason I was allowed out was because I could walk again, but if anything bad happened on my way there, then they wouldn't be responsible for any consequences. 
The police said that nobody would hurt me because they knew nothing about what had happened before I lost all memory of it, but I still wanted to go with someone else who could look after me in case something went wrong and they couldn't help.
It was my last day at the hospital when the doctor gave me a piece of paper that had my address on it along with contact details for social services so if anything did happen then somebody would be able to call them straight away and let them know where I was going next. 
I was told they'd come round every day until I moved out, but I knew there wouldn't be any point because even though the police said they wanted me safe in London again, they also said they couldn't guarantee anything else. They didn't have enough information yet to do that. 
My doctor offered to drive me home himself if needed and he also told me that one of his friends was a policeman who lived near my new house so maybe I could stay there until everything got sorted out properly. That would mean that no one else knew where I'd been living either because they wouldn't have known how to contact them directly or through social services if anything went wrong again, but at least it meant having some security until something else happened. 
I didn't want to stay in London anymore than I wanted any more pain. The only thing left was for me to find my mother and explain everything that had gone on while we were apart. She deserved an explanation as much as I did, although I knew she wouldn't understand why it happened or believe what I told her either way. 
The police said they wanted to question my father again about where he last saw me because there wasn't any other information available until that point, but they couldn't do anything else without more evidence than just his word for it alone since nobody had seen me alive in years and even though I was supposedly dead according to the reports - which meant nobody knew if my body could still be found somewhere - it wouldn't count as proof unless someone saw me myself again. 
I wasn't sure what else would happen next because I didn't know how much longer I could stay in this place before something happened, but at least I was home now and ready to start a new chapter of my life wherever that might lead me next...
