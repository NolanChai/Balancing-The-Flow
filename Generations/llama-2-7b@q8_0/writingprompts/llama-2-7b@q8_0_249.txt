"No," I said with what I hoped was the proper amount of firmness, "we can't give you what you want."

Fëanor stared at me, his eyes wide. His face, and indeed every inch of him, seemed to be on fire - but this wasn't a case of an overly enthusiastic speaker being unable to control the intensity of his emotion. It was pure rage. My eyes narrowed as I considered what I had just said.

"You cannot refuse," he hissed. "I will have my reward, and you know it!" He stomped towards me with fury in every step. 

I stepped backwards and gestured for him to stop - but my gesture was ignored. Fëanor continued until I retreated into the room behind the desk.

"You must give us our reward," he hissed, coming up to me so that we were face-to-face. "Or you will suffer!" He brought his fist down on the table hard enough for a cloud of dust to rise and float in the sunlight streaming through the windows behind him. I waved it away as best as I could. 

"That is not necessary," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "I will give you what you need - but there must be some consideration on your part."

Fëanor sneered and raised his eyebrows. He opened his mouth to speak - but then closed it again as he thought better of whatever he had been about to say. Instead, he leaned over the table until our noses were almost touching. 

"I do not negotiate with thieves," he said in a low, menacing tone that made my blood run cold. "I will have my reward - and you must give it to me!"

I met his stare without flinching, though the thought of what would happen if I didn't satisfy him was making me sweat under my robe. "You do not understand," I said. 

"Oh?" he replied sarcastically. "What am I missing? Do you think that we will be so happy with the work you have done for us - so grateful to your king and country, perhaps - that we will allow you to keep our reward? Do you really believe we would trust a thief like yourself not to try and run away with it?" 

I shrugged. "As long as I am here," I said, "there is no danger of that." 

Fëanor's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "But what if you decide to leave?" he asked, his tone suddenly calm and almost pleasant again. He leaned back from the table and rubbed at his beard with both hands. 

I shook my head. "That would never happen," I said. 

Fëanor looked doubtful but kept quiet as I took a deep breath and continued: "We have already found the locations of two of your jewels, and will soon have three more. We will return them to you - but in exchange for our help you must agree to give us one other thing."

Fëanor's expression changed again as he stared at me expectantly, waiting to hear my conditions. I knew it would be pointless trying to explain myself any further; the decision had already been made. 

"All who dwelt in Aman were filled with wonder and delight," I said, quoting the Silmarillion, "at the work of Fëanor." I glanced up at his face for a moment before returning my eyes to the paper in front of me. I had been practicing this line all morning - ever since Carcharoth's letter had arrived and I'd found out what he was willing to do for us, if given the chance. 

Fëanor was still looking at me, his eyes wide with anger but also curiosity as well it seemed; he knew that something big was coming but didn't know exactly what it might be. I could tell from his expression that he wasn't entirely sure whether or not to trust me, either. 

"I think you should agree," I said at last, "because we both know how important this is."

Fëanor gave me a long, hard stare before looking away and shaking his head in disbelief - but he knew that he had no choice. He had never seen someone as determined to get what they wanted as Carcharoth was; even Sauron himself might have been put off by such a force of will! 

"It is not an unreasonable request," I continued, "but if you refuse it then we will take matters into our own hands and find out for ourselves." Fëanor stared at me again as my words sunk in; he could see that I meant what I was saying. After a few moments of silence he reached down to pick up his gauntlet from the floor where it had fallen during our earlier argument. 

"Very well," he said, "I will give you one of my jewels - but only if you promise me that no harm comes to any of your friends or family while they are in Aman."

"So," I asked as I poured myself a cup of coffee, "where do we go from here?"

Fëanor sighed and rubbed at his eyes. "I don't know," he replied with resignation, "and that makes me nervous." 

"But you have to admit," I continued, "that it was a brilliant plan - especially if everything works out as we hope!" Fëanor shrugged and took the mug of coffee I had poured for him. He stared into the liquid for several seconds before taking a sip. 

"I know that," he said, "but what about these other two? How will they react when we tell them our news?" 

"Well," I replied, "that depends on how well you do your job." I turned to face Fëanor and gave him a small smile. He returned it with an equally small one of his own. 

Fëanor nodded as he took another sip from the mug in front of him; then he stood up and walked over to look out of one of the large windows that lined our office wall on three sides (the fourth was occupied by a pair of doors which led into an adjacent room). He stared out at nothing in particular for several minutes before turning back around again. 

"I am not sure if I like this plan," he said, "but if you say that it is important enough then perhaps there is something to be done." Fëanor paused and rubbed at his eyes again with one hand while the other held onto a fistful of hair as he thought for several seconds. 

"I can't believe I agreed," he said after some time had passed, "but now that I know how important this is then perhaps it will all be worthwhile." Fëanor looked out at nothing again before turning back towards me and smiling once more; this time his expression was slightly less strained than before. 

"What if you fail?" I asked. Fëanor stared at me with an almost comical look of surprise on his face for a moment or two before replying: "I will not let that happen." He paused again and sighed before turning back towards me once more, this time with a serious expression which made it clear that he was not joking. 

"We have no choice," I said. Fëanor nodded as though he agreed wholeheartedly with everything I had just told him; then he took another drink from the mug in front of him before sitting back down at his desk again. 

Fëanor shook his head and stared off into space for several minutes more, thinking about what I had said and how important our new plan would be if it worked out correctly - but at last he gave up on his thoughts and looked back towards me instead; then after taking another drink from the mug in front of him he spoke once again: "We must be careful."

"Of course," I replied, "but we can handle this. As long as we stick together then nothing will happen to us - especially now that we have our own army!" Fëanor smiled at me briefly before taking another drink from the mug in front of him and returning his attention towards something outside once again; only this time he didn't stop staring until several minutes had passed by without any interruptions or distractions - which meant that I had succeeded in getting him thinking about what we were doing for long enough to forget all about our meeting with the elf king and queen! 

Fëanor turned back towards me again, his expression still serious but now showing some signs of relief as well. "I suppose you are right," he said at last; then without warning he stood up from behind his desk and walked over
