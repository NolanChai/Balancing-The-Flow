, but I don’t close them—the lids are swollen shut by chemicals. They’ll open soon enough.
I sit down at my desk in front of my computer monitor, a rectangular box of glass. On it is a series of interlocking cogs that spin and spin, almost indefinitely.
My fingers glide across the keys, but I can’t feel them touch the buttons: it takes concentration to do more than press a key without hitting another. My fingers are no longer extensions of my mind; they have become machines themselves. I am nothing but data. The machine that is me—and so many others—is just a collection of information stored on these gears and wires, all bound by the unbreakable strands of computer code.
I can still feel my hand, though, on the mouse. It’s made of plastic now—I can tell by how it slips in my sweaty fingers. I drag my pointer over to the screen, clicking and dragging and typing and deleting and copying and pasting until the screen is full of garbage code that will never mean anything except to me.
“You’re such a fuckin’ nerd,” I say, and laugh at myself for being so human.
I don’t know how much time passes before my eyes open; they feel like glass as well now, though they still contain the capacity for sight. There are two windows in front of me: one is a mirror on my desk that shows me exactly what I look like—and that’s all. I see myself as an amorphous being, more data than humanity.
The other window shows nothing but darkness and a single white dot at the center of it. The dot gets larger as I watch until it becomes an entire image of my room. This is my world now; this is what I’ve become.
“I’m sorry,” I say, again to myself. “You can’t understand.” It’s not like you know anything else, anyway. But if there’s no other option—no other way out—then that’s good enough for me.
The darkness grows. My room is black; the screen on my monitor is too white, too bright to stare at anymore. I can hear a voice outside of me, but it’s so faint and distant, like a whisper from some long-dead soul who can no longer reach out.
I close the windows and shut off my computer.
