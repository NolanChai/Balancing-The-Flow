, but it 's happened. The 30 Days of Truth Challenge.
The first time I heard about this, was last year on twitter by a girl who did the challenge and posted her answers online. Her answer to question two: "Have you ever had sex?" She said yes and she was attacked mercilessly for it. They even threatened to report her to her school as well as threatening rape. This is just one example of what happens when you're honest, and so I wanted to see if my friends would be brave enough to face the same thing.
For 30 days, a person will answer twenty questions posted by the person who started it all: Tyler Oakley (Youtuber). There are a total of forty questions but after day ten, you get to make your own rules and customise them. Some people just post their answers on twitter or facebook for the world to see, but other's like myself choose to answer anonymously so as not to be recognised from their answers.
Things I 've learned:
-Some people have never done drugs in their life before. Ever.
-Some people have had sex more times then they can count on one hand.
-There are people who will try and make you feel like crap for being honest about what's happened to you, or what you've done. They can be anonymous too.
-People you think know everything there is to know about you...know nothing at all. I'm talking about the things that have really happened to you.
I hope some of these things make you want to join in with me for 30 Days of Truth! Here are my answers, and if anyone wants to do it too then let me know and we can go through them together!
Day One: I am a woman, living on a planet called Earth.
Day Two: My favorite subject is art. I've always loved painting and drawing... I just want to make the world a more beautiful place!
Day Three: My favorite book of all time is The Vampire Diaries: The Return by L J Smith. It has everything you could ever need in a story! (Fiction, romance, vampires, love, action.)
Day Four: I'm not really good at singing but I like to play the piano and write songs. I have many unfinished ones that I never showed anyone.
Day Five: My favorite animal is a penguin. They are so cute and fluffy!
Day Six: My most embarrassing memory would be when I was 5 years old and we were in the car on our way back from somewhere. It was raining and I suddenly got scared of the rain, because I thought it was my dad crying at me so I started to cry too. He couldn't stop laughing...
Day Seven: My best friend is a girl named Hannah (we've known each other since 2010). We spend most days together and we can talk about everything that comes into our minds. She's really smart, pretty and funny! I'm so blessed to have her in my life.
Day Eight: My worst enemy is time. It seems to move at the speed of light, but also slowly too... I don't understand it. It drives me crazy.
Day Nine: My favorite movie would be The Vampire Diaries: The Return by L J Smith. It has everything you could ever need in a story! (Fiction, romance, vampires, love, action.)
Day Ten: If I had to go back into the past and change something...I wouldn't want too much change anyway! It would be so hard because you never know what's going to happen after.
Day Eleven: My favorite song is "Birthday" by Katy Perry. She has a lot of songs that I love, but this one means the most to me because it reminds me of my birthday last year. Whenever I hear it I think about how special and amazing people have made me feel on my special day!
Day Twelve: My favorite food is...chocolate! I can never get enough. It's so good, you can do anything with chocolate (except eat your fingers off)
Day Thirteen: If I could change one thing about myself then it would be that I have to keep my mouth shut sometimes because when I start talking I don't know when to stop! People get confused and annoyed at me. So yeah, if only I knew what was happening around the time I started speaking...
Day Fourteen: My favorite TV show is The Vampire Diaries (I don't know why I have so much vampires in my life). It has everything you could ever need in a story! Fiction, romance, vampires, love, action.)
Day Fifteen: If I were an animal...I would be a fox because they are very intelligent and cunning creatures. Also, it sounds like fun to be a fox because you can jump from tree-tops and do other cool things!
Day Sixteen: My best memory is when my little brother was born. It felt like everything was happening at once, but also nothing was changing. It's hard to describe the feeling of seeing your baby brother for the first time...but I have no words! (I was 13 at that point)
Day Seventeen: My favorite place is... my bedroom because it's so comfortable and cozy inside, plus there are a lot of memories made there too! There are also lots of things to do in the room. Like watching tv or reading books while relaxing with friends. (This sounds like heaven!)
Day Eighteen: My favorite smell is chocolate cake! It's so yummy and sweet, it makes me feel happy just thinking about it! (If only I could eat cake all day...but alas no.)
Day Nineteen: If I were famous then I would want to be a singer because my voice sounds nice enough for other people to hear. (It might also be because I'm not good at anything else)
Day Twenty: My favorite person is the person that gave birth to me! They deserve more love than anyone could ever give them. Thank you mom and dad! :)
