 the empty parking lot the sun was setting and it was getting dark out the street lamps were on to brighten her way.
She knew exactly where she had to go, as well as when and how she would get there, but this night was different. She didn't want to be alone in these woods that had become so familiar, so routine that it felt like home to her now.
The leaves swirled around her feet and rustled along the ground with each step she took. Sherry blumpkin had lived at this place for most of her life. She was a high school senior at the abraham j carver high school located in the center of town, where she met the love of her life, steven mccrae.
Steve was a junior at the time and they both played football together on the vikings football team. They started out as friends but later fell in love with each other, making it the most special relationship either one of them had ever experienced.
Both Steve and Sherry knew this would be their last year together, so they made the most of every moment. It didn't matter what time of day or night it was, as long as they were together that's all that really mattered to them.
"Steven! Are you ready to go yet?" she yelled out into the darkness, but there was no answer from her beloved boyfriend so she knew he wasn't around and started walking again through the woods. The trail ended at a small pond where Steve liked to sit on the edge and watch all of nature happening around him.
It had become one of their favorite places they would meet up after school or during lunch hour just so they could spend some quiet time together without distraction from other people, which was something that neither one really needed at this point in their relationship.
Sherry walked towards where she knew he always sat to find him still waiting there for her with a smile on his face as usual when she arrived. She stood next to the pond watching as tiny little frogs jumped around between two of the lily pads on top of it, their croaking noises echoing throughout the woods surrounding them both before eventually fading away into nothingness again just like everything else in this world does eventually if we allow ourselves to let go and live freely instead of trying desperately all our lives to hold onto what once was.
She reached out her hand towards him but stopped midway when she saw something in his eyes that made her pull it back quickly before they touched his face. It wasn't just fear or disgust either, there was also sadness mixed with anger as well which made Sherry feel like crying right then and there but instead of doing so she turned around quickly before heading home alone without saying anything else to Steven Mc Crae who sat patiently waiting for her on his side of the pond.
The next morning, sherry blumpkin woke up early and went back into town to buy herself some new clothes. She was tired of wearing the same thing every day and wanted to change things up a little bit before heading off too college in just two months time. Sherry didn't know what she would do without Steven by her side anymore, but at least now she felt like she had something else going on for herself which made everything seem a bit brighter somehow even if only momentarily so anyway.
She walked through the stores looking around at all of things on display while thinking about how much easier it was just to buy these new outfits online instead since she didn't have any money left over after buying those clothes last night when her credit cards were maxed out already again like they always seem too be.
Sherry finally found some nice black leather boots that looked great with everything else in her closet, as well as a red sweater dress which seemed perfect for winter time since it was getting colder outside now too so she bought those two items before heading out once again into the real world where people could actually see her.
Steven was sitting at his desk working on some paperwork when Sherry walked in the doorway of their bedroom wearing only the red sweater dress from last night and no panties underneath either so he immediately got up out of his chair to take a closer look at what she had purchased.
"Wow!" Steven exclaimed as he stared at her legs before adding: "Where did you get those?" Sherry just smiled back at him while placing one hand over her heart then reached down with the other and began untying her boots so he could take a closer look inside of them too because she knew how much he loved watching women undress for him whenever given half an opportunity to do so.
She pulled off both shoes quickly before sliding onto her knees in front of his desk chair where she remained there waiting patiently until he finally came over beside her and started removing his belt buckle with one hand while massaging Sherry's breasts with the other until eventually they were both naked again like usual.
Steven leaned down towards her face so that their lips could meet together once more before whispering into her ear: "I can't wait to see what we will do tonight when we go back there…" Sherry smiled up at him with a look in her eyes that told him everything he needed to know right then and there, so without another word they both climbed underneath the sheets together once again where they would stay until morning arrived.
Sherry blumpkin woke up early on Sunday morning ready for one final romantic encounter before heading off too college in just two months time because she knew that this was going to be their last night ever together after which things were never going to be quite so easy again between them like they had been since high school began back when Steve first moved into town where he lived next door neighbor to her family's house.
Steven mccrae had been there from day one helping sherry out with everything she needed until recently when things started getting more complicated than ever before. They both knew that eventually they would have too break up because of all the pressure involved between them but for now at least Sherry wanted nothing more then just spend some time alone with Steven Mc Crae, even if it was only one last night together before saying goodbye forever after which everything else would go back to normal once again as best she could make happen anyway.
Sherry got dressed quickly before heading outside into the cold air of early winter morning where there were no other cars parked anywhere nearby yet except for hers alone so far at least. She walked down towards town hall which was only two blocks away now that summer had finally ended and it felt like she could breathe again without feeling like she needed too much more sleep since everything was so different now compared to back when Steve first came into her life just over three years ago already!
Sherry blumpkin walked around town hall looking at all of the different things that were going on inside there while also taking in every detail about this place itself before finally deciding where exactly she wanted too meet Steven Mc Crae at some point later on today so they could spend their final hours together like they had been doing for so long already without any problems whatsoever, even if only once more.
She left town hall quickly heading straight towards the police station next door where Sherry knew he worked now since she hadn't seen him in months! After all, there were other things going on right then besides just simply dating each other anymore either way so everything else had changed too without them even knowing it at first but now they both did know what was happening now after seeing how much different their lives had become lately between one another.
Sherry blumpkin waited outside of the police station for quite some time before finally getting tired enough to go back inside again where she found Steven Mc Crae sitting down working on paperwork once more just like he did every single day without fail since high school began over three years ago now! She sat right beside him at first but then moved closer until finally leaning forward against his arm which had been resting upon top of some files while waiting patiently for what was next to happen between them both now before she could finally speak out loud again about everything going on in her life lately so far since things were changing very quickly right here today alone without anything else getting involved too often anymore either way.
"I can't believe that I never knew you existed until just recently…" Sherry said as soon as possible before turning back around once more facing away from Steve again while continuing: "But it's true! You're real and everything!" She then turned around one final time staring directly into his eyes which made him smile back at her before they both laughed out loud together too because this was just what they needed right here today without fail no matter what else might happen between them next!
Sherry blumpkin walked back towards town hall after leaving the police station again where she knew Steven Mc Crae worked now but not anymore since he had quit his job there recently which meant that everything would change forever starting this weekend alone with nothing left over either way except maybe just some memories later on down the road once they were both finally gone from each other's lives altogether too soon than anyone could have imagined!
She arrived at town hall quickly but before she went inside there was one more thing that needed doing first which was checking her mail box outside because this is where all of their letters used to get sent when they first met back then years ago now without fail every single day until today finally happened without any problems whatsoever either way too many times already!
There were only three
