 after some time it dawned on me that I had gotten lost.
I stopped in my tracks and looked at the map on my smartphone, realising that I was nowhere near where I thought I was supposed to be, but somehow still close enough for comfort.
There were no people around. I was alone, lost and bewildered, not sure how to get out of this predicament, when suddenly I saw a man walking towards me. It didn't take long before he caught up with me, and then we started talking about our lives and what had brought us to where we were.
He was older than me but still looked as if he could go for years yet, while I was already close to my forties and starting to show signs of ageing. He told me how he had come across a book one day that had changed his life, and it was because of this that we started walking together again.
I don't know what the book was about or who wrote it - it didn't matter. All I knew was that if there was any truth to what he was saying then I wanted more than anything else in my life right then to experience it for myself; so I made up my mind to follow this man and see where his path took me.
This is the story of how I became a student of The Path Of Light - an ancient Egyptian method for developing inner powers, healing ourselves from within, and finding our own truths in life that have led many others on similar journeys throughout history back to themselves too...
