 fire and as we approached the small town, a sense of dread filled me. The wind howled against us. It was clear that the storm had reached here too.
This place is unlike anywhere I have ever been. The people are different than what you would expect in the suburbs; they speak an unknown language and are dressed strangely. As we enter the town square, there stands a tall figure with a large black hood covering their entire head from view. A shiver ran up my spine as I tried to ignore the fear that was growing inside me.
I am here for a reason though; the man I’ve been sent to talk to is standing right in front of us. As he approaches, his movements are slow and steady, like a clockwork mechanism, almost robotic in nature. He speaks with an accent so thick that I can barely understand him as we meet on the center of the town square.
“Good day,” he greets me politely in the local language before sitting down to talk. It’s clear from his voice that there is something very important on his mind but he refuses to speak about it, so instead I do most of the talking. “I’ve been sent by a good friend of yours and your father has asked for an audience with you. He has some things he wishes to tell you.”
He nods slowly as if this is something that was expected.
“Fine then,” he says. “Come, let us talk in private.”
And so we walk through the streets until we find ourselves at a small café. There are several other patrons here but they all seem to be looking down at their tablet computers and not speaking with one another. This seems odd; why would people come out in such terrible weather to sit alone at a coffee shop?
As I enter the café, my eyes rest upon an older man sitting in the corner of the room. He is dressed in all black except for his white shirt which shows no signs of wear and tear despite being so old. His hair is completely gray but his skin looks remarkably young. This must be the father that my contact speaks about, I think to myself as I sit across from him at our table.
“You have come far in such a short time,” says my contact as he sits down opposite me and gestures towards the elderly man before us with a hand motion indicating his chair is empty but not yet occupied. “He has been waiting for you.”
And so I take my seat at our table, facing the old man. He looks up from his newspaper slowly, adjusting his glasses as he does so. A thin smile creeps across his lips and he gestures for me to come closer to him but I remain seated where I am.
“I’m not sure what you want with me,” he says in a gentle tone. “But if it is something concerning my son then perhaps we can discuss that.”
I lean back in my chair, clasping my hands behind my head as I think for a moment about how best to proceed. Finally, I speak up again and say: “There are rumors going around about your son. That he has been spotted fighting with other people who do not belong here.”
“I know nothing of that,” says the old man with a frown. “My son is not one for violence; if someone else were causing him trouble then yes, I am sure he would defend himself but it is not like my son to be violent.”
At this point, my contact stands up and walks out of the café without saying another word or looking back. This was unexpected as his behavior seemed strange from beginning to end; maybe he thought we were finished already? I glance over at the old man once again only to find that he is gone too – vanished into thin air like magic!
My contact had been waiting for me but now it seems like he has disappeared just like my client’s son did many years ago. Did I say something wrong or am I being followed? It’s getting colder by the minute and I need to find somewhere warm before this nightmare turns into an ice-cold hell!
