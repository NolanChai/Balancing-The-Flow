 again* oh look a rant about a tv show that people are watching and talking about for the past few days..
I love reddit. I will post something to keep it alive.
What I do in my free time...
Yeah, I have a lot of free time and don't know what to do with it.
So this is how I spent a weekend:
- read a few chapters from "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak
(I've gotten quite far into the book already... I must say, I like it so far.)
- Read an entire issue of "Comic Life" and started reading another one.
(These comics are really cool. They're about life, love, friendship, etc. They have really good artwork too!)
- Played some Civ 4 for a bit (I haven't played it in years, but it still feels so good.)
- Finished reading "The Book Thief" and started another book: "Better Worlds".
(The story is about a girl named Marla and her journey into the virtual world of "World".)
- Played some more Civ 4.
And that's about it I guess... It was a good weekend though! :)

I just had an idea for another comic... not sure if I have the time or willpower to draw it. We'll see.
Anyways, I spent most of my free time this weekend watching the newest season of House of Cards! It was quite interesting and exciting.. I'm really looking forward to the next season (which comes out in September.)
Oh also I am playing a lot of Final Fantasy XV demo lately. It's pretty awesome, but it's just so short!! ;D

I have started reading "The Lord of the Rings" by JRR Tolkien... I don't know what I was thinking! It seems like such a long book.. but it really is worth reading. The writing is beautiful. :D

I have just finished reading "The Lord of the Rings" by JRR Tolkien! It was really interesting and I'm glad I finally read it. :) Now to move onto another book.. I think I might start reading "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins next weekend, we'll see what happens..
I have just finished watching season 1 of House of Cards! It was so good!! And now I'm going to watch the second one... *fingers crossed* it is as amazing as the first. :)

I have started reading "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins and finished season two of House of Cards! The second one was even better than the first!! (But I still think the third one will be the best...)

I have started reading "Mockingjay" by Suzanne Collins! It's really interesting so far and I'm quite enjoying it. :)

I have just finished reading "Mockingjay" by Suzanne Collins! It was a pretty good book... but I kind of wanted to see more action. (The previous two books were definitely more action-packed.) Still overall it is a really good series, though! :)

I've just started reading "The Princess Diaries" by Meg Cabot! The first couple of pages have already made me laugh so hard. (The writing is quite funny!) :) It should be an interesting book..

I've just finished reading "The Princess Diaries" by Meg Cabot! I really enjoyed it! The writing was very good and the story was interesting. :) (I found out that there is a movie about this book.. but I haven't watched it yet.)

I have just finished reading "The Princess Diaries" by Meg Cabot! It was really interesting and fun to read. :) I think this is the best book out of all the ones I've ever read.. but I probably wouldn't like it if I were a teenager myself.. haha.
I've just finished reading "A Series of Unfortunate Events" by Lemony Snicket! It was an interesting and funny story... but I don't know why this book is so popular or what it has to do with the movie that came out in 2004.. maybe because there are so many different characters?
I have started reading "A Wrinkle In Time" by Madeleine L'Engle and it seems like a pretty good book... :)

I have just finished reading "The Princess Diaries" by Meg Cabot! I liked it a lot.. :) (But I don't really understand why the main character is so naive.)

I have started reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" by Douglas Adams! So far it has been really good. :) (But the writing is kind of confusing...)
