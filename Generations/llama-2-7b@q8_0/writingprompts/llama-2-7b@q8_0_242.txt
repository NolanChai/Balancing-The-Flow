 of a river 
 but the wave of a hand can reach out to me 
 and still I am with you 
 
 I will come to you if you wait for me 
 I'm there already as always 
 it is true that we are not two 
 in truth our souls have met 
 
 if one is lost, the other remains 
 and in the silence of this room 
 in this space between us two 
 my soul will speak to yours.
