100 million years to find Earth colonized by the 'Earthmans', as the original inhabitants are now called. The Earthen had little use for a spacecraft with alien technology and even less interest in the three cryo-pods, so they sent them into deep space on a collision course with an asteroid where their ship would be destroyed, thus removing any potential threat to Earth. However, when the asteroid's gravitational pull altered course of the ship and it began moving toward Earth again, the Earthen decided to destroy it themselves by detonating an atomic bomb inside one of its pods. The explosion also destroyed the spacecraft, leaving only three survivors who were deposited on Earth with their ship's computer, which was still functional.
These are the first three members of the alien species. They have no names, but call themselves "1," "2" and "3", respectively, as well as "Computer" for short. They refer to humans (as well as Earthmen) by a number ("1800") or name ("Charles"). Their ship was built using advanced alien technology and they are the only survivors of their civilization after their home planet was destroyed.
The Earthen have no interest in the three aliens or their ship, which they regard as dangerous and useless to them. They decide to destroy it by placing an atomic bomb inside one of its pods and setting it off. The blast destroys the ship but also deposits the survivors on Earth and allows the ship's computer to remain functional.
The Earthen, now calling themselves humans because of their ability to adapt to their environment. They believe that they are superior due to the fact that they had to develop intellect to survive in this hostile planet, whereas the aliens were given intelligence from birth. The three aliens are regarded with suspicion and distrust by these people until a few individuals begin to show signs of empathy for their situation.
The first is Charles Brubaker, who stumbles across them while walking through the woods one day. He is intrigued by their appearance and takes pity on them when they are attacked by two hunters who mistake them for wild animals. Another character shows sympathy towards them during a scene in which he finds 3 floating near Earth's surface after being separated from his spacecraft due to an explosion caused by him accidentally locking himself inside one of its pods (which was intended as punishment).
The aliens eventually learn that humans do not have the same physical abilities as themselves. They also discover that they can communicate with each other through telepathy, which allows them to understand what Charles is saying when he calls out "Charles" every time he sees one of his kind (either in person or on television). This also helps establish an emotional connection between the aliens and humans as well: 2 finds himself attracted to a woman named Julie while she becomes fond of him after hearing stories about how hard life was back home on their planet before it became uninhabitable due to pollution caused by industrialization and population growth.
The alien's ship crash lands in Earth, where they are discovered by humans. They have no name for themselves until the computer gives them one (1-3). The Earthen find that these three survivors were given intelligence from birth which makes them superior to any other being on earth and they believe this is proof of their own evolutionary superiority as well; however, there are some humans who show sympathy towards them even though most regard them with suspicion or outright hostility because it's unknown what these creatures want or why they came here at all.
The aliens learn that Earth is not as dangerous as their home planet was due to the fact that they do not need to develop intellect in order to survive here. They are also able to communicate with humans through telepathy, which allows them to understand what Charles (the only human who shows sympathy towards them) says whenever he calls out "Charles" or asks him questions about his life on Earth because it's unknown where these creatures came from originally before arriving here after their ship crashed onto our planet centuries ago; this also helps establish an emotional connection between both species since some members of each group find themselves attracted towards one another while others develop friendships with them despite not understanding anything about what makes people unique compared against other living beings like animals, plants etcetera.
