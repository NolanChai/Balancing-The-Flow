bre, his body protected from the air-borne virus by a sealed room.
Colin's father, Lord Huxley, was not pleased when he found out what Colin had done. He'd gone ahead and married Felicity without letting him know. Her dowry hadn't been enough to buy his forgiveness. Not even the fact that she was pregnant.
Felicity was a good wife; she kept up with her housework and cooked good meals for Colin when he got home from work. He hated that they had to live in a flat in the city but it made things easier financially, at least. The rent was cheaper than owning their own home and since they didn't have children yet, they could afford it.
"I don't want Rupert growing up here," Felicity told Colin when he came into the kitchen one evening and found her cooking dinner. She looked so beautiful in a pair of loose pants and a T-shirt that showed off her flat stomach and made him feel more like a cad for thinking about other women, but there it was. He'd been married to Felicity now for five years and every night he wished she had more curves; sometimes he found himself wishing she wasn't so pretty at all.
"But we don't have the money," Colin said quietly as he leaned back against the counter and looked down at her. He couldn't keep his hands off of Felicity and he was worried that one day he would wear out his welcome. She had such a soft body, so perfect in every way.
"We could live with my parents," she said. "My father would probably let us stay with him."
Colin looked up at her sharply; it hurt to know that she'd been thinking of leaving him and going home to her family, who were all much richer than he was. He felt a pang in his stomach as he watched her cook dinner, and he suddenly knew what he had to do.
"No," Colin said firmly. "We need to make more money."
She frowned at him. "But how? I'm not working yet; our bills are still very high. We can't just give up our flat in the city and move home, where my parents will be able to look down their noses at us even more than they do now." She turned around slowly as she said it. "You know how they feel about you, Colin; I don't want my son growing up knowing his father is a failure, that he isn't good enough for me, just because of our class differences."
"But we can afford to live here," he insisted. He tried not to let her see how much it hurt him, but she could tell by the way he kept staring at her as they talked.
Felicity stopped what she was doing and turned back around. She walked over to where Colin stood with his arms crossed and leaned up against the counter next to him. She put her hands on top of his so that their arms were touching, just above the elbow. Her eyes met his; there was an intensity in them that she knew he didn't like.
"I don't want our son growing up with no money and no family," Felicity said. "Colin, we have to do something." She looked at him very seriously for a few moments before continuing on. "We can try making more of it here in the city; I can get a job working for one of those corporations that is expanding into London. We'll start with me getting a position and then maybe you'll get promoted, too."
Colin shook his head, disgusted at how she was willing to abandon their marriage so quickly, even though he knew it wasn't really about him anymore than it was about her father. He had to admit that Felicity had always been beautiful but there had never seemed any reason why she should have married a man like him when she could have been with someone much more wealthy and successful.
"We need to move, Colin," she said again, her voice firm. She squeezed his arm lightly before stepping back from the counter and going over to where she had left her dinner on top of a low shelf in the fridge.
He watched her walk away with a mixture of emotions; there was something about Felicity that he would always love no matter what happened between them, but sometimes he found himself wondering if they were really meant to be together. Was it possible that she was just too good for him and would never actually accept that?
Colin turned around as the door chime sounded outside of their flat; there was a loud banging against the door followed by someone shouting out angrily about how much money they owed. He could feel his heartbeat start to increase slightly as he thought about what might happen if this person managed to get in, but before he could decide whether or not to let them inside, Felicity came back into the kitchen and opened up one of her drawers underneath their sink where she kept spare locks for such things.
She pulled out an old pair of scissors and began cutting through the chain that had been holding shut one of the windows in their flat; then she stepped over to where he was standing at their front door, took hold of his hand with hers as if she were going to kiss him on the lips before suddenly bringing it up hard against her own forehead.
"I'm sorry," she whispered loudly into his ear, tears coming down her cheeks now that they weren't able to keep their baby safe from the virus any longer. Colin could see how much Felicity loved him; he didn't understand why she would ever want to leave him after all these years of marriage but right then there was nothing else for either one of them to do except stand there and watch as her body became more and more stiff with pain before finally collapsing into a heap on top of the floor next to where he had been standing only moments earlier.
