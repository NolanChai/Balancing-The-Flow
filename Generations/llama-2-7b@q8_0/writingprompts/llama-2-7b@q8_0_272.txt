9/10
“Why are you here?” I asked, squinting as I adjusted to the brightness. There were several figures in the room who had not bothered to wake up yet: a few men and women with dark robes sitting on their thrones at either end of a long table. It was quiet but for the rush of wind that blew through one of the open windows. I rubbed my head, trying to recall what happened before I fell asleep in this strange place.
“I am here to give you your new assignment,” said a figure sitting across from me at the end of the table. He was tall and thin with long black hair that hung past his shoulders. It reminded me of… But where had I seen him? “You are the Queen.”
“What?” My mouth dropped open in surprise as I looked around. No, this wasn’t right!
“It is your destiny to be Queen,” he said calmly with a smile. “And that is what you shall do, my Queen.” He stood and walked over to me, offering his hand. It was warm, and when I shook it, we shared a look that made my stomach do strange flips as I felt an odd connection between us.
“What do you mean? Am I really the Queen?” I asked, still not sure what this was all about or whether this was really happening. But I could tell from his smile that he knew it was true.
“Yes,” he said firmly. “It’s your destiny.”
“But how can I be a Queen? I don’t even know who you are!” My voice rose as I shook my head, still not entirely convinced of what I was seeing or hearing.
He chuckled and sat back down in his throne across from me before gesturing to one of the men standing behind him with dark red robes on their shoulders. “This is the Lord,” he said, nodding to a man in front of us. The Lord approached, giving me an awkward half-smile.
“It’s my honor to be here with you today.” He bowed and then walked over to the other side of the table as we all stood up again. “This is the Knight,” he added, gesturing next to him to a woman in dark blue robes. She didn’t smile or move much, just stared straight ahead at something unseen before her.
The Lord then turned to me and asked, “How are you feeling?”
“Fine I guess.” He was probably the most normal one out of them all.
The Knight spoke next. “Your new assignment begins tomorrow morning,” she said coldly with a nod, staring straight at me as if judging my every movement. “We will meet before then to discuss your duties.”
“Duties?” I asked, frowning now. The Lord took the opportunity to chime in next, speaking into my ear and saying something quietly that made my head spin with confusion. As quickly as he came over, he disappeared again like a ghost in the night. I turned to look at him, but he was gone, just a dark shadow behind his throne.
I looked around at all of them sitting there on their thrones looking back at me like statues. This didn’t seem right… It wasn’t my life, or was it? They must know something that I don’t! 9/10
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” I asked the Lord with uncertainty in my voice as he sat next to me on our thrones across from each other. The Knight stood behind him with her hands behind her back, and the Queen was nowhere to be seen. It had been weeks since they’d told me what my assignment was going to be for tomorrow, but it didn’t feel right.
“Yes,” said the Lord firmly while staring down at me from above his throne with a serious look on his face. “You will do this.” There was an edge of warning in his voice that made me shiver, but I wasn’t going to argue anymore because I knew it wouldn’t change anything anyway.
“But…” What if something goes wrong? What if I mess up again and get sent back here forever? The Lord looked at me with a smile on his face while the Knight just stared straight ahead like she didn’t care one way or another about what was happening. There were no words from either of them; they weren’t going to change their minds now, so I gave in and nodded my head as if everything was okay.
“I guess…” My voice trailed off as I felt myself sinking down into the soft cushioning underneath me like a heavy weight on top of me. This wasn’t right! “I guess I will do this then.”
The Lord nodded at my statement and stood up, walking over to the door that led outside where we could hear birds singing in the distance. It felt like they were mocking me for being here, but he didn’t seem bothered by them at all as he opened it with one hand and let himself out into the warm sunlight before turning back around to look at me once more.
“Good luck.” His voice was serious again, but I could still see a faint smile on his face when we locked eyes for one last time before closing that door behind him forever… 8/10
