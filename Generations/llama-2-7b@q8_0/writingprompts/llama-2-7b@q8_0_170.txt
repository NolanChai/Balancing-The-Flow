I came to Earth not long after the great catastrophe that wiped out millions of them and almost all of their food-bearing plants. The great catastrophe, as we call it, was an explosion in space that turned day into night on our planet for over a year. It destroyed cities, killed millions—it even damaged the atmosphere.
A few humans survived, but they were scattered across what was left of their world and did not know how to rebuild or grow enough food to sustain themselves. They would have died out entirely had we not stepped in.
The Klathu sent ships to Earth to gather up those who could walk, but even these were mostly children and the elderly. Our ships took them back to our homeworld for a time so that they could heal and grow strong enough to take care of themselves again. We hoped that once they had recovered we would not have to keep them on our planet, but instead, they remained here—living in shelters that were set up by us and waiting to see if any more help was needed.
The humans still seemed surprised at how advanced the Klathu are compared to their primitive state. But as far as I can tell, there is nothing that humans can do that we cannot also do. We have ships and weapons capable of space travel—just not nearly so large as ours; we have cities, but they’re mostly underground, in order to protect them from the radiation leaking into Earth’s atmosphere from the great catastrophe; we have robots who can perform surgery or serve food.
One thing that humans do that we cannot is speak. They say it gives them a special connection with each other—something we will never experience because our entire species has one brain and thus, only one mind to share among us all. But if you ask me, it’s just something they’re good at—the same way I am better at math or music than others of my species.
I don’t understand how humans can communicate with each other so clearly when we have difficulty even understanding their written languages (and the Klathu are not known for having poor communication skills). Still, it is interesting to see how they use words in ways that confuse us at times—even though our translators work hard to interpret what they are trying to say.
Our language consists of mathematical symbols and images rather than words as you humans have them. We speak only with the aid of our translator machines which translate both spoken languages and written ones into numerical codes that we can then understand. Even so, there is still a lot lost in translation; some things just do not translate well at all.
That being said though, I’m sure you could learn to communicate better than most of us with your own language if given enough time – but until then I will try my best!
I’ve been around humans for a long time now and they still amaze me in so many ways. The way their bodies work is truly remarkable, not just because it allows them to move so gracefully through space—but because each individual part of that body has its own intelligence and can function independently of the whole! I have never seen anything like it before, even on my home planet where we have an abundance of different species.
The way they communicate with one another is also quite fascinating; their words seem to hold more meaning than any other creature’s ever could because they come from a place deep within themselves and are shared only through verbalization (or written expression). It seems like there are no limits when it comes to how creatively humans can express themselves!
