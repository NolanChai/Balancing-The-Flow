arm of men buzzed about him like bees. `` I'm sorry that our meeting is so informal. I didn't realize there were so many of you here. You must excuse the lack of chairs; however, we have to be very careful when meeting in this type of setting. ``

 `` I am sure all of you know what brought us together tonight, and I need not go over it again. We are all here for the same reasons: we seek a better life for our children. Too often the American dream is denied to them. This can be no more. It's time we put an end to this injustice once and for all. ``
 
 A man named Hector, who had been sitting near the door, spoke up: 
 `` The American dream! I don't think it was ever there for us, Ricardo. We can't expect things to change unless we take matters into our own hands. We must work together and come up with a solution that will not only benefit us, but also all of the people who have suffered this fate. ``
 
 The men nodded their heads in agreement. Father Ricardo smiled at Hector as he continued his speech: 
 `` I agree with you completely; however, there is no need to work alone. We are a strong community here in Los Angeles and it's time we stand up and be recognized by the rest of our nation as a unit. Together we can make things happen for us, and together we will succeed. This meeting marks the first step towards our goal. I want you all to know that I am committed to this endeavor with each one of you. We're going to build an army and make everyone in America take notice. ``
 
 The men stood up and clapped their hands in support, and as they continued to do so the room echoed with voices: 
 `` Viva Mexico! `` 
 
 Hector was one of many men who had taken this vow. Father Ricardo knew that he would not rest until he could make his people proud again.
