 distant memory in the minds of those who can remember it at all.
The town lay below, small and crumbling. Old houses with broken windows and cracked walls. People walked slowly through the streets like zombies, heads bowed and eyes downcast. Those that did look up saw a sky as dark as night in broad daylight. It was always this way; always had been and always would be. There were no children or young people among them. They all seemed to have aged beyond their years, hair falling out in clumps, faces withered from the harsh weather.
The people of the town knew they were trapped here, but didn’t know how or why it had happened. So long ago no one could remember when the sun had gone away forever. They just lived their lives and tried to survive in this dark world.
In the midst of all this gloom there was a small light. A lone candle flickered on an altar. An old woman knelt before it, head bowed in prayer. As she prayed, she cried tears of sadness for her people, and what had been lost. Her heart ached with the knowledge that this could never be restored.
Her prayers were answered by a voice from beyond. A whispering of sound that came as if from nowhere or everywhere at once. “I will show you the way back to the light,” said the voice, “but first, I must know your heart.” The old woman stood and walked towards the candle flame, her tears drying on her cheeks.
As she approached the light, the darkness began to recede, revealing a shimmering silver orb within. It was a small mirror, reflecting the candle’s flickering glow with dazzling clarity. The voice spoke again. “Look upon yourself and see what lies deep within your heart.”
The old woman gazed into the glass and saw her reflection: wrinkled skin, tired eyes, and gray hair. She began to weep once more as she thought of how far away from youth and beauty she had come. But then something caught her eye – a glimmer of light shining through her heart. It was hope – not just the hope that she would find a way out, but also the knowledge that even in this dark place there can always be some small rays of sunshine.
The voice spoke again: “You have found your way back to the light! Now go forth and spread it to others so they may know true happiness.” And with those words the old woman walked out into the world, determined to make a difference in this dark place.
