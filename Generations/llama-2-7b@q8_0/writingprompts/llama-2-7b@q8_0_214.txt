ated along underneath it.
The people walked through the mud. They climbed rocks. They fell into crevices. They scurried up boulders, sometimes getting stuck half way on them and having to pull themselves back up by their arms. They slipped down steep slopes on the mountain that were covered with grass. They had no path. They had only each other.
The indigenous people made it all the way to the top. They reached what was considered holy ground, a place they called home for many generations. It was a special place in their hearts and minds. Their ancestors had told them of its beauty. They had sung about its majesty. But the people were not blinded by any myths or fables that had been passed down to them from generation to generation, because they believed truth only came from their own personal experience, from what they could see with their eyes and feel with their hands.
They did not have a written language so the history of their tribe was told by word of mouth through generations, from mother to child. It was passed on in song. It was shared when it rained for days on end, because that meant there were no more berries or plants growing out of the ground for the people to eat. It was told during long, dark and cold winters as the fire burned in their homes. And finally, it was written down by white men who came along a century later after having conquered them with superior weaponry that allowed them to climb much higher on the mountain than any indigenous people could ever dream of reaching.
The white man had a long history and his ancestors were far from being what they are today. The white man was once a native American Indian but had turned on their own people, murdering and raping with impunity, stealing their land and forcing them to live in reservations that were nothing more than concentration camps where the people lived as if they were animals in cages.
The white man’s history is riddled with shame. Their ancestors had raped African women during the slave trade. They had murdered native Americans en masse and then stole their land, raping it for all the gold that was buried beneath its surface. But their shame did not stop there.
The white man’s history is filled with the horror of war. Their ancestors had fought against each other in a civil war in which brother fought against brother in an attempt to decide whether they were better off as slave owners, or as free men who could work for themselves and own their own land. In the end, the white man’s history was no different from that of any other tribe. Their ancestors had fought over natural resources that they believed belonged only to them, even if it meant murdering one another in order to claim the spoils of war as their own.
The indigenous people who climbed the mountain had never seen a white man before because none had ever reached this part of their land. They were amazed by how different these new visitors looked from themselves and they wondered if they would be able to speak to each other in some way that could possibly break down barriers between them, but it was not meant to be as the white men killed every single one of them on the mountain.
The indigenous people who climbed the mountain were looking for a new home because their own had been taken away from them by white men. They wanted a place where they could live in peace and harmony with each other without fear of being murdered or raped at any moment, so they would have time to plant seeds that would grow into fruit bearing trees, and to build houses where they could sleep comfortably and raise their children as free humans without worry. But the white man was not interested in peace between his kind and the indigenous people because he saw them as savages who must be tamed before he could accept them on equal terms with himself.
The indigenous people were taken from their homes by white men and made to live in reservations where they were kept prisoner while their land was plundered for its natural resources such as gold, silver and copper which could then be sold at a profit back home where there was no shortage of money or opportunity.
The indigenous people who climbed the mountain were looking for a new homeland because their ancestral homelands had been taken from them by white men and turned into places that resembled concentration camps more than anything else, places where they were imprisoned without trial or reason except to serve as slaves for those who owned them.
The indigenous people were forced off of their land by white men in order to make way for development projects which would bring more money and opportunity to themselves but at the expense of others who had been living there far longer than they ever could hope to live anywhere else on earth.
The indigenous people climbed up the mountain to escape from this kind of oppression, where their ancestors’ blood was spilled so that white men could take advantage of them without any moral qualms whatsoever about doing so because it had been done before and there was no reason why they should feel ashamed for having done so when others had already suffered under its tyranny.
The indigenous people who climbed the mountain were looking for a new homeland where they could be free from oppression, where they would not have to work for other white men but instead live as equals among each other without fear of being killed or raped by them at any moment because all that mattered was protecting their own lives and families above everything else.

They were looking for a place where there was no room left over after everyone had been given an equal share of land in which they could raise crops, build homes and live peacefully without fear of being murdered or raped by white men who did not care about anything except themselves and their own comfort at the expense of others.

The indigenous people climbed up the mountain to escape from this kind of oppression but there was no way they could ever have known that it would be the last thing they saw before being murdered and raped by white men who did not care about anything except themselves and their own comfort at the expense of others.
