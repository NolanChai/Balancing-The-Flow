 in with the team. And, Seth...
 
 "Sorry about that."
 
 It was a strange turn of events at first, but it quickly became obvious why he was here. He had to be in the same vehicle as his two closest friends. 
 
"I'll see you on the other side," says Seth as they all pile into Cam's car and begin driving north. 
 
"Not too bad, huh? I mean, we gotta get there quicker but this is pretty good."
 
"The best part?" asks Paul. "It's all downhill from here..."
 
They all laugh as Cam accelerates his car up to its maximum speed and slices through the snow, kicking up clouds of powder behind him. They pass the turnpike exits for New York City in a matter of minutes, then head north toward Albany. 
 
"I'm getting a little bored," says Cam. "I think I need another song."
He turns on the radio and quickly realizes that he's been tuned into the local news. He turns down the volume... but it's already too late. 
 
"Look out!" shouts Paul from behind him. "It's a deer!"
Cam swerves to avoid hitting the animal, sending his car into an uncontrolled spin that sends it sliding off the road and rolling several times before coming to rest upside down in the snow. He doesn't know how long he lies there trapped under his car; maybe seconds... minutes? It feels like hours. 
 
Seth yells his name over and over, but Cam can barely hear him through the tight space. They need to get out of here now. He manages to pull himself from beneath the car before passing out on the side of the road. Paul and Seth manage to dig themselves out of the vehicle soon afterward, but are too tired to continue walking. They collapse in the snow beside Cam's car. 
 
"I told you I was bored," says Cam, waking up a few hours later to find himself trapped beneath his vehicle once again. This time he can hear Paul and Seth trying to dig him out from underneath... but it takes them another hour to free him. "How long have we been sitting here?" asks Cam as they finally make their way back onto the road. 
 
"Maybe six, seven hours," says Paul. "I was just about to start panicking."
 
"You gotta do better than that," laughs Seth. "If I'd have known you were worried, I could've made it ten at least."
They make their way back onto the road and continue driving toward Albany. The closer they get, the more obvious it becomes how much time has passed. The sky is brightening. The snow is melting. 
 
 "I think we should just stay here," says Seth. "I mean, you're not even supposed to be here, so what are they gonna do? If we find the car, maybe we can take it back home."
 
"What do you think, Cam?" asks Paul. "Should we continue on our way or just stop here and wait it out?"
"I don't know," replies Cam, shaking his head. "Maybe we should wait for a little while longer... but I think I want to keep going." 
 
 "Good call," says Seth. He pauses before continuing. "Can you guys believe this? We were gonna be dead right now if not for that deer and then, like, hours later we get hit by another one in the exact same spot. I'm tellin' ya... it's a sign."
 
"From what?" asks Paul as they continue walking down the road. "God? Santa Claus?"
Cam just shakes his head and lets out a big sigh. He feels like he'll never be able to stop thinking about what happened in the woods earlier that evening, but this is nothing compared to what he went through at the school. 
 
They continue walking until they see an abandoned car on the side of the road up ahead. They look for a sign... any sign indicating what city they're in... and soon find themselves standing in front of a sign that says ALBANY, NEW YORK, USA. It feels like such a long time since they left their homes. 
 
"I don't think I can do this anymore," says Paul as the three friends walk toward the car. "I just want to go home."
 
Cam and Seth stop in front of him, reaching for his shoulders before he continues walking by himself. He gets into his own vehicle and starts driving, heading back toward Pennsylvania and away from New York City...
