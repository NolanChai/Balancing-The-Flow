‫ﺑﻄر‬,'' replied Phil with the same smile as his father. `` ‫ﮎﺛﯽ‬.'' 
 
 `` No, it's Greg!'' said Greg with an even bigger grin on his face. `` You're doing a good job learning our language.'' 
 
 `` Well you know what they say in our culture? '' Greg said as he grabbed two handfuls of snow from the pile and packed it into a ball before tossing it to Phil who caught it, his smile growing bigger with each time he looked at his father. `` ‫ﺑﻄﯽ‬.'' 
 
 `` That's great,'' said Phil. He stood up from the pile of snow and tried to catch another ball his dad threw at him, which he successfully did. He then let the ball go. `` I really like the snow!'' he exclaimed happily as Greg continued tossing snowball after snowball at him until he was covered in the white stuff. 
 
 `` It's really fun isn't it?'' said Greg with a big smile on his face, Phil nodding in agreement. He then noticed that Phil had not thrown back a single snowball. `` What's wrong? You not having any fun?'' 
 
 `` No,'' answered Phil as he threw the first ball of white powder at his father, which missed and landed on his chest instead. As he did so, Greg winked at him before throwing one back that Phil caught with ease. 
 
 The two continued to throw snowballs at each other for a couple minutes when all of the sudden there was silence in the air as Phil threw his next snowball, missing it and landing on top of his father's head. It took Greg only a moment to realize what had happened before he looked down and smiled once more. 
 
 `` Are you done yet?'' said Greg. 
 
 `` I guess so,'' answered Phil with another grin on his face. He then stood up from the pile of snow in which he was covered with and hugged Greg, who returned the embrace. 
 
 `` It's getting late. We better head back home! '' said Greg as they both began walking towards their house, Phil following closely behind him while he continued to smile at his father.
