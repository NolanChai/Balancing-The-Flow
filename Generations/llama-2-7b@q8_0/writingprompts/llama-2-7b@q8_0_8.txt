 y changed from ``life, liberty and property'' to ``life, liberty and happiness,'' it had been an inescapable fact of life that Americans were doomed to be annoyed every January first by having their lives invaded by a crowd of well-intentioned busybodies who would go out of their way to ensure that the rest of us lived up to what they considered our constitutional obligations.

These soi disant ``happiness inspectors,'' as I called them, always had the same itinerary: Every January first, the nation was divided into two groups -- the ``happy'' and the ``unhappy'' (in which the former category included everyone who actually had a day off from work). Then the soi-disant inspectors set out on their appointed rounds. The ``happiness inspectors'' would visit each household in America to make sure that everybody was having an equally good time, and that all families were observing this holy day of the year with appropriate merriment and jollity. They went from house to house, pounding on doors at 5:30 a.m., and demanding to be admitted for a ``well-being inspection'' (as they always called it) by shouting out their name and calling themselves by the title of what was evidently the government agency in which they were employed. The inspectors then proceeded to examine everything inside every house, making sure that nobody had been left off the guest list for New Year's Eve celebrations, that all family members were being treated with equal consideration by their spouses, and so on. In fact, these self-appointed guardians of public morals and standards of behavior made such a nuisance of themselves every year that in 2017 the House of Representatives passed a bill making it illegal to call your house unless you gave prior approval for them to do so; but since this measure never got through the Senate, the tradition was resurrected the following year.

On New Year's Eve I had given up any idea of going out or of having guests in my own home; even though it was a holiday and many restaurants were open, I had made sure that none of them would be within walking distance so as to avoid being accosted by some well-meaning inspector on his way through the neighborhood. Instead, I spent the evening watching the ball drop in Times Square while eating dinner in front of the TV -- a lonely and uninspired end to the year that seemed somehow appropriate for my state of mind.

`` What's the use?'' I said after dinner. ``Even if you wanted to, where are you going to find a babysitter on New Year's Eve?'' 
 
 As if in answer to this rhetorical question, my wife's cell phone rang and she picked up. It was the babysitter calling to say that her husband had called out of work again, leaving her without a sitter for the evening. The only time I ever called the babysitter herself during their employment (in order to get information about her husband) she'd asked me to stop calling him at his place of business since he didn't like it when his family members got involved in work matters; but I guess this was an exception.

My wife said that she thought there was a neighbor who could come by, and then went over the house rules with her:
 
 ``If you see any food on the floor, don't pick it up -- it may be poisoned!'' I didn't know if this particular precautionary measure had actually been taken in our household or not (in fact, my wife always claimed that I was the one who got her to say such things), but I agreed with her anyway: If you saw food on the floor, it wouldn't do any good for me to pick it up. The kids would just put more of it there afterwards. 
 
 ``Do not let them get into the bathroom!'' my wife continued (a rule that was even more pointless than the previous one). ``They might try to drown themselves if you do!'' I guess she got this idea from a book or magazine article about how children often drown themselves in bathtubs while their parents are away.
 
 ``If they start getting on top of the coffee table and playing with it, tell them to get off at once!'' my wife said (in what was obviously a vain effort to prevent us from having another set of glasses broken). ``If you don't, I'm going to come over there and put my foot through your TV screen!'' I thought that this particular threat was even more ludicrous than her first one; after all, we had already replaced two sets of glasses and were using disposable cups for now. But the point she was making was clear: We didn't want to lose our TV set again before it could be repaired or replaced, so there would have been no way for me to make a comeback with anything like ``If you don't stop telling your husband not to drink at home, I'll put my foot through the wall!''

When she was finished talking, I sat down at my desk and got out my computer. As usual on New Year's Eve, I was going to spend the evening checking up on some old friends who lived in other parts of the country -- people whose lives were so different from mine that they often made me feel as if we had never been close to one another in the first place (which is why it wasn't like having a New Year's Eve party with someone who lived in your own town). In fact, my wife and I hadn't seen our old friends in years; even though they'd moved away from us after graduation from college, we had kept up an occasional correspondence until about ten or twelve years ago -- at which point the letters stopped coming. 
 
 The last time we saw them was at a reunion of the class of '73 in May of that year (the same one during which my wife and I got into a fight with each other). It was obvious that something had gone wrong between us, but no one seemed to know what it was. We'd been going out together for so long -- even after high school began and we started dating -- that nobody could imagine why all of a sudden our relationship should change overnight; we were both just as nice to each other in public as ever before, and if there had been any problems they hadn't shown up yet. But since no one could explain what was happening or how it came about, there wasn't much anyone could do to try and fix things. So we split up soon after returning home from that reunion; my wife didn't even bother telling me where she was going next (though I knew all too well that it would be a place called ``Bedrock City'').

The last time I saw my old friends -- who had come along with their own spouses for the occasion -- was at another reunion about five years later, shortly before I left Bedrock City and moved to another part of the country. Even though it had been over a decade since we were together regularly as a group, they seemed happy enough to see me again (as well as my wife, who apparently hadn't told them that she was no longer interested in being married to me). But by then something else had happened between us -- not just the fact that our lives had taken different directions over time, but also that we now felt more like old acquaintances than close friends.

As I sat down at my computer and opened up my email program, I couldn't help feeling that if I hadn't married someone else after leaving Bedrock City, this would have been the year when everything finally worked out between us again (and even though we hadn't seen each other since May of 1983 -- more than thirty years ago! -- there was no reason why things couldn't have gone back to being as good as they ever were). But now it looked like I would never find out how it would feel to be with her again, or even if we could still be friends.

The problem was that since leaving Bedrock City in 1983 -- and before going on the run from the law (which is what happened when my old college roommate accused me of murdering his wife) -- I had been living with a woman named Jane (who was actually married to someone else at the time). She and her husband were good friends of ours, so they let us stay in their house while we were on the run from the police. But after about four months it became obvious that they couldn't live like this forever: They had two small children who needed their own rooms; plus they had a mortgage payment to make each month.
 
 `` If you don't mind staying with us,'' she said one day when we were having dinner together in the kitchen of her house (which was also where Jane and her husband lived). ``You can sleep on one of their beds until your wife gets home from work; then you two will have to share a room together.'' It seemed like an innocuous offer at first, but it turned out that once we were living there there was no way I could leave without causing problems for myself or her husband (not only because he knew where I was staying but also because we had become involved). So instead of going home to find my wife -- who had been looking all
