 being so popular it has become a worldwide news outlet, with their articles ending up in major newspapers across the world. 
It was not always like this. It used to be simple; there were no rules, nothing could hurt you (or at least that's what they wanted you to believe) and the moderators simply had one goal: to make everyone happy so that everyone would continue to use Reddit. But all good things come to an end...
 
 It was a day like any other on the Internet, and I was bored out of my mind. That's why I decided to browse through some /r/circlejerk threads for old times sake, but this time there was something different; something I had not seen before. A Reddit user (or sub) with 100% upvotes and no downvotes...I knew it was against the rules to be 100% upvoted on any post you submit to r/circlejerk, but this one was different. This particular post was a meme about /r/circlejerk itself, making fun of how easy it is to get a post 100% upvoted in that subreddit...that's when I realized that the rules had changed.

It seems that the circle-jerking (and other subs) has become so popular that it now has its own rules, and if you break any of them, even accidentally, then you might just be banned from your favorite subreddit...forever.
