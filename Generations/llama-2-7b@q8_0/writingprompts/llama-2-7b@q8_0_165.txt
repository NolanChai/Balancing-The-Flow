 the lake, 
 South of the fray. 
 
 Come take a trip with me, 
 To a place not quite as nice, 
 Where we can have some fun; 
 You'll get a drink or two! 
 
 But when I'm through with you, 
 You will be dead just the same; 
 Don't say that I didn't warn ya. 
 Come on - don't be so lame! 
 
 I can promise it is true 
 That your body parts will go missing, 
 And soon you won't be able to see: 
 All the people who love you.
