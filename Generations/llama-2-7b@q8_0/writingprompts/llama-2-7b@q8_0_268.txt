50 years into the future; those who'd taken the 'fever', had it bad and were now beyond treatment.
The rest of them? They'd been given their marching orders, told to abandon ship. The infected were a danger to the remaining healthy, as they tried to join the ranks of those already bitten. But no, the government wasn't taking any chances. A plague is a horrid thing and it was time to rid the planet of them.
Sirens screamed from all directions as trucks raced through the streets of what used to be San Francisco in search of the 'contaminated', to drag off and shoot, so they wouldn't spread their disease any further. The police were not spared, nor firemen or ambulance drivers either. And those who couldn't run from this latest outbreak of death; well, there was no escape for them.
But even the government had their limitations as a handful remained unaccounted for in the streets. Somehow they managed to evade capture and they were now on the loose and posing a threat to anyone who got close enough.
The last thing that the plague survivors wanted was to come face-to-face with one of these creatures, but they had no choice. As the hunted, they would have to fight for their lives or else be bitten by the very enemy who'd taken away so many of those they held most dear in life.
Mind you, the odds were against them as the deadly virus was far more potent than any bullet from a government issued weapon could ever be. So, unless one survived that first bite on their arm, then there was no hope for them at all; their death would only be delayed for a short while and it wouldn't take long before they too succumbed to this horrible disease and fell victim to the deadly plague known as the Fever.
