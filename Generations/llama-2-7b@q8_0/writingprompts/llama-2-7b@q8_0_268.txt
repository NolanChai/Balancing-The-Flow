30 minutes of fun. ''
The Warden shook his head sadly, `` You don't know? You have no idea which one to choose? Then I shall make the decision for you.''
He stepped forward and laid a hand on my shoulder. A sardonic smile twitched at the corners of his mouth as he gazed down into my eyes. He was so tall that his head nearly touched the ceiling in the confined space of my cell, but somehow he still seemed to loom over me as he stood there with one hand on my shoulder and the other grasping my chin in a grip more painful than any I'd ever felt.
`` You do know what this is about?'' he asked softly, `` This whole thing? The reason you're here? ''
He shook his head sadly and released me with an audible click of joints. He took a step back and folded his arms across the front of his robe as if that would conceal him from view in my cell. I had never seen this man, but he was clearly used to being the center of attention wherever he went, even here among these barren gray walls where everything was drab and lifeless and unremarkable except for him.
`` This is about Anecdote or Breakout?'' he asked again. His voice rose with every word. `` The choice isn't between those two things you've mentioned. It's much more than that. I want to talk to you about the real reason you're here in this cell. ''

His guards were all around, standing silently with their hands on the handles of their weapons, ready to strike at any moment.
`` So what's your answer?'' he asked again, `` Anecdote or Breakout? Which one is it going to be? ''
