ing and it was becoming obvious that the plague had not disappeared, as the first doctor had claimed. It would never disappear, there was no cure for a vampire's illness. The plague had been born in a cave near the small town of Brampton where the family that started it all, the D'arcy family had lived.

It was around three in the morning and the sun would be rising soon. Sam felt the need to feed as he had not for almost two weeks now. He lay down on his bed and let out a heavy sigh. If he could get some blood before the sun rose, maybe that might help him feel better.
 
 `` Where are you going?'' asked Laura. She was sitting up in her own bedroom looking through an old magazine she had found at home.
 
 Sam said nothing as he left his room and headed downstairs to the kitchen where there were a few bottles of blood on top of the fridge.
 
 `` Where are you going?'' Laura repeated, but by this time, Sam was already gone. He had made it out into the back garden before she could even open her mouth again.
 
 `` Oh. Right.'' Laura said as she sat down on the floor and poured over the magazine. It was a fashion magizine from the early nineties which had articles about shoulder pads, and photos of celebrities with no makeup on. She decided to go upstairs again to her room where there were also some old videos lying around.
 
 Sam walked through the back gate into his garden and began to sniff around for anyone who was out feeding, he had not been out for almost two weeks now so his nose was definitely on edge. He began to walk down the middle of his lawn looking everywhere for a possible source of food that might be there. His bloodlust was beginning to consume him and it seemed like the only thing that could calm him down was some sort of meal.
 
 He continued walking around when suddenly, he heard something in the corner of the garden behind him. He stopped what he was doing and turned to see who or what it might have been. There was a person there, they were lying on their back with one hand over their face as if trying to sleep, but Sam knew this was not possible for a human to do because they need so much blood every few days or else they begin to get sick.

 Sam walked over and peered down at the girl who was still unconscious, he could smell the scent of her blood and he felt his mouth salivate as he became aware of how hungry he really was. He reached down with one hand and placed it gently on her forehead to check if she was breathing or not.

 `` Can I help you?'' Laura asked, standing next to him. She had been watching them from the window but now she decided to step outside of their house and try and help Sam out. It had taken a while for Laura to realize that her brother was turning into a vampire but after they were forced to leave their home in London because of the plague, she knew there could be no doubt anymore.
 
 `` Yes. Please.'' Sam said, trying his best not to show how desperate he really felt at this point in time. If Laura saw how weak he was and how badly he wanted blood then he may never get another chance to feed again.
 
 `` What can I do?'' she asked. She had a worried look on her face as she tried her best not to show how scared she really felt, but it was obvious that Laura knew what was going to happen next, and she did not know whether or not Sam's transformation would be painful for him at all.

 `` Come here.'' Sam said to her. He began to walk backwards towards the back door of their house, where he hoped that his sister might follow him in case there were any problems during this time.

She walked over to him and stood next to him as they both looked out at the back garden. She could see a girl lying on the ground who had her hand covering her face. 

 `` What are we going to do?'' she asked, turning towards her brother. Laura was not sure whether or not it would be appropriate for them to help this girl but Sam seemed to know exactly what he wanted to do so that's when they both began walking in the direction of his house once again.

 `` I need some blood.'' Sam said as they walked through their door and into their home. It was a cold morning and there were still no signs of any sunlight appearing outside but he knew he did not have long now, so he hurried up to Laura and began to rip the top of her shirt open with his teeth before she could say anything else at all.

 `` What are you doing?'' Laura asked, looking down at him in horror as she felt a cold breeze run across her skin, it was almost like winter was arriving early this year and Sam knew that he did not have much time left now. He let out another heavy sigh before pushing his fangs through her skin once again.
