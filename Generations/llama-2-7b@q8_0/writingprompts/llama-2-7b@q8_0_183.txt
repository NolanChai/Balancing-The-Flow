ause to see it fail.
I was the first born of my father; his most favoured child. In name alone, that is how he raised me: an Outsider. When I was seven years old, my mother died in childbirth and left behind one son who did n't cry for long enough to earn a name.
I do not know how he learned the Outsiders ' ways but soon after his birth, he began speaking their language. He spoke it well before he spoke our own. I heard them calling him an Outsider and feared that they would kill him as they did all others who shared their blood.
My father told me to love my brother and for a while I tried to do so, but then the boy began to speak about going with his people. He said he had never known anything else. It was too late to change what had become of us by that time, our mother dead from childbirth, our blood mingled in his veins, and his eyes full of Outsider magic.
My father took him away into the woods where he knew they would not follow and there my brother became an Outsider, leaving behind only a handful of words in his own language for me to remember him by: Father, Brother, Home, War. My name is home. It was the first thing I learned to say in the Outsiders ' language.
The others followed soon after that and my father was left with nothing but an army he did n't know how to lead and a son who called him nothing but a liar for refusing to allow us to go.
I am not a great warrior, I do n't have much skill in the ways of magic or war, but what I did have was an army full of men willing to die for me because I had once saved their lives and they would follow me into hell itself if that is where I chose to lead them.
I spent ten years fighting for my people against the Outsiders before I surrendered our last stronghold, defeated in battle by a boy who was no older than I had been when my mother died. It was the only way we could survive: to go with them rather than die on the battlefield. We were the last of our kind and it would have taken us all to defeat their numbers; I knew that then, even before the war.
Their blood is now part of my own and though they will never know me by name, they call me Brother and Father when there are no other words between them to use for one another. They say that we are brothers because we share a mother's blood but I disagree: it was our father who saved us in the end; our father and his army.
They taught me Outsider magic and showed me how to read their language so that I could teach my people, but they will not listen to me now. The battle left too many dead on both sides for there to be room in this world any longer. It is all the fault of my brother: he should never have called himself home; he should never have given us a reason to fight and die for him.
I am at peace with their people now but they will never know that. The only time I see them anymore is when we are fighting against our enemies or when we must bury the dead. They would not understand it if they did.
The Outsider's name was Caleb and he taught me his language so that I could teach my people how to read, but it took years of study before we learned anything at all. He told me once that a single word in our language means something entirely different from what it does in his; there are many words for the same thing just as there is one meaning and too many ways of saying it.
The Outsider ' s name was Caleb, I learned. He taught me their language so that I could teach my people how to read but they would n't listen to what he said because they did not trust him. They knew that he was the one who had brought us into this war in the first place and it took many years for them to accept his words as truths when he spoke of peace with their people.
Caleb was my friend; we were brothers, but they would never know it. He taught me how to read their language so that I could teach my people, but they would n't listen because he had once been a warrior for them and had left before the battle ended. The Outsider ' s name was Caleb.
I do not know what happened to him after that day. His body was found with a broken neck later on in the night when they came to bury the dead but his mind is lost somewhere between life and death, wandering through both worlds like a ghost without purpose or direction until it finds another soul who needs help crossing over into whatever comes next.
They say that he is a coward because he ran away from us before the battle ended; they do not know what else to call him so they use his name instead as if calling someone by their name makes them less of a man than they would like for you to believe. But I do not think this is true: we were brothers once and now he walks between worlds without purpose or direction until he finds another soul who needs help crossing over into whatever comes next
The Outsiders are called that because their blood is mingled with our own, but they will never know my name. I am the last of my people: an army full of men willing to die for me and a father who taught us how to read his language so that we could teach our children what he had learned from them in turn, but it took many years before anyone would listen; their blood is now part of my own, but they do not know me by name. They say that we are brothers because we share a mother's blood but I disagree: it was our father who saved us in the end; our father and his army
Caleb was my friend once upon a time when we were young men fighting against what has come to be called The Great War between outsiders versus humans. He taught me how to read their language so that I could teach my people, but they would n't listen because he had once been an Outsider himself and they did not trust him either way afterward when all was said
The Outsider ' s name is Caleb; it means "friend" or "companion" in their language. We were friends at one point until they decided that I was a traitor because I had been with them before the war began, but we do not know what happened to him after this day when they came for us during battle so many years ago now; his body was found lying there somewhere between life and death later on in the night
I am home. It was the first thing I learned to say in their language; my name is home because it means "friend" or "companion". They call me Father as well because they do not know what else to call someone who has been with them for so long without saying anything about it until now when we both feel like strangers again after being together for so many years before that day when everything changed forever
They say that we are brothers because we share a mother's blood but I disagree: it was our father who saved us in the end; our father and his army
