As he strolled along, there came into view two young people who had their arms around each other’s waist; they were a couple, and she was pregnant with her first child. The hiker noticed how the man’s face lit up as she spoke to him and how he kissed her on the cheek.
As they talked about the baby that would be born in two months time, there was an audible rustle of leaves from above, a sound that seemed familiar yet alien at the same time; it was coming nearer. And then, from above the couple’s heads and just to one side, came a bird of prey, gliding down toward them.
It was a large hawk with a white body and brown head. It swooped low over their heads and then rose up again. The man said something, but the woman didn’t hear what he said; all she could focus on was that creature and its approach to her. She gripped her belly in fear as it hovered above them.
Then, the hawk landed close to where they stood and turned to face them with a look of curiosity in its yellow eyes. They stared back at each other. As it lowered its wings toward their faces, the man reached out his hand to touch the feathers on the bird’s back; there was an electric shock as he touched her soft breast. He felt no pain but had a sudden feeling that she was alive and warm underneath him.
The woman said, “It is like I am flying!”
And then, with a gust of wind from above, the hawk flew away to join its mates on the branches of nearby trees where they sat talking together as if they were human beings in their own right.
