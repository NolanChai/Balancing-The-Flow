148 people at the time of this writing, and a few in the next room, Jackeline has managed to say that "shit hit the fan."
 
 It doesn't matter what you say when you get home after work or out to lunch with friends. If you're talking to someone who knows about the power of suggestion, all that needs to happen is for them to believe in the idea, and it becomes fact. That's the beauty of hypnotism, suggestion, and our unconscious mind: The ideas that we have become fact whether we believe them or not.
 
 As an example, I know a woman who has been diagnosed with cancer several times now over the past decade. She is 50 years old. When she was first told, she said to her doctor "I'll get through this, it will go away." A few weeks later she went back for more tests, and they confirmed what she had suspected all along: It would go away. Her unconscious mind believed in the idea that it would, and so it did.
 
 This woman has also been diagnosed with a heart condition since then, a neurological disorder, and a blood disease. All of these were cured through her suggestion as well. She is now 10 years away from cancer because she believed in the idea that it wouldn't return. Her beliefs about those things became fact.
 
 Hypnotists know how to use this power, too. That's what we do: We create a reality for people and then get out of the way so they can live their lives as if what we've said is true. If we say something that makes it impossible for them to go back on their beliefs, we will make them do things that they may never have done before or even thought possible.
 
 That's the beauty and power of hypnotism. You can create your own reality simply by what you choose to believe in. And now that I've told you that it is true, your life has changed for ever.
