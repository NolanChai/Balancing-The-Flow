 it wouldn ' t, but sometimes you had to take chances...
Carson had been an insurance investigator in Chicago before moving back to London and joining Private Eye Ltd. His previous employers had given him a great deal of independence, but there was nothing quite as interesting as this new job. It might be too good to last - Carson knew that, but he would take the chance just to prove himself. He did n't even mind doing it for free; in fact he had been working on his own account from the moment he returned to England. He was an independent man and he preferred it that way.
A loud thump made Carson wince as the door behind him crashed open, its hinges protesting at their workload. A short man with a black ponytail stepped into the room. His eyes were small and his face was gaunt - no one would have expected someone of this type to be employed by PI Ltd but he obviously knew how to do his job; he had been given the contract for surveillance on Carson. The man gave him an evil smile which revealed a set of perfect white teeth, then he looked round the room.
"What is it? Didn ' t your boss tell you where I was working?" asked Carson. He knew that the guy wanted to look around and find out as much as possible about his surroundings before deciding what he should do next. There was no point in him trying anything now, though - he had been waiting for over an hour, and he would not have been sent if there were any suspicions of Carson's whereabouts.
"The boss is not very happy about you," said the man, nodding his head towards the back of the warehouse as he spoke. Carson had no idea what the man was talking about; it was obvious that they should be in contact with their superiors for this information and he did n't know how long he could keep up the pretence. He knew that there would come a time when he would have to tell them something, but he also knew that he could not afford to lose his cool so early on.
"You must be mistaken," said Carson. "I haven ' t been here for over an hour."
The man seemed to think about what Carson had just said - it was obvious that he was surprised by the response; he was almost sure that Carson was not lying, but he did n't know how much more evidence there was against him than there already was. The fact remained, however, that they were in an unmarked building and the boss had been worried about him since he went off duty earlier that evening...
Carson knew that this was going to be hard - his employers would not give up so easily if they really wanted to catch him out and they had sent him a surveillance agent who was clearly better than most of them. It was time for some plan B; he needed a different approach, but there was no need to panic just yet...
Carson turned his back on the man with the black ponytail and walked towards one of the doors in front of him. As soon as Carson reached it, he opened it up and stepped inside - he had to get rid of this guy before he started to think too much about what they were doing; if the agent was going to try and stop him from leaving then Carson would have to let him know that he had no intention of staying any longer than necessary.
The door shut behind him as soon as it opened, but the man did n ' t follow - he obviously wanted to wait until Carson came back out before deciding what next step should be taken in this investigation. Carson turned round and walked away from the door for a few seconds, just to make sure that the agent was not going to come after him; if he was going to do anything about it then there would be no point waiting around any longer because they were going nowhere with their plan A - the man had already found out where Carson lived and he knew how much money he made every month.
Carson turned back towards the door as soon as he realised that his surveillance agent was not following him; it would be better if this guy just went away before he started to think about what they were doing again...
"What's wrong with you?!" shouted Carson at one of the men who had been watching him from inside his car. It was a mistake to have spoken like that, but Carson felt as though he needed to get something off his chest; he could not help thinking about how this guy had been stalking him for months and it would be nice if someone just talked back every now and then - maybe then they would give up.
"You are going the wrong way," replied one of Carson's team members from inside their van, "we need to get out of here before we are spotted by anyone else who knows what you have been doing." The driver did n ' t bother saying anything because he knew that it was pointless - no matter how much they tried to avoid this guy, there would always be another one waiting around for them on every corner and roundabout in London; this was just the way things worked when you were working undercover as a private investigator...
