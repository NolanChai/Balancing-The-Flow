   * She walks to the door, turns around, and looks back at him with a stern expression before exiting through the door, leaving him in shock.
   
``Holy shit... she is going to kill me...'' he thought. He sits down, takes out his phone, and begins texting her again. He receives no reply. He gets up again, walks over to her door, knocks, enters, and is greeted with a blank stare from her. 
  
 `` Hey.. '' he says.
   
She looks at him.
  
 `` What's wrong?'' he asks. She sits down on the couch, looking at the floor.
  
``What did I do wrong? Why is it such a problem that you aren't wearing clothes?? You should just go to your room and put some on! I can understand why your mother wouldn't want you walking around like this in public but I don't care so long as you're comfortable with yourself.''
  
 `` I was so mean... '' she says, teary eyed. 
  
 He sighs and walks over to her.
  
``It's okay... don't worry about it... its nothing bad what I said....'' he begins.
   
 She looks at him with a sad expression and says `` No.. It is something bad what you said. '' 
  
 He smiles, trying to cheer her up and then suddenly stops. His smile quickly fades as she continues speaking.
  
``I didn't mean that... I didn't mean it like that at all... but I did say some things.. and now I'm really sorry..'' 
   
She begins crying, shaking her head back and forth and he walks over to her to comfort her. He sits down beside her and rubs her arms in an attempt to calm her down before she speaks again.
  
``I don't know who I am anymore... I can't be anything like you, or my mom.'' 
  
He looks at her with a puzzled face, not sure what exactly he is supposed to say in response. He tries his best to comfort her by rubbing her arms and back as she continues to speak.
