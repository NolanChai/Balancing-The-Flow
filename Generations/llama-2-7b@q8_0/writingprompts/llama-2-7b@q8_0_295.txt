grily demanding a life free from the compulsions and obligations that are required to be human. It started with wanting to know why. Why should we bother with any of this at all? Why should we be held accountable for our actions when no one else seems to be? If everything is arbitrary anyway, if everyone is out to get you, what is the point in being good or bad? And so on and so forth. I was depressed about my lack of money, my inability to find a job. So, I became angry at the world for denying me these things when I wanted them.
Then, I got tired. I was done with this. But, as I went to sleep last night, there it was again. This morning, after a few hours of sleep, I was back. Then, finally I asked myself: What do you want? What do any of us really want? We don’t want to be held accountable for our actions because we are afraid that we may not be able to live up to the expectations that society has set. And what if we can’t? The answer is simple, but it is difficult: make your own rules and follow them. No one can tell you how to behave unless they know the kind of person you want to become. So, stop being afraid! Stop feeling guilty for not doing anything at all! Life is not a zero-sum game where the only way to win is by making everyone else lose. And if we are so focused on ourselves and our own needs that we forget about others then who will take care of them?
But there was a time when I wanted something more than this life would allow me, which is why my first reaction was to complain. Then, as I thought about it some more, I realized what I really want: I just don’t like being alone all the time. That’s it! Nothing else matters in life but to be happy with who you are and where you are going; if that means staying single or married for a long period of time, so be it.
The problem is we live in a world that tells us what we should want. If I wanted this or that then I would have it by now! But sometimes people don’t know what they really desire until they find out how hard it can be to get it (and often times how much effort isn’t worth putting in).
The truth is, all our desires come from the same place: wanting something more than we currently have access too. Whether that means having money or power or knowledge – whatever floats your boat really – we all want those things because they make us feel better about ourselves and others around us! And while this seems like a simple idea on paper, I can tell you first hand how difficult it actually is in practice…
As soon as I finished reading the above paragraph, I was reminded of my favorite quote by Henry David Thoreau: “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.” This is what we do when we feel like we’re stuck and there’s no way out. But if you want to be free from these feelings then stop thinking about them! Think about something else instead, whatever that may be for you – it could even just be breathing…
We all have desires, but not every desire is created equal. Some are more important than others and some are simply unrealistic or impossible to obtain. Desire can motivate us in many ways, but it’s also possible that our greatest desire might be the very thing holding us back from achieving success.
Desire for power over people leads to corruption and abuse of authority. The desire for wealth often turns into greed which destroys relationships with loved ones or even entire communities as people compete against each other instead of working together towards common goals like happiness, health and prosperity. And last but not least – the most important one: love; when we lose sight of what truly matters in life then everything else falls apart around us too!
When you look at a desire from this perspective it becomes clear why some people are so successful while others struggle just to get by every day. The first step towards changing your life is realizing how much control over yourself and the world around you depends on what kind of person you decide to become instead of letting circumstances determine that choice for you.
When I’m feeling down, or lonely, or sad, or frustrated…
When I’m feeling down, or lonely, or sad, or frustrated about life in general – it often helps me take a step back and realize what my desires really are. It can be hard to see past all the noise when you’re caught up in your own head (and sometimes even harder still if others try to tell us how they think we should feel). But if we’re able to get outside our own perspective for just long enough – whether by reading something uplifting or spending time with friends who know what matters most – then suddenly everything seems clearer again; like there’s always been an answer right under your nose all along!
Desire is a powerful force. It can be used for good, but it also has the potential to lead you down the path of destruction and despair if left unchecked. Desires are what make us human – without them we would never strive for anything or work towards any kind of progress in our lives; but they’re not always easy to control either!
We often think that happiness comes from having everything we want, when really it just takes some time and effort on your part before things start coming together properly so don’t give up hope if things aren’t going well right now because there may still be hope left for you yet. If this sounds like something you might need help with then please reach out – I know what it feels like to struggle with my own desires and how much easier life became once I found a way through them all together (which was definitely worth every penny spent).
It is natural to have desires, but if we let ourselves be ruled by our desires instead of making them work for us then we will never reach our true potential. This article has given you some insight into how your life could be different if you had the courage and determination to change things up a bit!
