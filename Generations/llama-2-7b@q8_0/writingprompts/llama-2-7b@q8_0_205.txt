 build and dark complexion. I am sure he is not from around here. The area we met in is known to be dangerous. I have had some visitors that were obviously CIA but he seemed more serious about what he said than they were. 
 
 He told me the US government has found out what is going on here, and wants to help. I think this is true because it would be very unlikely for a spy from anywhere to get information to someone in the intelligence community without a connection with that agency.
 
 I asked him where he was from originally but he would not say. He told me his name was Jack Smith, and his email address is jack@jacksmith.com
