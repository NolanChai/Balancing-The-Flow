'pose but still. 
 
 I get up from the bed, where I have spent many hours crying into my pillow and walk over to the window to gaze out at the beautiful landscape that was once my playground...
 
 This world has been mine since it was first created by you, the father of our kind... It's true that the old man might not be here anymore but I am. He left me in charge and even though I have tried to keep things in order the past few months everything keeps falling apart.
 I can feel a tear building up as I stand there staring at nothing, it's been so long since I have felt real pain that tears are just starting to leak out of my eye... I hate this world and everything on it, all of creation is doomed and everyone in it knows it... yet still they chose to keep their heads in the sand and pretend like it doesn't matter.
 
 It's time for a change, if you won't help us then I will be forced to take matters into my own hands... I'll start with this planet first of course before moving on to the rest of the universe, that should do wonders for the mood and make me feel better about myself. 
 
 I go back to the bed and pick up a paperweight and throw it across the room, it shatters into pieces as it hits the wall...
 
 I know this world will never be good enough but maybe this is just what I need to finally get it done right!

 
### Part III - The Tearoom
 
 I stand in front of a mirror admiring myself, the new look suits me quite well. 
 
 The man staring back at me was once called Eden but that name was so long ago and now he's just another nobody... 
 
 I walk up to him and raise my fist into the air before striking him hard across his face, the sound of breaking bone fills my ears. 
 
 That should do it! Now onto the next step...
 
 I take off my suit jacket as I begin to change myself in ways that are so much better than what he was capable of doing.
