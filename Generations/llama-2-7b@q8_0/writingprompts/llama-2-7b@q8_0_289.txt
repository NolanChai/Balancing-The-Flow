16 year old mother in New York City, his father had already left and never came back. His mother struggled for years to raise him alone while working multiple jobs. She would not let poverty get the better of her and she made sure that Remi had every opportunity possible to succeed in life.
Remi went through the education system and excelled as an academian. He was a straight A student until he decided to take his final year at a different school where he got his first taste of football. It took some time for him to get used to it, but that did not last long. He loved the sport instantly and knew right from then on what career path he wanted to go down in life.
As he grew older Remi started playing with an amateur team on weekends where he was immediately noticed by scouts at the professional level. One of his coaches knew him for years as a child, who made sure that Remi had the right connections and people behind him to make it to the top. It did not take long before he got a chance to play with a semi pro team in Italy where he was signed almost immediately after trials. He played in Italy for a year, which was good enough time for some professional teams to notice his talent.
It took an agent who knew Remi personally from childhood to get him that final big break and make it into the top leagues of Europe. Now, at 24 he has proven himself as one of the best young defenders in European football.
