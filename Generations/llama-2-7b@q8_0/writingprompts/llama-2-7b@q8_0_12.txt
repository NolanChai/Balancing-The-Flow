inging my thoughts back to the present, I stare down into the campfire where most of the men were still telling their tales to the few remaining people in the circle around it. The first thing I noticed was that the fire wasn't burning brightly anymore, just glowing with a dim orange light. All eyes looked at me as I approached and sat next to the fire.
"I don't understand why we have a campfire here." I stated softly to the group of men around it. "Isn't there some sort of rule about not using fire near these types of materials?" A couple of the men started laughing at my innocent statement but then one of them replied, "It's not like we haven't tried using candles or anything else." He answered while looking around the fire. I stood up and looked down to see that there were no other flames burning in the area.
"How is it that you are able to keep a fire going?" One of them asked me as he reached over his head and touched the ground above the small fire we had built here. "It's a magic campfire." I stated looking at them all with a confused expression on my face. They began laughing again while staring at me as if to say I was crazy for believing such an absurd story.
"You don't have any flint or matches?" One of the men asked me. "We do but no one cares about it." He then turned and looked at me with a confused expression on his face, "I just told you we can't use fire here." I smiled back and placed my hand over my eyes as if to block out the sunlight for just a moment before turning to look at him. "Well, that's not the way it is supposed to be done but no one seems to care what I do or say so..." He stated as he began moving his hands around in circles in front of me as though he was casting some sort of spell.
"What are you doing?" The man next to him asked as he watched him move his fingers around in the air and then hold them up like a cross for a few seconds before looking at me again with an expression that told me he had no idea what I was talking about. "It's not supposed to be done that way." He replied once more, still watching my every movement as if it were some sort of trickery.
"Do you guys ever do magic?" One of the men asked as he stood up and began moving his hands around in circles in front of me before holding them up like a cross for several seconds at which point I smiled at him. "I don't know what you are doing but it isn't supposed to be done that way." He told me, still watching me closely with suspicion as if he were trying to figure out my secret.
"Do any of the women here do magic?" I asked them all while looking around at each one before turning back to face him again. "Not that we know about anyway," One of the men replied quickly, seeming rather shocked by the question. "Well, if you don't then how are you able to keep this fire going without any flint or matches?" I asked him as he sat down next to me and began moving his hands around in circles before holding them up like a cross for several seconds at which point everyone else began laughing again.
"It isn't magic," He told me quickly as though that explained everything, "it just works." As the laughter subsided, I turned back toward him once more and asked him to explain what he meant by 'just works.'
The first thing you need to do is take a piece of wood about two inches long. Hold it over the fire for a few seconds and then place your hand under it and touch it to your skin." He told me, "if I'm right it will burn you." As I held my hand out to him, he moved his own closer until both hands were just above the fire before he placed his palm on top of mine.
"It's not supposed to work that way." He said as I felt a burning sensation in my skin and then watched it disappear almost instantly. "The heat from the fire isn't enough for this type of wood," He told me, "it needs to be burned at high temperatures or else it won't work properly." As he spoke, another man pulled out his flint and steel and began striking one against another while holding them close together.
"That looks like a good idea," I replied as the fire flared up once again. "What are you doing?" He asked me before looking back at him. "You're right it doesn't work." The second man told me, "I've been trying to start one for hours and finally gave up after burning myself several times with these two objects." As he spoke the fire began growing rapidly once again causing everyone else in our group to turn away from us as they tried not to watch.
"That's where you're wrong." I said as a smile crossed my face, "it isn't supposed to work like this either." He stared at me with a confused expression on his face before turning back toward the fire and watching it grow again. "It doesn't matter if your hands are dry or not," He replied quickly while trying unsuccessfully to blow out what had become a small flame in front of us. "But the fire is getting too big now."
I turned away from him and began moving my hands around in circles once more, then held them up like a cross for several seconds before turning back toward him again with an expression on my face that told him everything he needed to know about what I was doing next...
