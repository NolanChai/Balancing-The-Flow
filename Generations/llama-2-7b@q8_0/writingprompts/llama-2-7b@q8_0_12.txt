 sorts of shades and is almost ready to fall below the horizon.
“So tell me what’s new” she says after a few minutes of silence. I smile at her, I don’t know why but this is one of my favorite things about her. She asks questions and seems genuinely interested in whatever it is I might be doing or have been up to lately.
“Oh there’s not much really” I tell her as we turn a bend on the trail that brings us closer to the waterfall itself. It’s just getting dark enough that you can see some of the fog rising off the surface of the falls, but not so dark that the whole thing is hidden in shadow like it usually is this time of year.
“How about we go up there?” she asks, pointing to a spot above us where another trail branches away from our current one and heads higher up on the side of the mountain. There’s a path leading off into the forest that’s clearly used by lots of hikers, but I’d never taken it before and so I wasn’t sure if she had or not either.
“I don’t know” I say “maybe tomorrow.” We both look at our watches and realize that we probably should turn around soon in case it gets too dark to find our way back to the car. But then again, there really isn’t much reason for us to hurry back down, not when she has me all alone here on a mountain with nothing but her to keep me company for the next few hours.
We walk slowly back towards the trailhead and I find myself thinking that this might be it. After five years of coming up here together every summer and sharing a couple dozen conversations like this, we’re going to say goodbye as soon as tonight is over.
“You know” she says suddenly “I don’t think you’ve ever told me what brought you out here in the first place.” I look at her for a moment before shaking my head. The truth is that there are lots of things that bring me to this place every year, but the only one that truly matters is the fact that she comes too.
“Well then” I say “I guess it’s time that you found out.”
I stop walking and sit down on a large rock that overlooks the falls from below where we’ve been standing all evening long. She joins me and sits down next to me, looking out at the falls in silence for a few minutes before speaking again.
“So what is it? I mean you could have told me any time.” Again my head shakes back and forth in response to her question. There’s a part of me that wants to tell her everything about this place but another that knows she doesn’t really need to know all that much more than she already does about why I come here every year at the end of summer.
“I guess it’s like this” I finally say after we sit there in silence for a few minutes, “whenever you and I meet up here, I don’t just feel closer to her but also closer to myself.”
“You mean like when she used to come along with us?” She asks. It was almost like I could see her frowning through the darkness as the question finally came out.
“I suppose” I say quietly. The truth is that for me this place has always been more about the two of them than just either of them, but it’s still not exactly what she wants to hear. “She was a part of us once too” I continue slowly “and we all used to come up here together.”
“Oh” she says almost as if she feels like she’s being punished for asking about the past in the first place. I don’t blame her because it wasn’t really until last year that I started coming back on my own after all these years of only ever meeting them at this spot every summer together.
“I don’t know” I say “it was like something just happened and now we all have different lives or whatever, so…” But then again maybe there isn’t really much point in trying to explain any of it to her. She doesn’t understand how important coming here has been for me over the years and neither does she know that I miss them more than anyone could ever possibly imagine.
“You don’t need to say anything else” she tells me as we stand up again, “it’s alright if you just want some time alone.” So I do my best to smile at her in response even though deep inside this is one of the hardest things about being back here on my own.
We continue walking down the trail that leads off into the woods until finally we come upon a clearing with a bench sitting near by. As soon as we sit down, she reaches out and grabs my hand again, squeezing it tightly like she always does whenever I’m feeling particularly upset about something in particular at this time of year.
I don’t know why but there seems to be a sense of urgency behind her actions that makes me want to say all kinds of things out loud even though neither one of us has ever said anything out loud before, not even when we first met up here on our own last summer together at the end of everything else.
“I love you” I finally say after thinking about what’s going through my head for a while now “and it always feels like something changes whenever either one of us gets back into town.” She looks at me in silence and doesn’t really seem to know how much time has passed since she last said this exact same thing five years ago.
“It’ll be alright” she says finally, her hand still gripping mine tightly even though I already know that things won’t ever go back to the way they were again, at least not for me anyway. “I just want you to remember how much we love each other and nothing will change because of that.”
It’s hard for me to think about any of this after hearing her say it out loud but I do my best to nod even though there is still so much more going on inside my head right now than just feeling happy or sad. But then again maybe that was never really the point in coming up here alone at all, not if you ask me anyway.
As we walk back down towards where our car has been parked for most of this evening I look out over what’s left of summer and try to remember what it felt like when they used to come with me every time there was some kind of holiday or special occasion coming up on the calendar ahead.
“It’ll be alright” she says again “just let yourself feel whatever you want without trying too hard not to.” And then we both look down at our feet for a moment before turning around and walking back towards where all three of us used to stand together whenever it was time once more for summer vacation from school.
There’s something about saying goodbye that makes me want to cry, even though I’ve never done this in front of anyone else before now either. Maybe it’s because she knows how much I love her or maybe it has something do with the fact that we can finally be together again after all these years apart but whatever the case may be there is still so much more for me to figure out than just feeling happy or sad right now.
