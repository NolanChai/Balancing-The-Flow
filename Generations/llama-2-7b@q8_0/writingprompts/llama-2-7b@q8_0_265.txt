ir followers to victory in the name of their deity; on the other, the army of the old gods, whose bannermen fought for glory, wealth or simple survival.
"Halt! We surrender!"
The voice rang out from behind the door, and the bells fell silent. The priests stepped back in confusion to let a handful of soldiers pass them on their way through into the chapel.
Behind them, a young man in dark robes stood waiting for them: a high priest, apparently, who had taken up residence within the church.
Their leader was a tall man with a weathered face and long white hair, his armour covered by a black cloak. The soldiers stopped and regarded him warily as he approached, the other priests and bannermen following behind them. "I am Father Diligence," he announced. "How did you get in here?"
"I was trapped inside with many of our brothers when the doors were locked, Father." The young priest bowed respectfully before him as the other soldiers began to file past and join their comrades at the front door, waiting for further instructions. "We had been attempting to escape, but we ran out of provisions and were forced into a desperate situation."
The leader looked around at his followers, many of whom were barely able to stand without collapsing from exhaustion and hunger. "Father Diligence," he said. "This is a disgraceful state for those who call themselves soldiers of the One True God. Do you truly not see that?"
"We were forced into an impossible situation, Father," Diligence replied, "and did our best to defend ourselves against your armies." The other priests nodded in agreement, though a few looked unconvinced as they stared at the filth covering their ragged clothing.
Father Diligence gestured for them to follow him outside to the front of the church and its stone altar, where the soldiers waited. They could hear the bells ringing from inside the chapel above the sound of distant cheering, as word spread that the Church had been defeated. The young priest bowed before them all with a reverent sigh. "May the One True God be pleased to look favourably upon your sacrifice and accept you into His holy kingdom."
Father Diligence took his place at the altar, turning around to address the soldiers. "I shall now perform a ceremony to purify all of your souls," he announced. "But first I must take this offering from those who have sinned in their service to you and give it up to God." He gestured towards several of his followers, who knelt at the altar and unfurled bundles of coins, jewels and other riches from the pouches at their waists.
"The Lord will now accept your gifts," Diligence announced with a smile as he took each one in turn before throwing it on top of the altar. He then picked up a large sack that was wrapped tightly around a wooden frame and held aloft for all to see, its contents glinting in the sunlight streaming through the windows behind him.
"This is His great sacrifice," Diligence explained, "which we have made on our behalf." He then turned away from the altar towards Father Diligence and his followers, who waited expectantly as he continued speaking: "I now invite all of you to come forward and receive absolution for your sins against God. All it will cost is a single gold piece."
With that, the soldiers began streaming into the church at a steady pace, taking their places before Father Diligence while he waited patiently until each had completed his or her part in receiving forgiveness from the One True God through His High Priest. Finally, when it seemed as if everyone who wished to take part had done so, he began leading them back out of the chapel and into the courtyard beyond it, where they could be joined by their families after being cleansed from all of their sins by Himself alone.
And so ended one more chapter in history’s long war between Good and Evil…
