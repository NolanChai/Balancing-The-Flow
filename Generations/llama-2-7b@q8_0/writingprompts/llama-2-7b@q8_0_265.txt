10 feet up in the air.
 "What are ya doin '?"
 My face was red as could be. It did n't help that my cheeks were wet from sweat. "I don 't know," I said. "I'm scared to jump."
 I stared at her, and then realized it was probably true. So what?
 "Cool!" she yelled.
 She jumped off the roof too quickly and landed on her butt with a loud smack. She shook the cobwebs out of her head and stood up again. "Did you see that?" she asked, looking down at the street below us. It was dark out; just before midnight.
 "Yeah." I climbed the ladder back up to the roof with a sigh. I sat on the edge of it and looked toward the ocean. My eyes were getting used to the darkness, and I could make out some white spots moving through the water. There were lights in them. Maybe they were fish or something.
 "Those are boats," she said after looking at me for a minute. She shivered, which made her jump again. "You're really cold."
 I nodded. "Yeah. Come on. Let 's go downstairs to my room." My voice sounded strange and squeaky even to myself; probably from the way the wind was blowing through my hair.
 We walked back inside, and she followed me into my bedroom. She stood behind me as I closed the door. Her hands were on my shoulders, and when I turned around her lips were pressed against mine. It felt so good that it scared me a little. What if she wanted to kiss me again?
 We pulled apart after a moment. She looked at me with big eyes. "Are you sure?"
 I nodded quickly.
 Her hand went up my chest and touched the top of my shirt, her fingers moving over the cloth until they were on my nipple. Her other hand ran across the front of her own pants. My heart beat really hard, but not in a bad way this time. I felt like maybe I was about to faint; that 's how fast it was beating.
 She took her hands off me and took a step back, her arms behind her head as if she were nervous. "I... uh, guess we should go to sleep."
 It sounded like the words came out of her mouth at the same time my brain registered what they meant. "Huh? Are you serious?" I asked in shock. "You want to just... go to bed together?"
 She shook her head quickly. "I mean, no. Not exactly," she said, and then ran off.
 "But..." It took me a minute to figure out that she 'd gone into the bathroom. I was pretty sure it had been right behind my bedroom door. It still felt weird in there though; like maybe she could hear us if we yelled at each other from different rooms. Maybe that's why she wanted me to sleep on the floor?
 I lay down with my head next to the window, watching as the stars disappeared into the darkness of night and morning appeared again. It was a little uncomfortable without a mattress, but it helped keep me awake. "I don 't think you should be here," she said quietly from across the room.
 I turned my head to look at her; she sat on the floor with her back against the wall and her legs bent underneath her. Her hair was everywhere, and she looked a little sad. She could n't have been very comfortable either. I guess that's what got me up again. "Why not?"
 She shrugged. "I don 't know."
 That was weird enough for me to get out of bed. I sat on the edge and put my legs under me. The floor was cold, but at least it felt more familiar than lying down had. "Don 't be scared," I whispered. She shrugged again and looked away from me.
 I crawled closer to her. "You don't have to stay if you don't want to."
 That seemed to catch her attention, and she turned back around with a smile. It was nice to see it, especially since I did n't think she 'd been smiling at me for the last hour or so. She got up and sat in front of me on the floor, so that our knees were touching.
 "I don't want to leave," she said quietly. Her words sounded like they hurt a little when they left her lips; I guess she had been holding them back for a while. I put my arms around her and pulled her close until we were lying down on the floor together, facing each other with our heads turned toward each other. She leaned in closer so that her nose was almost touching mine.
 "Hey," I said.
 "Uh-huh?" she replied.
 My face got hot again as my heart beat faster and faster. That's how I knew this time that it would n't scare me away. It made me want to do what we were doing again. It also helped to have her so close, so that when she leaned in a little bit more, our lips touched for real.
It was not what I expected at all. She tasted sweet like candy, but her mouth felt hot; like she 'd been holding it closed for a really long time or something. Maybe she had been scared too? Or maybe she just did n't like kissing me the first time around.
That was okay though. I liked it this time better than the other one. Her lips felt soft when they touched mine, and her hands held my face as if she wanted to do that again and again. I had never done anything like this before, but I knew it would make us both feel good. It also helped keep me from getting scared like earlier in the day.
We were so busy kissing we did n't even notice when a pair of legs came through my window and onto my roof.
#  Chapter Twenty-Two
# Lily
**_"Lily,"_ **I said quietly, pulling away from her lips to look up at her face. She had the biggest smile I had ever seen on her, and it made me feel good inside too. It also reminded me of what we were doing; like maybe there was more than just kissing going on between us right now.
I reached out and touched her cheek with my hand. "What 's wrong?"
She shook her head, as if she did n't know how to answer that question. She pulled her knees up close to her chest so that we were face-to-face on the floor again. I leaned in for another kiss before I got scared and decided to stop, but it was already too late. Her lips moved against mine without any warning.
I closed my eyes and tried not to think about what else could happen if we kept this up. We did n't have much time left though; at least that's what the clock said on the wall next to us. I looked at it for a minute, thinking how strange it was that it was still there in the morning after all of our fun last night.
"We should go," I whispered. "My parents will be home soon." I felt her arms tighten around me and let out a breath I did n't even know I had been holding. I looked at her, thinking about how it was the best night I 'd had in months. It made everything else that had happened in my life seem like nothing compared to this.
"Okay," she said softly.
I got up first and held out a hand for her to pull herself up with. She took it, and we walked toward the bedroom together. I stopped just before we entered it though. "I don't know what you think is going on between us," I started to say, "but I like kissing you."
She smiled at that and let out a breath too as if she was relieved to hear those words come out of my mouth. She leaned in closer to me and kissed me softly again; her hands ran through my hair and down my back before they stopped on my butt, pulling me even closer against her body.
"I like kissing you too," she whispered. Her lips were really warm now, and I was sure we had been kissing for at least a minute or two by then. She pulled away from me and looked into my eyes again. "Will you come over tomorrow?"
It took me a second to answer that question, because I knew it would lead to more kisses and maybe even something else if she wanted it too. It was hard to say no when her lips felt so soft against mine; not to mention the fact that I did n't really want to go home anyway. My parents had been fighting for what seemed like weeks, but tonight they were actually getting along. That meant that my mom must have told them about what happened with me and Lily at school yesterday.
I nodded and looked at her again before she kissed me one more time and then ran out of the room. I stood there in front of the door for a minute, thinking how good it felt to be kissing her. Maybe we did n't have anything special between us; maybe Lily was just trying to get back at my mom for
