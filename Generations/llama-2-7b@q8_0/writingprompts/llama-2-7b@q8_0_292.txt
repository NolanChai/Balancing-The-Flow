 sucked again today. Well, not really work so much as trying desperately to get out of work. If I had any kind of job, I'd probably be on the unemployment line by now. The only thing that kept me going was my apartment and the hope that it would soon be a memory. 
 My neighbor was banging around like he was having guests over. I wasn't too happy about this. It meant more noise for me, meaning less sleep for me. I thought maybe I could just go out to buy food or something, but if I left now they might come in and talk to me, which would be even worse. 
 Finally I decided that I would just have to risk it. My neighbor was probably drunk anyway, so he'd never notice if I stayed away for a few hours. I grabbed the key from under my mattress, and went out into the hallway.
 
 "Hey, you," my neighbor yelled at me in his drunken slur. "What are you doing up so early?" 
 "I was just getting ready to go to work," I said, walking past him. He stopped me by grabbing my arm and turned me around. His breath smelt like the inside of a barn, but he smiled at me anyway. 
 "You wanna come in for some drinks?" he asked me. 
 I felt like I should say something about how much it would cost or that I didn't have any money, but before I could do anything my neighbor grabbed me by the arm and started to lead me down the hallway. 
 "Come on," he said. "We can get drunk and you won't even know what day it is when we're done." He laughed as he walked towards his apartment door. I followed him in, not wanting to make him angry by trying to walk away. I felt so nervous about this whole thing that I wasn't sure if my legs were going to hold up under me or not. 
 His door was already open when we got there and he led me inside. "Have a seat," he said, gesturing towards his couch. He sat down himself and looked at me expectantly while he waited for me to sit too. I did as I was told, but I tried to keep my eyes away from the television screen in case some horrible crime scene or something like that were on it. 
 "Want a drink?" my neighbor asked. He grabbed a bottle off of his table and held it out to me. 
 "No," I said, shaking my head. 
 "Come on," he insisted. "Don't be such a party-pooper." 
 "I don't drink," I explained. "It makes me sick." 
 "Aw, man," my neighbor moaned as if to say that it was just too bad for him. "Fine then," he said with a sigh. "If you won't have one with me then we'll go find someplace where they got whiskey." He stood up and walked towards the door. 
 I stayed on the couch, trying to ignore how drunk my neighbor was getting as he talked about how much fun we were going to have. Finally he turned around to look at me again. "Come on," he said. "I don't think you can even drive that way." He laughed and walked towards his door. I felt like I had no choice but to follow him if I didn't want my neighbor getting mad with me for being so rude about it all, so I stood up and did what he asked of me. 
 The whole walk over there was awkward because neither one of us were saying anything else besides hello when we got outside our building. I didn't even know where to look or anything like that while walking with him. Finally my neighbor stopped at a bar, just down the road from my apartment, and said "Here," holding out his hand for me to shake it. He led me inside without saying another word about how he was going to pay for all of this or whatever else people usually say when they want you to know that you're supposed to buy them some drinks at some point in time later on during their visit with you, but I didn't really care anyway because I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible before anything else bad happened between us.
 *clank* 
 
 My neighbor had been drinking a lot and he started talking about all kinds of things that made no sense whatsoever while we sat at the bar. It was really hard for me to keep up with him because I wasn't sure if any of this stuff were true or not, but my neighbor seemed convinced by everything that he said so I just let him continue talking and trying to act interested in whatever nonsense came out his mouth while we sat there together drinking beer after beer after beer until we both felt like crap again. 
 "I've been thinking about it for a long time," my neighbor said, staring at me with bloodshot eyes. "And now I know what you're supposed to do when someone has taken everything away from them." He took out his knife and held it up so that everyone in the bar could see it. 
 *clank* 
 
 My heart stopped beating for a few seconds after hearing this. Was he going to kill me? I couldn't tell what was going on anymore, but then my neighbor started laughing at himself again and put his knife back into his pocket. He waved goodbye when we were walking out of the bar together later that night before heading back home alone to our respective apartments where we would both eventually pass out after being unable to fall asleep all evening long due to everything going on around us. 
 *clank*
