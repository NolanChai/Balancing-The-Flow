licities are simply replications of their original source. They do not grow; rather, they mature in parallel to the source, like children in a family. This has led some of the more curious minds to consider this process as something other than mitosis, but, instead, as a process where each new being is born fully realized, without having had to go through the process of learning and discovery that the original went through.
The multiverse is not the same as it was when it started, just like people are not the same they were twenty years ago. It has grown in complexity and intricacy; it has also become more defined. The multiverse has developed new languages and social constructs where it had none before; it has evolved into a creature of its own design. It is an entity unto itself, but still exists as one with the source.
The multiverse is an infinite mirror that reflects back all possible outcomes within every universe. This is why certain events can never be changed or rewritten in their history. Infinite timelines cannot have different results, only variations of a single path. These timelines are created by individuals from all around the multiverse and they are often very similar to each other, but sometimes there will be minor alterations. The most interesting thing about these events is that once something is written in the past it becomes part of all possible futures and cannot be changed again; this makes the multiverse a dangerous place for time travelers or individuals who try to change history because they are now an integral part of all possible timelines. This also means that certain events happen more often than others which creates what we call "probability waves" in some areas, while other parts remain largely unaffected by them due to lesser population density or lack of interest from travelers who would alter their destinies through time travel or alternate dimension travel (like the ones from another universe).
Infinite universes are born with the same set of rules and constraints as their parent. These constraints become more refined over time, but do not change.
The multiverse is made up of infinite universes that share commonality in their origins. While each has its own unique characteristics (or lack thereof), they all share certain elements from one another. For example: A universe with a large population and high level of technology will have some similarities with an identical universe found elsewhere in the multiverse due to shared ancestry between them both; however this does not mean that those universes are necessarily similar in every way--they may look alike but still possess different properties when compared side by side.
Each universe exists as a separate entity and can be considered its own "world". Each world has its own set of rules, laws of physics and social constructs which were developed over time through natural evolution or due to outside influences such as gods from other realms entering into our own dimension (or vice versa).
The multiverse is made up of an infinite number of universes. These universes are similar in many ways, but different in others. For instance: One universe may have a very large population while another has little or no population at all; one universe may be rich with resources and technology while another is impoverished; one universe may be governed by law whereas another is ruled by chaos and anarchy--the list goes on!
Each of these universes exists as its own world. This means that there are multiple versions of Earth in existence at any given time, each containing different cultures, technologies, and social structures than those found elsewhere within the multiverse. As such it's possible for two people from separate realities to meet up despite being separated by great distances because they share a common ancestor (although this doesn't always happen).
There are many universes that exist within the multiverse, each with its own rules and laws. These rules can be anything from how time works to what makes things solid or not; even things like gravity are different from one universe to another because they are based on their own set of rules rather than our own rules here in this reality.
The Multiverse is a complex and ever-changing entity, with an infinite number of universes that share commonalities but also have unique traits. Each universe has its own laws and rules that govern how it works—for example: one may be rich in resources while another lacks them completely; one may be ruled by law whereas another is ruled by chaos or even anarchy! This complexity means there’s always something new to learn about the Multiverse no matter what your field of interest may be (and if you find yourself bored with one subject then try looking into another).
