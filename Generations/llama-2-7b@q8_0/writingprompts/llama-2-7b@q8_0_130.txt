The time for the appointment is here and I’m still feeling nothing, nothing that is but a cold hard floor beneath my bare feet, my chest tight with anxiety and my breath shallow with fear. It’s 10:05am.
I walk into the room where he will be examining me, the man who knows me better than anyone else in the world. He is young, his face boyishly handsome, but I can tell there is no lightness behind those eyes and that beneath the kind words there are many thoughts and emotions. I’m sitting on the table now and he has started to do whatever it is that he does before we start with anything else, whatever it was that he had done last time.
I’ve been here a few times and while his touch on my body makes me feel vulnerable and exposed in an all too familiar way, I know him well enough by now not to be afraid of the examination itself. This is what we do.
“Everything alright?” he asks as he checks my weight again (I have been steadily losing this last few months) and moves on to examine the rest of me.
I nod yes, I’m ok. “So what happened this time?” He asks, his tone serious but with a hint of concern behind it.
I pause for a moment trying to think about how I can put what I want to say in words that will not scare him away or make him feel awkward and uncomfortable around me. It’s hard when I know how much he cares, how invested he is in my well being, and I have been here a few times before so I shouldn’t be this scared but I am.
“I don’t know really” I start to say then take another deep breath and continue “I thought it was something again, I didn’t even tell anyone about it because I didn’t want to get people worried if it wasn’t true.”
He nods and looks at me for a few more moments before he speaks. “What did you think it might be?” He asks.
“I don’t know” I say again, this time feeling my eyes getting wet with tears “It was something on the inside of my thigh, like a bump or something.”
He smiles and then sits down next to me on the table as he turns his head away for a few moments before speaking.
“You’re right, I shouldn’t be so blunt about it but you know how I am” He says with a chuckle “But what do you think it was?”
I try and force myself not to cry, knowing that if he sees me like this the appointment will end early and we won’t talk. There is too much for us to discuss.
“I don’t know” I say again, “it may have been nothing.”
He nods slowly before turning back to face me. His eyes are so kind and gentle that they almost hurt sometimes.
“Well let’s see what we can find out ok?” He says as he takes a few more things from his tray and begins to do some more examinations, this time of my legs. I watch him move down my left leg before he stops at the exact same place where I felt it last week on my thigh. I close my eyes for a moment, the memories too fresh but with something in them I have never had before, and try to not to think about what we might find there.
“I don’t know” He says again “it could be something, or nothing. If it is anything it would most likely be nothing serious so let’s see how things go.”
He goes on with his examinations as I lie there feeling so exposed and vulnerable that I don’t even feel safe enough to cry now. I can tell he has found the right spot though because suddenly my whole body shifts and a tiny voice in my head screams “OH NO!” My breath is caught somewhere between my throat and lungs as fear grips me again, but I say nothing at all.
“Well, it’s not there this time” He says with a smile and his hand pats my leg gently before he stands up again to continue his examinations on the rest of my body. There is no further discussion about what happened earlier and I am glad for that, not knowing what could possibly have come out of me or if anything at all.
It’s now 10:20am and the appointment has already lasted longer than it should have. He smiles again as he gets up to wash his hands. “How are you feeling?” He asks.
“Fine I guess” I say, my eyes downcast so he doesn’t see me crying. There is something that feels different this time though, and although my heart is pounding in fear for what it may be, there is also something else I can’t put into words.
He stands up with his hand still outstretched towards me as if offering to give me a hug but decides against it instead saying “well that was about as uneventful of an appointment as you could hope for. Let’s try and get you out of here in one piece shall we?”
I nod and sit up, moving my legs gingerly back and forth. There is something else there now though, some sort of discomfort but it has no pain so I can ignore it until later when I have more time to think about things. The examination was not as bad this week either, even without the other thing that happened earlier (which makes me feel a little guilty for making such a big deal out of nothing), and I’m sure that next time will be better than all of them combined.
“Well done” He says with his hand outstretched to shake mine “good luck until next week.”
I smile politely at him as he walks me back through the waiting room, making small talk about how busy things have been lately and when they might get a bit quieter again. I think for a moment before turning to face him one more time, “thanks doctor” I say with a big hug followed by an equally warm handshake.
“Anything at all” he says as we part ways, but it’s not until later that evening when I am alone in my bedroom, lying on the floor and staring up into space with nothing but darkness surrounding me that I realize what else there is to say.
