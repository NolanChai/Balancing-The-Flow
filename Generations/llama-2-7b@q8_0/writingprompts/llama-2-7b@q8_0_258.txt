 he table, Doc Puller of Pants sat stiffly in a metal folding chair. 
 ``The same as always.'' He looked downward. A pudgy hand lifted his chin and turned it up to look at Sneakerpants. The captain's eyes were bloodshot. He was drinking beer. It made him look like a lion who had eaten a few too many antelopes. ``Same as always.'' 
 Captain Sneakerpants sat back down with a grunt and an overfull glass of beer. The table creaked from the weight. He held up the bottle in salute to Doc Puller, who stared into the foamy head on the glass like he was looking at a great white shark about to swallow him whole. 
 ``You know I'm a big fan of yours, doc.'' 
 ``Thank you, Captain.'' 
 ``I mean it.'' He tapped the bottle on the table. ``Just one more and we're heading back down to the island.'' 
 Doc Puller smiled politely and said nothing. 
 ``You know I always liked the idea of the islands, doc,'' Sneakerpants went on. A cloud of beer vapor rose from the bottle in his hand, enveloping them both like a white-hot mist that left them ghostly for a moment before it dissipated. ``The way they've always been, you know? The way no one has touched 'em.'' 
 Doc Puller nodded solemnly and took another drink of his beer. Sneakerpants noticed the bottle was empty and began to reach for a new one on the table. He stopped short with a look at the doctor. 
 ``Oh, no. No more. You know how it is when you get older?'' Doc Puller's face flushed slightly as he spoke, which Sneakerpants knew meant he was lying. The captain's head tilted backward and his eyes slid to the ceiling of the bar in a look that said, _You don't want to know what I had last night_. 
 ``Anyway . . .'' Doc Puller's voice trailed off with a sigh. A second empty bottle sat on the table beside him. The captain poured himself another beer from a fresh one and held it out for Sneakerpants, who declined with an exasperated snort. ``We have to take care of our island friends now, you know?'' Doc Puller looked at his empty bottle with regret. He was clearly still feeling the effects of last night. ``It's what we do.'' 
 Sneakerpants leaned back in his chair and ran a hand through his thick black hair. The bottles on the table rocked gently, like the boat he had been aboard earlier that day. They had sailed out of town to a desert island not far away where they had been keeping two people hostage for years: a man named Eight and a woman named Seven. 
 ``So what are you saying? We don't have them anymore?'' 
 Doc Puller shook his head. He was still looking at the empty bottle he held, as if it were holding something other than beer in it. ``No, no. They're alive and well. As far as I know.'' His face brightened with a smile. The captain was about to ask how Doc Puller knew this when his expression fell again. He looked around the table and shrugged. 
 ``It's just that . . . we don't have them anymore, Captain. Not in this way.'' 
 Sneakerpants's face darkened as he reached for another beer. It was not the first time Doc Puller had told him something like this. He was always telling him about how his methods had changed and how things were different now that they were no longer just trying to keep the islanders safe from people who wanted them dead. 
 ``So you don't have 'em?'' Sneakerpants's voice grew louder as he spoke. It was clear he wasn't happy with this information, and it was also clear that Doc Puller had said exactly what the captain wanted to hear: _We don't have them anymore_. 
 ``I can't say for sure . . .'' Doc Puller took a long sip from his beer. He let out a quiet moan of pleasure and then put down the bottle. His hands were shaking slightly as he spoke. 
 ``You see, Captain, it's been years since anyone has come looking for them. Years!'' There was a hint of anger in his voice now. It made Sneakerpants uneasy because Doc Puller always seemed to hate it when people wanted what they had taken from him. He hated to lose control over their lives, even if he claimed not to care about the islanders anymore. 
 ``I can't say for sure what we do with them anymore. I mean . . .'' His voice trailed off and he looked down at the table. Sneakerpants felt a chill run up his back. He had never seen Doc Puller so nervous, which meant something must be wrong. 
 ``I can't say for sure what we do with them anymore . . .'' Doc Puller stared into space as if he was thinking about the past and how things used to be different. ``But I know that they're still alive and well on our island.'' His voice cracked like an old branch in a storm. 
 Sneakerpants looked at his empty bottle for a moment, then lifted it back up to his lips again. He drank deeply and felt the cold liquid burn his throat as he swallowed. When he finished he set down the glass with a clunk and let out a sigh. ``Okay, doc,'' he said in a voice that was more of an order than a question. 
 Doc Puller nodded, then reached for another bottle from the case on the table. As Sneakerpants watched, he poured himself a generous portion and took a long drink, his eyes closing in pleasure as he swallowed. When he opened them again, there was a look of sadness in them that made Sneakerpants feel bad for him. 
 ``I just thought I should tell you,'' Doc Puller said with an unsteady voice. ``So that if we find out they're gone . . . you know what to do.'' There was a long silence between them as the captain finished his beer and then reached for another one. 
 ``I can take care of myself, doc.'' He looked at Doc Puller with a smile that said he knew there was nothing anyone could do to hurt him. ``I've been doing this since I was eleven years old!'' The look on his face was pure determination. 
 Doc Puller smiled and shook his head. ``You're still only twelve, Captain.'' He pointed at the empty glass in front of Sneakerpants. ``It doesn't take much to get you drunk nowadays, does it?'' There was a long pause as they stared each other down. 
 ``You should know that by now!'' The captain slammed his palm on the table and drained the bottle in one swallow. He held up the glass with an expression of disgust as if he had just finished drinking from a toilet. ``I'll see you tomorrow, doc.'' He got up to leave. 
 Doc Puller stood also, his face still flushed from the beer. They shook hands and Sneakerpants headed for the door. He stepped out into the cool night air and looked back at the bar where Doc Puller was standing. There was a look of concern on the doctor's face as he stared after him. 
 ``So you're really going to kill that woman?'' The captain asked this question while still looking at Doc Puller, his hands in his pockets and his head bent forward slightly so it looked like he was trying to peek around a corner without being seen doing it. 
 Doc Puller looked away from him and shook his head slowly. ``I'm not sure what I'll do if we find her gone . . . but yes, that woman is going to die by my hand!'' He looked back at Sneakerpants as if he were a dog he was about to put down for eating the neighbor's cat. 
 ``I don't know what you are thinking, Captain, but she doesn't belong here anymore. If we don't kill her soon then I might have no choice but to give her back to the other one!'' Sneakerpants looked down at his feet as if they were about to touch something disgusting on the floor of the bar. ``She's a maniac, doc. She has to die!'' 
 Doc Puller's face grew dark with anger. He took another drink from his bottle and swallowed it in one gulp as if it were poison. Then he poured himself another one and stared at S
