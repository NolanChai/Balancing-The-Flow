 The world below me is nothing more than ants; they scurry around to each other and work together to build their nests, while I sit above them in peace.
I can’t wait for my meeting with the President. My plan will change this world forever and he doesn’t even know it yet. The way that I have orchestrated this will ensure that he is on my side and does what I ask without question. All of humanity will be mine soon enough.
I’m sure that he will like how the conversation begins; a simple, “Hi Mr. President” from me to him. He will think it is flattering that I would remember his name even though we have only met once before. I am very good at this game of humanity. It is just so fun and easy to manipulate these animals into believing anything you want them to believe.
As he continues with his question, “How can you possibly help me? How do you expect me to trust you?” my mind races ahead to the plan I have devised. My words come out in perfect sincerity: “I know how to get things done.” He will fall for this ploy immediately because there is nothing that he wants more than to get some things done.
As soon as those words are out of my mouth, we can start our game. I am sure that he will continue the conversation and tell me how much work needs to be accomplished and how much it is costing him financially every single day. This will give me time to build up my confidence before revealing what my true plan is.
“Well Mr. President, I think that you need a little help.” His eyebrows go up as he looks at me with skepticism, “Really?” he asks sarcastically, “Help? Why would I ever need any help from someone like you?” I just laugh and say, “It’s okay, Mr. President, don’t be scared of me.” His face turns red.
I know that if I can get him to laugh at this point, he will let his guard down because he is not expecting what comes next. So I keep laughing as loudly and sincerely as possible so he knows how serious it all really is. He begins laughing too; both of us are now in hysterics. It’s perfect timing for me to drop the bombshell that will change everything forever: “I know that you need my help, Mr. President.”
He stops laughing immediately and turns back around toward his desk as if nothing had just happened at all. His face is serious now. He begins talking about how much time he has been spending trying to figure out why things are so complicated in this country lately; it’s because of me, but I don’t tell him yet. Instead, my voice goes quiet and calm as I say, “Mr. President, what if we could make everything better?”
He turns back around at the mention of making everything better. This time he looks hopeful rather than skeptical or afraid like before when he thought that I might be out to harm him somehow. We stare at each other for a few minutes in silence and then he says, “You’re right Mr. President, this is not something that we should just sit on.”
I nod my head because this was what I wanted him to do all along; show his hand without realizing it first so now I can see exactly how he will react before even revealing my true plan yet again: “Yes sir,” he says firmly, “we need to get started right away!” We both turn back around toward the window and look out at our city below us.
There is no one else in this building anymore; everything has been cleared for privacy while we discuss how best to change everything forever together. I am ready now because my plan is set and all of humanity will be mine soon enough.
