ed and I had to find other accommodations.
The closest motel room would be a long ride through a valley at 6 am. Sounded easy enough, so I took off with a full tank of gas. About halfway there it dawned on me that I forgot about my bike seat bag. A quick U-turn and I was back in the city.
Inside the room I laid everything out as well as I could. The toiletry bottles, my computer, my clothes, the camera gear and the 15 lb bag of rice. Everything except for one thing, a very important piece of equipment that made my trip possible - My bike seat!
In the morning, I had no choice but to ride on my ass. Not fun at all. But, after two weeks on the road, I was determined to get back on my bike again.
After breakfast, I went downstairs and asked if there were any motels in town that would allow me to park my bicycle in their lobby during the daytime. Yes! I got lucky. The manager allowed me to leave my bike outside his business for a week, while he checked with the other establishments in town.
The next few days were spent walking around town and finding food. It wasn't easy, but the locals always offered help. By the third day, I was on my way out of town.
I reached the bottom of the pass at 3 am. Ahead was a long straight road to my destination for the evening. As the sun rose it began to rain. This is where things got interesting and what caused me to write this post about "Rainy Days".
About five miles ahead, I could see a group of people huddled under an overhang, in front of a building that was being renovated. A few minutes later as I passed them by I saw they were sitting on top of bicycles and riding to work everyday. It began to dawn on me that the rain wasn't just from a passing shower but a downpour.
When it comes to weather, I am not one to complain about how it effects my plans or my trip. But this time I was soaked! Everything in sight was dripping wet including my camera equipment. A few miles later and the rain began to let up. Soon after that is when I ran into a cyclist from the previous town who asked if he could camp out with me for the night. It took about ten minutes of convincing him, but soon we were on our way back to town where the motel owner had given us permission to sleep in his lobby.
After a nice warm shower, I got on my bike and set off for the next town. The weather was better than when I left earlier that morning. It even stopped raining by the time I reached the outskirts of the city. As I made my way through town, I began to notice other cyclists who were riding their bicycles in the rain as well.
A few miles ahead there was a bridge and from it I could see all the cars on the road. They were being splashed with puddles of water while they drove through what seemed like a monsoon.
I had made up my mind by then, that these rainy days would be nothing but fun!
