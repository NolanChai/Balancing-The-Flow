 time in this life; the universe, the void, and everything that surrounds them.
I can almost touch it, if only I could reach out with my mind and grab hold of it...
This is my first attempt at writing a novel in English. My previous attempts were nothing more than short stories but there was something about this one that made me want to keep going and not stop until the story had been told in full. I hope you like the result; if not, feel free to leave a review so i can make it better.

*The End...?*
