 He had been dreaming again. Todd had a recurring dream. A dream where a dark man in black stood atop his bed and with a blade he sliced into Todd's arm. As blood dripped down Todd's arm, the man stared into him. The man's eyes were blank. They glowed like they contained a light that was not of this world.
 
 Todd screamed and woke from his dream with a start. He blinked at his surroundings as he sat up. A bright ray of sunlight penetrated through the bedroom window. It illuminated the walls in soft golden hues. He stared at it for what seemed like hours before finally coming to his senses and noticing that this was no ordinary room, but rather a prison cell.
 
 -- *The man looked down upon Todd from above, as if he were looking down into an abyss* 
 
 The memory of his dream flooded his thoughts. He had been dreaming the same thing for years now. For all his life in fact. Whenever he slept this dark man appeared to him and cut into his arm with a blade, leaving behind only a scar and a stench.
 
 Todd rubbed at his eyes. "No more," he thought. No more of that dream again. He had been plagued by it since he was fourteen years old, but now he knew the cause of his dreams. Now he knew what to do. The dark man in black was here because he needed to die.
 
 Todd stood up and began walking about his small cell. His feet thudded on the cement floor and he stumbled forward as a large shadow passed through the bars on the window. A man, wearing only his underwear, walked past his cell and out of sight. He stopped at the next cell where two men were arguing loudly about their food rations. Todd heard one say "God damnit!" as he slammed his fist into a brick wall.
 
 -- *Todd screamed at the top of his lungs* 
 
 Todd stood in shock and stared at them. The two men looked up, surprised to see him standing there. Todd turned away quickly and made his way back to his bed. He sat down next to it with a sigh. "So this is my new life now," he thought. He had been sentenced to death for murdering his wife, Sarah, who died from blood loss after Todd stabbed her in the chest with a kitchen knife.
 
 The court of law found him guilty and sentenced him to die by lethal injection. His execution was scheduled for three days from now. He had been incarcerated in prison awaiting his sentence, which would be carried out when he turned eighteen years old. However, due to the state's newest law, he could be executed earlier than that if certain conditions were met. Todd did not care about such a law however because he knew it was unjust and wrong.
 
 -- *He had always thought of his life as being somewhat meaningless* 
 
 Todd reclined back against the bed and stared at the ceiling, wondering how long until night time came and his dreams returned to haunt him once more. His heart pounded in his chest from fear. He had been afraid all day and he was still not used to this new way of life that he would be living for many years yet.
 
 -- *The man looked down at Todd with eyes like no one else's, as if they held a light so dark it could never escape* 
 
 Todd closed his eyes and imagined what lay ahead for him when the morning sun rose again in three days time. He would be led out of this cell to another area where he would sit on a small wooden bench while several men strapped him down, fastening leather restraints around his wrists, ankles, chest and head. One of them would then inject him with poison from a syringe filled with enough chemicals that it could kill any normal person in less than twenty minutes.
 
 -- *As the man gazed into Todd's eyes he saw only emptiness and darkness within them* 
 
 However, these men were not going to be using poison on him because they would use a new type of chemical called "Hypodermic Solution". This solution had been developed by the government so that they could execute prisoners without any difficulty. The lethal injection method was much easier than hanging or shooting people because there were no messy procedures involved with it at all.
 
 -- *Todd would never see daylight again and neither would he ever experience peace* 
 
 Todd sat on his bed, trying to find some sort of peace within himself as the sun set outside and darkness began to fall upon everything around him once more. He had been living in prison for three years now and it had already taken its toll upon him mentally and emotionally.
 
 -- *Todd's eyes opened wide with fear as he heard the sound of a door being unlocked* 
 
 Todd turned his head towards the sound that was coming from downstairs, where several prison guards had entered into the cell block area to begin their shift for the night. The guard's voices were muffled by distance and it took him a few moments before he realized what they were saying. Then all of sudden, Todd felt an enormous amount of fear overtake him as he heard one of them say "I don't care if it means getting fired or not! We have got to kill this man."
 
 -- *He had seen the darkness in their eyes and knew that they meant business* 
 
 Todd stared at them for a moment before turning away from them again, trying hard to calm himself down by breathing deeply through his nose while keeping his hands clenched together tightly on top of each other. He knew these guards wanted him dead but he also knew that there was nothing anyone could do about it because the law had already spoken its final judgment upon him.
 
 -- *The man walked up to Todd and grabbed his arm, pulling him out into a small room where others were waiting for them* 
 
 Todd felt an overwhelming sense of fear as he was led through various rooms until finally reaching one that resembled a cell block. It had been designed specifically with bars on the outside to keep prisoners from escaping but even still, it seemed too small and cramped for anyone's liking.
 
 -- *As they approached their destination Todd began sweating profusely* 
 
 The men continued walking through this maze of cells until finally coming across one that was empty except for a wooden table with chairs around it, as well as another set of bars on the outside wall. This room was much larger than any other in here but still too small for comfort.
 
 -- *Todd realized why they had brought him here* 
 
 The guards began talking amongst themselves before finally turning away from Todd and facing one another instead. They both looked at each other with blank stares on their faces before saying something quietly under their breaths which seemed like they were making some sort of decision about how to handle this situation without being overheard by others around them.
 
 -- *Todd couldn't believe what he was seeing* 
 
 They then began talking in whispers as if they had already decided on something that would happen later but wanted it kept secret from everyone else inside these walls. Todd stood there for a moment, watching everything unfold before finally breaking into tears and falling down onto the ground beside his chair while sobbing uncontrollably at how unfair life could be sometimes.
 
 -- *The dark man looked down upon him with eyes that were full of empathy* 
 
 Todd sat there on the floor for several minutes, crying and wiping away tears from his face. Eventually he stood up again but this time around he was no longer scared or sad about what had happened earlier today because now he knew exactly why these men wanted him dead so badly. It wasn't just out of hatred anymore though--it seemed like they cared for him too somehow which made things even worse in a way.
 
 -- *Todd walked towards one of the chairs and sat down as if nothing had ever happened between himself and these people* 
 
 Todd thought about what would happen next when nightfall finally came upon them all once more--he imagined that he might be able to sleep better tonight but even still, knowing how close death was made it hard for him not only fall asleep but also stay there after waking up during some part of the night again.
 
 -- *The man walked over towards Todd and reached out his hand* 
 
 He watched as the dark-haired guard took hold of his arm and pulled him back onto the floor where they were sitting before leaning down close enough to whisper into Todds ears "Don't worry about what will happen here tonight--just concentrate on getting some rest." The guard then stood up again, patted his shoulder one last time before walking away.
 
 -- *Todd felt a strange feeling wash over him* 
 
 He st
