athen goddess who bore me. It has been said that she gave her own blood to birth me. I am one with the gods now, no longer bound by such trivial matters as names.
The last time the humans called us together in this fashion was during Ragnarok. There will be no new sunrise for me. If you see a blue-green haze settle over my form after death it is only the reflection of Odin's eye upon me. I am not afraid of you, human. I have never been. You cannot harm us.
The others are more concerned with this reappearance. We have been told to gather on a single day, and so we do. You will see. If there is no new dawn it has nothing to do with us. If the gods wish to keep their promises they will come forth themselves and tell you that Ragnarok has begun.
Your deaths mean little to us. It would be more interesting if you stayed alive until this day, but I have never been one for idle curiosity. I am only here because my brother's mate insisted it was a sign of her faith. He would not have allowed it otherwise.
It has been too long since we fought together as equals. Your world is so much more interesting than mine and I have grown bored with this place. That said, if you are a brave human warrior you may be given the honor of being one of my companions for eternity in Valhalla.
I am Hildr and I will slay you for Odin's sake.
