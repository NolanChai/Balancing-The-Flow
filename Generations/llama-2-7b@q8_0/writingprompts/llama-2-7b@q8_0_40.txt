3D-reality's flat images of a sky that looked as though it had been painted on, and then, when he thought about it, that was exactly what had happened, the olden days. But when had they lived in a world where the sky remained blue?
The last time, so very many years ago, before the war against the aliens began. He was but an infant at the time; he knew that only from his grandfather's stories. It had been a terrible time for his people. Even as a child he could remember how his grandfather had told him with great pride about their victory in the war.
But then, he had thought to himself, it must have been even more terrible before the war than after. Why did his grandfather not talk of that period? He was but an infant then; surely there had been much worse. 
 But no! There were other periods when things had been bad and even worse afterwards. It seemed like a vicious circle to him, like the spiral of the Milky Way galaxy itself - darker, hotter, more dangerous - that he stared at in fascination every time he had occasion to look up into it.
What was the point of looking backwards? Surely there must be something better to do? 
Gyyshk was just about to get off his chair and leave this room with all its unpleasant memories, when a sudden bolt of lightning tore through the dark sky outside, followed by thunder. It made him jump up in surprise!
How long had he been sitting there? Had he slept away the whole afternoon? 
But no! It was evening now; he could see that from the flat images on the screen: the sun had gone down and night was falling. He could hear his son, who was trying to make the computer respond to commands in a different language than his own, speaking softly to it so as not to disturb his grandfather's nap.
Gyyshk could feel the pain in his back where he sat; but then he would always be old and infirm now that there were no more wars left for him to fight. He was sorry about this, of course, but perhaps it was better like that. 
The war had been too long and hard fought; people should live their lives as they pleased without fear of being dragged off into a battle that might have nothing to do with them. In fact he was proud of how his grandfather's people had adapted after the war, when they found out that there were no more aliens left to fight.
It had been a bitter time; many had died of hunger or sickness in those terrible years before the aliens disappeared for good. But now everyone could live as he liked and still get everything he needed. Gyyshk could remember the old days, when they had all lived together in one huge house that seemed to stretch up forever into the sky and down into the earth; he remembered how there had been no time then either to sleep or rest, always having to work for their food and their lives. But now, life was peaceful and quiet, like this room with its soft colours and soothing pictures of beautiful scenes.
Gyyshk felt his old body trembling as if it wanted to let go of its mortal coil once and for all; but there were many things yet left unfinished, he could feel that in his bones: his son had not yet married a suitable wife, though they had been looking at pictures of prospective brides ever since Gyyshk could remember. And then there was the matter of what to do with this room; it had been his grandfather's bedroom all these years and he was sad that he would no longer be able to sleep in it himself, for now that he was old and weakened by age, it was too hard a task even for him.
His son would have to find another place for their father-in-law; Gyyshk knew this, but at the moment his thoughts were more on the future than on the past - or so he thought, until suddenly there was the sound of a voice calling out: 
 "Gyyshk! Grandfather!"
Gyyshk looked up. His son had come into the room; the old man saw that his eyes were wet with tears and there was a strange expression in them. But what was it? Sadness, confusion, pain? Gyyshk could not say for sure; he felt tired and weary now after all these years of fighting wars against aliens. Perhaps he would take a nap - just one little one - while his son took care of the old man who had always been so kind to him. 
Gyyshk closed his eyes as he heard his grandson say in a trembling voice: "We've found her, Grandfather."
And then there came another sound; it was like thunder, but very loud and close by...
