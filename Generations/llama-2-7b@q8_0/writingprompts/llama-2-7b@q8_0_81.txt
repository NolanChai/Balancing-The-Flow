 go again, I thought – it’s all about me!
When we played games with the animals, I was usually the donkey. Donkeys are stubborn and hard to train, but they do have a sense of humor (it’s difficult to make them laugh). That was the part that appealed to me most.
There’s an old saying: You can lead a horse to water… you cannot make him drink. Well, it is easier with donkeys! The donkey will drink if he wants to drink and not otherwise. He will go his own way, but only if he wants to do so. There are also stories that tell about the donkey who was trained to ride, but when he saw a pond of water, instead of crossing it, he turned around and returned home.
It’s hard to understand people who complain all the time. It is not only boring; it is also pointless! It doesn’t get you anywhere. I believe that in every one of us there is a stubborn donkey. This can be for good or bad. However, there are many situations when we would prefer to see this character in ourselves rather than in others.
It isn’t easy to make someone laugh if he doesn’t want to do so. That applies even more with grown-ups. I once worked as a waiter at a restaurant for foreign tourists. One of the most frequent orders was an omelet, which is not considered a delicacy in Israel. The customers liked it because they thought it was easy to eat and digest, so it would be good to start a meal with it. I didn’t know what to do when I saw them coming back with the empty plate without having eaten anything else. It was easier to smile and give them another omelet than to have to deal with complaints.
There are things that happen in life which we cannot change, but there are many things that depend on us. Our attitude towards life has a big impact on how our lives will be. If we learn not to be offended by what other people do or say (and sometimes even when they don’t), we can make the most of our lives. I prefer to see in myself the stubborn donkey who is unwilling to drink from ponds that he has no use for, rather than someone else.
