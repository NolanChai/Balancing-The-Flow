 ngs to get me through my weekend so I went.
I didn ’ t believe in love at first sight, well not anymore I guess after a year and three months of dating my boyfriend but this place did it for me. There were beautiful roses everywhere and a cute little table with the cutest doily on top. I wanted to take the whole thing home just to look at it again tomorrow night.
Shelly walked up behind me and wrapped her arms around me, she was really pretty even in jeans and a t-shirt. Shelly had long blonde hair that reached down to about halfway between her shoulders and breasts. She was about 5 ’ 8″ and very thin, she didn ’ t have any tattoos but I could tell by the piercings that she had at least two others.
I didn ’ t know why I told Shelly everything about myself right away, it seemed like there were a million people in my life that I shouldn ’ t have told everything to and I wasn ’ t sure who I was going to tell her next. It just felt good talking to Shelly even if we had met only an hour ago.
The roses weren ’ t the only thing that caught me off guard, the place itself seemed to be from another era. There were no pictures on the walls, no windows and no modern technology anywhere, it was like being transported back in time about 50 years. The store was small but comfortable, the seats were very soft leather and the chairs all had matching doilies at their feet.
When I went to pay for my roses there was a small box with some business cards on top of it, I took one without thinking much about it and walked out of the door feeling good. After that the night seemed like it would last forever. I really didn ’ t want to go back home to face my own lonely existence but I knew I had to.
When I got into work the next morning everyone was talking about how great the wedding had been, they all asked me if I had anything to do with making it special and when I said yes they clapped and laughed at me like I was a hero. After a few minutes of that I walked away and went back to my office where I sat down to write another proposal for another big client who didn ’ t even know what their real needs were but had enough money to hire me so it didn ’ t matter.
The day dragged on until lunchtime when one of the secretaries came into my office with a business card from the rose place I had visited last night. It was addressed to me and inside her note said, ” thanks for your business last night, hope you enjoyed yourself as much as I did.” She left without saying anything else so I put down my pen, closed my laptop and walked out into the hallway.
I really wanted to call Shelly back but something in me held back, was it because I didn ’ t know what I would say or maybe it was fear? Whatever it was I went home after lunch instead of calling her. The next day things were normal at work again and my office wasn ’ t being decorated anymore which made me feel a little better.
When I got into the rose shop that night, there were two dozen roses in a big glass vase sitting on the table for me to take home with me. They all had different meanings but one of them really stood out from the rest of them. It was a red rose with a special note attached saying ” thanks again for last night, hope we can do it again soon.” I felt good about going home that night and falling asleep in my bed without worrying about anything at all.
The next day when I went to work there was another business card on top of my desk; this time it said: ” thank you so much for last night, I can ’ t wait until tonight.” When I opened the door to leave work that afternoon Shelly had a bouquet of roses waiting for me and they were all red with no meanings. I walked into the elevator alone because she had gone back upstairs to get something before we left together but when I reached my floor it was dark and empty, she wasn ’ t there anymore.
When I got home later that night there was another card waiting for me on top of my desk; this time it said: ” thanks so much for last night! You are a great guy and I can ’ t wait to see you again soon.” But when I woke up the next morning something felt different about my life, maybe it had always been that way but now I knew what it was.
It turns out Shelly had left me an envelope full of money with a note saying ” here are some things you might need to take care of yourself until our next date.” She also sent me another bouquet of roses and this time they were all white. When I opened them up, each one was different from the others; there was even one with no stem at all!
When I got home later that night there was a card on top of my desk again saying: ” thanks for last night, see you tonight!” And when I woke up the next morning something felt very wrong about life.
I knew it would be different but I didn ’ t think it would have been so hard to leave her; she was all I thought about and even though we had never really talked about our relationship before now I couldn ’ t help feeling sad.
