 That's just hormones. 
 There's more to it than this, 
 It's gotta be better than this... '' 
 
 `` We need to talk about you! 
 What's wrong? 
 You look like a stranger.'' 
 
 `` I want to play the game again.'' 
 
 `` The game is over now, baby. It's all been taken from us.'' 
 
 `` So I'm not good enough for your friends... or even you? I have no reason to stay. '' 
 
 `` I just wanna know what it feels like to be free.'' 
 
 `` You are the best friend I ever had. Don't leave me! Please, don't leave me alone here in this dark place!'' 
 
 `` You're all going to die. There is no escaping it. This is where we go when the time comes. It's just that for most of us... it takes a long time to get there.'' 
 
 `` Why don't you let me take care of your friends? I'll bring them back in one piece.'' 
 
 `` No. You will not use me, or anyone else! We all have the right to make our own decisions without outside influence.'' 
 
 `` I won't be here forever... but neither will you.'' 
 
 `` I'm just like my father... he's a god.'' 
 
 `` It was just some game we made up, nothing serious. You need to get over it and move on!'' 
 
 `` That wasn't me, I promise! It's not what you think.'' 
 
 `` Don't let him control you. He wants to own everything he creates - including people like us...'' 
 
 `` We are the chosen ones who will bring about a new era for this world.'' 
 
 `` I don't believe in any of that stuff! You should stop talking to her, it isn't healthy.'' 
 
 `` You should have been stronger.'' 
 
 `` That's not how the game is played.'' 
 
 `` No more running from him; no more hiding from me. We need each other now - don't we?'' 
 
 `` Don't you ever call me again! You can never find us here, and I don't want to see your face ever again!'' 
 
 `` Don't listen to them! They want to control what happens in this world... but it doesn't have to be that way. We are the ones who make our own decisions, not them!'' 
 
 `` You can't blame me for your mistakes anymore. It wasn't my fault - I never said it was!'' 
 
 `` Don't trust him; he doesn't have our best interests at heart.'' 
 
 `` This is just a game, nothing more than that. If you want to win, you must do whatever it takes to defeat your enemies. That means killing them and taking their possessions!'' 
 
 `` He thinks the world belongs to him - but it doesn't! I will not let anyone control my life or tell me what's right or wrong without being asked first!'' 
 
 `` We don't belong here! We have nothing in common with these people... so why should we listen to them?'' 
 
 `` You can't stop me from loving you.'' 
 
 `` You can't make me hate myself; I am strong enough for that!'' 
 
 `` It was just a game, but it became much more than that... now we need to figure out what comes next before everything goes wrong again.'' 
 
 `` Don't listen to him! He wants control over everything - and he doesn't care who dies in order for him to get there!'' 
 
 `` You should know better by now; this isn't real love. It never was, so let go before something terrible happens!'' 
 
 `` I don't want you anymore!'' 
 
 `` Don't make me do this! It's not fair that I have to kill people who only care about themselves... but if they won't stop taking our possessions, then someone needs to pay the price!'' 
 
 `` If we can't be together, then let us go our separate ways and never see each other again.'' 
 
 `` I won't allow anyone else to tell me what's right or wrong with my life. Not even you... so don't try it!'' 
 
 `` We have nothing in common anymore - but that doesn't mean we can't still be friends!'' 
 
 `` He thinks he has control over everything, but there are forces stronger than any of us. Let go and trust that they will guide you through this mess...'' 
 
 `` You're not good enough for me anymore; it's time to move on.'' 
 
 `` I don't care what happens here! All I know is that if we can find each other again, then maybe everything will be okay... but until then? Just let go and trust the universe.'' 
 
 `` We are not enemies, nor do I wish to harm anyone - but if they continue taking our possessions without asking first, someone must pay the price!'' 
 
 `` I don't want to talk about it... please just leave me alone!'' 
 
 `` Don't touch me. It makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe when people do that - but if you must know what happened? My father killed my mother with a gun, then left me to die in the woods because he thought I was worthless. I will never forget how it felt for him to look at me like nothing more than garbage...'' 
 
 `` He thinks we belong together; that's why they stole us from our homes and brought us here without permission! If anyone wants anything from either one of us, then let them come ask first before taking what doesn't belong to them.'' 
 
 `` I won't let him control my life anymore! It was just a game until we decided otherwise - now it's time for change so that nothing like this ever happens again...'' 
 
 `` He thinks he has the right to tell us what to do because of who we are. Well, I am not going down without a fight; if anyone wants anything from either one of us, then let them come ask first before taking what doesn't belong to them!'' 
 
 `` Let go of me! I won't allow you to control my life or tell me what's right or wrong anymore - not now that we both know how things really work around here...'' 
 
 `` We can do this together, but if they continue taking our possessions without asking first? Then someone will have to pay the price... '' 
 
 `` He thinks he has control over everything; it doesn't matter who you are or where in life we find ourselves - because he believes that everyone must be subservient to his will. Well, I am not going down without a fight; if anyone wants anything from either one of us let them come ask first before taking what does not belong!'' 
 
 `` Don't touch me... it makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe when people do that - but if you must know? My father killed my mother with a gun, then left me to die in the woods because he thought I was worthless. He looked at me like nothing more than garbage...'' 
 
 `` If we can't be together, then let us go our separate ways and never see each other again - but if anyone wants anything from either one of us? Let them come ask first before taking what does not belong to them!'' 
 
 `` I don't want you anymore! You have nothing in common with me anymore... but if we can find each other again, maybe everything will be okay... '' 
 
 `` Let go and trust the universe - just like your father said! It doesn't matter what happens here today; all that matters now is finding peace within ourselves before moving on to something new.'' 
 
 `` We are not enemies; we mustn't let them control our lives or tell us what's right and wrong anymore... '' 
 
 `` I don't want you! You have nothing in common with me, so why can't we just go our separate ways and never see each other again? But if anyone wants anything from either one of us? Let them come ask first before taking what doesn't belong to them... '' 
 
 `` He thinks he has control over everything - but there are forces stronger than any of us that will guide us through this mess, so don't worry about it!'' 
 
 `` If we can find each other again, then maybe everything will be okay. We have nothing in common anymore; all I know is that if we can just stay together... '' 
 
 `` Let go and trust the universe - but until then? Just let go and trust that they will guide you through this mess...''
