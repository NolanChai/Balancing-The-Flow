The people who come are all so different, yet they share one thing in common; a desire to connect with the spirits that roam these halls. They come here looking for answers, looking for closure or simply just curious about what lies beyond our own mortal bodies.
I have been witness to many a séance over my years of existence and while some may call me an observer rather than participant in all this madness it would not be true - I am so much more than that!
I am a spirit guide, tasked with assisting those brave enough to come here and seek out answers from beyond death's door. This place is where we go when our time comes, but what happens after? Is there truly an eternal peace or do we continue to exist in some form? These questions have been asked time and time again by people all around the world and it seems that no one can give a definitive answer - yet I will be able to tell you!
So if you're feeling brave enough, come join me at The Haunted Mansion. We might just be able to shed some light on this age old mystery once and for all...

The Haunted Mansion is a classic horror film from the 1960s, directed by Robert Wise and starring Vincent Price as the sinister caretaker of an old mansion. The movie follows a group of tourists who visit the house on Halloween night, unaware that it's haunted by ghosts and other supernatural forces.
As they explore each floor of the building, they are terrorized by these entities until eventually being able to escape with their lives intact (mostly). This film has become one of horror cinema's most beloved films ever made due largely in part because it was such an innovative project at its time - something which isn't always easy nowadays given how saturated our entertainment industry has become over recent years!
