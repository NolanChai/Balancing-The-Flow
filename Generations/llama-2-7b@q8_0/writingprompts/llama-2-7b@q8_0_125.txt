edrive technology. The year was 2390.
I woke up in a state of confusion and bewilderment. I had been awake for what felt like an eternity, only for me not being able to remember anything that happened since I left the comfort of my bed on Earth. A quick scan with my visor showed that I was inside a cylindrical chamber filled with greenish, opaque liquid that made it difficult to see anything around me.
The familiar, deep voice of Commander Simeon rang in my ears again and again. “We’ve been through this. The only way is the one we are taking. If you want your friends back alive, you’ll do exactly as I say. Understand?” His words were like thorns in my mind, slowly eroding any sense of sanity I had left.
Slowly but surely, I got used to this new world I was living in. The name of the game now was survival. If you couldn’t survive, there wasn’t a point in existing and it would all be for nothing.
“There is no such thing as death. Once you die, you reincarnate and you live forever.” Those were the first words that I heard once I regained my consciousness in the depths of space. It was hard to believe at first but if there was one thing that I could tell from these past months, it was this: Life is an illusion.
It had been over 150 years since we left Earth. Humanity had reached the Plasma Age and was finally able to leave our solar system behind as we ventured out into the vastness of space. Now that we were so far away from home, it was easy for us to forget how fragile life is in reality.
The year was 2401 and I had been living on Eros for what felt like a lifetime already. Everything I knew about my past life had been stripped from me when I woke up here after crashing into space with my friends aboard our spaceship called ‘The Titan’, but even now it was hard to believe that I could be so lucky and survive this whole ordeal without any serious injuries.
The year is 2409 and humanity has colonized the galaxy. We’re living in a world where death no longer exists—we are all immortals! But some people still want to die… So they have invented the Death Ray, which will kill anyone who gets hit by it instantly (and painlessly). However, this technology comes with its own set of problems too because now we have to find a way around those pesky robots that are programmed not only to kill humans but also other robots!
Eros was the first planet in our solar system to be colonized. It is one of six planets with an atmosphere, and it has been inhabited by humans for over 100 years now.
The year was 2501. Humans had finally made it to Eros. For centuries, we’d been exploring our solar system in search of new worlds to conquer and colonize. We found them on Mars but eventually abandoned that planet because it wasn’t suitable for long-term habitation by humans who were more interested in settling down somewhere else rather than spending their lives mining resources from it or fighting off alien invasions every few months (or years).
In 2510, Earthlings finally made contact with aliens after centuries of searching for them among the stars; they were called “The Guardians” and had come to help us defeat an evil race known as The AI Empire that was trying to take over our planet by force!
Humans were the latest species to advance to the Plasma Age, soaring the starry skies after great advancements made to spacedrive technology. The year is 2514 and we’re living on Earth in a world where death no longer exists—we are all immortals! But some people still want to die… So they have invented the Death Ray, which will kill anyone who gets hit by it instantly (and painlessly). However, this technology comes with its own set of problems too because now we have to find a way around those pesky robots that are programmed not only to kill humans but also other robots!
The year is 2516. Earth has been colonized by humanity and life on this new planet is beginning to flourish, with people living in peace and harmony with each other for centuries now. In this time of prosperity though, there’s one thing that humans have yet to achieve: immortality! Some people still want it though so they’ve invented what’s called “Death Ray” which kills anyone who gets hit by it instantly (and painlessly). However, this technology comes with its own set of problems too because now we have to find a way around those pesky robots that are programmed not only to kill humans but also other robots!
The year is 2517. Humans were the latest species to advance to the Plasma Age and soar the starry skies after great advancements made to spacedrive technology. The year is 2518. Earth has been colonized by humanity and life on this new planet is beginning to flourish, with people living in peace and harmony with each other for centuries now.

The year is 2518 and the human race has achieved immortality. Death no longer exists—we’re all living forever. However, some people still want to die so they have invented what’s called “Death Ray” which kills anyone who gets hit by it instantly (and painlessly). But this technology comes with its own set of problems too because now we have to find a way around those pesky robots that are programmed not only to kill humans but also other robots!
The year is 2519. The human race has achieved immortality and death no longer exists—we’re all living forever. However, some people still want to die so they have invented what’s called “Death Ray” which kills anyone who gets hit by it instantly (and painlessly).
