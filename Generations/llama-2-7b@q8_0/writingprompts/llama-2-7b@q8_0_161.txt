 
 Through the pain I heard myself say, `` Where am I? '' 
 
 A voice answered: `` I am your body. You are lying in bed in an isolated room. Your mind is somewhere else, but you do not know where.'' 
 
 The pain hit again, and this time it was worse than before.
 
 I looked around. This time there were things to see.
 
 An IV hooked me up with a tube into the side of my arm. 
 
 Another tube went into my nose and disappeared under my gown.
 
 My gown had been ripped off somewhere downstream from here,
 
 So I felt naked as if exposed to an audience, but there was nobody around.
 
 The only sound was a faint whirring, and the only thing to see were my own eyelids.
 
 I remembered that it was supposed to hurt when they put you under, so maybe this is not so bad after all.
 
 What's going on? Where am I? It must have been a nightmare! 
 
 Then the pain hit me again and my mind screamed. 
 
 I was back in that room.
 
 The next few minutes passed like hours, each one of them agonizing. 
 
 The voice came back: `` Do you want to know what is wrong with you?''
 
`` What's wrong with me?! '' I screamed. 
 
 `` Yes...you are not supposed to be here, so they have decided to fix you up. They are doing that now.'' 
 
 `` What do you mean by "not supposed to be here?"'' I asked. 
 
`` Your mind is somewhere else. I do not know where because no one knows. Some say it is with the spirit, others say it is in another time and place. ''
 
 Then I thought: `` I am not dead!'' 
 
 My voice screamed again: `` What does "not supposed to be here" mean? Am I supposed to be somewhere else? Why don't they just fix me up so that my mind will stay where it is supposed to be? ''
 
 The voice replied, `` It is not their concern. They do not understand the situation.''
 
 Then something happened and my mind screamed again: 
 
 `` What was going on here?''
 
 The voice said, `` A few years ago your mind was somewhere else. You were dead. Somehow they brought you back to life, but when they did, there was an accident that injured your brain. So now it has separated from your body and does not know where it is supposed to be. That's why you are in this place of pain.''
 
 My voice screamed again: `` What do you mean by "separated"?''
 
 The answer came back, `` Your mind cannot find itself.'' 
 
 Then I thought: `` Where is my body? Did it go somewhere else? Am I going to be here for the rest of eternity without a body? What if they never fix me up and my spirit goes to Hell while my body stays here forever, tortured by pain? ''
 
 My mind screamed again. 
 
 The voice said: `` Do you want to know why it is like this for you?''
 
 `` I don't care! Just do something so that the pain stops and get on with my life! '' I thought.
 
 Then I realized what had just happened:
 
 My mind was thinking and my body was moving its lips. I was in a state of double awareness, divided between two realities. 
 
 Something strange was happening. The pain stopped but the voice did not. It spoke to me with my own voice as if it were a part of me. But there is more: My thoughts seemed to be coming from my mouth, and yet I knew that they had come from somewhere else because I was hearing them through my ears, which were in my head!
 
 My body felt warm again but now the pain is gone. There was something strange about this warmth too; it was not like feeling cool air blow on me and then turning hot as the sun rose and the day got warmer. No, the warmth was constant as if it were from within my own body. 
 
 Something else strange happened: I seemed to be able to move my head more freely than before, even though I did not feel any better. 
 
 The voice said, `` You are aware of a third reality because you are in a state of double awareness.'' 
 
 Then I remembered what had just happened and thought:
 
 My mind was thinking while my body spoke...this is crazy! Where am I?
 
 But the voice came back again, `` You have been unconscious for some time now, so you are not in your body.''
 
 Then another thing hit me: I realized that although there were things to see and hear all around me, there was still something missing.
 
 My mind thought: `` My eyes are closed!''
 
 Then the voice came back with my own words again: `` You are right. You cannot open your eyes because you are not in your body. ''
 
 This is crazy; I am seeing things around me but cannot see myself! Am I dead? What happened to my body? Where did it go? Why can't I find it or my mind?
 
 Then something else hit me, and I knew the truth:
 
 My voice screamed again. 
 
 ``Where am I?''
 
 The voice answered: `` You are in a place that exists somewhere between your body and spirit, which is where you used to be before you died. But since you came back to life they have been unable to find both of them at the same time so they cannot fix up what went wrong with them.'' 
 
 Then something else hit me again:
 
 My voice screamed.
 
 ``What about my body? Where is it? Did somebody steal it? Did they take my spirit to Hell? I don't know where either of them are, so how can you tell me anything more?''
 
 The voice said, `` You do not understand what we mean by "the spirit" or by "Hell". It is all in the way that you look at things.''
 
 Then something else hit me: I realized that there was no one around to hear my screams. But this time it did not hurt. In fact, it felt good!
 
 My body felt warm again; it must be because of what just happened. There was nothing but silence now and everything seemed to be cooler than before.
 
 I wondered: `` Did that last pain have something to do with the warmth in my body?'' 
 
 Then my mind thought:
 
 What about what the voice said? That sounds pretty crazy too!
 
 But the answer came back: `` You are right. You can look at it any way you want. I can only tell you how things really are, and if that seems crazy then maybe we have been miscommunicating all along.''
 
 Then something else hit me again:
 
 My voice screamed.
 
 ``What happened to the rest of my life? What about my future? Did I miss something important while I was dead? Is it too late to fix things up now that they have messed them up in the first place?'' 
 
 The voice said, `` No, nothing is too late for you. In fact, right now you are having your last moment of consciousness before being placed back into your body.''
 
 Then I knew:
 
 This must be death.
 
 My voice screamed again:
 
 ``What's going on here?! Why can't I wake up so that I don't have to go through this painful experience again? What kind of life is this, anyway?''
 
 The answer came back, `` If you were not dying then you would not be here. But if we fixed up what went wrong with your mind and spirit in the first place then maybe both parts could be together at the same time. So it must all seem crazy to us because that is how things really are for everyone else, including you.''
 
 Then something else hit me again:
 
 My voice screamed.
 
 ``What about what you said before? I thought the spirit was supposed to be with God or in Heaven and Hell is where bad people go? What do you mean by "really"? '' 
 
 The answer came back, `` You are right again because that's how things seem for everyone else. But it's not like that for us; we cannot see either the body or the spirit because we are a part of both of them. So when you are in this place between life and death then you become double-awareness so that your mind can experience reality as if you were dead, while at the same time it also has access to information from what is happening here with your body.''
 
 Then something else hit me again:
 
 My voice screamed.
 
 ``Is there anything more I need to know?
