 where it hurts to think straight? 
 
 Check. 
 
 Vision blurred, so bad I can't make out what's in front of me? 
 
 Check.
 
 Okay then. Must have been a migraine. 
 
 Not that big a deal. Should go away after a while. 
 
 If I just lay down and close my eyes for a little while, it'll probably clear up in about thirty minutes or so. 
 
 I've had worse.

# Chapter 10: Terror on the Fourth Floor
BRIGHT AND BLURRY, THE NEXT MORNING.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED last night. 
 
 But it was a bad migraine, I think. 
 
 Maybe I shouldn't have eaten that pizza? 
 
 But it tasted so good! 
 
 Anyway, now my head is throbbing again and there are these little dots of light in front of me. 
 
 And all the light in the world isn't going to make them go away.

# Chapter 11: The Washroom
WASHING MY FACE IN THE BATHROOM. 
 
 I can feel a headache starting. 
 
 Ow, ow. 
 
 So much pain in my head!

# Chapter 12: A Trip Down the Stairs
HOLD ON, HERE IT COMES—THE BAD SENSATION of imminent death by falling down the stairwell at school. 
 
 I'm about to pass out! 
 
 I must be very sick if I can't even stay on my feet long enough to walk down a flight of stairs!

# Chapter 13: A Dirty Look from Mr. Flynn
THERE HE IS, MR. FLYNN—the teacher who is making me late for class yet again! 
 
 I can feel him glaring at me as he walks toward my row and stops in front of the empty seat where I'm supposed to be sitting. 
 
 I try not to look up at Mr. Flynn, but it isn't easy.

# Chapter 14: An Interview with a Teacher
I HEAR MR. FLYNN SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT HOW I MUST BE VERY SICK IF I CAN'T MAKE IT TO MY SEAT BY THE END OF the passing period—and he's got some nerve, too! 
 
 He has no idea how much pain I'm in right now. 
 
 I can't even stay on my feet to walk down a flight of stairs!

# Chapter 15: A Pair of Lies
THIS IS SO HARD TO DO, but Mr. Flynn is watching me very closely, so I have no choice now but to lie to him. 
 
 The best thing to do under these circumstances is to pretend that nothing's wrong. 
 
 Pretending will help me keep my head down and not look at Mr. Flynn—it'll be better for everyone if he thinks I'm just a lazy, stupid kid who doesn't care about his education or anything else in the world for that matter!

# Chapter 16: A Visit to Mrs. McGee
"THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S PROBABLY A MIGRAINE." 
 
 "I WONDER IF YOU SHOULD BE SEEING AN OPTOMETRIST, TOO?" 
 
 "THAT WOULDN'T HURT. I JUST NEED SOME EYE EXAMS, IS ALL."

# Chapter 17: A Trip to the School Nurse
I FIND IT INCREDIBLY ODD that Mrs. McGee would have a problem with me seeing an optometrist—what is she so afraid of? 
 
 It can't be a migraine, because I think it was a migraine last night! 
 
 I don't understand what this is all about!

# Chapter 18: An Examination by the School Nurse
"MAYBE IT WAS THE PIZZA LAST NIGHT?" SHE SUGGESTS. "THE CHEESE MAY HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM—THAT'S WHAT I SAW IN YOUR FAMILY'S FILE." 
 
 "I HOPE IT WASN'T THE PIZZA THAT GOT YOU SICK, TOO. IF SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO GET A MIGRAINE, I WANT TO KNOW WHY!"

# Chapter 19: A Visit from the Principal
MR. CURTIS COMES INTO THE ROOM AND SITS DOWN ON MY DESK. 
 
 He looks very worried and nervous about something, but I can't imagine what it is! 
 
 Maybe I shouldn't have eaten that pizza?

# Chapter 20: A Bad Situation
"I AM SO SORRY TO HEAR OF YOUR FAMILY TRAGEDY," MR. CURTIS SAYS IN HIS OFFICIAL voice, "BUT I DO NOT SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE MATTER AT HAND—HOW IS IT RELATED?" 
 
 "I AM UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OF VIEW."

# Chapter 21: A Surprising Response
MR. CURTIS'S FACE TURNS RED IN ANGER—WHAT IS HE SO ANGRY ABOUT? 
 
 "HOW DARE YOU?" HE SAYS, LOOKING AT ME AS IF I AM THE ONE WHO HAS BROKEN THE LAW! 
 
 "I FIND YOUR INSULTS AND PERSONAL REMARKS DISGUSTING—IN FACT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EVEN HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING!" 
 
 Mr. Curtis looks so angry that he has to stand up just to be able to shout!

# Chapter 22: A Dangerous Situation
WHAT IS MR. CURTIS SO ANNOYED BY? 
 
 I can't understand what happened here, but it's obvious that Mr. Curtis is angry with me and wants nothing more than to make my life miserable!

# Chapter 23: A Paper Thrown in the Trash
MR. CURTIS STALKS OVER TO ME AND THROWS MY SCHOOLWORK ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIM—AND THEN HE WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM!

# Chapter 24: A Confusion of Schoolwork
WHAT DO I HAVE NOW? 
 
 Am I in trouble because my teacher doesn't like me or because he thinks it's a big deal that I was late for class again today? 
 
 I don't understand what happened here!

# Chapter 25: A Trip to the School Office
THE SCHOOL OFFICE IS AT THE END OF THE HALL. 
 
 The door is open and it looks like Mr. Flynn is inside talking with another teacher, so I'll just walk over there now and see what they are arguing about!

# Chapter 26: A Bad Mistake
AS I WALK INTO THE SCHOOL OFFICE TO CHECK OUT WHAT MR. FLYNN AND HIS FRIEND ARE SO UPSet about, I look up at the clock and see that it's almost time for my next class. 
 
 "I guess I better hurry," I tell myself as I walk away from Mr. Curtis's desk and start heading down the hallway toward my next classroom.

# Chapter 27: A Mysterious Teacher
MR. HARRISON IS THE NAME OF MY NEXT TEACHER—I REMEMBER THAT FROM LAST YEAR, BUT I FORGET WHICH SUBJECT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING RIGHT NOW? 
 
 Maybe he teaches math. 
 
 Or maybe he is a history teacher and we are supposed to be learning about the ancient Romans today!

# Chapter 28: A Hard Lesson
"I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY READING THE MATERIAL IN BOOKS," MR. HARRISON SAYS TO ME, "WITH ALL DUE RESPECT." 
 
 I'm not sure why he is talking to me like that—maybe because he thinks it would be better for me if
