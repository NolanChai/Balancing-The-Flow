der fashion than one would expect. There was something slightly off about it. Something that screamed "creepy." But that's how Leo DiCaprio has always been.
He was on stage at the Academy Awards accepting his Best Actor award for his portrayal of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street. It was a performance that garnered plenty of buzz, but wasn't the frontrunner, so why was he up there? Well it seems the Academy was really impressed by Leo DiCaprio's career thus far and decided to give him one last big win before he hung it all up.
The actor has been making movies since 1990 when he played the title role in This Boy's Life with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. He was so good, they made a sequel called... I don't even know what this is. Since then Leo DiCaprio has worked consistently and turned himself into one of Hollywood's biggest stars. His career has been on an upward trajectory for 25 years now and he hasn't slowed down yet.
But after The Wolf of Wall Street, I don't know that you could call him a working actor anymore. He's a star now. But that doesn't mean it was always the case.
Take a look at the films Leonardo DiCaprio was in before he hit it big:
Leonardo DiCaprio in Critters 3 (1991)
When I say "in," of course I mean that Leo DiCaprio is one of the guys who got to watch this movie and didn't actually have anything to do with it. The film was produced by Paramount, but it was distributed by New Line Cinema. In fact, it seems like DiCaprio never even heard about his role until he saw the trailer for it on TV and called the studio to ask how much he got paid (I'm guessing).
But still, that counts as a movie credit. So there you go!
Leonardo DiCaprio in The Quick and The Dead (1995)
It was only a small role in this Clint Eastwood Western, but it was a step up for Leo DiCaprio. At this point he'd already appeared on the sitcom Growing Pains twice as well as guest starring roles on The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Parenthood and Roseanne (the latter two I've only seen recently). He wasn't yet a big star but he was certainly starting to make his mark in Hollywood.
Leonardo DiCaprio in Total Eclipse (1995)
He didn't have much screen time here either, but the movie itself is pretty memorable for its depiction of the famous love affair between poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. It's also a lot shorter than I remembered it being. Still, Leo DiCaprio is there and he was clearly already a good actor at this point.
Leonardo DiCaprio in The Basketball Diaries (1995)
The film is based on a memoir about drug addiction by the same name by Jim Carroll who also wrote American Poet and the novel The Basketball Diaries, which was later adapted into an animated movie starring Shaquille O'Neal. It's hard to believe that Leo DiCaprio was only 21 when he made this film because it really feels like it could have been a career defining role for him. Instead though, the actor was already well on his way to becoming one of Hollywood's biggest stars by the time it came out.
Leonardo DiCaprio in Romeo + Juliet (1996)
The film is a modern take on William Shakespeare's classic play and features an ensemble cast including Claire Danes, John Leguizamo and Pete Postlethwaite. It was one of Leo DiCaprio's first starring roles in a major production, which he got thanks to his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? the year prior.
Leonardo DiCaprio in Marvin's Room (1996)
He's not really in this movie very much at all but it is an early example of Leonardo DiCaprio working with Robert De Niro, who he would go on to make many movies with in the years that followed. Also stars Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Hank Azaria.
Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic (1997)
The film is a historical fiction based on real events that took place during the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912 and has since become one of the biggest films ever made. It was directed by James Cameron who also wrote it alongside his wife Gale Anne Hurd, who were both nominated for Academy Awards. The film won three more Oscars including Best Picture which meant that Leo DiCaprio became an overnight star thanks to this movie alone.
Leonardo DiCaprio in Man in the Iron Mask (1998)
The film is a period drama based on one of Alexandre Dumas' famous novels. It also stars Jeremy Irons as King Louis XIV and John Malkovich as Cardinal Richelieu who are both seeking to unmask the true identity of Philippe, the young man played by DiCaprio (who also has a small role in The Aviator).
Leonardo DiCaprio in Celebrity (1998)
He plays Lee Simon, an actor who becomes obsessed with his ex-girlfriend after she has sex with one of her co-stars on set during filming for their next movie together. It's directed by Woody Allen and features appearances from Alan Alda, Winona Ryder and Breckin Meyer among others (including Jennifer Aniston).
Leonardo DiCaprio in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018)
He plays Toby, an American screenwriter who travels to Spain hoping to get the film adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes' classic novel done. It was directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliames as well as co-starring Antonio Banderas. The movie has been in development hell for more than 20 years but finally got released last year thanks to DiCaprio who financed most of it himself after failing multiple times at getting studio backing for the project (which makes me wonder why they didn't just give him money instead).
Leonardo DiCaprio was always going to be a star. It wasn't a question of whether he would make it or not, it was more so what kind of actor he would become and how many Oscar nominations would follow in his wake. He has been nominated for Best Actor 8 times before winning this one with The Revenant (2016) but that film wasn't really an "actor" movie so much as it was a character study piece about a man who gets lost in nature and must find his way back home again, which is why I think he won instead of Matt Damon for The Martian because at least there were some other characters to play off of.
I can't wait until we see what kind of movies Leonardo DiCaprio will make next after winning this award; maybe they'll be more like what I expect from him or maybe something completely different and unexpected!
