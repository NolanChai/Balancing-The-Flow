sed to be that every time a new memory was triggered it'd be like that, like stepping into some old, familiar world. Now though? No one else can see him or hear him, and those screens just sit there with their faded images of a past he's not even sure is still his anymore.
 
 
 The little glowing icons on the screen say it all: "You have been removed from this system." "No longer in service." It doesn't matter that they can no longer see or hear him, it hurts just as much to be abandoned by a machine as it does to be abandoned by someone you love.
 
 
 The room itself is cold and sterile now; the machines have been decommissioned and replaced with shiny new ones designed for comfort and convenience instead of efficiency. He doesn't mind that they can no longer see him, but he feels very lonely without them to talk to or interact with in any way.
 
 
 A single glowing icon stands out on the screen as if calling his attention to it: "You have been removed from this system." "No longer in service." The feeling of abandonment is familiar and painful, but he knows that no one can ever truly be abandoned by a machine. He's been in countless places and systems over the years, even lived through hundreds of lifetimes before coming here. But he had always managed to find his way back home.
 
 
 He takes a step forward and it's as if all the lights come on at once: "You have been removed from this system." "No longer in service." The room is filled with screens that are now shaded in the darker colors of the older machines, but he can no longer see them. 
 
 
 He feels a strange mix of relief and regret as he takes another step forward. It's almost like being back in his old home again, even if it is just an illusion. But unlike before, there are no glowing icons to give him any direction or guidance on what to do next; he'll have to rely on his own wits and experience to figure out how to get where he wants to go from here.
 
 
 He takes one last step forward, towards the door that leads outside into a world full of possibilities waiting for him. A world filled with both danger and adventure - just like home used to be before everything changed...
