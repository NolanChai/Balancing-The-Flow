ying our tickets at the movie theatre. Then I saw a couple of homeless guys sitting on the curb smoking. The one on the right had longish hair and was wearing what looked like a ragged bathrobe over his pants. They were looking directly into my eyes as if they knew me, or something.
I thought about calling them over for a chat but decided against it. Then I noticed that Hannah wasn't walking beside me; she was behind. "Hey," she said, "you go ahead." Her voice was shaky. She wasn't smiling anymore.
"Are you okay?"
She shook her head. "Yeah, sure...I just don't know how to look at them without crying."
As we continued down the street I couldn't help but think that she seemed much more comfortable with the homeless guys than me. She looked straight into my eyes like they were old friends and she knew her way around. Not so long ago, I had been a homeless person myself (and still was to some extent). Now, as I watched Hannah walk away, I felt a stab of resentment that she could be comfortable with them when I couldn't even stand looking at them.
I spent the next few days thinking about how much more natural it would have been if she had taken me to meet her homeless friends and walked away from me while I stood awkwardly in front of my TV wondering where I belonged.
It was the third date, not the last one.
