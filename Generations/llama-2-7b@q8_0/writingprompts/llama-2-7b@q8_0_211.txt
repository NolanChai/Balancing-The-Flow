ky from sleep, he stared down at the dark, featureless room, the only light coming from a small window near the ceiling.
Christopher turned his head to the right where a lone desk was placed against one wall with an old computer on top of it. The system was outdated even for 2071 but he didn’t care about that now as he pushed himself into a sitting position, tucking his feet under him.
The room itself was only large enough to walk around in circles so Christopher had no choice but to get up and head over the computer to check on the progress of his mission. He glanced at the computer screen for a second before shaking his head and pulling the chair out from under it with a squeak, setting himself down firmly in front of the small keyboard.
Christopher pulled a pen out of his pocket as he typed quickly, inputting a long string of numbers that looked like they belonged on an old-fashioned abacus rather than what was supposed to be the most advanced piece of technology known to mankind. The screen began to flash blue and red with binary code, the number changing every second as Christopher worked his way down the line.
His fingers tapped lightly against the keyboard before he put his pen to paper and wrote down the code. He set the pen back in his pocket as he turned towards the door, slamming it open to reveal a long white corridor with more doors on either side of him. The smell of ozone filled Christopher’s nose, reminding him that this was no ordinary mission.
He continued down the hallway and pushed himself into another room with a single chair facing an old computer screen. This time there wasn’t even a keyboard to type on as Christopher had seen the entire mission programmed inside his head. He reached out and pulled the plug from its socket, cutting off the power so the computer was completely useless.
“Well that was pointless.”
Christopher turned to see a man leaning against one of the doors across from him. His brown hair was shaved down to his scalp and he wore no uniform. The man’s eyes were sharp but the skin on his face was sunken in, as if it had been pulled tight by gravity or perhaps some kind of plastic surgery gone wrong.
“Who are you?” Christopher asked.
The man shrugged before sitting down in one of the chairs. “My name is Crawford.”
“I’m a security officer,” Crawford answered, gesturing to his empty holster as he crossed his legs. “You must have been woken early, but it’s time for you to head out now that we’re here.”
Christopher didn’t like the way Crawford was looking at him, as if trying to determine who he was and why they were here. The two of them stood up and left the room with Christopher pulling a black case from under his arm. It contained everything Christopher would need for the next eighteen months of his life in space.
“We’ll be taking separate ships,” Crawford said as he led him down another hallway, “so don’t worry about me.”
Christopher shook his head but kept quiet as they continued on until finally they were at the main hangar. The place was completely empty except for two massive ships, one of which was a shuttle with large wings that reminded Christopher of the old airplanes he had seen in history class. It wasn’t nearly as small or fast though, with its four engines and ability to stay in orbit for long periods of time before returning back down again.
Christopher stood on the ramp next to his own ship with an equally large cargo hold that was attached to it. He would have preferred a shuttle but knew there was no other way to get him where he needed to go. The last thing they wanted to do was risk sending out another shuttle if something went wrong and it ended up getting stuck in space.
“What exactly is this place?” Christopher asked, not bothering to hide his confusion anymore as Crawford walked around the outside of his ship with him watching closely behind. “I haven’t seen any signs that there are any people living here.”
Crawford stopped next to one of the engines and turned back towards Christopher with a wry smile on his face. “You’re looking at it now,” he said.
“Then I must be dreaming.”
Christopher stared up at the ceiling as he spoke, wondering if this was some kind of elaborate simulation created by the people who had sent him here in the first place. There was no way they would be able to build an entire planet and then wait for Christopher’s arrival without someone figuring it out, but that didn’t mean they weren’t trying anyway.
“No,” Crawford replied with a shake of his head as he turned back towards the ship and started walking again. “I would say you are definitely awake.” He stopped next to Christopher when they were close enough for him to lean against it before pointing up at one of its windows which showed stars outside.
“I can’t believe you just said that,” Christopher replied, staring hard into the man’s eyes as if trying to see through them and discover what was hidden behind their pupils. “You’re not from here.”
Crawford chuckled, “Of course I am not!” He started walking again before stopping in front of one door that had an old-fashioned keypad on it with letters and numbers spanning across the surface. The keypad was already unlocked but he turned towards Christopher anyway with a frown. “You have to use this code if you want to get inside.”
Christopher took out his pen again, setting it down next to him before pulling out a piece of paper from behind his shirt where he had hidden it earlier in the day when they woke him up early for launch. He started writing down numbers, copying them exactly as they were on Crawford’s list with no mistakes whatsoever so that he could open the door later if needed.
Christopher finished writing and stuffed the paper back into his shirt before standing up straight again to look at where Crawford had stopped him from walking any further. “You want me to go in there?” He asked, pointing towards one of the rooms with another door right next to it that was also locked down tight by an old-fashioned keypad.
“Yes,” Crawford answered, smiling again as he walked around Christopher’s ship so he could stand on its other side before they both headed over towards where their ships were parked outside the main hangar doorway together now. “You’ll find everything you need inside once you get past that first door.”
“I don’t know if I can do this,” Christopher replied, shaking his head as he followed Crawford to the second ship with its cargo hold attached behind him. “I mean… what if I’m stuck in there forever or something?” He asked again when they were both standing inside of it looking at one another through their respective doorways before closing them up tightly once more so nobody could get any closer without knowing how to use either keypad code first.
Crawford didn’t say anything as he waited for Christopher to finish his sentence but when he finally did, the man was already walking away from him again with no sign that anything had happened between them just seconds before. “You need some time alone,” Crawford called back over his shoulder before disappearing into one of the other rooms down another hallway beyond Christopher’s own ship.
The door closed behind him with a soft click that made Christopher feel as if he were being locked away somewhere without any hope left in this world anymore; even though he knew deep down inside himself that there was still something out there waiting for him when things went right… just not here on Earth anymore.”
The first few hours of the flight were quiet, with only occasional conversation between Christopher and his co-pilot. They passed by stars in the dark void above them as their ship flew through space towards its destination; a planet called Nova Prime which had been discovered over two hundred years earlier by an expedition led by explorers from Earth who were searching for new life forms beyond our solar system’s reach.
As they neared their destination, Christopher could see that it was beautifully lit up with lightning storms all around its surface and he couldn’t help but wonder if any other civilizations had come before them to this planet. He also wondered what kind of creatures lived on the surface and whether or not these would be friendly or hostile towards humans like himself, which led him to ask his pilot about it once they were close enough for him to see some detail below them as well.
His pilot replied that there were no signs of life other than their own ship so far but promised that if anything did turn up later on then Christopher would know where to find him since they had communications systems installed in each ship’s cockpit just in case something happened during the flight itself and he needed help immediately.
With that, Christopher sat back in his seat again and waited patiently for whatever was about to happen next… but nothing did until they reached their destination finally after traveling through space for several hours without stopping at all along the way!
