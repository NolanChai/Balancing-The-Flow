 r, ready to play some StarCraft II before heading to bed. I saw no one as usual when I walked through the door and flicked on the light. After making myself a cup of coffee, I turned on my laptop and booted up Steam. The familiar interface greeted me with its cartoonish menus and colorful icons. As I made my way through the pre-game ritual, I could hear my neighbors talking outside through an open window. They had been arguing for days now about a noise coming from a nearby house. There were always disputes in this neighborhood about noisy dogs or loud music. Most of the time they settled their differences by shouting at each other until one side gave up, and then the whole thing would start again over something else.
I had lived in this apartment for almost five years now but it was still a strange place to live in. The apartments were located near the industrial zone on the east side of town, right across from the train tracks, and you could see everything that happened along them every day. The houses that were situated next to them were old and rundown, the people who lived there looked like they had given up on life long ago. It was like living in a prison. I thought about moving out but my parents couldn't afford for me to live anywhere else so I stayed where I was.
After making my way through the match selection screen, I finally entered one of the new StarCraft II custom maps that had recently been released online. This map took place on a desert planet with giant sand dunes and massive stone monoliths scattered throughout its surface. As I began the game, everything seemed normal at first but then it started happening. The light in my room turned an eerie shade of green and a glowing, shadowy figure appeared out of nowhere on my basement floor. It was as if it had been there all along, waiting for me to play this map. I screamed when I saw the thing standing by my bed but no one in the neighborhood could hear me because they were busy arguing about something else.
When I tried to turn away from the shadowy figure, I found that I couldn't move anymore. I was paralyzed with fear as it approached slowly towards me. Suddenly, something slammed into my face and everything went dark.
 
It was only when the sun rose the next morning that I realized what had happened to me. The shadowy figure in my basement had stabbed me in the eye with a sharp object and now it was gone. I called an ambulance and they came to take me away, but by then all of my neighbors were arguing about something else so no one could hear me scream for help when they took me away on a gurney.
 
The doctors at the hospital told me that there was nothing more that they could do for me and that I would probably be blind in my left eye forever because of what had happened to it. They also said that I might not ever regain full use of my right hand again after having been stabbed through it by a knife during the attack. But despite all this bad news, they couldn't tell me why someone would want to do such terrible things as they had done to me in my own home on such a normal day like Tuesday morning.
I tried not thinking about what had happened but sometimes I still wake up at night and see the shadowy figure standing over me as it stabs me again with its sharp object of choice until everything goes dark once more around me and all hope seems lost forever.
