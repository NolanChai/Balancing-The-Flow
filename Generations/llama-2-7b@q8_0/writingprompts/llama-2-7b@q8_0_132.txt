 revolving.
And the globe said: "You know me; you are my son."
"That is why I have come to save you from the abyss that yawns below me," it replied.
But the man had no answer. He stared and shivered. The globe became more and more terrifying as he gazed at it. It seemed a demon in revolt, and the man was its prey. Its voice boomed like thunder; it spoke of destruction. There were screams about him that rose in intensity with each moment that passed, but his own cries could not be heard because they were drowned by the noise of the globe.
"And now," said the globe in a terrible voice, "I have come to save you."
The man gazed at it and shivered; he turned away from it with horror as it approached him. He felt that the globe was trying to get into his mind. He knew it would succeed if he allowed it. It spoke of darkness and evil, and it made him feel as if his head were full of water.

The globe had spoken, but the man did not hear its voice.
He sat on a bed in a small room that was ill-kept; he looked about at the untidy furniture and shivered in fear. The sunlight seemed to come through his body and pierce him like a dagger, but he did not know why this should be so; it was only that he felt as if he were dying.
He heard something that made him turn towards the door and look out into the street; it was a man running very fast with a gun in his hand. The man's face was contorted with rage, and he ran straight at the globe. It seemed to stand still for an instant as if trying to avoid his bullet; then it turned and fled down the street and into another room where a man was sitting in a chair by himself.
The man in the bed became very calm, but he could not hear what the other man said or see what he did because of the darkness that surrounded him. But he felt that something strange had happened: there was a moment when he thought his body would explode. Then everything grew quiet and dark again, except for an occasional light which came in through holes in the roof, but they were not the same kind of lights as those that came before.
They seemed to be from some other time or place; sometimes it looked like daylight outside, while at others it appeared night-time in a room filled with candlelight. He felt his way about by touch and smell and hearing until he reached the end of one long corridor where there was another door that opened onto darkness again.
He walked through this room without thinking about what might be behind him, for if anything had been there it would have been too late to stop him. There was no sign that anyone else had ever been in this place before; but then again he knew nothing about any other time or place except from stories his mother told when she was a child herself: tales of witches and demons and spirits haunting houses at night, and how they would steal your soul if you let them into their homes.
Inside this room there were only two objects; one was a wooden chair which sat in the centre of the floor and had no back or legs so that it could be used as a table for things such as food or drinks or books; while near by stood another piece of furniture: an old wardrobe whose doors hung open revealing shelves filled with clothes that were dusty, torn, and worn out from years of use.
On one side wall there was also some kind of cupboard which had been left unlocked since the last time anyone lived in this place; but nobody ever went near it because they knew better than to try opening such a thing without knowing what was inside first!
