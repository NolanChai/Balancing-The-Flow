es hers. They are as beautiful and delicate as an elf's.
"Hey there," he says, and she smiles at him shyly. She is the first person that I've seen smile like her here in this land. "Do you want to go inside?"
She nods yes, and they walk side by side into one of the halls that lead into the city. They talk about small things; she asks how he knows the language of these people, how old he is, what his name is... all little questions asked from a child's curiosity. It was obvious to me that she didn't understand why I wasn't answering her questions properly.
"Where do you come from?," she says to him at one point in time. He responds with a smile and shrug, telling her he comes from somewhere far away. "That's quite strange. How is it possible?"
It was then that the guards came. I froze in shock as they drew their swords against me, for my disguise as one of their race was completely blown. They seemed to know exactly who and what I was from my appearance. I ran, fearing for this girl's life; but as quickly as they came, they left her behind to die.
They say that there are no elves here in the lands of Eltair. They say that there never have been. But I know now. The truth is not what you want it to be. This is a world of secrets and lies...
I remember when I was a boy, in our land of Eltair, they would tell tales about how elves were created by the Goddess Nyrvael herself. She wanted them to live in harmony with nature as she did. But the other gods objected, for there is no greater enemy than an unnatural creature; and so a war was fought against those that were to become our people.
Our kind was supposed to be weak and defenseless; but Nyrvael would not have it. She gave us magical powers far beyond what any of her other creations possessed, and she granted us the strength to survive in a world where we did not belong. The other gods were angered at this, for they saw how she favored us above them; but even still Nyrvael refused to accept their defeat and allow us into paradise.
It was then that these beings known as "the dragons" came into existence... I still do not know their true origins. I know only that they were created by a being far more powerful than the gods themselves, and that it is said they serve no one but themselves. They began to hunt us down wherever we lived, killing without mercy or hesitation. Our people had no defense against them; they had no place in nature as they existed, and so they were destroyed by their own lack of ability to adapt.
The gods eventually grew tired of the dragons' constant attacks on our kind. They did not wish for us to disappear completely from existence; but still they would not allow us into paradise. Nyrvael agreed with this decision. She wished that we be allowed to survive, as long as we were able to do so in hiding and in secret...
We moved away from where the dragons dwelled, settling into a place of our own near an enormous forest. This land was not far from paradise; but it had always been a part of Eltair's kingdom before it had fallen, so we believed that Nyrvael would still protect us there as she did in the past. Our people spread across the forests and mountainside, creating villages throughout this new home. But even then they continued to be hunted by those who did not wish us to live; and some of our people were killed. We fought back against them with magic that we had learned from Nyrvael herself...
This was all many years ago now; before the dragons were created, before my time on this earth began. But I remember when they first appeared in my life...
It was a night much like any other, and I sat at home reading one of my favorite books about Nyrvael's creation story. I could hear voices outside my door, but it wasn't until later that I realized what had happened... The people who came were not there to kill me as they had before; they were searching for something else instead: a girl named Elara Elrithiel. They told me her name when she was captured by them; and I knew at once why they had come.
She was one of my most trusted friends from childhood, always staying with us at night while we slept under the stars. Her parents were killed not long after this event took place, so it fell upon me to raise her as best I could... It was a hard task for me alone; but in those days we had no other choice. We did not know what else would happen if we refused their orders.
We fled together across the mountainside and through some of our villages with them on our heels; but even then, they were not able to catch us because of my power over magic which I received from Nyrvael herself... It was during this time that she first revealed herself to me as well, telling me about how her creation story differed slightly than what others believed; and how we should try harder than ever before if we wanted our people to live in peace once more.
They did not stop chasing us even after they realized what had happened; instead, they kept going until finally reaching another village nearby... I had thought that perhaps this was where Elara would be taken by them again so quickly; but she never came back with them... The next morning, when we awoke from sleeping outside in the cold for nearly two days straight without any food or water, all I saw were dead bodies scattered across our village site. It seemed as if everything had been burned down completely--as though they wanted nothing left behind except death and destruction wherever they went...
We ran back home once more after this horrific event took place; but there was still no sign of Elara anywhere near me or anyone else in my family at all! We searched for days on end until finally finding out what had happened: she had been taken away by them before anything could be done about it, leaving behind only memories and dreams...
I have never known such despair as when I realized this would probably mean that we were now alone forever without her. She was the best friend anyone could hope to find in life; a girl who always put others before herself, even if it meant putting me on my own at times too! Even though she had been captured by these monsters (which is what they are called because they do not look like people but more like demons from Hell) there was still nothing I could do about it...
I spent months mourning her loss, believing that no one else would ever understand or care as much for me as she did. But then something happened which changed everything: someone came knocking at my door late one night with a letter addressed specifically to me! The envelope was sealed tightly shut; however, when I opened it up, there inside lay an invitation for us both into what would become known as "Eltair's Paradise"--a place where only those who were truly worthy could go and live forever...
We had no idea why we were being given this opportunity now after all these years; but even so, we accepted it immediately. We did not want to wait any longer before finding out what awaited us on the other side! When we finally stepped inside that doorway together for what felt like an eternity ago...
We have been living in paradise ever since then without anyone else knowing about it or caring either way really; but now that I think back to how everything happened all those years ago when we first started this new life here--it feels like something out of another world entirely...
That girl was the one who brought me into existence. She did not know what would happen when she came across my path, or even why she was meant to be there; but somehow I knew from that moment onwards that I had found my home at last.
I have never seen her since then--and although it might seem strange now considering everything else in this story thus far... She has always been close to me ever since then too somehow; always watching over me whenever something goes wrong (as though she knows exactly what needs doing!)... It's like we are connected by some sort of invisible thread which runs through both our lives and connects them together forever...
Now that I think about it, maybe there truly is no such thing as coincidence after all... Maybe everything happens for a reason; even if none of us can ever really understand why sometimes... Maybe life itself is just one big adventure waiting to be lived out--no matter what happens along the way!
