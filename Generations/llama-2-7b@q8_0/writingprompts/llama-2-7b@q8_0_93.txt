oundings then continues walking.
She is alone. No one knows where she has gone or even why she left. It's just that she was beginning to feel like things were going too smoothly and she felt like she needed an adventure.
She sits down on the grass and looks over a list of supplies she packed in her small rucksack. She doesn’t think anyone will be looking for her, but she wants to make sure she has everything just in case.
She opens it up and takes out several large, well-used leather-bound journals that are full of notes she's made about the places she's visited and things she's seen. The first entry is dated two years ago when she decided to leave home for the first time. She didn’t have anywhere specific in mind, just an idea that it was time to get out there and do something exciting with her life.
The entries are often very detailed of the places she visits, even listing down the foods she eats while she's there. It doesn't surprise her when she comes across an entry where she wrote down "Earth Pie." The pie was served to her by a waitress and it tasted like fresh dirt with a side order of worms, but it was good.
She reaches inside the rucksack again for another journal and begins writing in it. This time the words come faster and she doesn't have to concentrate as much on them. She feels more confident as if this is something she has been doing all her life.
She looks up at a bird flying overhead with a piece of food in its beak. It lands in a nearby tree branch and eats, then flies away.
She looks down at the ground again to see if there's any sign of another animal being there before she gets up and walks out into the sunlight. She has no idea where she will go next but is willing to take her chances.
