6 o’clock position in the sky, just as it had been doing for the last five thousand years.
A sudden surge of energy brought me back to reality; I was falling into a spin that was taking me back to the ground and I was out of control. My heart beat like a jack hammer but I managed to right my position with an adjustment in attitude, which immediately put me on a collision course with the planet below.
“What is it, Mike?” she asked anxiously as we both stared at our instruments. The last time I’d had anything like this happen I hadn’t been able to save myself and I wasn’t about to die again without a fight.
The ground came up fast; it was hard to think clearly but I knew the drill. If you were going down with your ship, then damn it, go out with a bang!
“Hold on,” I said as my thoughts became clearer.
I checked all the switches and prepared to cut power – the last thing we needed was an explosion from our fuel tank just as it hit the ground at over 700 miles an hour. I hit the button, the engines fell silent and a split second later, the air brakes activated with a sudden jolt that made my eyes water.
The aircraft bounced to the left on impact, then down again on its belly before coming to rest in what was left of a forest clearing. We both looked at each other and grinned, knowing our survival was just beginning. I went to the cockpit window to survey our damage – luckily it appeared to be superficial but I knew we were going nowhere fast so it wasn’t really important.
“You okay?” she asked anxiously as I climbed back into the cabin.
She looked at me with wide eyes, and then a big smile broke out on her face. She didn’t have to say anything; I understood what she was feeling – we both had a lot of work ahead if we were going to make it off this planet alive, but at least for now, we were together.
A couple of hours later I was lying on the ground, looking up into the night sky as my partner and pilot, Kara, collected firewood for our small camp. She came back and sat down beside me, throwing her arms around me to cuddle close. We’d been through a lot together already in just two days and I knew we were going to be fine so long as we kept our wits about us.
I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a second. She was right; what had happened here wasn’t meant to happen, but it was no use worrying about it now – things like that would take care of themselves if you just kept your eyes on the road ahead. I let her continue cuddling me until we both fell asleep and then I drifted into my first good nights sleep in almost 24 hours.
“I’m going to try one more time, if that doesn’t work there isn’t anything else for it,” said Kara from beside the small camp fire where she was cooking some bacon. She didn’t like eating vegetables so I did most of our food preparation as part of my survival skills training. It meant we didn’t eat too well but at least we were alive, and that was what counted.
“That’s it?” she said, standing up to come over and give me a hug. “You sound pretty confident.” I guessed her question had been rhetorical though; with our current situation, there wasn’t any other option. If we weren’t going to die of starvation then we would have to find help – it was as simple as that.
The last three days since we hit the ground hadn’t been easy but I had managed to teach Kara enough about survival skills so she wasn’t totally helpless anymore. She could now use a knife properly and knew how to make fires; things like building shelters, setting traps or finding food were all beyond her at this point – not that it mattered; we didn’t need any of those skills right now. All I needed was something that would get us noticed in the sky above.
“Okay,” she said with a nod and then started to move back over towards the fire, “I’m going to keep an eye on things while you’re gone – don’t be too long!” She smiled as she looked at me, winking playfully, before disappearing into the small tent that we had made from some of our emergency supplies.
I nodded and started walking away. I was almost certain that something would turn up soon and hopefully it wouldn’t take more than a day or so for rescue to come along – after all, if anyone else had crashed on this planet they would have seen us by now unless they were hiding out somewhere nearby; in which case they could probably tell we needed help just by looking at our situation.
I reached the edge of our camp and turned around one last time before heading back down towards where I’d left Kara waiting beside our fire – it had been a long three days, but things should start getting easier now that we were going to be rescued soon. With any luck this planet was going to get us out alive!
I couldn’t help smiling as I watched her from afar; she looked so happy sitting there beside our campfire that it made me feel good about being the one who’d brought her here. We’d only been on this planet for two weeks now but things were already starting to take shape – we were both learning quickly and getting better at surviving each day.
“Hey babe,” I whispered as she turned around with a smile when I sat down next to her, “how are you doing?” She looked up at me with those big brown eyes of hers that always melted my heart no matter what we were going through – today was no exception! We’d been through so much together already but somehow it never seemed like enough; we had an unbreakable bond between us that would last forever no matter where life took us.
She leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek before turning back to focus on what she was doing – cooking dinner for two people who hadn’t eaten in almost 24 hours! I watched as she threw some more wood onto our fire, stirred around with her spatula until everything looked perfect then sat down next to me again.
“Mmmm…” She whispered as we both took a bite of what had become one of my favourite dishes: bacon and eggs cooked over an open flame! It was so good that I couldn’t help but reach across with a hand and pull her closer to me – I loved feeling like this, where nothing in the world mattered except being here together.
We sat there for what seemed like hours without saying anything; just enjoying each other’s company until finally we heard something outside our camp that made us both jump up from our seats at once! It sounded like someone was walking towards us and before long they were standing right next to our little tent – two people who looked as if they had been lost in the wilderness for far too long.
“Please help us!” one of them cried out as he fell onto his knees before me – it was obvious that he was begging us not to abandon him like so many others had done over recent years since being stranded on this planet alone with no hope left whatsoever! I didn’t want any part of him or his sorry excuse for life but seeing how desperate these two people were made me feel obligated somehow – maybe it was my duty as a survivor to offer them shelter and food until they could find their way back home? Whatever it was, I knew one thing: whatever happened next would be our first true test on this planet together.
