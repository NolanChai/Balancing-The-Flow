ckets full a shit and you know they been there for days, weeks. And every time ya look at 'em, ya feel like cryin', but ya can't, cos yer the law now an' somebody gotta clean it up. That first day I felt like my legs were goin ta give way on me so bad I wouldn't be able to move, and that's not good if you gotta run down a perp with a gun in his hand! But I did manage t'get through it, and from then on every day was worse.
