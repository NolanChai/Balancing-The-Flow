 has a more relaxed attitude than most other universities. Its student population is split between 30% townies, 25% posh twats, and the rest either out-of-towners or international students. Most of them live in halls and only come to uni during term time when their parents drop them off and pick them up again at weekends.
Kent University is located on the Kent coast. It has a beautiful white sandy beach, which is 40km long, but no one goes there because it's cold and windy. Students instead tend to hang around in the student union bar. Kent Uni also has a gym, which is open only during term time when most students go. But again, since it's so windy outside, they don't use it either. Instead, they go for walks on the beach.
There are only 10,000 students at Kent University. They get a bad press in the media because of their constant partying and drinking, but they do have some serious courses there as well:
Social Anthropology with Politics & International Relations
Drama & Performing Arts
Environmental Technology/Management
Media Production & Studies
They're all about the same standard as any other uni, though. Kent University has a lot of clubs and societies for its students to join. The main ones are:
British Sign Language Society (BSL)
Deaf Students Association (DSA)

The Kent University African Caribbean Society (KUACS) is fundraising to help children in Zimbabwe who are being oppressed by their government, which includes the murder of civilians. It's run by members of the society including a couple of students from Kent Uni, one of whom used to work for Amnesty International:
KUACS was formed with the aim of raising awareness about issues concerning people of African and Caribbean descent in the UK as well as abroad. We also believe that it is important that we support our brothers and sisters around the world, especially those who are facing oppression due to race/ethnicity.
With this in mind, KUACS has made a decision to raise money for the Zimbabwean Refugee Fund. This fund was started by the University of Cape Town Student Representative Council (SRC). It is raising funds to support refugees from Zimbabwe. The money will be sent to the SRC, who have established a number of projects which aim to help the displaced people in Zimbabwe, including:
Educational material and text books.
Provision for students who cannot afford to pay their fees or buy stationery.
Food parcels, blankets, clothes etc.
A feeding programme for children under five years old.
KUACS believes that the University of Kent is a rich resource; we have the capacity and the opportunity to help people from all over Africa who are in desperate need. We also believe that the community has an obligation to assist those less fortunate, especially if they face similar discrimination to what they have experienced themselves.
The first event was a quiz night where there were lots of prizes, including one for Best Team Name. The winning name was ``We are not Afrofascists''. After that there will be a series of fundraising events throughout the year:
Dance Classes - 19th Feb, 26th Feb & March 5th at Canterbury High Street Hall.
Disco Night - 13th April in the Student Union Bar.
Fundraising Dinner - 4th May at the Sutton Valence Community Centre.
Race Against Time (KUACS's annual ball) is going to be held on Saturday, 25th June 2005 and it will include a silent auction for lots of items don
