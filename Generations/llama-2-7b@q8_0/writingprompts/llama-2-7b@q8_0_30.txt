`` `You must be a Sith Lord to have such power,'' Cody said. `` You know you're just like me when it comes down to it, and you've been using that power to corrupt the galaxy for years, haven't you? '' Cody asked in an accusatory tone. His eyes were narrowed, as if he had found a piece of evidence or uncovered a secret. 
  
---
  
I stared at him, my mouth slightly open with shock and disbelief, then I turned around and ran. `` 'Sup?'' 
 
---
  
`` `What are you doing here? '' Cody asked as he followed me into the dining room. I was still clutching the lightsaber in my hand. `` If you're planning on leaving, get it over with now. I don't want to hear anything from your stupid mouth once we leave this planet.'' 
  
---
  
`` `You won't even be able to see me when we get off-planet, and that is something you can rest easy knowing about.'' Cody said as he walked up behind me. `` I promise you, my dear boy, it will all be over soon enough.'' He then threw his arms around me and whispered in my ear with a seductive tone: `` The first order of business will be to teach your silly ass how to be the master instead of the slave. '' 
  
---
  
I was frozen in place for a few seconds, unable to move or respond to Cody's advances, but as quickly as I had been frozen, my body snapped back into action and I twisted out of his grip, turning around so that I faced him. `` How dare you? '' I shouted angrily at him. 
  
---
  
`` `You've crossed the line, Cody,' I said as I pointed to the lightsaber in my hand and added: `Now, let's see how good a Sith Lord you really are when faced with your own creation. '' 
 
---
  
Cody raised an eyebrow at me and took a step forward so that he was closer than I would like for someone who had just threatened to kill me. `` Well, what do we have here? A lightsaber. And a young man with the ability to wield it with skill and finesse. That is something you must learn in order to be any good at this Jedi business. '' 
  
---
  
I stood my ground as Cody continued his advances, keeping the blade up so that he wouldn't get close enough for me to use the Force against him and kill him like a good Sith Lord should. `` That is correct, Master Cody. I am learning quickly thanks to you.'' I said with confidence in my voice as I used the Force to lift myself off of the ground so that I was standing on top of his shoulders instead of beneath them. 
  
---
  
`` `And now it is time for me to learn about something else, Master Cody: how to be a good Sith Lord and not get caught in my own trap like you did. '' As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I heard a loud snap followed by Cody's scream. `` It's over,'' I said with relief, as I ran from the room, leaving the lightsaber behind for the time being. 
  
---
  
It was hard to believe that it had all been an act of mine until this moment when I realized my mistake. But there was no turning back now; I knew what I wanted and would do anything in my power to get it. And so, as I made my way toward the dining room door, I closed my eyes tightly and began to chant: `` May the Force be with you always. '' 
  
---
  
The moment I opened my eyes again, there was a bright flash of light, followed by darkness and silence. I tried to make sense of what had just happened but all I could hear was Cody's voice ringing in my head: `` You are now one with the Force! '' 
 
---
  
Cody stood up from the ground as he smiled at me knowingly, his arms outstretched and a look of ecstatic joy on his face. `` Now that I have your attention, how about you come over here and give us both some of those juicy cheeks? '' 
  
---
  
I laughed and shook my head as Cody made his way toward me with an almost child-like innocence in his eyes. `` You're not serious, are you?'' I said to him incredulously. 
  
---
  
`` `That is a very rude thing to say after what just happened between us.' He stopped and looked at me, his eyes twinkling with mischief. `` Do you think I would ask such a question if I weren't?'' 
 
---
  
Cody grabbed my hand tightly and pulled me into him so that our chests were pressed up against each other, our bodies rubbing together in an almost sexual manner. He then kissed me on the cheek, but instead of being tender or gentle like I had expected it to be, his lips were rough as if he were trying to force them onto mine. `` You see,'' Cody whispered into my ear seductively, `` that's how a real Sith Lord does things! '' 
  
---
  
I pulled away from him and frowned in confusion at what had just happened. `` What?'' I asked as he laughed out loud at me. `` Come here,'' Cody said again with an insistent tone to his voice before pulling me back toward him. This time I fought him off until I heard my name being called from across the room: 
  
---
  
`` 'Master Cody? Can you come over here a moment? '' I looked at Cody, who was still holding on to my hand tightly despite my efforts to pull away from him. `` I don't want anyone else seeing me like this.'' He said as he winked at me with an almost-sinister grin before letting go of me and walking toward the woman calling out for him. 
  
---
  
I watched Cody leave, his hips swaying seductively in time with his steps, and I had to admit that my heart was beating faster at the thought of what might happen if he were to return to where we stood alone together again. But for now it seemed as though my fate would lie in someone else's hands...
