irteen days after my birthday—and you were supposed to take me out for a special dinner. I was looking forward to that. So what happened? 
 
 Nothing. I didn ’ t get what I expected on my birthday. And now today . . . nothing again. 
 
 It doesn ’ t look like there ’ s much hope in my future. 
 
 That sounds a little dark, doesn ’ t it? Sorry. I feel kinda down because things haven ’ t worked out the way I thought they would. 
 
 And now that we know where we are and what year it is, you can probably guess what happened to me on my thirteenth birthday. 
 
 So what am I going to do? I think I might try something new . . . 
# Day Six
# **Sixteen years ago**
 
 I woke up in the hospital and they told me that my name was Evan. My mom said, "It's a good name," but she never told me what it really means. I wasn't sure if her answer was honest or just something to make me feel better about my new name—like it might mean something special . . . like maybe it meant "the beginning of an adventure"! 
 
 I don't know why the doctors and nurses were so interested in knowing my age. It felt a little weird, but then Mom said, "They just want to make sure they get your medication right." That was a good answer. So I didn't ask any more questions about it. 
 
 After they got all of the IVs and monitors set up for me, my mom kissed me on top of my head, and then she said that she had to go get ready for work. She told me that she would come back in a little while and see how I was doing. But when she left, I could tell she didn't want to leave because there were tears in her eyes. 
 
 I wish my dad hadn't died. He was killed by terrorists in a war overseas, but that doesn't have anything to do with what happened to me today—it just makes me sad when I think about it. 
 
 I didn't see my mom again until almost dinner time, and she came into the room carrying flowers and holding a book titled _The Complete History of Birthday Traditions_. She was really happy to see that I was awake, but I could tell she still felt bad for me. "How do you feel?" she asked. 
 
 "My head hurts." I was lying flat on my back, and I noticed that my mom had brought some magazines over from home so I could read them while I was stuck in bed. But the book on birthdays is definitely going to be the first one I read. 
 
 Mom asked me if she should leave it there for me to look at later, and when I told her that I wanted to start reading now, she put _The Complete History of Birthday Traditions_ down next to my bed. Then I saw a pink and purple balloon with a note attached. The card said "I love you" in black marker. 
 
 There were other presents, too . . . lots of them! Most of the boxes were filled with little things—little stuffed animals that my mom had made and some old toys from when I was really young—and then there were bigger gifts like a big stuffed puppy dog, a book about dinosaurs, and a new video game system. 
 
 When my mom realized how many presents there were, she started crying again. "Oh Evan," she said, "I'm so sorry you had to spend your birthday here. I don't know how any of this happened." Then she looked around at all the balloons and presents with a little laugh in her voice. "I guess it could have been worse . . ." 
 
 "But that was my favorite birthday present," she said, pointing to an envelope on top of my bedside table. 
 
 I had never seen any money before—but I knew what the bills inside were for! It's like when you open a present and see the tag on it that says "To: You!" Then when you read it, there is no mistaking who the present is for . . . even if it wasn't wrapped up with fancy paper and a bow. 
 
 But I didn't want to read the money out loud. "Can we just put it away so that we don't have to look at it until you feel better?" I asked. 
 
 Mom gave me an angry look like she was annoyed by something, and then her face softened into a smile as she said, "Okay." She folded the envelope over with one hand and stuck it under my pillow while I tried to make myself comfortable on top of the hospital sheets. 
 
 The next day, they took me home from the hospital, and for the first few hours after we got back, Mom was very busy—she kept looking around at everything in our house, like she had never seen it before . . . then she started cooking dinner. I thought maybe she was still worried about having to stay up so late on my birthday, but when I asked her what was wrong, she said that there was nothing wrong except for the fact that I had been sick and she was just happy to have me home again. 
 
 When we finished eating, Mom took me back into the living room so I could look at all of my presents. She handed me a box with a picture on it that said "The Birthday Present That Every Kid Dreams Of!" inside . . . and then she asked if I wanted to open it right away or save it until later. 
 
 When I looked at the box, there was a big red button on top of it. Mom explained that it was just some kind of game controller for my new video game system that she bought me. Then when she said, "Okay . . . push it," I pushed the button and got an electric shock—just like they do at carnivals when you're standing in line to win a stuffed animal! 
 
 I couldn't believe how much fun this game was going to be. All of my friends will probably want one too . . . 
# **After that**
 
 My mom never told me the story about how she and Dad first met, but later on in life when I was a teenager and living by myself, I found out what happened before they got married. 
 
 It started with Mom's parents going through a nasty divorce because their marriage was never really good to begin with. The kids weren't involved at all—it was just grown-up stuff between two people who had been together for too long and needed some space from each other. 
 
 After that, Mom went back home where she lived with her mom while Dad stayed in his apartment because he couldn't afford anything else . . . and I think they both knew what was coming next. They didn't really talk about it or anything—just pretended like everything was fine so they could keep living their separate lives. But they were actually both thinking the same thing: _This is not how you start out a marriage._ 
 
 Mom and Dad met in a bar downtown, though neither of them remembered what they said to each other or where exactly it happened (because they had been drinking). The next time they saw each other was at their friend's wedding—and I guess you could call that "their first date." 
 
 After they got married, Dad moved out of his apartment and into Mom's house so he didn't have to pay rent anymore . . . but even though he had his own bedroom, he still slept on the couch because he was too scared that she would find out what had happened between him and one of her friends who worked at the restaurant where they were both bartending. 
 
 Mom never talked about how it felt for Dad to move in with us after their divorce, but I think she knew that I needed a father figure growing up—and even though we had different ideas about what kind of man he should be, at least he was there when I needed him most. 
 
 That's why we got married on my thirteenth birthday instead of our actual anniversary . . . because it felt like something special between us that no one else understood. It made me feel safe and loved—and it also gave us both a chance to tell each other how much we cared about each other before things ended so badly for them both. 
 
 My parents divorced when I was nine, but they never stopped caring for me . . . which is why I know that my dad didn't hate Mom because she didn't give birth to him—it just means he loved her enough not to want anything bad happening between us ever again. 
 
 I don't think any kid should have a parent like Dad, but at least his death made me realize how important it was for me to keep my family together even though things might get hard sometimes . . . especially when we were separated by different countries and languages during our time apart
