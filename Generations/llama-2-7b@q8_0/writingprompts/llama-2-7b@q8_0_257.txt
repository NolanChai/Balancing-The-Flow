ed been cooking inside a hot oven for days? He couldn't feel any heat, either on his skin or anywhere else. He was still surrounded by the cold darkness of the space suit, and that was keeping him alive.

 "Wow," Celsius said to himself. 
 
 Then he thought about it. He didn't think so. He really was going to boil alive if they kept this up. No, what was it that kept you from frying in an oven? The air temperature, he supposed, or the lack thereof. He had been breathing pure nitrogen for days now, and it couldn't keep his body warm even with his own internal furnace blazing away at maximum heat.

 "Wow," Celsius said to himself again. 
 
 Then he thought about that last comment, too. No, there was another thing. The lack of oxygen would kill him long before the boiling water could do it. It was an important difference.

 "The boiling water will kill me," Carlos mused aloud to himself. "If I ever get out of here."

 It occurred to Celsius then that he didn't want to be in here anymore, at all. He wanted to get back on the surface and breathe again. And what he wanted more than anything else was a drink of water!
 
 So he started working his way up through the tube. There were still several layers between him and the opening that led into the oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere outside, but at least it wasn't going to kill him anymore if something went wrong. He could only hope that whatever was keeping him alive would continue doing so until he reached that safety level.
