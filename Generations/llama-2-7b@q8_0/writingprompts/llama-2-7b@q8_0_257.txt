10k was about to be mine.
-265,000 karma. I used a computer. I took part in discussions that are not worthy of a karma boost for me. I accidentally got one when someone made me an admin on another account. But what could I do? I was an internet addict by then.
-148,552 karma. I wrote a blog. It's called 24 Things My Computer Does For Me That I Couldn't Have Done Without It (Part II). My computer does lots of things for me. It is like another part of me, after all. But it can't make me coffee in the morning because I don't have a coffee maker (I don't drink coffee).
-148,540 karma. I wrote a blog called 25 Things My Computer Does For Me That I Couldn’t Have Done Without It (Part II).
-74,936 karma. I used a computer at work. I didn't use it to look up how many things my computer does for me. It was just on for 8 hours per day. That's it. Nothing else. The end of my addiction.
-72,145 karma. I wrote another blog called 26 Things My Computer Does For Me That I Couldn’t Have Done Without It (Part III).
-70,260 karma. I posted a comment to someone's blog about their computer not doing anything for them. The person's name was Matt. He told me that he was going to have to put the computer down and that it had been great while it lasted.
-74,059 karma. A lot of people who I don't know are reading my blog about computers that do things for me. I like this new feeling of power. My readers want more information so I write another 26 Things My Computer Does For Me That I Couldn’t Have Done Without It (Part IV).
-19,305 karma. A computer does something to someone who has no computer and it becomes their best friend for the next few years until they die. The end of my blog about computers doing things for me.
-126,744 karma. My blog is mentioned in a post that gets 60 comments in which I get 895 karma. I write another blog called 25 Things My Computer Does For Me That I Couldn’t Have Done Without It (Part V).
I don't think we should ban anything on this site, and certainly not for the reasons given. There are a few reasons why I disagree:
1) The person in question isn't hurting anyone
2) We don't have rules against writing blogs
3) It's kind of funny to me
4) There is no malice or hostility behind it, at least not on the part of the blogger. They just wrote a silly little blog about their computer doing stuff for them and then other people commented on it. No one was forced to comment on the post. People did so because they wanted to be amused by it. It's like if you see someone doing something silly, you can't help but laugh at him.
5) The blogger has a lot of karma from being nice and sharing information. They don't need more karma, nor do any of the people who comment on their blog because they think it's funny.
6) There are no rules against writing posts about computers that do things for you, even if your computer doesn't actually do those things for you. You could write a post about how you wish that your computer did x or y for you but it doesn't so you use a laptop instead. That wouldn't be bannable either because there aren't any rules against writing posts like that.
7) It's fun to see what other people think their computers do for them, even if they're wrong. Sometimes we can learn things from others and it's good to know that you're not alone in thinking your computer does x or y for you when it really doesn't.
8) We have no rules against posting blogs on this site unless they violate the terms of service, which isn't what this blog was about anyway. The only reason why we have bannable offenses at all is because there were so many people who were breaking other rules (spamming and so forth), that it became necessary for us to create an even more serious rule in order to prevent them from abusing our site again in those areas where they could be banned for breaking a different set of guidelines.
I am not going to ban this blog because the person who wrote it is nice and friendly and does not have any malice behind their actions. If you find that other people's posts are making you uncomfortable or you feel that they might be offensive, please report them as spam or abuse so we can review it and decide what needs to be done about it (if anything).
I hope this helps clear up some confusion about whether or not blogging is allowed on our site. I also encourage everyone reading this post right now who has something they want share with others through writing a blog, to feel free to do so!

Thank you for taking the time to read my response and I hope that it was helpful in answering any questions or concerns that you may have had regarding whether blogging is allowed on this site. If not, feel free to ask another question in the comments below!

It seems like most people would agree that it's best to keep our computers off the internet as much as possible. We all want our computers running smoothly, but what about those pesky little viruses and malware programs? It is important for us not only because they make your computer run slower than usual (not good), but also because they could potentially cause damage to your system if left unchecked!
Viruses are small programs that can cause problems on a PC or other device. They usually come in the form of an email attachment, a link on social media such as Facebook or Twitter, or sometimes even just by opening up a file without knowing what it contains first. Virus scanners will be able to pick these up before they do any harm and delete them so you don't have anything left over after cleaning out all those nasty bits of code from your system!
Malware programs are similar except that instead of being used directly against your computer they use other computers around the internet as a way of spreading themselves more easily. For example, if you have been infected by one type then another may show up later because it was installed before yours did so now both versions exist at once within each machine's memory!
Antivirus programs can help prevent viruses from infecting your computer in the first place but they won't stop these nasty little things from spreading around once they have done so. You need to be sure that you keep an eye on what gets installed onto your system and make sure there isn’t anything suspicious going on.
If it looks fishy then get rid of it before something bad happens! If not then chances are everything is fine but just in case double check anyway by scanning through some files with your antivirus program or running a malware scan just to be safe :)
Most computers can do the same thing: play music, watch movies and TV shows on demand; surfing the internet. They might look different from each other but they’re all computers! You may think that having more RAM (Random Access Memory) or storage space will make your computer faster but this isn't always true because some programs take up less memory than others. Some software needs more resources than others do so there’s no point upgrading something like Photoshop just because it takes a lot of RAM while another program doesn’t need any at all!
I hope you found my post helpful and if not then please let me know what else might be useful for everyone out there trying to figure out how computers work together :)
