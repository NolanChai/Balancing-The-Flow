ustle clients at the local firm in Stamford where he spent much of his time commuting on the train.
But something was missing. He wanted more.
Richard had been thinking about this for quite some time now. Even back in his college days he had pondered about life’s bigger picture, but as is often the case, life had intervened and distracted him from the questions that really matter. In recent months it was all he could think about; how to make a difference in this world. He knew he couldn’t keep going on like before; working hard for someone else wasn’t fulfilling anymore.
So there he was, in a bar, having a beer with a friend from high school whom he hadn’t seen in years. This friend was a doctor who had recently retired and wanted to move to Florida. They started talking about the different possibilities life presented and how they both wanted more from their lives.
“You know,” said Richard “I really want to make a difference. I feel that if only we could all work together, we could solve almost any problem in this world.” The two of them spoke for hours on end as they sipped their beers and eventually the idea came up: Why not start an NGO?
“That’s interesting,” said Richard “I had never thought about it like that. What would your organization work towards?”
“Well, I was thinking something along the lines of providing clean drinking water for people in third world countries.”
Richard immediately liked this idea. There were so many problems to solve and yet so little help.
“Hey,” said Richard “wouldn’t it be cool if we could all work together?” They both agreed that it would be.
The next day they began calling their friends, colleagues, and associates to see who wanted to get involved. It was a huge success and before long the two of them had a group of twenty-five volunteers ready to launch an NGO.
Richard decided to call the organization “WeWork.” They would all work together to solve the world’s biggest problems by bringing in more people, ideas, and resources than ever before. The idea was simple; the bigger the We, the better we were able to get things done. Richard had a vision of being able to provide clean drinking water for millions of people with this organization he and his friends started.
As they planned out their initial steps towards making this dream a reality they realized that they needed some funding if they wanted to do anything really big. So, they applied to the government for some start-up money. It was no small feat and took some doing but in the end they received $1 million from the US Government. With these funds they were able to expand their organization exponentially and soon enough they had a team of 250 volunteers who all shared the same vision: To make this world a better place one person at a time by working together as One We.
Richard was happy with where things stood; he knew that there were still many problems in this world, but he also knew that he could help to solve them if he continued on his path. And so it was with great optimism and determination that Richard set out for the next chapter of his life: One We.
