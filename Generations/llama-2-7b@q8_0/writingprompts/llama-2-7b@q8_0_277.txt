ega, and then began to come back. It had started its journey at almost exactly the same spot as where we were now standing.
"So what's it doing?" I asked, feeling slightly dazed by the enormous size of the ship. It was nearly half a kilometre long; it looked like something out of an old science fiction book – only bigger and more realistic. The surface of the craft was made up from smooth hexagonal panels that shone in the sunlight, reflecting back so much light that it hurt my eyes to look at them for too long. There were no engines or windows visible anywhere on its smooth surface.
"I think it's just checking us out," said Mara. "You know how it is – every now and then some alien species sends a ship through our solar system and we all have to freak out about it."
"Or maybe they're looking for something in particular," I suggested.
Mara shook her head. She was pale and tired, but still looked like she could fight off an army of Zygons or Daleks by herself if necessary. "No, that ship isn't after us."
"So what _is_ it after?" I asked, glancing over at the giant spaceship as it drifted silently past us. It was still a way off but its sheer size meant we could see almost every inch of its surface. I knew it must be heading our way because Earth wasn't that big on any scale; even if you didn't consider it a planet, just an asteroid in the middle of space, it would take longer than this to get anywhere else.
Mara shrugged her shoulders, giving me an apologetic smile. "I don't know."
"It could be looking for survivors," I said hopefully, trying not to sound too much like a conspiracy theorist.
"Maybe," said Mara. She seemed a little reluctant to let me believe that was true; perhaps she had seen it too many times on television or in movies to trust it. "But if they were looking for survivors, why not just come down here and ask?"
I looked back at the ship. It was so big that I wasn't sure whether its hull could even be considered a surface; all the same, I had this nagging feeling that if we needed to, it would be easy enough to climb up onto one of those hexagonal panels and start searching for survivors. But then again maybe it was just too big – something on that scale wouldn't have been able to land on Earth without having a big impact or leaving some sort of mark behind.
"What do you think they were doing before?" I asked, turning my attention away from the ship and back towards Mara. "They must have come down here at some point; if it was just for scouting around then why not come again later? You can't spend that much time on a planet like this without leaving an impact."
"You might be right about that," said Mara, nodding slowly in agreement as she considered my question. "If they were looking for survivors it would make more sense if they did try to land on the surface – but then again, we don't know what their technology level was like before all this happened."
"You mean they had space travel and they didn't use it?" I asked, almost disbelieving.
Mara looked at me with her big brown eyes; they seemed huge in comparison to the rest of her pale face, making me feel even smaller than usual. "I don't know. Maybe they did and they were trying to keep it a secret from everyone else until something went wrong – but then again why would anyone want to hide their technology from other civilisations? It seems a little pointless."
"Or maybe they never had space travel at all," I said, almost before I realised that I had started talking. "I mean, look at us – we're barely able to do anything in the stars right now, but the technology is there somewhere if you go looking for it. Maybe they didn't have any of that stuff."
"So why did they come down here then?" asked Mara, her brow furrowed together. "I mean, I know we were scanning through all this data and we saw some ships heading towards Earth just before everything went crazy but how would aliens get here if there wasn't anything in space for them to use as a jumping-off point?"
"I don't know," said Mara. "Maybe they didn't have any way of travelling through the stars, or maybe they did and we just couldn't detect it." She stared at me for a while as if she was waiting for an answer; but I had none so instead I changed my mind and decided to look back at the ship.
"Maybe they wanted some fresh air," I said, trying to find something that seemed plausible in comparison with everything else we'd seen on TV or movies since all this began. "Or maybe they were just curious about what was going on here."
Mara rolled her eyes and sighed heavily, the sound of it filling up every corner of our little room; then she shook her head at me as if I had said something stupid. "No," she said firmly, "I think that ship is looking for us – or maybe just someone in particular. Maybe they want to talk about what happened."
"What?" I asked, taken aback by the thought that some alien civilisation might be interested enough to try and contact us after everything went wrong with Earth. "You mean there was something we missed? Something that would have explained all this?"
Mara shrugged her shoulders, almost looking embarrassed as she did so; it seemed like she didn't want to believe in what she was saying either but I could see that she really thought that maybe aliens were trying to find us. "I don't know," said Mara. "But it seems likely."
"Why would they care?" asked Dan, joining the conversation for the first time since we'd started talking about the ship in the sky. His voice seemed a little louder than usual and I guessed that he had been standing off to one side of us while we'd talked about what might have happened before everything went wrong on Earth; now though, as soon as Mara finished speaking, Dan felt like it was his turn to say something.
"They wouldn't care," said Mara quickly, shaking her head at him and moving slightly closer so that she could speak into my ear instead of Dan's. "If they were looking for us then the most likely thing is that they would have been scanning through our data anyway – but something went wrong with their ship and it ended up coming down here by accident."
"Why would you think they'd be interested in what we found out?" asked Dan, still sounding confused. "There must be hundreds of things that could go wrong when you're travelling at a hundred times the speed of light through space – why wouldn't they just try and figure it all out themselves?"
"Because they don't know everything," said Mara quickly before Dan had a chance to answer her. "Maybe this was their first time in space and they didn't know how things worked when you were travelling at those speeds." I could see that she wanted to keep talking but for the moment she seemed unable to get any words out of her mouth, so instead of saying anything else she turned around to face Dan.
"Dan, can you give me a hand with this?" asked Mara, waving one of his arms towards the door; then she held up an old-fashioned camera in the other hand and pointed it directly at him.
"Why do I need to be doing anything for you?" he complained, trying not to sound too annoyed by her request but failing miserably. "And why are you asking me this anyway? I thought that's what we were supposed to be doing here." He turned and started to walk towards the door again, almost pulling his arm away from Mara; she held onto it firmly though, refusing to let go until he finally stopped moving.
"This is _my_ research," said Mara slowly as if she was trying to make herself clear to Dan before we went any further into our conversation about the alien ship that had just passed us by in space. "I know what I'm doing with this camera and I can work it myself if I want to – but right now I need a hand."
Dan looked at her for a second, his eyes wide open as he stared directly into Mara's; then without saying anything more he started to turn around again until finally he was facing us once more. "Fine," he said, almost in a whisper. "But you need to tell me why I should be doing it."
Mara smiled at him and pointed the camera towards Dan's face; he didn't move as she did so, his eyes still fixed on Mara as if trying to figure out what she was saying or thinking about. "Because this is our chance," whispered Mara, her voice almost a plea now as she spoke into the microphone that had been attached directly to the camera before we left Earth. "The only time in history when we might get any sort of contact with an alien civilisation."
Dan nodded slowly, his eyes still fixed on our camerawoman's
