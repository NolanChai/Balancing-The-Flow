4 red in all the time we lived there. The clock read five o 'clock but I could feel my head throbbing. It always did on the mornings of a shoot, I thought and reached for the remote next to me.
"Morning Ms. Jones." I smiled, even though I didn't have to, I knew she was probably smiling back at me with her sweet southern accent. "Good morning, Mr. Davis," I said back as I turned on the tv. It seemed like every time I heard that voice it would make my heart stop for a moment. My favorite part of waking up in the mornings were the little things like this, and noticing how she would say Mr. instead of just Davis or D. "Do we have a schedule yet?" I asked.
"No not yet, but the producer said he would be here at seven to give it too us." I smiled as the show started up with some ads for coffee and cleaning products. "I heard they were filming over in Europe this morning," she added. I nodded my head. The truth was that we had been talking about doing a commercial together for years now, but never got around to it because of scheduling and the fact that she lived all the way out in L.A. Now that we both lived here it seemed like it would be the perfect time to do this.
"So I hear you are going overseas this afternoon." She said looking at me as if there was something more, "yes ma'am," I said still not knowing what she was talking about. She laughed. I know that she knew I didn't like to be called ma'am but she couldn't help it, I think she found me very charming when we first met and probably thought of me as some kind of sweet southern boy even though I am not from the south at all.
"Well D.," She said changing her tone "I hear that you are going to be doing a commercial in Spain today." "I guess," I laughed, this was the truth but it didn't seem right for me to tell anyone so early on when we were just beginning our relationship together, or what ever it is. "You know what they say about Spaniards." She said with another laugh as if she knew something I did not.
"What's that?" I asked knowing there had to be some sort of joke behind this. "They are very passionate and very hot tempered." The words rolled off her tongue slowly, almost like a snake sliding up to it's prey. She watched as my eyes lit up. Was she talking about more than just the commercial? I wondered.
"Are you kidding me?" "Well," I said with a smile "I guess that depends on who is asking." And there she was smiling right back at me, I could feel my face flush as her blue eyes seemed to bore into mine. I looked away and took a breath trying not to get lost in them.
"So when did you find out?" She asked almost like the one question that would bring an end to everything. "Just now." "I guess this is going to be the first time we will both be together for more then a few hours at least," she said smiling, her eyes still on me as if she could see right into my soul and I hated it.
"Yes ma'am," I managed to say before my voice broke in half. "Well D.," She smiled and now that was the first time that she had called me by my full name and I didn't like how good that felt on my ears, but there was something else going through my mind that made this whole thing feel so strange. "I guess it is time for us to get ready."
"Ok," I said and stood up, leaving the room without another word. As soon as the door closed behind me I began to think about everything she had just said. She knew that this was going to be the first time we would both be alone together without having cameras around or producers there trying to keep us from getting into any trouble.
It felt like a very strange feeling, almost like when you meet someone new and want to know more about them but don't know how to get close enough to find out anything. "And I thought that this was going to be an easy day," she said laughing as she went to the bathroom and began to take her shower. She always had a good sense of humor, even when she was talking about the possibility of me being with some other woman.
"I guess I have been wanting to tell you for a long time now but just couldn't figure out how," she said as if she could read my mind. "What are you trying to say?" I asked confused. She came back into the room wearing her favorite white cotton bra and underwear that showed off every part of her body perfectly, and every part of mine too as she bent over in front of me.
"I've been wanting to tell you for a long time now but just couldn't figure out how." "Tell me what?" I asked almost getting frustrated at this point, if we were going to start off with the jokes and flirting then we may as well get straight into it.
"I think you know," she said looking back at me smiling her sexy little smile that always seemed so good for getting what she wanted out of things. She had a very nice body, and I knew this was going to be the first time that she would ever let me see it without any clothes on. "What are we doing D? Why did you come over here?"
"I'm sorry," she said as if she thought this was somehow my fault and not hers for flirting with a man who was supposedly her best friend at the time, but I could feel myself getting excited at the same time that I began to think about what would happen next. "Just tell me." I said almost begging her to spill everything out of her mouth before she changed her mind and told someone else instead of me first.
"I'm not going to give you all the details," She laughed and then looked up at me with those eyes that always seemed to bring me closer towards her, "but I know what we are doing." I began to wonder if this was something I wanted or needed right now. If I did then would it be ok for someone else to find out?
I knew how bad she liked sex but there had never been anything about our relationship that made me feel uncomfortable in any way, until today when we were both talking as if everything we were going to do together was something new and special. "Tell me." I said almost crying at this point because it was just so hard for me not to ask her outright what she wanted from me.
"We are doing some things that will be very naughty and sexy," She added as if that was all the reason anyone needed to go along with something like this in the first place, but then again I had never seen anyone do anything like this before so maybe it wasn't really as big of a deal. "But you have got to promise me D.," she said as her eyes looked right into mine, and I knew that there was more to come if I did not listen to what she told me next.
"You will never tell anyone about this." She added with another laugh before looking at me again in a different way than before. "I know you'll keep our secret," She said as if it had been the plan all along. I couldn't help but smile, knowing that even though she was joking around with me like this that there would be no telling anyone about what happened next between us until after we were through with everything.
She smiled back at me and then came over to me putting her arms around my shoulders so that our bodies became one against each other as she looked into my eyes again, "and don't worry D.," She said as if she was reading my mind, "I am sure you will love every single minute of it."
I felt the heat rise from between my legs as I thought about what this all meant for me and my life right now. But there was something else that made me feel a little strange too. Was she talking to me like this because she knew that we were going to do more then just get together after work every night? Was it possible that she could be interested in me in some other way than what I had always thought about her before, or maybe even for the first time ever?
She began to kiss my face and neck while still holding onto me like there was no tomorrow. She pulled back from where we were pressed against each other's bodies as she took off her underwear leaving me standing naked in front of her while she looked at every part of me with those same blue eyes that seemed so deep when I was looking right into them before.
I could feel my body starting to shiver as soon as she saw what was down there and then began to do all kinds of strange things with her hands, pulling on the head of my penis while at the same time pushing it back against my stomach until it became hard enough for me to see some kind of liquid coming from where it was rubbing against something inside of me.
"What's this?" She asked as she leaned down closer and began to lick along every inch of skin that I had left exposed by taking off all my clothes earlier before we started talking about how much sexier everything would become once we got started with what was happening next. "I don't
