 disorder. I can 't even stand talking on the phone. 
 It seems as if there is no way out of this world.  
 Until one day, a friend tells me about a job at a store called Gaming World. They need someone with my skill set. 
 
 But how will I survive in public when I can 't even stand being alone? 
 This is the story of how I got that job and why I should get one too.
