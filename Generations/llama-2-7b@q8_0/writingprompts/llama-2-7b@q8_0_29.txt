aves of buildings reached up to touch the sky; no sun could penetrate here. All was dark, save for the few scattered lights from apartment windows. Sonia continued along her path.
At last she saw it: the building where he lived, just ahead on the left side of the path. She hesitated and looked at the structure carefully before proceeding with caution toward the entrance.
The doors were shut tightly. She tried to open them but was unable. She banged on the door with her fists but there was no response from within. The house seemed deserted, yet Sonia knew it would be occupied. She had seen the people who lived here: they passed her as they went in and out of their apartment building. They were very different from herself; she noticed this every time. Their faces were clean, with not a trace of grime on them. And their clothing was immaculate, especially when they walked among the children at school.
Sonia was quite dirty today. It had been raining and she hadn’t gone home to change after school. Her face and hair were damp from the rain; her clothes stuck to her body and itched terribly. She had been too tired to stop and clean herself properly before coming here, and now the children who lived in this building would probably laugh at her as they passed by on their way home.
Sonia felt a surge of anger rise up within her and she banged even more vigorously with her fists on the door. She knew how to break through locked doors; but she stopped short when a hand came out from inside the building, opening one side of the door as if it had been waiting for her signal.
The door opened wider and Sonia could see a shadowy figure standing in the doorway.
“Come in,” the man said with a smile. “It’s getting cold.” He stood aside to let her pass into his building.
Sonia stepped inside, letting her gaze take it all in: from the tiled floor covered in dust and dirt; through the hallway cluttered with old furniture and bags of garbage; upward along the staircase to the apartment where she was going.
Her eyes went wide when she saw him standing there, waiting for her on the landing above. He wore black clothes and had long hair that reached past his shoulders. His face was pale as if he never went outside during the day. He seemed like the kind of person who only left home to go out at night. And yet Sonia recognized him immediately: he was one of the children in her class, but unlike those others his face bore an expression she had not seen there before.
“You’re my friend,” Sonia whispered, staring up at the boy with admiration and wonder.
He smiled down at her; it was a smile that filled her heart with warmth. The feeling of love welled up inside her as if this boy had been waiting for her to come here all along, just so he could show her his affection in this way. She had never felt such strong emotions before and they made her tremble slightly.
“Come on,” he said, taking her hand and leading her toward the door of one of the apartments. “I’ve been waiting for you.” He opened the door and gestured inside with his arm.
Sonia stepped into the apartment that was larger than those she had seen before in this building, but it was filled with just as much clutter. There were shelves full of books, but they were dusty and covered in cobwebs; there were pictures on every wall, many of which seemed to be torn from magazines or newspapers that had been left behind here after the people who lived here moved out. Sonia could smell the dampness in this place as she followed her friend toward a wooden desk with papers scattered across its surface.
She sat down at the desk and looked around the room. The walls were covered in graffiti; some of it was quite beautiful but much of it had been scratched or scribbled over, making it difficult to read what was written there. There were also patches on the wall where someone had tried to cover up an image with white paint only for it later to be uncovered again by whoever had painted over it before.
Sonia couldn’t help but feel a little nervous as she sat down at the desk and waited for her friend to come closer. He stood behind her, looking at her intently; he seemed so familiar that she felt like they knew each other already somehow—and yet there was something about him that made Sonia wary of getting too close, as if this man was not quite real or tangible but more like a ghost from another world.
“I’m glad you came,” he said softly. “You must have been very brave to come here.” He put his arms around her and held on tightly; she could feel how strong he was as their bodies touched together for the first time ever since they had met outside school several weeks before in the street where they lived next door to each other but never spoke until now when something happened that made them realize that maybe it wasn’t so strange after all.
Sonia smiled and leaned forward into his embrace, closing her eyes as she felt him kiss her gently on the lips while stroking her hair with one hand while holding onto her shoulder tightly with another; this was what love felt like—or so she thought until a sudden jolt caused Sonia to open her eyes again only to see something terrible: her friend’s face had turned into that of an animal, its teeth bared as he tried to take hold of her head between his jaws.
Sonia screamed and tried to pull away from him but it was too late; she felt herself being dragged across the floor toward the window where a large black creature waited for them outside in the darkness below—and then they were gone into oblivion…
