ets. They nodded enthusiastically, before running back to their parents as I began handing out the chocolate bars. After I finished one last bag and returned it to its owner with a smile, I looked across at my partner in crime, Paul.
 
 `` Is that enough?'' He asked me after glancing at the bowl of sweets we had made earlier. 
 
 `` Well, they seem pretty happy with it!'' I replied. We had spent the morning making this bowl of chocolates for the kids in our neighbourhood who were going trick or treating that evening. We had started to make one last minute, but thought it would be nice to give them something special to end their night.
 
 `` Let's not get too big-headed; we've been making sweets all day and I think these kids are a bit spoiled!'' Paul laughed.

 `I think they will enjoy the surprise of having handmade chocolates,' I said with a smile.
 
 We sat back to watch our guests return home as the sun set behind us. The sound of fireworks and music drifted over from the next street, which we had seen in the distance earlier on today when the kids were out trick or treating.
 
 ``So what now?'' Paul asked me, getting up to stretch his legs. He walked over to where our bowl of chocolates was and picked it up with a look of admiration in his eyes as he took note of how much had been eaten already.
 
 `Well I'm going to bed, are you coming?'' I asked him as I got up from the chair we sat on earlier. I put my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips for a moment before he smiled back at me with a look of tiredness in his eyes. We had been so busy all day that we hadn't even eaten much throughout it, which is why I thought this would be an ideal time to go to bed.
 
 `Soon enough,' Paul said as he put the bowl down and turned towards me with a grin on his face. He led me over to our sofa and pulled me close before kissing me again passionately, which made my heart flutter in anticipation for what was coming next!
