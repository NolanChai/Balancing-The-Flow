 in the corner next to the bed as if they were the last thing on my mind.

I stepped into the bathroom, turned on the shower and let it heat up for what felt like an eternity, letting the water run down the drain before turning back into the living room.
I pulled out a cigarette from one of the crates of smokes I'd bought earlier and lit it with my Zippo lighter which had been engraved with my initials; 'Z'. It was in my hand, now, as I walked to the bedroom again where there were some clothes that I'd picked up from a local store.
I threw them on and went to sit on the balcony which overlooked a busy street, it was early afternoon and people were out doing their daily business; rushing here and there in order to get things done.
The smoke curled around my lips and I took another drag from my cigarette, it was just after noon, I'd been up since six o'clock this morning and it felt like it had only just happened.
It wasn't as if I was complaining; being a hitman for the mafia was rewarding work. It paid well and at times I found myself having fun in the job.
I sat there, watching the people pass by and thought of my two latest victims that day; one had been a business man who'd been on his way to buy a new car when I'd managed to push him out in front of it while he was crossing the road, the second had been a girl; she'd been waiting for her boyfriend outside a bar and I'd waited until they'd left before going in.
I knew how the job worked so didn't feel any guilt over taking their lives. The mafia wouldn't care either way, there were plenty more who wanted to fill our places if we died, it was just part of the job.
I sat there for a few minutes longer and took another drag from my cigarette before tossing it back on the balcony, it landed next to some other smokes that I'd thrown down after finishing them the previous evening.
I picked up my phone and called one of my contacts at the mafia who was in charge of all our assassinations, he answered after just two rings.
"Z, how are things?" he asked, his voice sounding as if it were full of static.
"Good, we're having some problems with the Russians at the moment," I replied. 
 
 "We can send some men to handle that for you."

"No, I need them myself," I said before walking back inside and locking the door behind me.
I went downstairs into the garage where there was a car waiting for me; it was black with tinted windows. I opened the driver's side door and sat down, it took me less than two minutes to reach my destination and when I did I saw that they were already waiting outside. 
 
 *It's nice of them* I thought as I approached them and walked up to one of the men who was standing next to a black BMW with tinted windows and had been holding an AK-47 in his hand; he'd pulled it off at my approach.
"Your man is here," he said, speaking in Italian while gesturing towards me. 
 
 "What do you want?" I asked him, my Italian accent heavy but not so thick that they couldn't understand what I was saying.
"I was told to take the car," he replied and pointed towards a man standing beside one of his other men who had been holding a suitcase in one hand while brandishing a Glock pistol with the other.
"No, you were told wrong; it stays here." 
 
 *The Russians will be annoyed* I thought as I watched him walk over and open the car door for me. The man who had been holding the suitcase walked towards my car and I opened the passenger side door for him to get in, he looked at me for a moment before stepping inside and closing the door behind him. 
 
 "Get moving," I said as I closed the driver's door and walked over to where the Russian was standing with his men. 
 
 *The Russians won't like that* I thought again as we began to drive away from the area, we were going in a different direction from what they would have wanted us to take but it wasn't far before my contact on the phone spoke up.
"Z," he said and I could hear him through the earpiece that I had strapped underneath my helmet for this job which was made of Kevlar with a tinted visor to protect me from any bullets or shrapnel from grenades.

"Go ahead." 
 
 "I need you back at HQ in ten minutes," he said. 
 
 *Already?* I thought but there was no point arguing with him; this would have been a stupid move on my part as the Russians would have seen us and may try to kill me.
"Understood, we're coming back," I said before looking over at my driver who's name was Paul, he had blonde hair that reached his shoulders and was thin, but strong-looking.
I glanced down at the man in the suitcase next to me and saw him staring up at me through his sunglasses with a look of annoyance on his face; I smiled at him, trying not to let it show that he had been right in wanting to have the car for himself. 
 
 *Such an ego* I thought as Paul drove us back towards our HQ which was only a few miles away from where we were now.
