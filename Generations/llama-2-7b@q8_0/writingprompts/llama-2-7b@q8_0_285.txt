3 years ago. They would be happy to have her back.
I’m a father now. Not just any dad, but the type that’s all alone in this world. My ex wife has remarried and lives out in Arizona with her new husband. I couldn’t tell you which state she resides in because I don’t know how to pronounce it.
My daughter is a precious little thing, full of life, and constantly on the go. She was born on April 25th, two weeks prematurely. The nurse told me that she had been dead twice before they got her back from the operating table. I’m not sure how one could die twice in the same situation. It makes no sense to my brain and is a contradiction of terms.
It’s amazing what parents will do for their kids. Even now, if anyone else were to come into this bar, even my own mother, they would have to be armed with some serious muscle to take my daughter from me. My wife, the woman who gave birth to my beautiful little girl, is an abomination on humanity. She has betrayed and disgraced herself as a human being, but more importantly she has let my baby down by her inability to protect her own.
“I’m going to bed.” I mumbled to myself, before adding, “She’s not sleeping for the next few hours anyway.” My daughter is so tiny and light that when she wakes up from one of her nap time naps, it takes an hour or more for her to gain consciousness. It’s like she has a little switch inside of her that she can turn on and off at will, though I doubt my baby ever will. She is all too happy in the crib in front of her television playing with her pacifier.
My wife was a big fan of the Disney Channel when we were dating. That’s how they got me hooked on it as well. My daughter and I watch it together everyday while my wife works from home at her job as a telephone sex line operator. It was actually her idea for us to be together like this. She wanted the baby around, but she didn’t want any part of the raising process. I suppose that’s what happens when you cheat on your husband and leave him alone with an infant who has yet to learn how to walk properly.
My daughter was screaming in her crib, “Dad!” I had been hearing this a lot lately. She was going through a phase where she wanted me all the time. I tried to convince myself that it was just because I was home more often now with my wife working from home and not wanting anything to do with us.
I grabbed her bottle off of the floor in front of the TV, where it had fallen out of her tiny hands while she was playing with her pacifier. She never dropped them for long, so I knew that there would be one somewhere nearby. She screamed as loudly and frantically as if a burglar were in our house trying to steal our things. She has been doing this quite often lately too.
I walked into my daughter’s room with the bottle of formula in my hand, when I heard her start to cry. It was a different type of crying from before. This was one of the many emotional cries that she has been putting on display for us since our last argument. My wife and I got into it over the phone, which is how we talk with each other these days. We are still not physically together as husband and wife. It’s too painful.
I set the bottle down onto her changing table to clean up my mess from earlier in the day when she dropped it on the floor and I had to wipe it off of my shoe with a rag that was sitting next to me there for just such an occasion as this one. It’s amazing how much blood we humans can produce without any warning.
I walked into her room, sat down in front of her crib, and pulled out the pacifier she had dropped before her bottle fell on my foot earlier that morning. I handed it to her, watching for a response from her lips or eyes as she took it from me with both hands. Her mouth was open wide with tears running down each side of her face, but nothing came from them.
I thought about the time when I first met my wife and we were living in an old rented trailer together. She had been working at a hotel that I went to several times during our relationship and after she left there for the day, she would come home with bottles of wine under her arms. They were big, red bottles of wine that used to be stored on shelves in an old warehouse where we worked together before moving here to this city a few years ago.
I remember one time when my wife was so drunk that she tried to have sex with me while I was sleeping next to her and it was the only way for us to get through those long days of being apart from each other as much as we were then because of our jobs. It wasn’t until after we moved here where we found ourselves with more free time together than ever before in our relationship that things started getting really bad between us, but I suppose that was always going to happen sooner or later anyway even though we both thought it would never be this way between two people who loved each other so much at first sight like we did.
I grabbed the pacifier from my daughter’s mouth and stuck it back into hers before taking her bottle in hand again, but when I turned around to leave she was still sitting there crying with no response coming out of her lips or eyes despite everything that had just happened between us earlier today on the phone where we got into it over something stupid like how much money should be spent on baby formula for one bottle per day instead of two because it makes more sense since she doesn’t always drink all of hers every morning when I get home from work or sometimes even during dinner time if we end up having any leftovers left over after we eat them already which usually happens once in awhile due to our hectic schedules that don’t allow much room for cooking anymore like they used too.
I took the pacifier out of her mouth one last time before leaving her alone crying into her pillow while I walked away from this place and went back home with my wife where we would try once again to make things work between us as husband and wife because that’s all there is left for us now after everything else has failed so many times over these past few years.
