, I am reborn in the body of another human being and left to live out whatever time that person has left on earth before they meet their maker.
My father is an angel, my mother died shortly after my birth from a car crash (yes, I have seen her dead body and no she wasn't a vampire.) And in case you are wondering, yes, my dad is the good kind of angel - the guardian kind and he can't protect me from everything. I had a very nice life before all this started happening to me and now it's like being stuck on a treadmill with a cheetah chasing me for eternity.
It began when my father came into the hospital room of one of his patients, Mr. Sullivan, in the middle of the night. As you might imagine, I was quite surprised to see him there but he told me that it was time that we had a little talk and he showed me his wings. He also explained how this "job" works for him and as I watched my father die - yes, even angels can die - and be reborn into the body of Mr. Sullivan I realized why he could never marry my mother, or have kids. It was too much responsibility to take on in addition to his current job and all that it entailed. And, as a result, he chose me.
As if that wasn't enough, my father also explained that there are demons out there who want to steal the souls of humans like me so they can use them to wreak havoc on our planet. So now I have to protect humanity from those evil bastards and the only way to do that is to try to make each life worth living while I am in it, because I don't know how much time I actually have left before another angel takes my place - and, believe me, there are a lot of people who would rather be dead than be stuck with my superpower!
 
 It was at that point that I made a decision. If you want to be the hero in someone's life then you better make it worth living. So this is what I do: 
 * I protect humans from demon attacks.
 * I try and bring some goodness into people's lives.
 * I teach them how to defend themselves if they are attacked.
 * I find the ones who would rather be dead than alive - usually young girls or boys who have been sexually abused, abandoned, tortured or starved - and give them a purpose in life that will bring light into their darkness so they can look forward to living another day.
 * I tell all of my charges about the demons out there who want nothing more than to steal our souls away and turn us into one of their minions and then use those people to attack innocent humans.
 
 So this is my story. My journey through life, trying to do a little good every day so that when it comes time for me to die - or be born again as someone else - I can live with myself knowing that I have made the world just a little better than the way that I found it. I am Jacob Black and this is my life!
 
 Chapter 1: My First Day In The Life Of Jacob Black!
 
 So, here goes nothing! It's not every day that you find out that your entire existence is based upon protecting humans from demons. So, let me tell you a little about myself and how all this started before we move on to the reason why I am here in the first place. I was born Jacob Black but when my mother died of cancer shortly after my birth - I know she didn't have it, that was just what everyone said so they would stop asking me questions about her death, my father decided not to give me a middle name or a nickname. He just called me "Jacob" and never stopped doing so until he met his maker in 1978.
That's how I got this whole thing started - my superpower was a way for him to keep an eye on me without having to constantly be there every step of the way, which would have been impossible as well as dangerous when you are guarding the souls of mortals from being stolen by demons. My father chose to pass his "gift" down to me, but I can't really say it was a gift - more like a curse or a responsibility if anything at all because my life has been an unending succession of one bad thing after another that sometimes makes the entire human race seem worth saving and other times makes me wish I had never been born!
You might be wondering why my father didn't just leave me with someone else to raise, like he did his own brother and sister. Well, the answer is simple: It was too dangerous for anyone but a guardian angel to take on this job - not because they couldn't protect us from demons, but because when you are guarding humans in this manner your life span becomes very short indeed if you allow yourself to become emotionally attached to them. So, my father was always there at the end of every single one of his "charges" lives and that is why he has so many angels' wings adorning his coffin when they put him into it after he passed away in 1978 - although I am not sure how anyone would know which set of them belong to which person as all these things tend to blend together over time.
So, here is what happened the day my father came into that hospital room and explained everything about who he was and why he needed me! As soon as my dad died and I started being reborn into Mr. Sullivan's body (I will explain how this works in another chapter) I noticed something strange right away - even though I was now an old man with gray hair, there were no wrinkles on his face or anywhere else for that matter! So what the hell? How do you get old without showing it?
 
 Well, after some research and a few more visits to see Mr. Sullivan in person (who turned out to be my first human charge) I learned exactly how this works: It has something to do with guardian angels' wings, although no one really knows why they don't show up when you get older - at least not yet anyway. But here is what we know so far about how these things work: 
 * When a human dies and meets their maker (like my dad did in 1978) their body goes through some sort of transformation process that causes the physical effects associated with old age to be reversed or at least delayed until such time as they are born again into another person's body.
 * The soul then leaves its original body and enters into a new one which is reborn every seventy years so long as it is guarded by a guardian angel who protects that human from being stolen by demons who want nothing more than to steal our souls away in order to turn us into their minions and then use those people to attack innocent humans!
 * Once an angel is assigned this particular job there are no other jobs they can take on because it would be too dangerous for them or anyone else if one of these "charges" got hurt while being protected by someone who isn't an angel. So, that's why I have always been alone with my responsibilities - at least until recently anyway!
 
 So, now you know how this works and what I do when I die! Now, let me tell you a little bit about myself before moving on to the reason why I am here in the first place. I am not going to lie: It's hard being an angel and it is even harder for someone like me who was born without wings but still has to protect humans from demons every day! But, as long as there are innocent people out there who need my help - no matter how much of a burden that can sometimes be on their shoulders - then I will continue doing what I do best: Helping others and making this world just a little better than the way that I found it.
 
 So, let's start at the beginning! My first day in the life of Jacob Black was when my father came into Mr. Sullivan's room at night to explain everything about who he was and why he needed me - but before we get there let us talk a little bit about how angels work so you have some idea of what I am talking about here: 
 * Angels are beings that live in Heaven with God. They are created by Him as well when He needs someone to protect humans from demons who want nothing more than to steal our souls away in order to turn us into their minions and then use those people to attack innocent humans!
 * When an angel is assigned this particular job there are no other jobs they can take on because it would be too dangerous for them or anyone else if one of these "charges" got hurt while being protected by someone who isn't an angel. So, that's why I have always been alone with my responsibilities - at least until recently anyway!
 * When a human dies and meets their maker (like my dad did in 1978) their body goes through some sort of transformation process that causes the physical effects associated with old age to be reversed or at least delayed until such time as they are born again into another person's body.
 * The soul then leaves its original body and enters into a new one which is re
