ly forehead with a hand. `` It's my favorite memory ever, just us here on this bench.''
  
 `` That's so weird,'' the girl whispered. `` I don't have any memories of this place. But I guess that was because it was you who took me there in the first place. ''
   
 `` Didn't I? '' he asked, rubbing his chin and squinting at her. The street light flickered, making them both laugh as if they had just heard a funny joke.
    
 `` I guess we have no memories of this place together because you didn't take me there,'' the girl said in a sad voice. 
   
 `` But that was only the first time here.''  
 
`` It doesn't really matter if I remember or not now. Because it's the last time, right?'' she asked him.  
  
 The boy nodded slowly and sighed softly. He tucked a lock of his dirty brown hair behind her ear with one hand while he ran his fingers through hers with the other.
   
 `` I never thought it would come to this. But then again, maybe it was always supposed to end like this. '' 
  
 She couldn't help but feel sorry for him, so she took a hold of his hand and held onto it tightly as he continued talking. 
    
`` There were times I thought we were the same, you know? We could have been like the same person. You know how sometimes when you dream something is real? It was like that with us. I don't want to go on living if that's what it means to be alone. '' 
   
The boy and girl sat silently as they watched a train whiz by them, heading out into the night, leaving nothing but emptiness behind in its wake. 
    
``But we can be together again one day,'' she said softly, leaning close to him so he could feel her warm breath on his cheek. `` We'll always have each other. '' 
  
``That's not what I want. '' The boy snapped back quickly, pulling away from the girl and staring at her with a strange look in his eyes that she had never seen before. `` You can't just leave me here alone like this!'' 
   
She was about to say something in return but stopped herself when he suddenly turned around to face her once more and took both of her hands in his own, rubbing them gently between his calloused palms as tears streamed down his cheeks.
     
 `` Don't worry about me,'' she told him with a sad smile on her lips that hid the pain of watching him cry. 
    
``You will always be my favorite memory and nothing can ever change that!''
