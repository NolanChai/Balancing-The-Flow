 your house today. '' The voice on the other end said softly and politely, while at the same time I could feel a sting of irritation and resentment radiating from my cell phone. It was all happening so fast that I found myself asking the question again before I realized what I'd asked: 
 `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 The voice on the other end of the line explained, patiently and carefully as though she were speaking with a small child. 
 `` I'm sorry Ma'am but it looks like your loan is just not going to close today. Our underwriter says he can't meet you at this time. '' And before I could protest or ask another question the line went dead, leaving me standing in my kitchen, staring out over the empty sink as though the water had left a vacuum behind it. 
 
 A few moments later I heard my phone ringing on the countertop next to me and without thinking I picked up the receiver. `` Hello? '' I said, stupidly. 
 `` Ma'am this is the banker who was supposed to come with you today. Is there any way that I can still meet your loan?'' A voice asked, softly and patiently on the other end of the line. 
 `` No thanks. Have a nice day. '' And then I hung up the phone and put it down, not even bothering to shut off the ringer. 
 I stood there for several minutes staring into space. My head was reeling from what had just happened. It still hadn't sunk in yet. And then I started crying, the tears running slowly down my cheeks like rain on a rainy day. The kind of cry you feel but do not show - it's as though they are running out your eyes but coming up through the back of your throat and dripping all over your lips, tasting salty. 
 I went to my bedroom and shut the door behind me. And there I laid down on the carpeted floor and cried until my tears dried up and I couldn't cry anymore. 
 The phone rang a short while later but I did not pick it up. Instead I walked out into the living room and picked up an old copy of People magazine off the couch to read. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon on a warm summer day. It had been hot all week and now, for once, that heat had actually come with some nice weather as well. The kind where you just want to sit around outside and relax and do nothing at all. 
 I flipped through People and then, realizing it was about four o'clock in the afternoon and the mailman would be making his rounds soon, I went back into my bedroom and sat down on the floor next to my open suitcase. It was a cheap black case, one with two handles that folded up and held closed by snaps at the top. 
 In the suitcase were all of my worldly possessions: a few dresses, some underwear, some nightgowns, some jeans, a pair of sneakers, an old winter coat, a handful of jewelry and several pieces of paperwork I'd need to prove who I was. It had been five years since my divorce but I still hadn't filed all the paperwork to get it finalized. And in that time I'd moved from place to place, each new house smaller than the last as money and luck evaporated. 
 Still though, at that moment in my life I had enough clothes and jewelry and cash to leave me well off for a while if I was careful with it. And I would be. 
 The doorbell rang a few moments later and I walked into the living room and opened the front door. There standing outside on my porch steps, dressed in jeans and a nice button down shirt and a baseball cap that said ``Pennsylvania Real Estate'' was the real estate agent who'd been coming to look at my house all week long. 
 He smiled up at me and stepped inside, his sneakers crunching on the gravel driveway as he came in. `` Hi there. I was beginning to worry about you! '' His smile had a familiarity that made me feel uncomfortable for a moment before I realized who it was and how I knew him so well - I'd met him last week at my house while he was doing his first walkthrough, the one where they come in and make sure everything is alright with the place. 
 `` Hi,'' I said, forcing myself to smile back. I sat down on the couch next to my suitcase, leaving a wide open space between us. `` It's okay, it was just a bad day, that's all. '' 
 `` Well,'' he smiled again. He walked across the living room and came over to where I was sitting. `` I hope you don't mind if I sit down. '' And so I invited him to sit down next to me on the couch. We sat there for a moment in silence and then I said: 
 `` So what can I do for you?'' I said, my voice sounding strange even to my own ears. It was deep and throaty, almost like an old woman's or an alcoholic man's. I thought that if I hadn't already known him I would have assumed he was gay. 
 He looked at me for a moment. His eyes were bright blue and seemed to stare right through into my soul. `` Well,'' he began after a few moments of silence. `` You know I come here every day this week? '' And so I nodded yes, even though I hadn't known it until now. 
 He looked at me for another moment and then he continued: 
 `` Ma'am, you need to sell that house. There are a lot of people interested in it but no one wants to buy without your being there - because they know it won't close today, or any other day for the rest of this week or even next.'' His voice was very calm and soothing as he spoke. It was the kind of voice I'd want a doctor to have if I ever had to go in for surgery, the kind that made me trust everything they said. 
 ``What about my loan?'' I asked him, my eyes focused on his face. He looked away from me then and stared out into space, seemingly unseeing of anything else in the room with us. His voice was flat and emotionless as he spoke: 
 `` Ma'am, we have to close today or you will be charged a fee for failing to close on time. '' And that was all I needed to hear. It was the last straw - the breaking point of everything my life had been going through in the past two years. For so long now I'd tried so hard not to think about it, and even more not to cry about it. But now the tears came again as he spoke those words: `` Ma'am, you need to sell that house!'' 
 I sat there for a moment - frozen in time as my mind worked furiously over what it was I could possibly do to help him understand. I thought of all the money we were losing by not selling it right away and I thought about how much trouble it had caused me already, with everything that happened this week when I wasn't there to meet the prospective buyers. It was a lot - I mean a lot. And so I said: 
 `` Okay, I can do that! But what if you don't sell?'' he asked me, looking at me again and then back out into space. His voice had lost all its warmth and emotion but it wasn't because of anger or frustration either - just a flatness that told me this was a man who knew exactly what he wanted to say and nothing else. 
 I shook my head yes, nodding again to show him that I understood where he was going with the question. `` Well Ma'am,'' he said. And then in one fluid motion he stood up from his seat on the couch, walked across the room and picked up my suitcase off the floor next to me. He opened it up and held out a stack of papers to me. 
 They were the paperwork I needed to sell my house - the paperwork that would make everything official once we closed the deal on it: A copy of the deed, my name and address and Social Security number and so forth. 
 He handed them over to me as though they were a present he was giving me for being such an agreeable person today; one who understood where things were going in life now and didn't fight against it but rather embraced it fully instead. `` I know this isn't easy, Ma'am - but if you could just sign these papers I can guarantee your house will sell. '' And so without further hesitation I signed them as he watched me do so from across the room. 
 He smiled at me again and then walked out of my house, shutting the front door behind him before walking back down to his car in the driveway. His smile had a kindness about it that made me want to cry some more but also one that let me know he knew just what I was going through - even though I didn't actually tell him anything at all about any of my problems. 
 And so I did sell my house and soon after
