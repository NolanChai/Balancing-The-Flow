loon that is my reputation just because someone wanted to know my story so bad. Besides, why spoil their fun and entertainment with my trials and tribulations now would they?
So i tell them of course how great my life is. I tell them about my lavish lifestyle and the amount of money i earn that makes me such a successful business man. The sad thing is most do not realize i am lying to them. I can only hope they never figure it out because if they did it might ruin all this fun i have with making them think of me as being so great.
The truth about my life is it was never that easy and has been filled with struggle, hardship and a lot of times failure. The difference between the two sides of me? I'm just smart enough to know what to tell people and when its okay to tell the truth. In business it is often very important that you do not show all your cards at once or else you might be busted by your opponents. This has taught me how to keep a little secret from most people. The biggest mistake i have made in my life was telling the wrong person what was going on and having them tell everyone. Now i can only hope that this does not happen to you because if it did you would soon find out just how bad your life is.
You see, everyone has their secrets and no one wants people knowing about those secrets. So for me its important that i keep my business dealings on the down low so as not to be busted by competitors who might then tell my clients what a big loser i really am. It would n't do to have all of them jumping ship and leaving you stuck holding a very empty sack. So for me its best to keep that little secret from everyone except those few people that can be trusted.
If your a business man or woman then you might want to remember this lesson as well because it is a good one to learn. As with my story and life, the more secrets i had to keep from others made me have to make sure all of them were kept very close to the vest and not even told to anyone who was not supposed to know. Its funny how everyone can be such good friends but when it comes down to money they will soon find out just how bad a person you really are. It has always been that way and i think most people have found this to be true as well.
I do hope you enjoyed my little story about my life and the secrets i keep. If you want to know more of whats going on with me or anyone else for that matter, just ask them directly. I promise they will tell you everything from top to bottom without holding back anything at all. It would n't do for any of us to start lying now because we have always been so honest in the past.
