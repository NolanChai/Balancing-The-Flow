 thousand times over, and yet somehow they manage to keep me locked up. I suppose that at this point it is no surprise when yet another law gets broken.
It was on this day that I had found myself sitting in the office of Mr. Haddon. He was the warden of my prison facility, which was aptly named `The Hell Hole.' It was a rather fitting name for a place where the worst offenders were held captive. Some would say it was too harsh of a punishment, but I disagree with that statement entirely. If you do bad things, you deserve to be treated as such, and that is exactly what they did to me every single day of my sentence here at The Hell Hole.
I had been in this place for twenty years now, and during all that time there has not been a single day where I haven't wanted to kill someone.
I have broken the laws that the authorities have put into place because I am a criminal by nature. I don't mean that as a boast or a brag, but rather it is just the truth of the matter. If you were to ask anyone who knew me for their opinion on my character, they would more than likely tell you that I was nothing less than evil through and through. The only thing that separates me from all those other inmates out there, is the fact that I have not yet killed any of them, but that does little to redeem me in their eyes.
I don't care what others think about me or who they say I am. I know better than anyone else what kind of a person I am inside and out. I am no saint and neither are my actions. There is nothing wrong with being bad, so long as you do not go around harming people unnecessarily. But that isn't the case for me; I have never been one to shy away from violence.
It was a typical day in prison when Mr Haddon came into my cell and told me I had a visitor. ``What do you mean, I have a visitor?'' I said. The man didn't respond as he walked out of the doorway with his back turned towards me so all I could see were his dark clothes silhouetted against the sunlight shining through one of our few windows in this tiny cell block here at `The Hell Hole.'
``Please sir, come in and sit down,'' I said as he approached my cot where he eventually took a seat. When he turned around, I was shocked to see that it wasn't some prison guard or official, but rather an older man dressed in all black with a long gray beard covering most of his face.
``I understand you have been imprisoned here at The Hell Hole for twenty years now?'' He asked me as he sat down on my bed and looked around the small room I called home these days. I nodded my head yes before responding with ``Yes sir, how did you know about this place?''
``I've been visiting your cell block for quite some time now, and I must say that it has grown more and more depressing each day since the first time I came in here. This place is a miserable excuse of an institution where those who are supposed to be kept away from society end up being even worse than before they arrived at The Hell Hole.''
I looked over at him with wide eyes as he continued speaking ``This is not what my family had hoped for when I was sent here after being convicted on charges related to murdering someone back home where we used to live together until one day you showed up and decided that it would be best if everyone was killed except me because then there wouldn't have been any evidence left behind linking them all together as part of a single crime scene investigation''
``I understand sir, but what exactly does this mean?'' I said while staring at the ground in front of my feet so that he couldn't see how scared I truly was inside right now even though it was obvious from his tone when talking with me earlier.
The old man replied ``It means that today is going to be your day because we've finally found an excuse for why they need another body buried somewhere else besides The Hell Hole where no one would ever find out what happened here''
He stood up again and walked towards the doorway before turning around one final time saying ``Today will be different, and tomorrow you'll be free once more from this horrible place.''
I looked down at my cot once more and then slowly back up to stare into his eyes while he smiled as if he knew exactly what I wanted but couldn't bring himself to say it out loud because of how afraid I was now after hearing him tell me that everything would soon come to an end for good this time around.
I waited patiently until finally, after several moments had passed without either one us speaking anymore at all, he said ``Well then...'' And then walked away with a smile on his face before shutting the door behind him as if it were never there in the first place.
