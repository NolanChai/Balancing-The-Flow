led beaker and poured a half-inch of clear liquid into the flask. He started shaking the beaker. ``Ten seconds.''
 
 I nodded to Jack, he started adding water, as did the other guys, and we started again. 
 
 `` We're missing something.'' Hank said as he shook the beaker. 
 
 `` What?'' I asked. He glanced over at me with a smile. 
 
 `` Look, I know it doesn't make sense to you guys but that's what I say. We're missing something and we need to find out what.'' I looked around the room, everyone was shaking their beakers as if they were doing something important. 
 
 ``What about the formula? What does it say?'' Jack asked. Hank nodded at him, and he smiled. The two of them kept shaking their beakers as the water levels rose. I did too. The others weren't paying attention to me so I started thinking. 
 
 `` If you guys are missing something...'' 
 
 Everyone stopped and looked at me. 
 
 `` How about a distraction?'' I asked, and Jack started laughing. Hank nodded but the other two didn't look amused. They didn't laugh, just smiled and kept on shaking their beakers. The water rose in the flasks as we worked. We were down to ten seconds now, no more than five or six and I felt sweat drip down my spine. 
 
 ``What do you mean?'' Hank asked. 
 
 I smiled at him, nodded to Jack who looked back at me, he gave a thumbs up. We all started shaking the beakers in unison. The water rose and I was sweating, my forehead slick with droplets as we all started counting down in our heads, ten seconds left now. Hank was almost done when he suddenly dropped his beaker. It didn't break but it clattered to the floor and shards of glass sprinkled over his boots. 
 
 The water sloshed and he yelled ``Shit!'' Everyone turned around, except for me. I continued working as Hank ran to the sink to wash out his eyes while Jack and I kept on adding water. Five seconds now... 
 
 ``Fucking hell!'' Hank exclaimed, running back with a paper towel in hand. He pressed it against his face but he couldn't get every bit of glass out. It had gotten into his hair too, stuck between the strands and was digging deeper than the towel could reach. He dropped that as well and reached for another one but then I saw him staring at me, a frown on his face. 
 
 ``What?'' I asked. 
 
 Everyone looked at me now... 
 
 ``Fucking hell!'' Hank said again, and walked over to the sink where he started scrubbing his hair with shampoo, trying to get it out of there. He was breathing heavily through clenched teeth. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a pencil, it was the only thing I had and I tried to keep working on my flask but every time I looked up Hank would look at me as if he could see right through me or something, he didn't want me there anymore. 
 
 Jack smiled and walked over, sat down in one of the empty stools and watched me, his eyes glued to mine, his smile creeping wider and I started thinking, wondering what the hell was wrong with everyone but I knew. I just...I don't know how or why or even if it was real but somehow they all saw me as some kind of monster, something unnatural that had invaded their world. 
 
 Jack laughed. He winked at me and then turned back to Hank. I kept on working the pencil around in my hand as I added more water into the flask. My hands were shaking a little now and I had no idea what was wrong with everyone else except that they were scared of me for some reason...
 
 Jack leaned over to one side, his elbow resting on the edge of the stool's backrest as he looked at Hank who still stood at the sink. He started laughing and I felt my heart pick up its pace a bit more. The pencil slipped from my grasp and fell onto the floor, but I didn't notice until it hit. 
 
 ``What?'' Jack asked. Hank turned to him with that same frown on his face. It was like he hated me for some reason and it was infectious, getting under my skin too. Maybe it was just because I knew what they were all thinking; that there was something wrong with me. 
 
 ``I don't know.'' Jack shrugged as Hank walked over to the table where he had left his pencil on top of the flask. He picked up the pen and wrote down a number, 186, then crossed it out and started writing again. I kept working but I was sweating now, my hands were slippery and the glass felt as if it were going to slide out at any second and I would cut myself on one of the shards. Hank kept his eyes on me as he worked. 
 
 The other two guys watched us with their mouths open. 
 
 ``What?'' Jack asked, still staring at him. Hank nodded, then looked back at me and wrote down another number, 927. He smiled at that and put the pen back on top of the flask as he walked over to us, where he sat back in the stool next to Jack. The foreman stood behind him with a clipboard in his hand, looking down at Hank's work. He checked it against what was written there, then nodded. 
 
 ``Good job guys.'' Hank said. We all looked up and smiled. He patted me on the back. I didn't like that touch but I smiled anyway. 
 
 ``Go on break, guys. Water's in. Go home.'' Everyone started getting up, but I stayed sitting down. Jack leaned over to talk with Hank. The foreman nodded and walked out as the guys left. Jack sat back into his stool and looked at me again. 
 
 ``You okay?'' He asked. 
 
 I wanted to say yes, I did not want to be like this but something was different now; I was different somehow. Something had changed since...since that day on the roof. It was as if a door inside my head had been unlocked or opened and now whatever it was, was out there in the open again and I could see it. I could feel it too; like someone else was watching me but not with hatred anymore, this time they wanted to help. 
 
 Hank kept staring at me as if he knew what had changed inside of me, or maybe it was his gaze that caused the change in the first place. Either way, I felt different now and I didn't like it. 
 
 Jack smiled. 
 
 ``I think I know what's wrong with you but not how to help.'' He said. Hank started laughing again. 
 
 ``What? What's funny?'' Jack asked. The foreman was standing just behind him now and he put his hand on my shoulder as we walked out of the room, into a corridor where Jack turned around to speak with me. I shook it off and kept walking with him. We didn't say anything else until we were outside again. 
 
 ``You need to get rid of that thing'' Hank called after us but Jack just shook his head and looked down at the ground, his eyes wide as he tried to figure out what it was about me that had changed everything for him. 
 
 I didn't know myself but...something was wrong. It was in my head now, in my mind and heart and soul...but not all of me. Not yet. Not like before. But something was different now. Something inside was missing. Maybe it was the monster that had been awakened or maybe I was just seeing it for what it was now; a part of myself that had been asleep, waiting to be awoken. 
 
 Jack turned back around and waved at Hank who nodded and smiled. He didn't say anything else until we were outside. Then he pointed over towards the dumpster where I had seen him talking with the other man before. There was no one else there now though and they must have left because... 
 
 The door was open. It wasn't like that when I went down to it earlier; the lid of the dumpster was closed, but now it sat wide open. I walked over towards it, my shoes sinking into the grass as I did so. Jack followed behind me and we stood at its edge for a moment. 
 
 ``What?'' He asked. 
 
 ``You saw him earlier, didn't you? The man who was talking with Hank?'' I said as I turned around to face Jack again. His eyes were wide as he
