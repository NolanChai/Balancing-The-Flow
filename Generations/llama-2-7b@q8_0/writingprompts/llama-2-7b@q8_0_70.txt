ckets of a few individuals.
Then other idiots tried to kill each others for money, and they succeeded too. It is still happening, but I believe that it will end soon because its profitability is going down quickly.
Now some people try to cause mental pain by causing emotional suffering in their victims and they succeed too. But since it happens in digital world it is hard to identify them as criminals, even if they are. This crime is more likely to happen to businesses than individuals because of the nature of modern society and technology.
I don’t think that there is anything that can be done about this problem except trying to eliminate the causes of suffering.
For example, in the past people suffered a lot from starvation and disease, but now it is not so common. However some idiots still try to cause mental pain by making these sufferings happen or threatening their victims with them. This crime is happening too often. The solution is to make sure that everyone has enough food and medicine available and safe water supply.
Another problem is that many people are in extreme poverty, and they have no chance to avoid becoming a victim of digital criminals even if they wanted it so badly because it is easier for them to live by begging on the streets rather than working for something valuable enough to pay their bills. That’s why most victims of online scammers are from third world countries.
In conclusion, I don't believe that this crime will be solved anytime soon and we need to do everything we can to help those who suffer from it right now because otherwise they might end up being killed by these criminals if nothing changes soon enough..
