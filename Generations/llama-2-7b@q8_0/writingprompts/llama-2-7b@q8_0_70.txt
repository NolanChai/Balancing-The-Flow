ation by a superior officer. His speech was clipped and precise, and his bearing one of a soldier's soldier. ``The information has been collated from numerous sources. There are several indications that the information we seek may be forthcoming.''
``Where?''
Captain Knight Ronalde gave an orderly's salute. ``Sir, there is strong evidence to indicate that the target may be a ship of one of the three major sea powers, the United States, Great Britain or France.''
``It must be the United States then, sir.'' The captain had never before been on speaking terms with his superiors; the thought made him uncomfortable. ``Do you know anything about our target?''
The officer leaned back in his chair and crossed one leg over the other, looking at the captain as if he were a child. ``Sir, we have no idea where it is.''
``Then how can I give the orders to attack?''
The man smiled. His teeth flashed white against the tan of his face. ``You won't be giving the orders, Captain Ronalde. You will follow them as ordered.''
