 to her knees on wet grass and pressed her forehead against it; the coolness of which made her feel slightly better. She shook her head and tried to shake away the sensations but was unsuccessful.
“Lilac, Lilac. I need you to come with me. Please.”
Lilac looked up from where she’d fallen to the ground as a dark shape appeared through the mist of rain; it seemed to be coming closer. It seemed familiar…
Her heart hammering in her chest and hands clenching tightly into fists, Lilac leaped to her feet as the figure came within view. Her breath caught in her throat when she realised that what she was looking at couldn’t possibly be true… She was staring at a human figure but not just any human figure.
“Lilac? Lilac?”
She watched, with wide eyes as the figure took three quick steps towards her before kneeling down and holding out his hands. The scent of rotten fish filled her nostrils as she took another step backward to put distance between them. He was a demon. She had known that he would come for her; after all it wasn’t long ago she’d been warned by the Council about him, but she hadn’t expected the nightmare to be so real!
“Come with me.” The creature commanded as his hand reached out and grabbed her shoulder. “Please…”
She shook off his grip and stumbled backwards until she bumped into a large tree; her legs feeling weak and wobbly. Lilac looked around desperately for something, anything to defend herself with but couldn’t find a weapon. She was at the mercy of this monster!
“Lilac, please!” His voice held no trace of emotion, just calmness as his face suddenly appeared inches from hers. He opened his mouth and Lilac could see his sharp canine teeth; she backed away even further to put space between them but he moved quickly to block her escape route with his body.
“You’re going to be mine.” His voice was soothing, almost pleading as if begging for forgiveness. “I promise you I will never hurt you.” He placed a hand over Lilac’s heart and closed his eyes for a few seconds before opening them again.
“Lilac… You belong to me now.” He whispered softly and leaned down, placing another kiss on her lips. She instinctively turned away; her head spinning as she tried to understand what was happening. Lilac felt as though she’d been struck by a truck full of bricks…
“I won’t let you go again.” He whispered in her ear. “I promise.”
Lilac suddenly woke up with a start; her heart beating so fast that it almost burst through her chest. Her breath came out as short, sharp gasps and she tried to control the fear that had overwhelmed her. The nightmare was finally over but Lilac couldn’t help but feel like there was something following her wherever she went…
The young wolf shook off the feeling and quickly got up from bed; it wasn’t time for dawn yet but the sky had already started to brighten and the birds were singing happily. Lilac grabbed her cloak and slipped into it before leaving her home in search of breakfast. She could hardly wait to get down to the river where she was sure that there would be some fish lying around from the night before; although she knew that it wouldn’t be nearly enough to satisfy her hunger!
As Lilac neared the edge of the forest and looked down at the river, she felt a slight fluttering in her stomach. She smiled and turned to see the wolf again; this time he was closer than ever before. He had been following her since she’d left home earlier that day. The creature was huge compared to him, almost as if he wasn’t even worth looking at…
Lilac watched in amazement as the other wolf ran up and started licking his lips; she could hear him making strange noises deep down in his throat. He kept doing this for several minutes before finally stopping completely still on all fours with a low growl coming from somewhere inside of him…
Lilac was about to turn away when he suddenly leaped up at her, baring sharp white teeth as she screamed in terror and tried to run away; but it was too late. He’d already caught her around the waist before she could do anything else! The wolf didn’t seem interested in making any more noise than that though; he just stared down at her with an almost predatory grin as if he knew exactly what he wanted and how to go about getting it…
“Lilac?” He whispered softly into her ear, the scent of his breath making her shudder slightly. “You’re going to be mine now.” The words seemed to echo off in the forest around them; they felt like they were coming from everywhere at once and Lilac couldn’t help but feel a sense of helplessness as she tried desperately not to show it on her face…
The wolf moved closer, his claws scraping against bark until he was right up against her skin. She could smell the animal’s sweat as well as his fear; Lilac tried very hard not to think about how badly she wanted him and instead concentrated solely on keeping herself calm and collected…
“Please don’t be afraid.” He whispered in her ear again before leaning down closer until their noses were almost touching each other. “I promise you I will never hurt you.” The words seemed to have more meaning than just that one statement; somehow Lilac knew that it meant something much deeper…
The wolf moved his head up and down against hers gently several times before finally pulling back enough so she could see him properly for the first time. He stared at her with a smile on his face, his eyes gleaming in the early morning sunlight as he took another step closer until they were only an inch apart from one another…
Lilac’s breath caught in her throat; she felt like her heart was about to beat out of her chest. She knew what he wanted and she knew that there really wasn’t anything else left for either of them but yet somehow she couldn’t bring herself to do it even though deep down inside somewhere she desperately needed him…
The wolf moved closer again, this time so close that their noses were almost touching one another as they both stared into each other’s eyes without saying a word between them. Lilac felt something inside of her change then; she wasn’t sure what it was but suddenly everything seemed clearer than ever before…
He leaned down closer still, so close that his lips nearly touched hers before slowly pulling away once more while whispering “I love you” in her ear one last time before turning around and walking off into the forest with his tail wagging happily behind him. Lilac watched until he was out of sight before shaking herself out of what felt like a trance, smiling as she finally walked away from where they had stood together just minutes earlier…
“I promise.” She whispered softly to herself in the same way that he’d promised her earlier. “I will never hurt you either.”
Lilac knew that it was impossible for her to say those words back because they meant more than any words could ever express and yet somehow she couldn’t help but think about how much she would miss him even though deep down inside somewhere she didn’t want him to leave…
Lilac walked down by the river until she found a small piece of grass sticking out from beneath some rocks near its banks; it was one that she could easily eat without any other wolves being around. She sat down on her haunches and started eating quietly while watching for any sign of her friend in case he decided to come back…
Suddenly the wind picked up, causing a few leaves to blow past her before settling again; Lilac shivered slightly as she looked out over the water. Something about this place made her feel very small and alone…
“I love you.” She whispered softly into the air around herself, watching as the words drifted off into nothingness like so many others had done before them but still feeling hopeful that somehow they might make it back to him…
Lilac stood up from where she was sitting and walked slowly over towards one of the larger boulders near by; its surface covered in mosses and lichens. She sat down once more, leaning against its coolness while staring out across the water again with nothing but herself for company…
She could hear something moving closer behind her but didn’t turn around until she felt someone sit down beside her on their haunches just inches away from where she was sitting; Lilac turned to see that it was him once more! “I love you too” he whispered into the air between them before leaning over so that their noses were almost touching again…
She could smell his scent, feel how close they were together as if somehow through this intimate contact they’d managed to bridge the distance between them; although Lilac knew in her heart that no matter what happened next it would never be enough because she loved him so much more than just friendship or even love…
They stared into each other
