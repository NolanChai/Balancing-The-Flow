 out of town lover in a long time, should have alerted me to something being wrong.
I didn ' t even notice at first. Not until I went downstairs and was met by the smell of her favorite cologne; a stale alcoholic scent that I had come to know well. There was an ashtray filled with cigarette butts in my living room where she liked to sit, and there were several bottles of wine on the kitchen counter top.
I went into my daughter ' s bedroom and found her sleeping peacefully. It was a good sign that she was home; that she had not been hurt or harmed by someone.
That was until I noticed her stomach. Her eyes were shut, but the skin around them looked bruised and swollen. Her clothes lay scattered on the floor of the bedroom in no apparent order. And there, sitting atop her night stand was a knife that had not been there before.
I called for my son and he ran downstairs to meet me. I asked him to go check on his sister while I got the phone and dialed 911. I explained what I had found in her room and what I thought might have happened. When we got off of the telephone, I took one look at my son ' s face and knew that she was not all right.
The ambulance came first and then the police. They asked a lot of questions that I did n't want to answer, but they had their orders. It took them several hours before they gave us an update on her condition. She was going to be okay; physically at least. The knife had cut through her stomach in a way that seemed to have missed any major organs and it had not pierced the muscles.
My daughter spent three nights in the hospital recovering, but she ' s home now and doing well. She was lucky. Lucky to be alive at all. And even though I could n't help wondering how drunk she would have to be before she could get herself into a situation like that, it did nothing to change the fact that her mother was going to jail for attempted murder.
My daughter ' s ex-husband had been stalking and harassing her since their divorce almost five years ago. He called me one day and told me how he was coming to visit with his new wife, but that they were not staying over night at my daughter ' s house. I asked why and he replied that if the police found them there together in the middle of the night they might arrest him for stalking.
He then informed me that he had just bought a gun and was planning to use it on her as soon as she stepped outside of her door to confront him about his latest abuse. He told me he wanted us to stay with them during their visit so we could protect our grandchild from her father.
I didn ' t think twice about it, but my son did. My daughter was still married at the time and they had a child together; an adorable little girl who needed both of her parents. The divorce was bitter enough without us interfering in what should have been a happy occasion for our family.
He came home from school and went directly to my room where I was working on some paper work, to tell me that he would n't be going with them after all. He said it was not his place to make the decision for himself or his sister.
I couldn ' t fault him for wanting to protect her; I only wished that someone else had been there to help us keep our daughter safe. Instead, my son decided that if he could n't protect her then no one could and he would stay home with me instead of joining the family in their visit. We never saw my daughter ' s ex-husband again after that day.
About two months later I got a call from a police officer who was calling to inform me that my son had been shot while walking to school with our grandchild one morning. The man who pulled the trigger was another student at his school; a boy with a history of violence towards others and mental problems of some sort.
There were witnesses on both sides, but the police believed that the child ' s father was more than likely the aggressor in the situation. It is possible to get into trouble for pulling a gun out at the wrong time and firing it while angry or scared; however, you are not charged with attempted murder unless you were trying to kill your victim when you pulled the trigger.
The boy ' s father had been planning this attack since our son refused to protect his daughter from him earlier in the year. He wanted payback for the embarrassment he had felt as a result of her decision to keep us in the loop about what was going on with them, and he decided that making my grandchild an orphan would be the best way to teach his ex-wife and our son a lesson they were not likely to forget.
My daughter ' s mother has been in prison for almost three years now. She pleaded guilty to attempted murder, but will probably spend most of her remaining days in jail. My grandchild is now raised by my husband and I; the same man who told me that he would n't be going with his sister on that one day back in April when she needed him more than ever before.
His mother was wrong for what she tried to do, but he has made it clear to all of us that we can count on him from now until the end of time; no matter what problems come our way.
