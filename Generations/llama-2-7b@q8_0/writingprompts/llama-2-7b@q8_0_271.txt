31 times that night and had no clue what I did the next day.
I think it's safe to say I've made all my New Year's resolutions on my sleep-deprived mind. So I figured maybe I should just write them down here, so you could read along and keep me honest. And to make myself accountable.
1) I will be better about writing letters of love/appreciation. It is one of the few things that keeps me connected to my soul, and I don't do it enough. So I am committing to 2016: 20 letters of love (to anyone) per year!
2) I will be better at saying "NO" to people when they need help or want advice. It's not that I don't like being asked, but if the request is made 43 times in a single day, it can become tiresome. I am trying to find balance between wanting to help others and taking care of myself/my family.
3) I will take better care of my skin. This is something I've been meaning to do for over five years, and finally, I will. I have a face mask routine (yes, one that involves two masks at once), and it should be pretty good for me in the long run. And yes, I know how many times I'm going to screw this up before it happens. But maybe it will happen THIS year!
4) I will become more involved with my local library. I am such an avid reader that this seems like a no-brainer; but it's true. We have so many beautiful libraries in our community and we haven't utilized them enough.
5) I will be better at managing my time. The problem is, I know what I want to do with my time, yet the daily grind just happens too fast sometimes. And the older you get (well, me), the more things happen that take precedent over what you plan on doing in a day/week/month.
So here's to 2016! Let us make it count.
I have a bunch of stuff coming up with my local library. It's definitely something I need to get back into.
