4 empty plastic bottles hit the floor, a look of utter horror spread across my face as i looked down to see my crap spilled out all over the side walk, I looked up to see a very large rat scampering away from me and into a sewer hole. I ran towards it quickly, grabbed a nearby shovel that had been lying on the ground and jumped in after it, it was so dark down there I couldn't even see the walls around me, suddenly I felt something grab my leg and pull it into theirs, then another rat pounced onto my shoulder, I struggled to get free and eventually did.
Above me a light appeared and I looked up to find myself back in the sewer, but not the same one that had just been below me. This one was much bigger and more open, there were also plenty of rats scampering around. There must be hundreds of them down here, I thought as I wandered deeper into it, eventually arriving at a large chamber filled with 20 or so rats. They all began to attack me simultaneously, swarming over and onto my body, I screamed in terror and struggled to break free, but they were far too strong for me.
I was being pulled further into the cave when suddenly it stopped moving forward, it had reached a dead end. The rats tried to pull me through with them but the chamber was so small that my body didn't fit and I couldn't go any further, I watched as they began to push against my stomach, trying to force their way in. One of them bit into my cheek and then another came at me with its teeth outstretched, I screamed again as it clamped onto my face and ripped through my flesh like paper.
The pain was so intense that for a moment I thought my eyes were going to burst from the force of it but they didn't break and instead started to burn, slowly my entire body began to catch fire and I fell into an abyss of pure agony...
