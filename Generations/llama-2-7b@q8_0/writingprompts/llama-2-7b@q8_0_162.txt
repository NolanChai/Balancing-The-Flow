ies unstoppable and merciless. The bloodshed on both sides of this war had been catastrophic; but it would have been worse had he lost.
A voice behind him called his name again, but he ignored it and waited until the final few survivors from the opposite army fled or were hunted down to make their peace with death. When there was nothing left on the battlefield except for a few stray horses and wounded who had either been unable to flee or unwilling to die, he turned around and smiled at those still standing behind him.
His furies waited patiently, their claws dug deep into his shoulders but their eyes filled with expectation. The sight of them always brought an inhuman pleasure to him that he would never fully comprehend even though they were the most loyal and powerful creatures that existed in this world. It was not enough for them to be merely fearless; they had to be bloodthirsty as well, because nothing would sate his hunger without it.
And when he finally turned his gaze back to the corpses on the battlefield, he saw his bloodlust reflected there in their lifeless eyes. It was a sight that he would never tire of seeing.
Satisfied at last, he looked away from them and called out his name once more. The voices sounded far less anxious this time and a few steps later the woman he’d been searching for emerged from behind her guardians, her gaze fixed firmly on him as she approached. His eyes had already seen her face clearly in her mind so there was no need to wait and wonder; when they finally met his own, he knew that there would be no regrets between them this time.
She knelt at his feet with an almost reverent calm and he smiled at the sight of it, because she had always been one of those who made the most obedient servants. Even when her soul had first been taken from her body long ago by his hand, that same loyalty to him had remained in her eyes; for she had never forgotten what she was born to be, a creature with a destiny greater than even he could ever have imagined.
As he held out his hands, one of them clutching a white cloth tightly in its fist, she closed her eyes and drew her lips into a soft smile before kissing him lightly on the fingers that still carried a touch of her blood. It had always been her way to pay respects to those who had saved her from the world they both hated so much; for it was not enough that he should have taken away her humanity and made her into what she was now.
He stroked her hair gently, as though she were a child again, before finally releasing her and speaking to his furies. The moment their claws sank deeply into her body and they began to drink from the blood that still ran thickly in her veins, he turned away so that he would not have to watch it; for while there was no other way but this, neither of them needed to see what had become of the girl she once was.
Sometime later when all that remained of her were a few scraps and splatters on the ground, he looked down at her face once more. The only thing left of her humanity now was her eyes and they were closed forever. He smiled and wiped away a single tear from the corner of his own, not out of sadness but for the joy that he felt every time he remembered how she had chosen to die.
