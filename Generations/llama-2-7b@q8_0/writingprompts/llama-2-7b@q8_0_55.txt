ucking wave that has spread across every world it can reach, leaving nothing in its wake but death and destruction.
 The only way to stop this tide was the creation of the Colony Program—the systematic exodus from Earth and the subsequent terraforming of several planets outside of Sol. These colonies would be self-sufficient and capable of defending themselves, and mankind could finally find a place where it could prosper without fear or consequence.
 But there was one flaw in this plan. The Colony Program was dependent on the FTL network and the ships to transport the colonists. If Earth's civilization fell, so did every other colony with it.
 To solve this problem, we sent our greatest scientist and inventor into cryo-sleep until the situation was dire enough that he could be awakened. This man is known as _The Founder_ —the man who would save us all.
And we are still waiting for him to wake up. 
Chapter 1
# The Beginning of the End
A week ago, I was living my best life at a resort on an island in the South Pacific. Today I'm sitting in the backseat of a police cruiser—my life flashing before my eyes as we drive through downtown Los Angeles.
There is no doubt this has been one of the shittiest weeks of my life, and it's not even over yet. In fact, things are looking worse by the minute. We just passed the last checkpoint that would have let us into the airport where I was supposed to meet my family for vacation. Instead, we're being escorted straight to the LAPD headquarters.
The cruiser is quiet save for the squeak of the brakes as Officer Dennison slows to a stop at an intersection before pulling off onto the shoulder and stepping on the gas again. We pass through a gate into what was once an abandoned industrial park and make our way to one of the warehouses that are now being used for LAPD storage, maintenance, and operations.
"Hey, man," I say with a grin. "If you don't mind me asking, how many times have you done this?"
"Sorry, sir? Done what?" Dennison asks, taking his eyes off the road to look at me in the rearview mirror for the first time since we picked him up from the station.
I shake my head and smile. "I'm just kidding with you," I say, crossing my arms as he puts on his blinker and turns into one of the many loading docks that have been converted to parking spots for police cars.
He stops in front of a black SUV that has tinted windows but otherwise looks like any other vehicle except for its size. Dennison flicks the locks open, letting us out before getting into the driver's seat himself and starting up his engine. "It happens on the regular," he says with an honest smile as we approach a few other LAPD vehicles that are parked in the same loading bay.
"Wow... I guess you get to be pretty familiar with some people around here?" I say, watching him drive through one of the main doors and down another hallway before stopping outside of a large metal door marked "STORAGE."
He lets us out again, locking the vehicle as he does so. "Yeah... it happens," Dennison says, pushing open the massive warehouse door with a heavy groan that echoes off the concrete walls for several seconds before fading away. He walks past me and steps into the darkness inside while I close the door behind us to give myself some time to adjust my eyes to the near pitch-black room we're standing in.
"Uh, Officer...?" I ask as Dennison goes over to a panel that has been attached to one of the walls and presses several buttons on it. "How do you know this place is safe? What if there's someone here...?"
A white light flickers on above us, illuminating Dennison's face as he turns around. I can see a faint glow in his eyes—the telltale signs of having just woken from cryo-sleep and the resulting dehydration. "This place is top secret," Dennison says, patting me on the shoulder like an older brother would a younger one as he leads us deeper into the building to a room that has been outfitted with several beds.
"So, we're going to sleep here?" I ask. "In the same room? With these other people...?"
Dennison looks at me and shakes his head before turning back toward our bedroom for what I now know is the third time in less than two minutes.
"No," Dennison says, "We're not going to sleep here. But this place will be our home base while we prepare for your transfer to another location."
I raise an eyebrow. "What kind of transfer?" I ask, taking a step forward and stopping just a few feet from the nearest bed as he reaches up to pull down some of the blankets covering it. "And who am I going to be meeting with when we get there...?"
"You'll see," Dennison says with a smile before shaking his head in annoyance and turning toward one of the walls. He reaches out, grabbing at something that looks like an air duct until he finds the button that activates it and then pushing it down so hard I can feel the floor vibrating beneath my feet.
I look up to see a large section of the ceiling opening as another white light begins to flicker on and off overhead, casting Dennison's face into shadow every time it dims. A moment later, he reaches out once more and grabs hold of what I now recognize as one of the air duct covers before pulling it away from its hiding spot in the wall.
"What the hell is going on here?" I ask as a small mechanical arm extends from within the duct and comes to rest next to Dennison's hand, glowing red hot.
Dennison pulls his arm back slowly, staring at me like I just said something crazy, when suddenly we hear the sound of a door opening somewhere down the hallway behind us.
"Son of a bitch!" he says as he turns around and begins walking toward the sound. "You were supposed to be in cryo-sleep for another three days."
I stand still, watching him as he walks away from me. Dennison is just barely five feet tall with a stocky build that has been softened by decades of hard work and good food—the same kind you could only get when money was plentiful. His hair is short enough to be completely shaved if not for the white streak of his natural hair color running through it, which matches the stubble growing on his cheeks and chin.
He pauses at a door and pushes it open without looking back toward me, turning on a light as he does so. I watch him disappear into the room before taking one step forward to look inside myself when I hear the sound of a car engine coming from somewhere far off in the distance.
I take two steps forward now, getting closer to where Dennison went. I lean my head slightly to see around the doorframe and through the window into the next room over. In addition to having been outfitted with beds for our use, it has also been equipped with a kitchenette as well as what looks like a small dining area.
The light flickers on once more, causing me to look back at Dennison before I notice something that makes my eyes widen and my body go numb. Dennison is standing next to me now, staring off in the direction of the kitchen where we just saw a man walk out from behind one of the counters. The light flickers on again as another car passes by, its tires screeching against the pavement before it comes to an abrupt stop and a door opens.
"God damn..." Dennison says, looking me in the eyes. "I knew you weren't going to be awake for very long... but I wasn't expecting this."
A shadow moves quickly down the hallway before stopping outside of our room. A moment later, a woman with short brown hair and bright green eyes walks into view just as the door opens again behind her. Her skin is pale, almost sickly looking, and she has several dark circles under her eyes that make me wonder how long it's been since they last closed.
"That's him..." Dennison says with a nod to his side, letting out a small sigh as he turns back toward the woman who is now standing in front of us.
I look away from her and back to Dennison, feeling a sense of dread come over me like nothing I have ever felt before. "What... what happened here?" I ask, turning my head slightly so that I can see both sides of his face at the same time. "You said you didn't think we were going to be awake for very long—but _why_ did you bring us out? What are they planning on doing with us now...?"
Dennison shakes his head. "I don't know." He looks back down the hallway, then turns back toward
