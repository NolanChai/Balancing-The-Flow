r. My mom was a beautiful woman in her youth; tall, willowy and soft-spoken, she could have been anyone's fantasy come true - except for my father's. He was handsome, but not the kind you would say was "pretty". Rugged, with dark hair that was always windblown and a face littered with freckles, he was far from being dainty or feminine in any way. The combination of their differences was like oil and water; they were never on the same wavelength, though I think my father's taciturn nature may have been what kept them together for so long. It had to be a real challenge for her to get through to him without losing patience with his seeming inability to show or share emotions, but she tried. And she made it work - sort of.
Their marriage was never the most romantic I've seen; she was a good mother, though, and he was a good provider, so maybe that's what they had between them. But from my perspective as the middle child in this strange little family, I think theirs was an arranged marriage of convenience.
As far as I know, it all came to a head one day when my father was working at the mill and my mom was home alone with us kids. I'm not sure why he left; maybe he felt he had to get away from her for a while or just wanted some space so he could think things through, but whatever his reason, that afternoon was the last time we saw him alive.
I know what happened next is something my mom told me many years ago and I've always wondered if there were other details she didn't tell me, maybe things she had tried to forget - but they never went away. It was just too hard for her to face them alone. But that's not really important at this point because what matters most is how my mother made the decision I'm about to talk about, and why.
I think we were all home that afternoon; I was three years old, so I don't know if there was anyone else in the house or not. What I do remember from that day, though, was walking into a room at the back of our little house and seeing my mom lying on the bed in tears. She was sitting up at first, but as she cried her shoulders became more and more limp and eventually she just sank to the floor with her head down on her knees and began sobbing.
I don't know how long it went on; I can't remember exactly when my older brother came into the room or if there were any other sounds in that small house besides our mom's crying, but what I do know is that he sat down next to her and put his arm around her shoulder while she cried.
When she finally stopped, neither of them said anything for a long time; just my brother sitting there with his arm around her and my mother crying as quietly as she could. At last he spoke up and asked if she was okay or if she needed help doing something, but she shook her head and continued to sit where she was without saying another word.
That's when he took out a knife from the kitchen drawer that I knew he had been using to cut meat for dinner, then handed it over to my mother who immediately began cleaning off all of the blood that had dried onto its blade. Afterwards she wiped her eyes and went back to sitting on the floor with her head in her hands.
It wasn't until much later, after everyone was asleep in their beds, that he spoke again. I don't know what it was about this particular night or what my father had done or said that had made him so upset - maybe something he couldn't live with anymore; maybe his own secret shame over his failure to do the right thing and leave before there were any consequences; but whatever the reason, my brother was finally ready to tell the truth.
"Mom, I know what you did." He paused for a second to see if she wanted to answer him - which of course she didn't - then continued: "It doesn't matter if it was right or wrong... that's not the point anymore. The only thing that matters is how we move forward from here on out, so I want you to know I will always be here for you no matter what happens."
He said this all in a low, steady voice without any emotion at all except maybe some sadness or regret over their circumstances; nothing more than just words spoken softly as he reached out and stroked her hair gently with his fingers. After that it was quiet again until I drifted off to sleep.
When I woke up the next morning, my older brother was gone and so were all of our father's clothes and belongings from our bedrooms; nothing remained in any of them except for some dust on the floor where they used to be. That's when my mother finally told me what she had done the previous day.
She explained that she had decided to take matters into her own hands before things got even worse between them and so, without saying a word, had simply walked out of their bedroom one morning while he was sleeping next to her on the floor after another night spent alone in his own room with no sign of life coming from inside it. She told me that she then went downstairs into the kitchen and got herself some breakfast before leaving for work like nothing ever happened at all.
"Why did you do it, Mom?" I asked her when we were done eating our cereal together over coffee.
"It was a difficult decision to make," she told me as though I should already have known this without asking. "But I had been thinking about it for some time before that and realized there really wasn't any other choice." She paused again then added: "You know, sometimes things happen in life that force us into making decisions we never expected to make - or at least ones we didn't think we would have to face so soon..."
I remember sitting there wondering what exactly she meant by this comment until it finally occurred to me that her decision may not only be about them as a couple anymore... maybe it was also about us kids too. If things were going to continue down this path with no end in sight, then perhaps it would be better for all of us if my dad didn't exist at all - or at least not around our family anymore!
It has been several years since that day when I realized what my mom had done and why she did it... but even today after everything else that happened between them in their relationship (and especially after all these years), there still seems to be something missing from this story because none of us ever knew exactly how much my dad loved her until he died unexpectedly one evening while working late at night.
We were never really close enough with him so we didn't know his full story; but when you consider how hard it must have been for someone who lived such a sheltered life growing up without any real connections to anyone outside of our family - or even inside them! - it's easy to understand why he kept us all at arm's length throughout most of our time together. He just didn't want anyone getting too close because he feared they would find out who he really was (or wasn't) on the inside... which is probably why my mom felt compelled to make this decision so early in their relationship without telling anyone else what she planned on doing until it was already too late!
My mom didn't know at first that I had heard her conversation with my brother before he left our home; but once I told her about it, she admitted that she had been considering ending things between them for some time now - even if only out of fear over how this might affect us kids in the long run.
It wasn't until after we were all grown up and moved away from our hometown that we learned just how much my father loved her - despite everything else going on around him during those years when he didn't know she was planning on leaving him; but even though it took a while for us to get there, once we did find out about his true feelings towards her (and vice versa), it made perfect sense why they were never able to find happiness together - no matter how hard either one tried!
I wish more parents would talk with their children about these sorts of things; but since I know that isn't always possible, here are some questions you might want to consider asking your kids if you feel like having this conversation: How much did you learn from your mother growing up? What kind of person was she when you were little - and how has she changed over time? Do you think she still loves him today despite everything they went through together (or didn't)?
What do you think he thinks about her nowadays after all these years apart; is there any way he could ever forgive himself for what happened back then even though things have moved on since those days? How has this situation affected your relationship with him - or anyone else in your family who was involved at some point along the way? What would happen if one day everything just disappeared forever... Would you be able to move forward without regrets?
