 smiled at me. I blinked once more and opened my eyes. I was alone, but I am happy.
The first time I saw her was when she turned in the doorway of our local cafe. It's not an interesting place – there are two tables with benches on one side, a bar counter with stools along another wall, and a large fridge against a back wall. It is decorated by the owner's son who has painted it white and made up some signs for the menu. But it's clean and friendly, the food is good, and everyone knows each other there.
I was sitting at a table on my own and had just finished eating breakfast when she turned into the doorway. She came over to where I sat with an open newspaper on the bench in front of me and smiled up at me. 'Good morning!' she said and, as she spoke, she leaned against the edge of the table and her hair fell forward and brushed across my cheek.
She was tall and slim and her fair skin shone with health. Her brown eyes were deep-set beneath straight brows and her nose had a gentle curve to it. I noticed that she wore no jewellery except for two small stud earrings in the shape of stars, which glinted when she moved her head. She was wearing a white shirt and black trousers – nothing fancy at all but very stylishly cut and a lovely colour to match her hair.
'Hello,' I said back to her as casually as possible. 'Do you want one of these?' and, as I spoke I pushed the newspaper across the table towards her with my hand resting on top of it.
She looked up at me again with her eyebrows raised in a way that was both friendly and questioning at the same time – what did this man want? I smiled back down at her. 'I can read the paper later,' she said, 'but if you like, I'll come back for it.'
Her accent wasn't American but I couldn't quite place where she was from. She sounded educated and well-bred with a hint of an English lilt – perhaps she had been born in England before moving to the States? Or maybe her parents were from there and they had moved to the States when she was young, like many others.
I nodded my head but she seemed unsure whether I meant that I would come back for it or that she could read it later herself – so I said again, 'You can read this paper if you want,' and pushed it towards her.
She took the newspaper from me with both hands, smiled again and then turned around and walked away out of the cafe. And then, a few moments later, as she went up to the counter to pay for something, I heard someone behind me say 'That's the new woman at the school.' The voice was familiar – it belonged to one of my friends who lived close by but who did not know that we had moved in across from them. He hadn't seen her before and his question was genuine rather than malicious or rude, so I felt able to reply, 'Yes,' and then go back into reading the paper.
As I sat there, the front page of the newspaper filled with photographs of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall – they had just come in from Canada. There was a large picture of her and one of him in their hotel suite, smiling up at each other and holding hands. They were clearly deeply in love and looked like a real couple. I was not quite sure what this meant but, when I put down the newspaper, I thought of her again.
She'd been coming into the cafe for breakfast almost every morning now for about two weeks, although I hadn't seen her on each occasion because she often went straight to another table with someone else – a friend perhaps? She had not yet said anything to me. But then one day last week, when we were both sitting at our separate tables drinking coffee and reading the paper, she looked up from what she was doing, smiled again that friendly smile, and came over towards my table.
She walked across slowly with her head tilted downwards – looking at something in the palm of one hand or perhaps at her feet? I wasn't sure. 'Do you have a pencil?' she said, standing behind me so close to where I sat that our bodies almost touched. She leaned down slightly and put out her free hand towards my table without taking her eyes away from mine.
I glanced around the room but there was no one else at any of the other tables except for a man sitting in one corner with an open book on his lap, who looked up for just long enough to see what was happening before looking quickly down again and reading his newspaper as if nothing had happened. I reached into my inside pocket for a pencil but she caught it out of the air.
'Thank you,' she said in that beautiful voice that was low-pitched, almost like a boy's at times, with just one or two little sounds like a bird's call in it and then added, 'You can take it back when we leave.'
I did not reply to her but I nodded my head. She smiled again as she turned away and walked slowly towards the counter. I felt a warm glow all over me and for the first time I found myself feeling slightly excited about something that had happened in this town where everything seemed dull and grey most of the time.
The next day when she came in, we sat at our usual tables without speaking to each other or even looking across. But then a few moments later, after I'd put down my paper, she spoke and said, 'Excuse me – what is your name?'
I had to think for a moment about how to answer her question because I didn't really know where to start. All of a sudden, it seemed ridiculous that we were strangers in the middle of town after having met so many times at this cafe. But then I said, 'My name is...' and she interrupted me and said, 'I know – but what is your surname?'
She was looking directly at my face now as if searching for something there – a sign perhaps or an answer to her question? I felt that I should say more than simply state my name because this wasn't some official interview when one person has to give the other his card, name and address. But then again, how could I tell her where I lived so soon after meeting her?
I felt myself starting to sweat inside my shirt as we both looked at each other in silence for a while – it was as if I had been caught doing something wrong without knowing why or what exactly it was. And then, just when I thought she might walk away again and leave me alone, she smiled gently and said, 'Do you have to go out right now?'
I shook my head but did not smile back – although a few seconds later when I tried to look at her again, her expression had changed completely. Now her face was flushed and I saw that she was holding on to the edge of one of the cafe's tables as if she needed it for support.
She took a deep breath in through her nose and then let it out again slowly before saying, 'I will call you.' She turned around and started walking away but then stopped as if she wanted to say something else first. She leaned forward with both arms on the edge of the table so that she was almost bent over it – and said, 'Maybe next time?'
As I sat there staring at her back, wondering what I should do or where I should go, someone called out loudly from behind me – 'Sorry to interrupt you two,' they shouted as he came up close to my shoulder. He was wearing a black leather jacket and had his hands in the pockets of his jeans – a tall thin man with dark hair who looked like an accountant or solicitor maybe? But I wasn't sure because he did not smile at me, nor did he stop talking once he began speaking. 'But you two do know each other from somewhere, don't you?' He had just arrived in the cafe and I was still trying to understand what he meant when I looked up and saw that his eyes were fixed on us – as if they belonged only to him now.
I shook my head slowly because I didn't want to say anything more than necessary at this point in time, but then she turned back again towards where we sat together on opposite sides of the table facing each other like two prisoners in a cell without any walls between them. She put her hand out towards mine and I took it quickly before saying anything – as if that would be enough to stop him from talking or asking questions about us at all.
I wanted to get up from my chair but didn't want to do so too quickly because she was still holding on to me with one hand while rubbing the side of her face against mine. And then I heard him say, 'You are a stranger in this town,' he told me loudly as if there were no one else present at all. He turned away from us both and went over towards where she sat. 'But you're not here on business – or studying either?'
She shook her head slightly when she saw that he was looking directly into my eyes now; then she pulled her hand away from me as if it were still being held tightly by someone else who would never let go of it no matter how hard we struggled together. And then, before leaving
