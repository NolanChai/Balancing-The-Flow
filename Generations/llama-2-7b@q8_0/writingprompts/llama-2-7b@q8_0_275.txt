 He couldn ’ t help but stare at it for hours now, he was even thinking about asking his mother to get him a tattoo so that it ’ ll be permanent.
 He kissed her, and she kissed him back. 
 “ I love you, ” he said as they pulled apart.
 ” I know, ” Anna whispered into his ear as their lips touched again.
 Jacob couldn ’ t believe his luck; he finally got the girl of his dreams to say those three magic words to him for the first time in his life and now she was actually sleeping with him. 
 “ You really are my dream girl, Anna, ” Jacob said into her ear as they cuddled under the covers.
 He reached over and turned on a soft lamp beside their bed. The light illuminated Anna ’ s beautiful face in all of its glory as she gazed at him with those deep green eyes of hers. 
 “ You look like an angel, ” Jacob whispered to her as he kissed the top of her head. 
 “ I love you too, Jacob, ” she said as she wrapped herself around his arms and lay on top of him. She felt so much better now that she had someone by her side again; at least she finally didn ’ t have to deal with all of her nightmares alone anymore.
 Jacob was feeling great now that he was about to be a high school senior. It was only a few more weeks until the big day and he couldn ’ t wait.
 He wanted to tell everyone at school how he felt for Anna, but he knew it would never work out if they found out. He didn ’ t want to risk their relationship; so instead, Jacob decided that he would just tell her when the time was right. 
 “ You are amazing, ” Jacob whispered as he kissed his girlfriend on the cheek before lying down beside her and turning off the lights. 
 Anna smiled at him, she knew what he said and meant to her as they laid together in bed. She wanted nothing more than for them to be together forever. They were so happy now that she had a boyfriend who loved her, it made everything in life just seem easier. 
 Jacob kissed his girlfriend one last time before closing his eyes and falling asleep. It was only a few short hours until dawn; but he didn ’ t want to leave her side at all. He wanted to hold Anna in his arms forever, so that they could both sleep peacefully without any interruptions from nightmares or bad dreams.
 Jacob smiled when he woke up the next morning because it was a new day and a chance for him to tell everyone at school how much he loved Anna. He knew that she felt the same way about him, so now all they had to do was wait until their senior year started before telling everyone else in school what happened between them two nights ago.
“Hey! Wake up, sleepyhead!” 
Jacob woke up with a start. It was a girl’s voice; he recognized her as Anna. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. 
“Morning,” he said groggily. 
Anna smiled at him, her beautiful face radiating warmth and happiness. She reached out to take Jacob’s hand in hers and kissed it gently before pulling back. 
Jacob noticed something different about Anna as soon as she sat up next to him on the bed: Her birthmark had faded! 
“I didn ’ t do anything special,” Anna said with a shrug. “It just sorta happened one day.” 
Jacob smiled at her, his heart filled with love for this beautiful girl who had been there for him through thick and thin over the years. He leaned in to kiss her again when suddenly— 
“Uh-oh,” Anna said. “My alarm is going off!” 
She jumped up from bed and started running around trying to turn it off before it woke up her mom (who would be home soon). Jacob followed after her, laughing as they chased each other through the house until finally catching their breath by lying down together in the guest room next door.
Anna turned toward him, her eyes shining with happiness as she smiled at him. 
“I love you,” he said, kissing her gently on the lips before getting up himself and going out to start his day. 
Anna stayed behind a moment longer; she wasn ’ t ready yet for Jacob or anyone else in her life who loved her like family (and especially like family) knowing what happened between them two years ago when they first met each other at school—but someday soon… 
“I can ’ t wait,” she thought happily, smiling at him again before finally joining Jacob outside in the living room where he was waiting patiently for her arrival so that together they could begin their new life together as high school seniors this year!
