God laughed when Satan asked, thinking he was kidding.
It was rare that either of them fell upon circumstances requiring them to manifest a physical form. It was bothersome to both of them and it seemed unnecessary. But they had to do so for this one time or the problem would never be resolved. God knew the nature of Satan very well, he knew his weaknesses and strengths, and he also knew that no one could ever truly harm Satan in any way. Satan was far too cunning for that. But there was one thing he could not do; that was to die!
God took on the form of a man and walked down to where Satan stood. He looked up at him, towering over him with his head almost touching the heavens. The bright light emitted from God’s being bounced off everything around them. It made it impossible for Satan to see God clearly, even with his eyes closed.
Satan said, “What do you want of me?”
God looked down at him and said, “I have a son.”
“Yes,” God answered. “And I want you to give up your soul.”
There was a long pause as Satan pondered this request. “My soul is all I have,” he replied finally. “How can I give it to another?”
God thought for a moment and then spoke, “You must give it willingly, Satan. It should not be difficult. You are the most cunning of angels.” He paused again before continuing.
“I want you to love him more than your own soul,” God said. “He has come here today so that I may show him who I am and what I have done for Him.”
Satan thought about this, knowing it would be impossible but wanting to see if there was a way out. He decided he had nothing left to lose.
God saw Satan’s hesitation and smiled knowingly. “You will not have your soul back once you give it up,” God said. “You are mine now.”
Satan looked at him in disbelief but then shrugged his shoulders as if he were saying, “So be it!” He felt a sudden rush of power flow through him and knew that God would keep His promise to him. Satan stepped forward into the light, closing his eyes as if praying for courage before opening them again and looking directly at Him with a smile on his face.
God took him by surprise when he stepped out of the darkness and smiled at him. He looked back with a confused expression but then said, “I’m here to give you my soul.” Satan thought about this for a moment before answering with an eyebrow raised in disbelief. God was not surprised by his response because He knew how much power he had over everyone else except Himself.
Satan thought about this for a few moments and then said, “What do you want from me? I have nothing left to give.” Satan realized that even if it were possible for him to give up his soul willingly he would never be able to do so because God’s power was too great over anyone else.
“I can promise you one thing,” said God, “that whatever you give up will not be returned once I have received it.” Satan considered this but then decided that it wouldn’t matter in the end anyway since he could never win against Him no matter what happened next so why not just go ahead and do it? He stepped forward and placed his hand on God’s chest before saying, “I give you my soul.”
Satan knew that once he made this statement nothing would ever be able to take him away from Him again because He had already claimed him as His own. Satan felt a rush of power flow through his body when he realized what was happening but then quickly regained control over himself knowing how powerful God really was.
Satan stood there with tears streaming down his face as he watched God’s light slowly fade away into darkness, leaving only the moon and stars above him shining brightly in the night sky. He felt lost without Him but knew that if this was what had to happen then so be it! Satan walked away from where God once stood knowing that his life would never be the same again…
In conclusion, God’s ultimate goal for creation is to restore His image and likeness in mankind. He created man as His representative on earth because He knew we were capable of having a relationship with Him by loving our neighbor as ourselves. The story of Satan challenging God shows us how powerful Satan really is when it comes to tempting humans into sinning against their creator (and themselves).
However, this power doesn’t last forever; eventually we all must face judgment and reap what we have sown from our actions throughout life. It may seem like an eternity but God has made everything beautiful in its time so don’t worry if you feel like things are falling apart around you-God will never leave or forsake those who love Him!
