 time. He didn’t care about missing his train home; it was worth waiting in the crowded lobby just so he could look at her a little longer before he had to walk away from her.
Their eyes met again, for what seemed like the billionth time that day, but this time their bodies moved closer to each other. He felt the need to touch her, to run his hand gently over the skin of her arms and legs. It was as if he could never get enough of her. She turned away from him and he started walking in circles around the station, trying to keep himself from looking at her again.
She smiled sweetly at him as she stepped on to the train, waving goodbye. He wanted to be with her so badly that it hurt, but he knew if he went after her she would never come back. They had been flirting for weeks now and each time he saw her his heart beat faster, but he didn’t know how to talk to her. So he waited for the next train, trying to figure out what to say so that she could see him in a different light. He wanted to tell her about himself; about the things he did when they weren’t together and the things that made his life complete without her.
It had been an hour since he last saw her but every time he looked up from the newspaper he could feel her presence behind him. He closed his eyes, hoping it would all go away once he opened them again, but it didn’t. She was always there, with that sweet smile on her face and a look in her eye that told him she cared for him. He had to see her one more time before the train came; just long enough so that she could walk down the stairs from the platform onto his side of the street where they could talk freely without being disturbed by anyone else’s presence on their street corner.
He waited as patiently as he could while all around him people pushed and shoved to make it home before rush hour ended, but there was no way that he would miss this opportunity; even if it meant staying late at work or having a difficult commute back home after the end of his shift. He knew what would happen when she got off at her stop because every time they met there was something new happening between them- either she had changed her hair color and style again, or maybe this time she decided to wear more makeup than usual- but nothing could prepare him for how it felt when he finally saw her again.
She smiled sweetly at him as if they hadn’t spent hours talking about everything that mattered most in life; like they hadn’t shared so much about their hopes and dreams together. It was almost enough to make him forget about everything else going on around him- except maybe one thing: she wasn’t smiling anymore…
