4 years relationship because I'm in love with you. It might not be entirely true but you get the point. 
 
 If I could choose one thing to do over again it wouldn't be our break up. It would be to convince you that we were meant for each other. 
 
 I really thought you felt what I did about you and everything else. I guess not. That makes me feel even worse because all along I was trying to convince myself that you did. 
 
 You never asked my name but when I asked yours you've given it away so easily. It still sounds like a song to me. 
 
 I know what kind of music you like, your favourite food and your hobbies. It might sound weird but in the last four months since we broke up, that was all I could think about. 
 
 You don't know this, but my heart beats a little faster when I see you even for the briefest of moments. When did it change from me being in love with you to me just loving you? 
 
 It took four years for us to fall apart and it only took you one day to fix it. Is that how things are supposed to be? You're gone before I knew what happened and now I have to live without you. 
 
 I should've known better than to fall in love with someone who could never belong to me. But I didn't care then and I don't care now. 
 
 What did I do? It took you this long to find out about my feelings for you but it's too late now isn't it? Because you're already moving on with your life without even blinking an eye. 
 
 *I knew we were made for each other*
