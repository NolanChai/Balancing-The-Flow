'' replied Mr Atkins.
Having done our homework, and having a good idea what they were going to bring us to eat, it was with glee that we set off from the office and headed over the river to The Ship Inn, which is where the team likes to get their own food delivered. Mr Atkins had already been there, and I guess that he liked it so much because of the great service and wonderful food they receive there.
I've said before, and will say again, that having good food in your office can make or break a meeting. If people are starving then their mood is not going to be conducive to doing business. On the other hand if you feed them well (especially with some nice beer) they will feel more relaxed and thus will be able to do their best for you.
I think this is why HQ have chosen The Ship Inn, it's because they know that they can rely on this place. If something goes wrong then Mr Atkins can just pop over there to sort things out, which he did when our food wasn't ready and needed to be kept warm in the kitchen. He had a good chat with the chef while he was waiting, and came back looking pleased as punch!
The food was excellent. Mr Kojitsu ordered the seafood platter for 4 (£36), which included some lovely scallops, prawns, smoked salmon and squid in a beautiful little dish. This was accompanied by some delicious bread rolls with butter and chilli jam, and was all served up very quickly.
I was lucky enough to be eating with Mr Atkins this day, so I chose something for myself from the specials board. As you can see from my picture it's a salmon steak (£20) that looked rather delicious! The menu at The Ship Inn is quite small and simple, but they do exactly what they need to do very well, which in this case was delivering some excellent fish to us.
It goes without saying then that I will be going back here again very soon indeed!
The Ship Inn is an independently owned pub near to Borough Market (not far from London Bridge), and their food and service are both superb. They pride themselves on using local produce, and they have a small but well-stocked menu, with a wide range of drinks on offer too. I would thoroughly recommend it as somewhere for any business people looking to eat out in Southwark.
I think this is the best pub near Borough Market - great food, friendly staff and excellent service.
