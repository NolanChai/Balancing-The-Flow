 line of people waiting behind me got longer and longer, and no one seemed to be moving quickly through the line.
My parents and younger brother were standing with me, and my mom kept telling me that we didn't need potato chips right now; we needed money for our next trip to the grocery store later in the week. I was about 10 years old at the time, and I didn't know what she meant by "we" because it seemed like I was the only one who wanted potato chips.
I finally reached the front of the line when someone came up to pay for their items as well. The cashier quickly put their items on the conveyor belt, and they moved toward the exit before me, and I had another 10 minutes in line! As soon as this person left, a new customer appeared, and I waited my turn again.
My mom was right about one thing: We did need money for our next trip to the grocery store. We needed more money than we were going to get from selling the chips, but I wasn't thinking about that at the time; all I could think of was how many more customers there seemed to be in line behind me!
I can tell you exactly what happened next because it's burned into my memory. I didn't want potato chips anymore; I wanted a different snack, but the cashier would not let me pay for anything else until all of the other customers had paid. By then, I knew that there were at least two or three more people in line ahead of me!
I can't remember if my mom said something to the cashier after we finally got to the front of the line; she might have, but I don't think it would have mattered. The cashier was just doing her job, and there wasn't anything else we could do at that point except wait in line until all of the customers had paid for their items before she took our money.
There were so many times during my life when something like this happened to me: I wanted one thing but couldn't have it because someone was ahead of me, and they weren't going anywhere anytime soon! It felt frustrating at the time, especially if it seemed like there wasn't anything else that could be done about it.
When you think back on all of those times in your life when something like this happened to you (and trust me, I know plenty), do you remember feeling frustrated? Do you also remember having no idea how many more people might come behind the person ahead of you so they could buy their stuff too before it was finally our turn?
I sure did. I hated being in those situations! And sometimes when there seemed to be nothing else that could be done except wait until all other customers had paid, I'd just leave without buying anything at all (or if we were shopping together as a family unit), then I might feel even more frustrated because now we weren't going home with the items we wanted/needed either!
There is one way to deal with these situations where you want something but don't have it yet. You can always decide to wait until someone else wants what you do before getting your own item, and that person will probably come along sooner than you think they will! But what if they don't? What if the next person in line behind me never shows up at all? How long should I wait for him or her before deciding it's time to get my own potato chips after all?
This is where things start getting tricky. If someone wants something badly enough, then maybe they won't let go of that desire even if another person appears behind them in line; instead, they will do whatever needs done (like making small talk or asking questions about the other customer) so their turn comes up faster than it would otherwise!
When you are faced with this type of situation where someone is ahead of me but not moving through their items quickly enough for my liking (and let's face it, they probably aren't going anywhere anytime soon), then I think there should always be an option available to help make things easier on both sides: just walk away and go somewhere else!
I don't know about you, but when I was younger and had a hard time being patient enough in these situations (which happened pretty often), it sometimes felt like my only choice was either wait until everyone else who wanted something more than what they already had gotten their turn first; or leave without buying anything at all!
What's the best way to deal with this? What if you don't want to wait in line behind someone else because they are moving through items too slowly for your liking and there doesn't seem like there will be any point in waiting longer than necessary anyway. Or what about when no one else wants whatever it is that has caught our eye either, so we end up having nothing left over after making this purchase?
If you have ever been faced with a situation like this where someone else had something first before they let go of their desire to get their hands on the item in question, then I can tell you from experience: there is one simple solution that works every time!
You simply walk away and do something else instead.
It's really that easy because no matter what kind of situation you are faced with - whether it involves money or not - when someone else has something first before letting go, then walking away will always be the best option available! There is one major problem though: sometimes this doesn't work either; if another customer appears behind us who does want whatever we want as well.
What do you do then? Well, I have a solution for that too (and it involves going somewhere else)!
The answer here may seem obvious at first glance because it often is - but only in hindsight! When you are standing there with a dollar in your hand waiting to buy potato chips and someone else comes up behind you who wants them more than you do, then yes: walking away from the line and going somewhere else sounds like an obvious solution (and usually works out just fine).
But what if no one else wants anything? If this is the case, there will be nothing left over after buying our desired item anyway. So in situations where everyone else has something first before letting go of their desires for it, walking away from the line and going somewhere else isn't always an option either - unless you can find another customer who wants whatever we want too!
If you can't find someone else ahead of us in this scenario then there is only one thing left to do: wait until all other customers have paid for their items before paying for our desired item as well. This sounds like a great idea at first glance because it will allow us more time to think about what we want or need next - but sometimes waiting isn't always easy either!
It can be frustrating when there are people in line ahead of me who don't seem to be moving through their items quickly enough for my liking (and let's face it, they probably aren't going anywhere anytime soon). However, if we take a moment and look at the bigger picture here, then we might realize that maybe waiting isn't always such a bad thing after all.
When someone is moving through items too slowly for our liking (and let's face it, they probably aren't going anywhere anytime soon), this could mean that there will be more time available for us to think about what we want next or decide if another item would be better than the one in question.
The more time that passes by with someone who isn't moving through their items quickly enough for our liking, the longer it takes before they get up from the counter and move on to something else - which means you have even less of a chance to decide if another item would be better than the one in question!
There is also an added bonus when someone else has something first because we can always wait until their items are paid for before making our purchase (and this may allow us more time to think about what we want or need next). If no one wants anything then it might seem like waiting won't do us any good either - but this is where patience comes into play!
Patience is a virtue and I know that sounds cliche, but there are times when we have to be patient in order for things to work out just as planned. If someone has something first before letting go of their desire for it then sometimes walking away from the line isn't always an option either - unless you can find another customer who wants what we want too!
If this doesn't happen, then there is only one thing left: wait until everyone else has paid for their items and ours as well. This sounds like a great idea at first glance because it will allow us more time to think about what we want or need next - but sometimes waiting isn't always easy either!
The longer that you are standing there in line with a dollar in your hand, the more frustrating things can become as time passes by. If everyone else has something first before letting go of their desires for it then walking away from the line and going somewhere else might not be an option anymore - unless we find another customer who also wants whatever is currently being sold!
So how do you handle situations like these? Do you have any suggestions or ideas that might help make things easier on both sides when someone has something first before letting go of their desire to get hold of it themselves? Please share your thoughts below in the comments section.
