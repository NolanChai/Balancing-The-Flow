ynical about it. It could n't have happened to a better person.'' 
 
`` No, really? '' 
 
 He stared at my forehead for a few minutes before answering in an almost childlike voice. ``Yes, yes. You 'll do well, I promise.'' 
 
`` Can you explain what that means? Why did he pick me and not someone else? '' 
 
 ``Well...'' He scratched the side of his face as if itching for some reason. ``I suspect your friend was involved in a conspiracy against us. The files clearly demonstrate that. It 's no wonder you had to be sacrificed. As for me, I have no idea why he picked me. We never had any contact before the incident, so I can not answer this question. I assume it is because of your age or lack of knowledge. You were neither a spy nor an informer.'' 
 
`` But you said... '' 
 
 ``That does n't matter.'' He shrugged and then stood up suddenly, causing the files to fall on the floor. He picked them up and continued his work. His tone of voice was uncomfortable when he said: 
 
 ``I have to go to another room now. Do you want something to drink? '' 
 
`` No.'' I stood there, watching him leave the room. After a while, he turned back and asked me with a puzzled look on his face, 
 
 ``You did n't answer my question. '' 
 
 I paused for a moment before saying: 
 
 ``What question?'' 
 
 ``You know very well what question I 'm referring to!'' He exclaimed, and then he stared at me with his bright eyes. His gaze was so intense that I could n't say anything else. At the same time, a small smile appeared on my face as if I were not afraid of him. 
 
`` Why did you do all this? '' 
 
 He nodded and said, ``That 's what I wanted to talk about with you.'' Then he continued his speech: 
 
 ``You see, at first the incident was really a shock for us because we never expected it. It was even more shocking when your friend took over the command of this base from me without any instructions or approval from our superiors! He did n 't do anything wrong or anything that would make him guilty. But he did not take any actions either. Nothing at all, except for being a little reckless in his dealings with the aliens. It was clear to everyone that we had no orders. It seems to me that you were right when you asked why he had to die and I had n't.'' 
 
`` But I do not know... '' 
 
 ``Don 't be naive. You are still very young, but you know something more than most people in your age group. What do you think of him? What does your friend want to do here?'' 
 
 I looked at him with an expressionless face and said: ``I can not answer all these questions now, but one thing is for sure, he is a good man who only wants the best for everyone, including himself.'' 
 
`` But that 's not enough to make up for what happened here...'' He muttered something under his breath while looking down at my face. I noticed it and raised my eyebrows at him. 
 
 ``What? '' I asked him in a strong voice. 
 
``I said nothing.'' He replied. 
 
`` Yes, you did. What did you say? '' 
 
 He turned his back to me and said: "Nothing." He paused for a moment before adding, "But it was interesting to see how your friend can influence people with just a few words.'' 
 
``You 're lying! I heard what you said! Tell me... why did he have such an effect on you? '' 
 
``I don't know. He was my commanding officer and I had to follow his orders. However, he changed something inside of me that is very difficult for me to explain...'' 
 
 ``And what is it? '' 
 
 ``That 's not important right now. The important thing is that you have nothing to be afraid of. Believe me, everything will go well. '' He turned away from me again and said: "It was really a great honor for us. Now I can finally take up my work with confidence.'' 
 
 ``What kind of work? '' I asked him, looking at his back. His face remained as it had been all the time he talked to me. He just turned away from me without answering any questions that could make him angry again. Instead, he continued: 
 
``You must know what has happened here by now. You are in a very dangerous situation right now because of this base and its operations. We 're not like them-the aliens you saw outside your window. We are human beings, so we are affected by all kinds of emotions-anger, fear... '' 
 
``And what is love?'' I asked him. He turned to me again and said: 
 
 ``I 'm not here to talk about that stuff. I was just trying to warn you that you must be careful from now on. You may think your friend did n't tell us anything, but the truth is he told us quite a lot...'' He stopped for a moment and stared at me before continuing in an angry voice: 
 
 ``He also told us that he had someone very important with him. And if anyone threatens you or tries to harm you, they will have to answer to the person who is close to me as well!'' 
 
`` Who? '' I asked again without showing any fear on my face. He was right: My friend had given us information about his location. Maybe he had done it because he knew that one day we would need this information or maybe he did it just out of goodwill, I don't know. But it doesn't matter now anyway... 
 
``My friend has promised me a lot of things since then, but he 's never kept any of them. '' He paused and said: ``This time is not an exception either.'' Then he turned away again and continued his work in silence. After a few minutes, I stood up from my chair and walked toward him slowly with the intention to confront him with all this nonsense if necessary-but before I could reach him, someone entered through one of those doors leading outside and said: ``Captain!'' 
 
 He turned around and looked at me. His face was expressionless again but there was still some fear in his eyes which he tried to hide. Then he replied in a low voice: "What is it? '' 
 
``Sir, we 've found him...'' 
 
He looked at the person who had spoken and then at me, nodding without saying anything else. He walked away from where we were standing and left me alone with my thoughts again. I was still staring at that door when someone else entered the room again and said: ``Captain! There's an emergency on board '' 
 
``What kind of emergency?'' He asked quickly before turning around to look at me. Then he added in a calmer voice, "Is everything OK here?" I nodded without saying anything else as if nothing had happened between us. Then he walked toward the door again and left it open for a moment. 
 
``Who's that? '' He asked someone behind him but no answer came back immediately. Instead, I heard another voice: ``The captain needs to be informed of the situation at once.'' The person who had spoken before was now gone as well-probably sent somewhere else by one of those strange men who were always around my friend... 
 
``Yes, I know what's going on!'' He said angrily. Then he turned to look at me again and shouted: ``Where did he go? Was it you that gave him away? Tell me the truth now or else we 'll kill you both together right here and now! '' 
 
``No, no... I swear on my mother's life...'' He said angrily as if he was talking to himself. ``But please don't shoot, just wait until I find him.'' 
 
 ``And what if you do not find him?'' One of the men asked in a threatening voice from behind us without showing any emotion on his face at all... 
 
``Then we 'll have to kill both of you!'' The captain replied again with the same calm tone as before. He turned around and looked at me for a few minutes before saying: ``You are in big trouble right now, I think... So hurry up and find your friend before it's too late!'' 
 
``Yes, sir, but I can not do anything if he does n 't want to be found. He must have some reason for staying away from us even though we are trying our best to reach him. And I don 't think you understand what kind of pressure we face here...'' The captain replied in a more serious tone before turning back around again without saying
