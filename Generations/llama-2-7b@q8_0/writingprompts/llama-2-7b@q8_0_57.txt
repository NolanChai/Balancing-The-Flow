100 per cent, way outta my league. Like a goddamn rock star. I wish I was as cool as you are. ''
`` Cool is overrated. It doesn't last long, and if it did, we'd be over the moon about it. ''
Bridgette blushed slightly, glancing down at her chest in an effort to hide her embarrassment from Jaxon. `` You're pretty cool too. But you're not a rock star or anything. I mean, I can totally relate to you more than any other guy I know. ''
Jaxon was about to disagree with Bridgette, but the fact that she had said something positive in relation to him made her seem even cuter, so he held his tongue and let her continue without comment. `` But, yeah, no one's ever gonna be as cool as you are. It's just not possible. You know this? ''
Jaxon leaned forward slightly in the driver seat of his silver Mustang GT and smiled at Bridgette through the tinted windows, the sunlight reflecting off of her light brown hair that was caught up into a loose ponytail on top of her head. She turned toward him then, her eyes glancing over to the car's rear-view mirror and back again. `` I can only imagine what your parents would think if they saw you hanging out with me right now. ''
Bridgette chuckled, shaking her head slightly as she bit down on her lower lip. `` Well, my mom doesn't like you either...but not in the same way as my dad does. I guess it's 'cause you're a guy and she wants me to stay away from them. ''
Jaxon was about to reply when Bridgette suddenly spoke up once more. `` But, that's not what I meant. The thing is, I don't think they ever would have really gotten along with each other anyway. Your parents just seem...so different than mine in some ways. ''
Jaxon glanced down at his black leather driving gloves then up again to the road ahead of him as he gripped the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles white. `` Yeah, I know what you mean. But don't worry about them. I can take care of myself just fine without their approval or whatever. You should worry more about yourself and how your parents would feel if they knew that you were driving with me right now. ''
Bridgette paused for a moment before glancing up at Jaxon once again. `` Well, I don't really think my dad is gonna say anything to me or...I mean he doesn't like you 'cause he thinks it's not safe and all that but-- ''
Jaxon leaned forward even further in the driver seat as his hand came up to rub against the side of his neck. `` Look, I get what your parents are saying. But if they knew everything that I've been through in the past, I think it would be different. It might not be easy for them to understand but...it's not like I just woke up one day and decided to become a bad boy or something. Like I said before, I can take care of myself without any help from anyone else. ''
`` But what if you need their money? What if your parents kick you out of the house 'cause they don't think that it's safe for you to be living here anymore and then what happens? You gotta have food, man! And--and--maybe one day we could even move in together with my mom or something. That way she'd see how awesome you are and not just judge you because of your tattoos and all that. ''
Jaxon leaned back slightly once more as he shook his head. `` I don't need anyone else to take care of me, Bridgette. And if they want me out, then fine, but it won't be a big deal. It's not like I can't take care of myself or anything. ''
Bridgette looked up at Jaxon through the rear-view mirror once again, her brown eyes flickering momentarily as she held his gaze for what seemed like forever before returning back to stare out ahead at the road ahead. `` Well, I don't care. I just want you in my life too. That way we can be together and do all kinds of cool stuff like going out with friends or something else...I mean maybe even date one day. ''
Jaxon was silent for a moment before shaking his head once again. `` Bridgette, I can't just tell your parents that you are my girlfriend and then start dating you like some kind of creepy guy would do. It would be weird and they wouldn't understand how serious we are about each other or whatever else might happen down the road but...I think it's better if we stay friends for now anyway. ''
`` Yeah, I know. But--it just sucks 'cause no matter what happens between us, there will always be this secret barrier separating us from one another because of our age difference and everything else. And sometimes I feel like things are going to change really quickly in life but then it doesn't happen as fast as you might think it would when you get older--I mean not always anyways but...it seems like nothing ever goes according to plan anymore. It just makes me sad sometimes because I don't want anything bad happening between us either way so maybe we should try harder at staying close despite the fact that everyone else is trying their hardest to keep us apart. ''
Bridgette looked up toward Jaxon again as her hand moved over to grip his own, squeezing tightly before releasing it once more. `` I know how you feel. But this isn't about me anymore. It's all about you and the fact that people think they can do whatever they want with you without any consequences. They shouldn't be able to get away with stuff like that because no one should ever have to go through something like this again in their lifetime either, but...I guess it just goes to show how much we need each other even more than ever before right now.
