igid breath from the mouths of two wolves as they watched each other, nose to tail in the chilly snow-covered field.
In contrast with their surroundings, one was a brilliant silver white; the other was jet black, its back arched like that of a great cat.
The taller one stalking his prey was black. He had a thick winter coat and tall ears, unlike most wolves who live in packs and are born with floppy ears that turn to short triangles as they grow older. Black Wolf, the alpha male, stood on his hind legs, his front paws off the ground, looking down at Sable Wolf, leader of another pack.
Sable’s nose twitched; he could smell the predator’s breath as it crept closer and closer. His nostrils flared as they filled with the scent of the predatory animal. Sable felt his hair rise on his back as the odor intensified, as did his heartbeat, and that was when he knew Black Wolf meant business. He would not give up without a fight, and Sable had to be ready for it.
He turned to face him, snarling fiercely in warning. The black wolf reared onto his hind legs and growled back defiantly. When they met head to head the two locked in a vicious tug-of-war that would decide who was leader of this pack of wolves.
Sable pushed Black Wolf’s chest with all he had, knocking him over, but when his opponent stood again he reared on top of Sable and the two began to wrestle in a mad attempt to establish dominance. They rolled around in the snow together until their legs became entangled in a tangle that was hard to break free from. Black Wolf snarled angrily, and his jaws clamped down on Sable’s neck as if he were trying to snap it like a twig.
Sable’s teeth gripped the black wolf’s flank, ripping off great chunks of fur. He pulled hard with all of his might, but still Black Wolf fought back viciously. Their sharp claws scraped each other’s skins raw as they tried to pull free and attack one another again.
Sable was exhausted; he could barely stand up. But suddenly the black wolf let go, allowing Sable a momentary reprieve from the struggle.
Black Wolf lunged at him with all his might, but just when it seemed like he would be able to tackle his foe, his front paws slipped on the frosty ground and he tumbled head over tail into the snow.
Sable was not about to let such an opportunity slip by, so he jumped onto Black Wolf’s chest with all his might and bit down hard into the wolf’s flank. He heard him cry out in pain as Sable’s teeth tore through his thick winter coat, causing blood to spurt from the black wolf’s leg.
Black Wolf got up and stumbled back several feet, leaving a trail of blood behind him like an invisible line that marked where he had been. He turned around and charged at Sable again with all the speed he could muster but this time Sable was ready for him. He leapt out of his way as Black Wolf tore by, missing him only inches away.
Sable’s eyes were wide open; they darted back and forth from side to side like a deer spotting danger on the horizon. His ears twitched as he sniffed for any sign of danger. He was on high alert, ready for anything that might happen next.
The black wolf had stopped in his tracks and now stood still staring at Sable with an intense gaze. The two wolves faced off against each other, eyeing one another closely, trying to read what the other was thinking. A strange silence filled the air as they waited for one of them to make a move or speak first; it felt like time had stopped and all that existed in this moment was just these two predators locked in a battle to be leader of their packs.
Finally, Black Wolf took a step forward cautiously, his paw prints leaving impressions on the snowy ground behind him as he made his way toward Sable. They were now within biting distance from each other and ready for what was about to come next: one final battle between these two powerful wolves over who would be leader of this land.
As Black Wolf came closer, he lowered himself into a crouching position with his chest high up off the ground; his ears were pointed straight up and his eyes glowed brightly from behind them – he was ready for anything that might happen next! His jaw clamped down onto Sable’s shoulder as they lunged forward once again in what would be their last stand against one another!
