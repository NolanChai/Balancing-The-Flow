in'.
"Ya know, he is quite pretty." He said, his eyes peeked over my shoulder, I turned to face him. "But then again you have always been a little different from the rest. Ya just got a thing about men I guess," he said with a smirk, I just scoffed and pushed past him without saying a word.
"C'mon, ya know ya want it." He said, his hand on my lower back, I flinched at his touch, but stopped and turned to face him. "What?" He said as if confused by my sudden change of attitude. I rolled my eyes and pushed past him again, but this time he had grabbed me around the waist with an iron grip, and now I was faced into a brick wall that seemed to be holding me in place.
"C'mon baby, please." He whispered in my ear. "You know you want it," his hand moved down my back and pulled at the bottom of my shirt, he was trying to lift up my top and see the small piece of skin he could get. I pushed harder against him, and then he let go as if the thought had never crossed his mind.
I turned around again and started walking away from this god forsaken place. He was still standing there when I left. "You're a good girl," he said softly before I disappeared into the shadows of the night.
"Hey!" He called after me, but I ignored him, he wasn't worth my time or energy. So as I walked away from this place that had once seemed like home, all I could think was why? Why did I have to fall in love with a guy who didn't even see me for the person I really am. I just wanted someone that loved me no matter what...I just wanted someone that cared about my feelings...I just wanted someone who actually liked me and not the idea of who I pretended to be.
"Hey! Stop!" He yelled again, but still I kept walking as if deaf to his words. "Baby! Please wait for me." he called once more, and I heard a rustle of leaves behind me and felt something brush against my lower back. I jumped and turned around in the darkness.
"What? What do you want?" I demanded to know as if threatened by this unknown thing that seemed to be following us. "I don't have time for ya," I said, still trying to see him in the dark shadows of the night, but there was nothing. I looked around and then started walking again, my feet hitting the ground with a determined thud.
"You really hurt me you know." His voice came out of nowhere, and this time it seemed as if his words were meant for me. "I just wanted to take your hand in mine, but ya had to run away like some coward," he said before I heard footsteps behind me again.
I stopped and turned around, and this time a bright light shone down upon him from above. It was as if an angel was watching over us both, and then suddenly it all made sense. "You're an angel," I whispered to him as he stood before me like some fallen soldier of the past.
"I am," He said with a smirk on his face. "But I can do more than just watch you," he said with a wink, but still I looked away from this heavenly being that seemed so strange to be here in my world. "Why are you watching me?" I asked, confused by the fact that someone was there at all.
"I am your guardian angel," he smiled again, and I felt his warmth as if it were a blessing upon my heart. "So why did ya come here tonight?" He asked as if I had some sort of secret agenda in my life. I just stared down at him with an unreadable look on my face.
"I don't know," I answered honestly, but then a feeling came over me and it felt like the first time that this stranger knew who I truly was. "And that is why you have been sent here to protect me." He said as he wrapped his arms around my body in an embrace.
"I will be your guardian angel from now on," he whispered into my ear before I felt him walk away from me, and then I realized the truth of everything. I was not alone anymore...I had someone watching out for me no matter where I went or what I did in life. It wasn't until that moment that I finally understood how special I really am.
My life is like a dream come true, but it feels as if some sort of magic has taken place upon my soul. The stars above still seem so far away from us, even though we are close enough to touch them. They remind me of you...and they always will be the only things in this world that I have ever loved without question.
I hope you're happy where ever you may be, because knowing that there is someone out there who cares about what happens to me makes my heart soar with a sense of freedom like nothing else can do. When it seems like all hope is gone, just remember that some one believes in you...and no matter how hard things get in life...there will always be something beautiful waiting for us at the end of our journey through time itself!
The best thing about this story is that it has a happy ending. I was afraid when he left me alone, but then God sent his guardian angel to protect me and make sure nothing bad ever happened to me in my life again. This man is my guardian angel now, and he will always be there for me no matter what happens next!
