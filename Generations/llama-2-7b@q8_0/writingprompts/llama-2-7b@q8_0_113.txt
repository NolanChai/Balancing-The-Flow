 as I struggle to my feet, gripping onto my cane with one hand and my throat with the other.
> 
> My legs shake like the foundations of a building at the end of its days; no longer able to hold up the structure it once did. I stumble out into the hallway towards the front door. The sound of pounding feet can be heard in the house and I know that it is her coming home for another night from her new boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who has been treating me better than my own daughter for the last year since she went to university.
> 
> I open the door and there she is, standing outside in a red dress with her hair curled up in pink ribbons. She looks beautiful and innocent but that is only because she hasn't seen what goes on behind closed doors. The boyfriend she has chosen is a different man to me and it seems to be causing a bit of trouble between us, which I will get onto later on.
> 
> "Hello Mother," her voice is so soft and sweet like the songbirds in my garden, but I know this isn't the truth. She has never been sweet or caring, not even towards me. I don't think that she ever will be because she doesn't have a heart of gold; it only wears diamonds and is covered with rubies and emeralds.
> 
> "I brought you some flowers." She hands me the bouquet and I notice they are yellow and pink carnations.
> 
> *Ding Dong* - the sound of the doorbell comes back to my ears, but this time it's louder than before. I know who is at the door and I don't want to face them so I rush out into the garden and hide behind a tree where nobody can find me.
> 
> My daughter opens the door to him and his body fills up her space as he kisses her like no one else ever could before. I listen through the gaps in the trees, but all I can hear is their breathing getting heavier by each second that passes by.
> 
> Eventually they stop and she closes the door to the house, making me wait another ten minutes for her to come back outside again. When she does she stands there looking at him as he walks away with his car keys in his hand, heading for his silver Porsche that is parked on the driveway.
> 
> She starts walking towards me but I can't find it in me to face her just yet so I run back into my garden and lock myself inside of my house again. It's only then when I realise how much I have been hurt by her actions over the years, how I never got any flowers or gifts for Mother's Day and that she has chosen to ignore me on so many occasions.
> 
> She doesn't know what it's like to grow up in a house where your mother is always ill because she was never really well from the day she had you, not like her mother before who gave birth to two healthy children. My daughter hasn't been able to see me fall over and bruise my knees and legs so much that they have turned an ugly shade of purple.
> 
> She hasn't seen how many times I've fallen into a deep depression, only to come out again with the help of her sister who has been there for me at every step of the way through this hardship. And she definitely hasn't witnessed how my health problems have gotten so bad that it's almost time for my last breath, which I know will happen soon because I can feel death lurking around the corner, just waiting to take me away from this world and give me peace at last after everything that has happened in my life.
> 
> I go back inside and see my daughter standing there with a smile on her face as though nothing is wrong when we've both had another argument over something she can't help. This happens more often than not because it seems like nobody cares about me anymore, which makes me feel useless and unwanted in this world where people only think about themselves before anyone else.
> 
> *Ding Dong* the doorbell rings again, but this time there isn't a red dress or pink ribbons on the girl that I love so much with all of my heart because she has gone off to spend another night with her boyfriend in their own bed where he will make love to her over and over again until dawn breaks through the windows.
> 
> She's never really given me an opportunity to show how much I care about her, but that doesn't mean I won't always be there for her if she needs anything at all because even though things haven't been good between us lately we still have each other no matter what happens in life.
> 
> "Come on, Mum," says my daughter as she grabs hold of my hand and pulls me towards the front door before I can do anything else. It is now that it becomes clear to me why I have been feeling so sad lately and why everything seems so dark inside of this house; we were supposed to go out together but instead, there is only silence between us.
> 
> The sound of the key turning in the lock reminds me that she has finally come home, so I smile at her as we enter into the room where she's been living all these months without me or her sister knowing anything about it. This isn't what I wanted for my daughter, but it is what happened and there's nothing more to say on the matter because this is how life works sometimes: not everyone gets their happily ever after ending like Cinderella did when she married Prince Charming at last after all those years of suffering alone under her evil stepmother's roof.
> 
> "It was nice meeting you," says a voice as I turn around to see who it is talking about me and my daughter together, but there isn't anyone else in the room except for them both sitting at opposite sides of their own beds waiting patiently for something amazing enough to happen between us before going home after another long day without seeing each other again.
> 
> "I have to go now," says my daughter as she walks towards me and gives me a big hug. It feels good knowing that this is just one of many things we will do together because our relationship has always been something special, even if it doesn't always look like it from the outside.
> 
> "I love you," I whisper into her ear before turning around to leave when she gives me an unexpected kiss on the cheek before disappearing back behind closed doors with her boyfriend for another night of being together as one big happy family instead of two separate ones like they once were all those years ago when nothing seemed possible anymore but everything could still happen if only we believed in ourselves enough to make it so.
