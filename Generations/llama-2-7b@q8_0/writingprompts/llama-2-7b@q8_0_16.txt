 few feet high, with no doors or windows. The only furniture was a plain wooden bench that sat at the centre of the room, facing away from one wall. This was where it would end for him.
The moment had finally come and the last moments were upon him. His life was over now, his work finished, all those years spent searching for the secrets of immortality, he had found them. He had found the key to eternal life. There was only one problem remaining; the ceremony that would make him immortal.
He sat down on the bench and leaned back against the cold stone walls, staring upwards at the ceiling of his chamber, a small circle with twelve holes cut into it. He closed his eyes. The chanting he had spent years perfecting began to drip from his lips.
A few moments later the room began to shake. Cracks appeared in the wall and dust filled the air, slowly falling onto the bench. It was coming for him, the magic that would grant eternal life. It took another few minutes but the magic eventually reached his chamber. He felt a burning sensation as the magic flowed into him, then it began to work. The cracks in the wall widened and dust poured through them, covering his face.
He felt no pain, just a dull thud at the base of his skull where he had been struck by some unknown object. He blinked against the dust that covered his eyes. It was still falling around him but it seemed to be stopping now and the cracks in the wall were getting wider. His chamber was filled with smoke and dust and there wasn’t a speck of light anywhere.
Had he been right? Was this eternal life? He felt no different, no different at all. As soon as the chanting stopped it seemed to have had no effect on him whatsoever. He reached up to his forehead and felt a small cut there. It was bleeding profusely but other than that he felt perfectly healthy.
The dust began to clear around him and after a few moments of blinking in the darkness, he finally saw it: A large hole in one corner of the room, about 10 feet high and wide enough for him to crawl through. This had obviously been what was causing all this dust, and he suddenly understood why his chamber had no windows or doors. It was meant to trap you inside.
He slowly got up from the bench and made his way to the hole in the wall. He reached a hand into it but didn’t know what to do next. As soon as his fingers touched the edge of the hole, they were burned. The magic had been working again! But why? Had he somehow been wrong about everything all along? Was eternal life not possible after all?
The answer came to him in a flash of insight; he needed to be cleansed by the magic before attempting to enter it’s domain. He removed his robe and placed it carefully on the floor, then lay down naked upon it. The next time he reached out into the hole in the wall, nothing happened. His skin was unscathed.
With that, he crawled through the hole and entered the magic’s domain.
