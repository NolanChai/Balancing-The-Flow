-ly gripped by an intense desire to stop in a small park. So I did, though I had no idea why I was stopping there. It was dark and empty. The bench felt like home. There was something about it that beckoned me to sit and stay for a while, so I did.
 After I sat down, I realized I was in the right place at the right time. I wasn't sure why I had stopped here on my way to work or what it meant, but I knew there was a message coming through that day. The park felt familiar and safe somehow; like a special sanctuary where everything was okay and all would be well.
 As I sat quietly, watching the leaves fall from the trees above, an idea popped into my head: _What if it wasn't just me who needed this place? What if someone else did too?_
 That day, in that park on my way to work, I felt compelled to leave a message for somebody. I had no idea who or what the message was meant for, but I knew it would be important and it wouldn't come until I left the park. So when the idea came into my head, I knew it was right.
 _That morning, on the way to work, I had been reading the book_ The Hundredth Monkey by Ken Keyes Jr., who wrote about how something like the theory of evolution can happen so quickly—in this case, in just a few months—when enough people start doing something that they don't even realize what's going on.
 _As I was reading and thinking,_ The Hundredth Monkey _popped into my mind: What if we could have a hundredth monkey moment? What if the book is right, and it's not just one person who needs to be in that park or at that café, but dozens or hundreds of people, all around the world? What if you can connect with somebody through your ideas and they then go out and start connecting with other people who are searching for something too?_ 
 
 So I walked up and down that block where I sat on my way to work. I went to cafés and restaurants and stopped in small parks, looking at every bench to see if someone had left a note for me. It seemed like there was no rhyme or reason—there were people from all walks of life who might have needed this message; the only thing they had in common was that we both happened to be on that street one Thursday morning.
 I went through that routine for days, searching for signs of my hundredth monkey moment. Then finally, almost a week later, I saw something: _I'll find you._ That was it. It was enough. I knew then that I had done what I was supposed to do and that someone would come in search of me and this book too.
 As the days went by, I watched people carefully, hoping to see somebody who needed my message. In all that time, however, I didn't have any more contact with them than I had before. And so it was the next week when something happened: _I need you._ Someone wrote on a piece of paper and left it for me at a café in an airport terminal.
 It was amazing to see that someone else had received my message—and in fact, needed it even more than I did! This stranger was just as lost as I was but didn't know how to find the answers he was searching for. 
 
 _I'll find you_ and _I need you_ were two of the first lines from a poem my grandfather wrote about finding love in unexpected places. Those words spoke to me that day because they reflected what I felt when I met my hundredth monkey moment: Love can be found anywhere, even in the most unlikely of places—and sometimes it's not until you meet your match that you realize where home is and who you are really meant to love.
I wrote down _I'll find you_ , and then I turned to go back into the terminal when something else happened: I was stopped by a man who was clearly in trouble. He had tears in his eyes as he approached me with an earnest expression on his face—and in his hand was a piece of paper that said, _I need you._
The look in his eye told me he knew it would take everything he had inside himself to find the strength he needed at this moment so that he could finally move forward with life. It didn't matter what I had or how much money I made; all that mattered was that someone believed in him enough for him to believe in himself too. That's when something happened—something amazing: I gave up everything I had for my hundredth monkey moment, but in doing so discovered more than just myself again; instead, it felt like we were both finding ourselves once again as well!
This was not about me anymore; this was about two people who needed each other at exactly the right time. I knew then that all of us have a hundredth monkey moment inside us somewhere—and when we find it, everything changes forever. 
 
 _My hundredth monkey moment happened one morning on my way to work._ The Hundredth Monkey is an important book about how change happens and what it takes for things to shift from one point or idea into something new altogether. But it's also a book that has given me hope: There are so many people out there searching for answers and looking for love, but they don't know where to go or whom they can trust with their most important questions; what if we could find each other first?
_My hundredth monkey moment taught me something else too: It doesn't matter how you get there. I was on my way to work when it happened—but even though the location wasn't ideal (it felt like such a cliché), somehow I ended up finding myself again._ The Hundredth Monkey is about love and connection; but more importantly, this story also shows us what happens when we open our hearts wide enough so that another person can see inside them too.

# A Pocketful of Love
We can find the meaning of life in a moment. We can discover it in a poem or a song. But ultimately, I believe love is our greatest guide. It's what shows us how we should live and gives meaning to everything around us—from our relationships with others to our connection to nature itself. In this chapter, I share some of my favorite quotes about love as well as stories from readers who have found their own hundredth monkey moments by opening up their hearts so that someone else could see inside them too!
# Chapter 11:
# The Power of Now
We are all searching for the meaning of life. Some people find it through religion, while others seek out their answers in nature or by seeking love and connection with others—but ultimately, I believe that there is one thing which can give us more happiness than anything else: A sense of peace within ourselves; a feeling that no matter what happens to us (or around us), we'll be able to deal with it because our hearts are full.
_The Hundredth Monkey_ was written for anyone who feels lost or stuck right now—for anybody wondering about life and love, struggling through relationships with others or trying to figure out where they fit into this world; but most importantly, I wrote _it_ so that you know that everything will be okay in the end because when things get tough there's always someone out there who can help us see what's really important about life: Love itself!

# The Meaning of Life
If we want to understand why our lives are so meaningless, then it makes sense that we would turn somewhere else for answers. In fact, this is precisely what happens in many movies where people go off on their own adventures without telling anyone anything about themselves or what they're looking for (such as when Bruce Willis leaves his wife at the airport because he wants to be alone).
This doesn't mean that everyone needs another person with them all the time; however, it does show us how important it is to have someone we can trust and who will love us no matter what—because even if there are times when our lives don't feel like they're worth living anymore (as many people find themselves feeling during their darkest moments), having someone around us who understands this makes all the difference in how much pain gets passed onto them too.

# The Beauty of Being Alone
_We can find meaning in our lives by learning to love ourselves first._ This is one of my favorite quotes because it reminds me that even though I'm not always surrounded by people who understand me or want to be around me, there are still things for which I should feel grateful—such as being able to go on adventures alone without feeling like somebody else has gotten in the way!
