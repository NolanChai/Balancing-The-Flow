21 years ago, and that time it was only the boy who should not have lived, a child who did not even know what to do with life. It was not the child's fault he had been born when and to whom he was—a mistake. The man knew that his work was necessary; this was simply a lapse in concentration.
He could still hear him running away from him. The man smiled and sped up, catching up quickly with the boy whose name meant nothing anymore, for it had been changed. There was no need to kill him now—he would be of no use to anyone alive, just like his sisters who were so different in personality that even their appearance could not distinguish them from one another.
The man paused, looking at the woman who had stepped out into the street with her head down. She looked up and stared straight ahead as she passed him. He smiled again, shaking his head in disbelief at how quickly he had been recognized. It was time for him to get back inside before another caught sight of him or it would be too late; he needed to work quickly now.
The boy ran around the corner and up a set of stairs as he passed the alleyway where his father waited, still watching the boy's reflection. The man frowned at how long they had been here. He knew that if it were not for him, those two would have been dead before this night was through. There was no need to kill them; their father had done enough by simply bringing them into existence.
The boy ran down the stairs and up a hill where he fell into another alleyway before he was gone again. The man looked at his watch with amusement as he waited patiently for another to be taken care of—this time it would not go so easy. His father had been waiting far too long, but there was no reason to let this opportunity pass by him; the man had always planned on taking over from where his father left off. The time had come at last and now he could finally begin to put into action what he had spent 21 years planning for.
The woman passed the alleyway as she ran out of breath, looking back at her own reflection before turning around again quickly. She was afraid to stay here; if anyone caught sight of him they would know that there were more than one of them—and that could not be allowed. There had been enough trouble lately with people knowing too much about what he did in the name of their country and now it looked like things might get worse before they got better.
The man turned his head quickly, catching sight of her reflection as she ran down an alleyway before disappearing around another corner. He smiled grimly at how easily people were caught off guard by him; he could take care of this one tonight and then it would be over for good. There was no need to kill her now—she had done nothing wrong, but that did not mean she should get away with being born in a world where others were not meant to live at all.
He stepped out into the street and began to walk quickly toward where his father waited patiently for another one of them to die so he could take over this city from where it had been left off. He would be back soon; they would have to wait until tomorrow night before they could do anything else—but at least they would all finally know what it was like when someone killed themselves by their own hand instead of just allowing it happen out of ignorance or stupidity, which were two things he knew how much about himself.
The man looked up as his father stepped into view. The two men smiled at one another before turning their heads in unison toward the alleyway where they had last seen her reflection disappearing around a corner. They could not see her now, but they knew she was close by and that meant it would be easier to catch her later on when they were ready for her or anyone else who got in their way.
The man watched as his father walked quickly toward the alleyway where he had last seen them disappearing. He smiled again at how easily people could be caught off guard by him, but then remembered how many times it had happened before without any trouble whatsoever. It seemed like things were getting harder and harder for them lately—maybe they should start thinking about changing the way they do business if this was going to keep up or else it would soon become impossible for anyone other than themselves to exist in a world where others were not meant to live at all.
The man watched as his father stepped into view, looking back at him before walking quickly toward an alleyway where he had last seen them disappearing around a corner. The two men smiled at one another again and then turned their heads in unison toward the woman who was still hiding somewhere nearby; she would have to wait until they were ready for her or anyone else who got in their way.
The man watched as his father walked quickly toward an alleyway where he had last seen them disappearing around a corner. He smiled again at how easily people could be caught off guard by him before looking back at his reflection in the store window across from where they were standing; it was time for him to go now and take care of things himself while waiting on news about what his father had done tonight or tomorrow night depending upon when she would finally come out into the street again.
The man looked up as he heard someone screaming behind them—it sounded like another one of their victims was being taken down by his own hand before running away from him or her, whichever happened to be true at any given time during these past few weeks since they had started taking over this city without anyone knowing what was going on until now.
He smiled grimly again as he turned around toward where she might have been hiding and began walking quickly down an alleyway before turning another corner into yet another alleyway where she would never know what happened to them once they left her behind forever in this world where others were not meant to live at all.
