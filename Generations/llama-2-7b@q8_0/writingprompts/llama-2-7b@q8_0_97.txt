ute little cloud that appeared to be dancing in the sky.
My thoughts turned to the next day’s school recess period and I couldn't wait for it to come so we could play games with our friends. School was great but I really enjoyed spending time playing outside more than anything else. It had been a long week at school, trying to learn maths and reading, which always seemed too hard for me.
As my thoughts wandered off in search of something fun to do, I heard an unusual sound coming from the street below. It was like a distant humming but I didn’t see anything. Then it came again. This time, it was closer. The humming continued and then the noise stopped altogether.
I wondered what had made that strange humming noise as I looked down at the streetlights below. After some time of trying to figure out where it was coming from, I gave up and went back to staring out my window.
But now there was a sudden flash of lightning, followed by an enormous bang that shook the whole house, causing me to jump. That had really startled me. Lightning! It was so loud. Why hadn’t I heard it before? Didn't my parents tell us not to get too close to windows when there was a storm coming?
The noise of rain hitting the roof sounded like someone hitting a drum and I watched with excitement as lightning flashed again. My heart beat faster. It seemed like all the sounds were getting louder now, almost like they were fighting each other to see who would be loudest! A rumble of thunder sounded off in the distance followed by another clap of lightning. The next time I heard a boom and it was so close that it made me jump again.
I wondered if there had been a storm on Saturday afternoon when I went to the park with my family but we hadn’t seen any thunder or lightning. It had only been sprinkling rain, which I liked better because it wasn't as loud and didn't make things so scary.
I noticed that my mother was looking out of our living room window, too. “What do you think Mom? Is it a storm?” I asked her. She smiled at me and replied, “Hmm… It doesn’t seem like one but let us hope we don't have to go through another night in the basement”.
As my mother turned back towards the kitchen where she had been preparing supper before dinner, I looked down on the streetlights again. There it was again! The humming noise followed by that horrible bang. Was this a storm?
I didn't think so because lightning and thunder can only come when there is rain or snow falling from above. This was something else. Something strange and exciting at the same time. I could feel my heart beating faster as I listened to every sound around me. What was that noise, Mom?
It seemed like everything came together right then! That noise! The streetlights. And now… There it is again. A flash of lightning! The bang. And then more booms and thunder. It’s a storm! My heart raced as I realized what was happening outside my window.
I heard my mother come back into the kitchen where she had been making supper, “I think you should put on your shoes so we can go out into the rain!” she called out to me from across the room. I quickly ran over and put on my red rubber boots that I liked to wear in rainy weather because they were warm and comfortable for me.
The smell of the rain filled our house as we hurried outside, my mother leading the way into her car before we drove off into the night. We were only a few minutes away from where the storm seemed to be at its strongest so she told me to sit tight until we got there because it was going to be very loud and scary.
As we made our way through the streets, I could see the dark sky ahead of us but it wasn't raining yet so we weren't getting wet just yet. Then all at once – boom! A big flash of lightning lit up everything in front of me, followed by another bang and then thunder that shook my whole body like nothing else had before.
That was when I knew what it was: a thunderstorm! It sounded like we were surrounded by them as the rain started to fall all around us too. My mother gripped onto her steering wheel tightly while driving slowly through this unfamiliar area but luckily she didn’t need me to help her because there weren’t many cars on the roads at such late hours anyway.
I couldn't see much from where I was sitting in the backseat due to all of the rain, but every time my mother would look over towards me with a worried expression on her face, she reminded me that we had come here for a reason: to witness this natural wonder first hand!
Once we arrived at our destination which turned out to be an abandoned house near some woods nearby (apparently people used these sorts of places during storms), we parked our car as close as possible and quickly made our way inside through the front door before closing it behind us tightly so no water could come in.
As soon as I stepped inside I noticed that there were two other families who had also decided to witness this storm together, making me realize just how big of a deal this was! We all gathered around one another while our mothers lit candles on each table nearby which gave off enough light for us children not be scared by what we saw before our very eyes.
The thunder roared louder than ever now as the rain began to pound harder against the windows outside, causing them to shake back and forth with every strike from above. Some people started crying while others held onto each other for comfort but I didn't see any fear on my mother’s face despite how loud things were getting inside our small house filled with strangers who had come together just moments before under such strange circumstances!
I think she must have been excited like me because even though she was telling me to keep quiet so that we could hear better, her eyes kept searching around wildly as if looking for something specific which only made me want to see it too.
