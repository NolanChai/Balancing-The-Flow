pping away with my waking, but one was clear and bright.
I was at school when I fell asleep. That was where I had always been for as long as I could remember. When I was n't sleeping there, I was dreaming about it. 
 
In the dream, I was in a room like that. There were children and teachers around me and a lot of things to do, but everything was unfamiliar. My clothes were different, my hair was long instead of short, and none of the kids looked or sounded like anyone I knew. A few of them smiled at me as they passed by, but I could n't see myself in their eyes. 
 
Then someone called my name. It came from somewhere behind me and was mixed with the din around me; a blurred shouting that made me turn, only to find no one there. I turned back quickly, looking for the source of the sound, but it had gone. I knew what I 'd heard though: it was my name. It must have come from someone who knew me or, maybe better still, from _myself_. 
 
I woke up with a start and sat straight up in bed. The dream faded like the sun setting behind clouds on an overcast day; a soft light of confusion followed by darkness and then nothing but nighttime silence. I took a breath to steady myself, my heart pounding as though it had n't been in my chest for years.
I was not at school.

CHAPTER ONE 
#  _Monday_
I looked around the room and felt better immediately. It was a warm, comfortable bedroom, just like mine was back home; I could almost smell the familiar scent of my own sheets. The only thing that was different was the lighting: it was morning outside but evening in my room. That made sense because it was still wintertime. In fact, according to the calendar on the wall (I read it while I waited for my eyes to adjust) it was December 27th and time was 4:52 P.M., local time. The clock also said it was Sunday, but that could n't be right; I 'd just woken up from a long nap.
My confusion must have shown on my face because the door opened behind me and there stood a man in his early thirties with short hair, who looked at me curiously for a moment before speaking.
"Are you okay?" he asked. He was wearing blue scrubs over a white shirt, and a green surgical mask covered most of his face. He had brown eyes and a light beard on his chin, and I noticed that the lines around his mouth were deeper than those of anyone I 'd seen before, which made him look much older than he actually was.
"I'm fine," I said. "It's just... I must have napped for hours."
"That you did," he replied. He closed the door behind me and came over to help me sit up in my bed. "I brought a glass of water, but I don't think it 'll be enough."
I took the cup gratefully when he handed it to me, sipping carefully so as not to wake anyone else if they were napping too.
"Thanks," I said between gulps. After taking two long swallows, I set the glass on a bedside table and looked around again for something I recognized; some familiar item that would make this place seem more like home. There was nothing.
I met my new roommate's eyes in silence for what seemed like an hour but couldn't have been much longer than five minutes, each of us taking stock of the other as we waited for our eyes to adjust to the darkened room. Finally he spoke again, breaking the silence with a question that I knew would come sooner or later.
"How old are you?" he asked in a voice that sounded tired and deep. He stood in front of me while my gaze followed his movements, searching for some clue as to who this man was or where we were. It took me a moment to answer.
"I don't remember," I said finally with more uncertainty than certainty. "I mean... I 've always remembered before but not today."
The doctor frowned and looked away from my face, looking instead at the wall behind my bed. The clock on it had been blurred by a dusty handprint; he took a tissue out of his pocket to clean off the dirt that was on its face.
"I'm not sure what to make of this," he said as he examined the device. "You were napping for almost seventeen hours and then woke up at four-thirty in the afternoon, local time." He set down the tissue, glancing back at me with a smile. "Are you hungry? I can order something from downstairs if you 'd like?"
"That would be great," I said. He was already walking toward the door before I finished my sentence but paused for a moment to look over his shoulder.
"Do you know who I am?" he asked.
I shook my head in response, and then thought about it as he left me alone. "No," I answered aloud. "But you must know who _I_ am."
He did not answer when he returned from his trip to the kitchen, so I knew that there was no one else there to listen to us anyway; at least for now. This was not a hospital where patients could talk freely with visitors, and it was n't like we were in a public place either. It seemed obvious who my new roommate was: he was the doctor!
But then again... maybe not? I 'd never been in a hospital before or even seen one from the inside; only pictures of them on TV and movies. There was no way to know for certain, but there were certain things about him that made me think otherwise too; small details that together told me he could n't be who I assumed he was supposed to be.
For instance, if this man was an actual doctor (or even a nurse), why would he be wearing scrubs instead of some sort of white coat? Also, how did he know my name without ever meeting me before? It seemed strange that he would greet me with such familiarity after only waking up from what had obviously been a deep sleep.
Finally I got the courage to speak again: "What 's your name?" I asked. He stopped moving in front of the window and turned slowly around, looking back at me as though he was about to tell me something important but then paused when he saw that I already knew who he was. 
#  _Tuesday_
"What day is it?" I said as I sat up on my bed again, trying not to disturb anyone else in the room while looking out over at where my new roommate had been standing earlier. He was nowhere to be seen though; instead, there were just some other people sleeping nearby with their own curtains closed for privacy (or perhaps because they were embarrassed by what I 'd asked).
"It's Tuesday," he answered from somewhere behind me. "You 've been here almost two days."
I turned back around, looking at him through my bedroom window as though he had n't told me that already and was only now telling me something new. But no... this man was the same one who spoke to me yesterday. There were a few differences though, most notably being the fact that I could see his face for myself instead of just knowing it through some sort of instinct or memory; which made him seem more familiar somehow (though not in any way I could explain).
"That 's... interesting," he said as he sat down next to me. "You should know by now what day it is." His voice had a different tone than before, almost like a teacher talking to their student during class time; the kind of sound that makes you pay attention and be on your best behavior. But then again there was still something familiar about him... like I 'd seen him somewhere else before too but couldn't quite place where exactly?
"Where are we?" I asked. It felt strange to say such a thing out loud after being silent for so long, but I knew it would be even more important if he n't answer me first because then I wouldn't know what questions might come next and how long I should wait before asking them myself.
"This is an institution," the doctor replied with a sigh as though he wished things could have been different for some reason but they were not and so he had to tell me anyway even though he did n't want to do it (or maybe just because). "I 'm afraid we can't discuss this further until after your first appointment." He paused for a moment before continuing in an empathetic tone that made me wonder if there were other patients around who had been woken up by their doctor too (but if they did then why would he be telling me all of these things instead). "If you 'd like, we could speak about it after lunchtime when everyone else is awake and I have more time available."
"Lunch," I said. It was a word that made sense somehow but I had no idea what it meant or even how long until dinner would be served because there were no clocks in this room, just like the last one. But then again maybe that '
