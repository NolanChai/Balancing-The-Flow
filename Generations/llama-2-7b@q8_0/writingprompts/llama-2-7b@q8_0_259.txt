 right now. It sucks but you're a smart kid with good grades so you gotta stick it out, even if it kills ya. 
 
 What the fuck do you want to be when you grow up? Like what you wanna do for money? I'm asking because this is like, the most important decision of your life and we need to make sure that it's a good one, OK? 
 
 The other thing. There was this girl. Her name was Tara. She was beautiful. You should have gone after her but you didn't. I know why. Because I'd be jealous as hell if I were you and the truth is that she's prettier than me, so... 
 
 Anyway, shit happens for a reason I guess. At least I hope so or else I'm fucked. 
 
 Just remember this kid: You only get one life and it goes by real fast. If you want to know what a good life is, look at mine. It sucks. So don't blow it, OK?
