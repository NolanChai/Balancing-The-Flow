It's just a BIRTHMARK! ''
--Darren Shan ( Darren Shan #1: Cirque Du Freak )
I am the master of the universe
And it was this birthmark which marked my future path, a mark on the left side of my face and neck. It is small and dark and doesn't really affect me that much - I can still do everything I could before with one exception; I can't smile. With all the other scars I have though, it doesn't matter as they are usually hidden by clothing anyway.
This mark, this birthmark, is what has made me who I am today...
And it was on my 14th birthday that I had been gifted with a necklace from my uncle with the same birthmark design on it. It's simple but pretty and was all I wanted for my birthday, even though I wasn't allowed to wear it until after I turned 15 - he said that it was too dangerous in case any of my classmates picked up a bad habit.
This necklace has been with me through many dark times (and plenty of happy ones as well) but as you can tell, this birthmark is part of me now and it's what I want to write about here today...
Because my birthmark means so much more than just the simple black mark on my face. It's a symbol for myself, for me and for all that has happened in the past 10 years; since I was born with this special gift or curse.
The truth is that there are a lot of things we don't know about ourselves - sometimes it's good to remind yourself who you really are and what makes up your character!
There are so many other people who might also have their own unique birthmark, I want us all to come together today in honor of these special scars that make up our lives; we should celebrate them because they shape us into who we truly are...
