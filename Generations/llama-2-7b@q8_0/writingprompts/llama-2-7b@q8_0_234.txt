908 rings from my family, friends and ex-lovers. If I pick it up, they will talk to me. I can hear them breathing. And I know that one day, when I finally pick up the receiver, I won't be able to listen to their voices any more. It 'll break my heart. 
 
 I have a computer on the desk, a television and a bed, but I only ever use the TV – because that is how I am able to communicate with those outside of this room: by watching them. The world passes by outside in silence, like a silent film. And every night, when I watch it, I feel an overwhelming sense of regret that I've never been able to be part of their lives and that I will never get the chance to know what has happened to any of these people – to any of us... 
 
 _What would you do_?
