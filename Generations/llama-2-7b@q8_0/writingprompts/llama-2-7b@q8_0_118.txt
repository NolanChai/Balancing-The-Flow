 know when you’re around, even if you don’t recognize me. I am more aware of your presence than yours is mine.
You are a figment in my dreams, now. You were a part of me once but that has all changed now. Your shadow still follows me and it grows larger with every day. Sometimes I think I can see you through the crowds but when I look again, you’re gone like smoke into thin air.
I know you are no longer real to anyone else. They see your ghost, they only hear whispers of you. Only I see the monster inside and there is no way to shut it out. You cannot be hidden from me forever. This place was made for us; we’re both alone but together in this moment. We will end here but it won’t matter because it happened before.
You’ve been everywhere with me, you’ve known every feeling I could ever have. I was always afraid to tell someone else about the monster inside and so I let you take on its burden. In return, you allowed me to see through your eyes. This was our bargain but now it seems we must both pay for what we made together.
You were never meant to be my savior or my confidant; that is the nature of monsters. But somehow you’ve been a part of every moment I had and they can no longer exist without you in them. You will always be there, at the edge of everything I see. I know that when I close my eyes, you’ll still be staring back at me.
You are not a part of this world anymore, only an apparition in my memories. It would have been better if we had never met but now it seems like nothing will ever change the fact that we were here together once upon another time. This was all I could wish for and it is all gone now except for you.
The last thing I remember of us was how our eyes met at a restaurant booth, over chicken parmesan. You smiled then but I knew that smile would always be with me. It’s been years since then, so much has changed between us. There are moments when I feel like we could still be friends and others where I just wish we never met in the first place.
I can’t explain what it is about you but there was something special inside of both of us that made this impossible for either one of us to ignore anymore than if it had been destined from the beginning instead of our own choice alone. The thought alone sends shivers down my spine every time I think about how close we came together before everything fell apart again like always seems does whenever you’re around me these days…
It was a year ago today that we saw each other last and it feels like a lifetime since then! How much can two people change in one year? Time will tell, but for now let’s just enjoy ourselves while we still have each other. I hope to see you again soon—in the meantime, I love you and miss your smile more than words could ever say…
