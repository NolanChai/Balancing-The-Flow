arm, slid it back into my holster, and hurried in the direction of the racket.
When I turned a corner, I nearly jumped out of my skin at how close to the cell block the corridor ended. The floor was rusted and dirty. A large hole about three feet long had been torn from one wall all the way to another, creating a tunnel-like passage that led into the main part of the prison.
"I found it!" a guard said as he stepped out onto the walkway between cells and stared into the opening. He reached inside and started pulling out prisoners—one after another they piled up at his feet like a human wall. "It's the end of the world!" he shouted to no one in particular.
The sound was deafening, but it didn't seem to be bothering anyone else. They just sat on their bunks and stared. I recognized one of them as Frankie, an old-timer who had been around longer than most—probably twenty years or more. He looked up at me with a grin when he saw me.
"What's going on out here?" I asked him. "What happened to the wall and door?"
I recognized the expression in his eyes instantly, but he didn't seem to have any idea of what was happening either. His brain had gone blank; there were no thoughts or questions rolling through it like they usually did. He just stared at me as though I wasn't there. The others around him all looked the same way—like a bunch of zombies.
"Something is wrong with the wall and door," I said, but Frankie didn't answer me. A guard behind me cleared his throat. "That's the other end of the hole that the warden opened up last night." The guard motioned toward another tunnel on the far side of the main area.
"What's happening in there?" I asked, pointing to where we were standing. He shrugged.
"No one knows what happened," he said. "I think they just took off through that passageway and ran out into the woods."
That didn't make any sense; no one had been given permission or even a chance to leave.
"But why?" I asked him as my eyes scanned the area. It looked like maybe two hundred of them could have fit in the hole—probably more if they all left together. What was going on? Then it hit me: an escape!
I took off running back through the tunnels to where the main block led out into the yard. I passed more cells and cell doors as I went. When I got to the end of the tunnel, I saw that the hole had been repaired—the wall was patched up tight, and a new door stood in its place.
"Someone is trying to stop this," I said out loud. The guards behind me started talking, but I ignored them as I hurried down into the yard. "I know it's here!" I yelled. "Where did they go?"
They didn't answer me. It was like I had vanished. Just like everyone in the cells above who had seen what happened and heard the noise—it was like no one knew what was happening except for me.
I ran across the yard to where the men were waiting with their dogs, but they didn't seem to care about an escape or anything that was going on around them. They just stared at me as if I had grown two heads.
"What happened?" I asked the dog handler who stood off by himself, far from the rest of us. He shook his head and walked away without saying a word. When I tried to follow him he ignored me too—like I was invisible or something.
I turned back around and saw that everyone in the yard was walking toward one of the gates in the fence. They were all going inside, but they were walking together and talking among themselves as though nothing unusual had happened. Then it hit me: the prisoners weren't running away; they were trying to get somewhere else—back into their cells!
They knew what was happening too! It wasn't just a bunch of people losing their minds at once. I watched them for a minute before I walked over and joined in on the line that led through one of the gates.
"Where are we going?" someone asked from behind me when I got close enough to hear him talk. The guard who had been following me since he saw what was happening looked up as if just noticing I was there. "This is an unauthorized walk," he said, trying to stop them all before they got inside.
The prisoners didn't even slow down. They ignored the guy and kept on going until finally, at last, the gate opened with a clang of metal on metal. A bunch of officers rushed out behind it, but they weren't armed or anything—no one in the yard was dressed like that either.
The prisoners didn't seem worried though; instead they just walked faster so that they could get inside before anyone stopped them again. They all filed into a single line and started heading down the tunnel toward their cells. I followed close behind.
"It's okay," someone said from up ahead of me. "We aren't going to fight them." The words echoed off the metal walls, but they weren't directed at anyone in particular—they seemed to be meant for all of us. It wasn't just one or two people who were talking like that; everyone around me was saying the same thing too.
The men inside the tunnel went silent as we came closer and closer together until finally they stopped walking altogether. We just stood there with our backs pressed against each other, waiting for whatever was going to happen next—waiting in silence with nothing but the sound of our breathing filling up all this space between us where no one could move anymore without bumping into another person's shoulder or leg first.
When I got to my cell block, there were still guards out front and some people standing around inside too. They looked like they had just gotten there; their clothes were dirty and torn, but everyone else in the prison seemed fine with whatever had happened—they weren't even worried anymore because nothing was going on.
The prisoners were all sitting down now, eating breakfast or talking about something that had happened yesterday while everyone else tried to figure out what it meant for today and tomorrow. No one asked any questions; there wasn't anything left inside of them except an overwhelming sense of peace—like maybe they knew exactly how things were going to go from now on and didn't care anymore anyway so long as everything kept moving forward into something new instead of stopping at some point like this moment right here where everyone was just sitting around waiting for whatever might happen next without having any idea what it would be or even if there really _was_ anything coming after all.
I walked up to my cell and sat down on the bottom bunk, which is where I'd been sleeping lately anyway since I've had so much trouble getting comfortable anywhere else in this place. I lay back with my head against the wall and listened as everyone around me continued talking about nothing in particular except maybe what they ate for dinner last night or whether someone liked their eggs hard-boiled or over easy, which really wasn't anything at all but just another way of saying something else altogether even if it sounds like it might mean something more important than that right now anyway because everyone has been so busy trying to figure out what happened yesterday before they can even think about moving forward into whatever is happening next instead.
The silence was broken by the sound of metal scraping against stone as someone moved around outside my cell block again—the guard who had been standing watch over everything we'd done since last night came walking down our corridor like nothing at all bad had happened yesterday and might not happen today either even if everyone else thinks differently about this whole thing because it really isn't anything except maybe just another day in prison where nothing important happens unless someone decides to make some sort of change or start something new instead which is exactly what I intend on doing right now after taking care of the guy who keeps trying so hard not only for me but also everyone else too even if they don't realize it yet because maybe tomorrow will be different than today was yesterday.
I got up off my bunk and walked out into the main part of the prison to see what I could find. There were still a lot of people sitting around, eating breakfast or just hanging out with no real purpose other than waiting for whatever comes next instead because nothing really matters anymore anyway—not even time itself when all we can do is stand here staring at walls while everyone else goes on about their lives as if there isn't anything at all happening right now outside this place where no one cares whether or not tomorrow will be different than today was yesterday.
As I walked back toward my cell block again, another man joined me from inside—the same guy who had been standing watch over everything we did since last night even though none of it really mattered except maybe just for him because he thinks differently about this whole thing than anyone else here does which makes sense considering all the time he spends alone without anyone around him so he has plenty of chances to think up ways to change things instead although I don't think that will happen anytime soon either since there are still too many people standing around waiting for something different even though everything else seems just fine as long as they don't actually do anything themselves.
