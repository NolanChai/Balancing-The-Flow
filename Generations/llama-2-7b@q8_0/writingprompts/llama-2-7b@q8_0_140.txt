The Merman is an ancient sea monster in British mythology. The merman was described as being half man and half fish, usually with a large head on top of its torso and often a tail below the waist. Sometimes a fish's scales or fins were described in place of human flesh. It would frequently live among whales and seals, luring them to their doom by singing beautiful songs. In most versions of the myth, when it died, it would turn into a pillar of salt.
In Greek mythology, the merfolk are often called "Nereids", but in this case they were always fully human; that is, their lower half was not fish-like at all, and in fact may have been quite hairy. These sea-maidens are said to be the daughters of Poseidon and Nereus (or Nerine). According to Hesiod, the merfolk were beautiful women who would dance around the seashore at night; they are also referred to as "nymphs" in The Odyssey.
Apart from the merman or mermaids, there is a myth of an entire race called the Oannenoi (which may be related to the word "oneonos") that dwelt beneath the sea, and who were described by Homer as being half-man and half fish. They are sometimes considered to be dwarves or giants.
In Christian art, merfolk often represent demons and have been depicted in a variety of ways. In the earliest records, they are shown with cloven feet; later versions are seen with more human features than aquatic ones.
The Mermaid is one of a series of mythological beings that appeared from the waters of the oceans. The mermaids were usually depicted as beautiful young women who would lure sailors to their doom by singing and dancing on shore; they then drowned them in order to possess the corpse. In some versions, they are said to have lived among whales and seals.
In Christian art, mermaids were usually depicted as demons or fallen angels who had been cast into the sea when God created dry land from the waters; however, there was also a belief that mermaids represented good spirits who would try to prevent sailors from drowning themselves. They could take many forms, including those of young women, old men, monkeys and birds.
In some cultures it is said that if you encounter a mermaid in your dreams or while awake then you will have good luck; this belief has been used by sailors as protection against drowning themselves at sea. Other meanings include being aware of what others think about yourself (either good or bad) and having insight into things before they happen to yourself or others around you.
