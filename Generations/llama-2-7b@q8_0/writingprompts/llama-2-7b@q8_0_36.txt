izon of the Lonely Mountain and the small people were terrified, trembling as they stared into the flames that began to eat away at their wooden houses.
A great beast, a dragon with a single eye, a red snake like tongue and jagged teeth, rose up from within the fire's mouth, making the people scream in terror. Smaug was magnificent, fierce and powerful, and he knew it; his pride filled him with more power as he sat upon his golden throne and let the flames lick at his scaly feet. He laughed and laughed at their cries of fear; how the feeble humans were so easily slain by such a mighty being.
Smaug had been resting for days, feeding off of the Lonely Mountains riches. It was not that he needed the gold or jewels to live but he simply wanted them all to himself. He had destroyed many villages and small towns, eating their people and everything they owned, and now he intended to finish what he started; he would consume every last golden coin.
He lifted his head into the air as a shimmering silver arrow shot through the night sky and pierced him in his eye. Smaug was confused at first, unsure of who could shoot such an arrow from such a distance with such accuracy, but then he felt the pain in his eye worsen as it began to bleed. He stood up and scanned the area around him looking for his attacker when he saw it: a single dingy anchored high upon the mountain side, its sail being pulled by a group of men and women who were rowing with all their might towards his cliff face.
Smaug knew that they were no ordinary humans; he had heard stories from the villages around about an elf and some dwarves living in the Lonely Mountains. He was certain that this was them, the people of the town of Dale who were trying to kill him for their own selfish reasons.
Smaug lunged at his attackers with all the fire he had left; he wanted to destroy every last one of those feeble humans and make sure they would never again threaten him. He slid down from the cliff face, leaving a path of flames behind him as he burned everything in his wake, even trees were no match for this dragon's fiery breath.
The elf was on the dingy when Smaug reached it and he called out to the elven men; "You will not kill me! I am the one who holds the key to all of your riches!" Smaug said, "If you want them so much then come fight me for them."
The elf looked at him with such hatred that even a dragon could feel it burning through his body like a flaming arrow. He had seen the destruction Smaug had left in his wake and he knew that the only way to kill this beast was by fire, "Come and fight me if you dare," said Smaug.
Smaug's words made the elf angry, but not for what they meant; instead it was because of how Smaug spoke with such arrogance and pride as though he had already won when in fact nothing has been decided yet! The dwarves were no better than any other humans; they would simply use him to gain power over their own kingdoms.
The elf pulled out his sword, a glistening silver blade that glowed in the darkness of night as he stood on deck ready to face down this terrible dragon. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly before stepping off the edge of the boat towards Smaug. The dragons eyes lit up with excitement when he saw him coming closer, "Ahh! Look at you! A brave little elf are we?"
"I am no elf." Said the dwarf as he stepped onto deck and drew his sword from its sheath. He knew that this fight would be hard but he could not let his pride get in the way of defeating such an evil creature like Smaug, "You will die today!"
The two men stood back to back as they faced off against one another; it was a long moment before either spoke again after their first words exchanged between each other. The elf had been studying the dragon's movements carefully and he knew that if he could just get past him then he would be able to stab Smaug in his heart with his sword, but that meant getting close enough without being burned alive by his fiery breath!
"This is going to hurt," said Smaug as he prepared for the attack. He was confident in his abilities and thought it would not take long for him to kill this elf before he could return home with all of Dale's riches, "I am going to burn you alive!"
The dwarves eyes flashed with rage at Smaug's words; they had been studying him carefully and knew that his weakness was in his heart, "Not today." He said as he stabbed his sword deep into the dragon's chest. The elf had used a spell to hide himself from view so that when he struck Smaug with his blade no one could see where it came from.
The dwarves eyes widened in surprise as blood began pouring out of Smaug's mouth; this was not what they expected! It took them only seconds before realizing what happened and how close they were to death. They knew that if they didn't act quickly then their lives would be over, "Come on!" The elf said as he turned around towards the dingy and began running back towards it, but just before he jumped off board something happened which caused him stop dead in his tracks!
Smaugs eyes lit up with rage again; not only had one of Dales people managed to kill him but now another was trying? He slid down from the cliff face once more leaving behind a path of fire as he followed after them. The dwarves knew that if they did not get away soon then this time there would be no second chance!
They jumped off board and began rowing as fast as possible; every muscle in their bodies were strained from rowing against the dragons power but somehow they kept going until finally it seemed like Smaug was falling behind them again, "What is wrong with you?" Said one of the dwarves to another.
"I don't know," said the other as he continued rowing furiously, trying not to think about how close they had come this time or what might happen if something went wrong on their journey back home, "It seems like we're out of luck." He said looking over his shoulder at Smaug who was following them.
The dragons eyes grew red with anger and hatred; he did not understand why these feeble humans were able to kill him twice when it should have been easy for someone so powerful as himself! His head hung low in defeat but soon enough he heard something that made him lift his head again, "I don't know what you are talking about." Said Smaug.
"We've killed you twice!" One of the dwarves said turning back towards Smaug. He did not understand why this dragon was trying to follow them after they had already defeated it once before but now he knew that there were two things which made sense, "You're dead! We killed your heart with our swords and then burned you alive."
The dwarves began laughing at the dragons words; they could not believe that something so strong was telling them what to do when it should have been easy for anyone as powerful as himself to kill them, "It seems like you are out of luck too," He said before turning back towards the ocean and starting his journey home once more.
The elf looked at Smaug one last time with such hatred that even a dragon could feel it burning through their body, "You will not get away with this!" Said The Elven King as he pulled out his sword again ready for another fight against the dragon. He knew what happened before and now he would do whatever it took to make sure Smaug did not escape him once more!
The dwarves eyes widened in shock at how fast and powerful their enemy was, "You will die today!" They said as they jumped off board again ready for another fight against this dragon. This time however they would not give up so easily; now they knew what happened before they could make sure to prevent it from happening a third time!
Smaug stood back watching them fight each other, "This is going to hurt," He said as he prepared himself once more for whatever was about to happen next. The dragon's eyes flashed with rage once more but soon enough he felt something hit him hard on his side which made him stumble backwards into the ocean below!
"How did you do that?" Said one of dwarves looking at each other in disbelief as they stood over their fallen enemy, "It seems like we are finally out of luck!"
