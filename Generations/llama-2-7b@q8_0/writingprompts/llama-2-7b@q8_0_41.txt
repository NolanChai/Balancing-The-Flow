 age are just given a job that no one really needs to do. But she has taken to this title with gusto and even wears her stapler around her neck!
Delia and I work in the office of our church's pre-school. We were hired at the same time, three years ago. She is 40ish, a little overweight, short but not skinny, blonde with green eyes, no makeup except mascara. Not attractive by any means. The only thing that really makes her interesting are her clothes and the way she talks about them.
The day I arrived at work she was wearing a red pleated skirt, black hose and white blouse. Her hair was in pigtails, with a bow on one side of her head. She also wore these brown leather sandals that had heels about 2 inches high, which made them very uncomfortable to walk in. The outfit was so cute, I thought she looked like the little girl from the old TV show ``Leave it to Beaver''.
I asked her what was going on and she explained that this was her church day and she had come in early so we could get everything started for the morning. She then went on to tell me how her outfit was a ``Bible School'' outfit, but I think she just thought it was cute.
The next day, Delia was back with another new outfit, this time blue, and one of her pigtails was down. She told us that this outfit was from church. Then the following Tuesday, she arrived wearing a green skirt, and both of her pigtails were up! I asked her what happened to the blue skirt and she said she had worn it for her ``Bible School'' day.
I was beginning to think that maybe there wasn't such thing as ``Bible School'' at Delia's church anymore, and all this talk of outfits from ``Church'' or ``Bible School'' days, was just a way for her to dress up to work! But then the following week I arrived and she was back in red, and that pink bow on her head again.
That following Sunday, I went to church with her and found out that this time, it wasn't about an outfit from ``Bible School'' or Church. This time Delia was talking about what they were going to do at the Vacation Bible School that day. It started on Monday! And she had been there early to get everything ready for when all of those little kids came in after school.
I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be fun to go shopping with Delia and see what kinds of outfits she bought for her ``Bible School'' days, but now that I know they are for Vacation Bible School, we will probably have to get her permission before going shopping together. She is kinda strict about that stuff.
I asked her why she wasn't dressed up in a Sunday dress today and she said it was because she had been there all night with the other volunteers who were getting things ready for the Vacation Bible School. I guess she didn't have time to change, so she just came back to work looking like this!
I asked her if that meant that we would be starting our own Vacation Bible School at our church and Delia said no, there are a lot of other churches in town doing that, but they don't need any more help than what they already have. Besides she said she didn't want to get into anything where you had to clean up after kids or deal with all their problems. She is a little old lady who likes being the Stapler and nothing else!
