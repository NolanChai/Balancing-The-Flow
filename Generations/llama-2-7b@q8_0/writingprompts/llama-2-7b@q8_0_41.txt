umbfounded and slightly annoyed that I would even question such a statement of fact, as they continued to walk around the room, which didn't seem big enough in any way for them to be doing such a thing. ``Do you want to know what is going on here?'' they asked me with an almost sarcastic undertone in their voice.
I was confused by this whole scenario and decided to just let it all out. `Yes I want to know everything,'' I replied, I wanted answers, and I was desperate for them. The being looked at me as if I had been doing this sort of thing before but yet seemed shocked that I would actually ask such a question with no hesitation in my voice. `` Well then young one. Perhaps I will try to give you the information that you seek.'' The creature said as it sat down on a couch across from me and crossed its legs. `Its feet were disproportionately long compared to how large the rest of their body was, they looked like tree stumps with arms attached, and hands that were almost claw like. ``You have been brought here against your will I presume?'' it asked me as it reached into one of its bags. I had no idea what was happening, and it didn't seem to be worried about my confusion at all but rather just carried on talking as if they were going through an automated routine every day. ``I have been sent here from a place we call ''The Library'' it replied as it pulled out a small book, which I could see was written in Latin or some other language that was completely foreign to me.
It placed the book on its lap and began flipping through its pages like they were an old photo album. They read something aloud from one of the pages. `` It says here that your name is Peter Riley, you are 24 years old and live in the small village of Nutley which isn't far away from here. You have no family that we know of and have never married or had children,'' they said as I looked on with confusion as to what they were doing. `` And it also states that you have been brought here against your will but we cannot say exactly when this was done, but it must be recent due to the fact that you are still quite young. '' It continued as it read on a little longer before putting down the book and closing its eyes. `I don't understand what you're doing or how you know all of this information?'' I asked confused by the whole thing, and the creature just smiled and stood up again.
It walked over to a large wall where several drawers hung on metal poles which were screwed into the wall itself, these seemed to have all sorts of books in them as well as other objects that I couldn't identify what they were at first glance. It grabbed one drawer and pulled it out revealing many more drawers underneath it with various objects inside each one that looked like nothing I had ever seen before. This was something from another world entirely, and yet here I was standing in front of it as if it was the most normal thing in my entire life to be doing this. `I'm sorry but you have been deceived by someone into coming here,'' it said calmly looking back at me after it had finished its inspection of each drawer one at a time before returning them all back into their respective homes and closing the cabinet again with ease that I could only hope to match someday. `I cannot say who is responsible for this deception or why they would do such a thing but we will get you out of here as quickly as possible if it is your wish,'' said the creature before turning around again towards me.
`There are many things that I am not allowed to tell you due to the fact that they could be dangerous and cause harm to both yourself or someone else if they were shared with others outside our organization who have never seen something like this before. But know that we do care about what happens here, even if it may seem as though we don't sometimes,'' replied the creature with an emotionless tone of voice as if nothing had ever happened at all when in fact I was standing right there staring straight into its eyes wondering why someone would bring me so far away from everything I knew and loved. `It is time for you to leave now young one. Please take your belongings and go back home,'' said the creature calmly before turning around again without another word spoken between us after making sure that I had all of my things in hand including my wallet which contained nothing but some change inside it since everything else had been taken away from me while being unconscious when they brought me here.
``Please make sure you don't lose any of these items because if you do we will not be able to replace them for you,'' said the creature in a more serious tone of voice before turning around once again and walking out of sight down one of many hallways that led off into what seemed like an infinite number of other rooms beyond my comprehension at this time.
