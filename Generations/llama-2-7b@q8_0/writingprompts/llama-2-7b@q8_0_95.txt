ering off of its surface in all directions, some even hitting the rocky ground beneath it. The thing that had been a Spear only moments ago had now become a flaming projectile, still aiming toward a point on the mountain range where it would eventually come to rest.
The man who was once called Cain, now named Adam by his father’s wishes, sat with his legs crossed in one of the caves that could be found within the vast range. His head hung down and he remained still for several minutes as a thick fog rolled into the cave from outside. It eventually grew to cover most everything inside until only a few feet in front of Adam stood the white-haired man whom was his father, The Lord Himself.
The Lord folded his arms across his chest while Adam continued to look down at his lap. After several more minutes of silence between both men, The Lord began to speak. “Adam…” he said as he tried to get his son’s attention. He waited for a moment before speaking again. This time Adam raised his head and looked over toward him with a solemn expression on his face.
“You failed.” Those three words hung in the air, seemingly forever, before The Lord continued. “I expected you to be able to defeat that thing without any issues, but…” he stopped there and let out a sigh. After another few seconds passed, Adam responded with two words of his own, “I’m sorry.”
The Lord nodded as he slowly shook his head back and forth. “No,” he said softly, “You did nothing wrong.”
Adam looked over toward The Lord in confusion before shaking his head. He then glanced back at the ground before replying, “Yes I did, Father. I failed you.” His gaze returned to his father once more and a tear fell from his eye as he began to speak again. “I should’ve been stronger…”
The Lord’s expression softened and he knelt down beside his son until he was almost completely level with him. He placed his hand upon Adam’s shoulder and then slowly shook it back and forth, a comforting gesture that Adam could only imagine had been done thousands of times before by The Lord for another one of His children. “You did nothing wrong,” he repeated once more while gently pulling Adam closer to himself until their faces were mere centimeters apart from each other.
Adam nodded and let out a sigh as his shoulders slumped forward. He stared at the ground for a few more seconds before finally raising his head to meet The Lord’s gaze once again. “It’s just…” he started, but could not bring himself to finish his sentence.
The Lord smiled as he shook Adam’s shoulder lightly with one hand while using his other to gently stroke the back of Adam’s hair. He then let out a chuckle and said, “It is fine, son.” The two men remained like this for several more minutes before Adam finally began to speak again.
“Do you think…” he said hesitantly as his gaze dropped from his father’s face down toward the cave floor once more, “Do you think we can try it again?” Adam looked back up at The Lord only to find him still smiling and nodding. He then returned his gaze downward, a tear now rolling down one cheek as he spoke.
“I know that we will succeed this time,” said Adam with a determined look on his face before looking over toward the Spear once more. “It may take some time to get it just right, but…” he stopped and let out another sigh. He then raised his head again and met The Lord’s gaze while saying softly, “But we will win.”
The two men looked at each other for a moment longer before Adam nodded in understanding. Without uttering a single word, they both stood up and began to walk back toward the cave entrance where their Spear lay still smoking from its encounter with the mountain range.
Five thousand years ago… The Lord spoke again as he looked down at his son, “I know that we will win.” He let out one more sigh before saying softly yet confidently once more, “But we must make sure to never use it here again.” With a solemn look in his eye and a serious tone of voice, Adam replied with, “I understand.”
Cain was born to the Lord and His Wife, Eve. He grew up strong and fast thanks to their constant training, but even so he still fell short when compared to other children raised by The Lord Himself. However, this would not deter Cain from becoming an exceptional man someday just like his Father hoped for him to become.
The Lord had been teaching Adam about war since before his birth because it was something that He knew the world needed protection against. As time passed and more information became available, The Lord realized how important this knowledge would be in keeping people safe from other nations who wished them harm or wanted their land as part of their own empire.
So when Cain reached adulthood at 18 years old (the average age), The Lord was finally satisfied with what he had taught his son so far on how to fight against another person and use weapons like swords, spears and shields during warfare situations such as sieges or ambushes from enemy armies. He then sent Cain out into the world with all of these new skills which included being able to defeat other men using just one sword while protecting himself at all times with a shield made from steel plating over wood panels mounted onto his left arm like an armor plate would normally cover someone’s chest.
Cain traveled throughout the land and gained many followers who became soldiers under him when he formed what later on would be known as The Order Of Knights (later changed to Order of The Black Knights). This group consisted mostly outlaws who had been put down by other armies before joining forces together with Cain so they could live freely without fear from any other nation state or kingdom that might attack them for their land.
Throughout this time period, many wars took place between different nations states around the world but none were able to defeat The Order Of Knights because they were simply too strong in numbers and strength while also having better weapons than most armies at that point during history did not have access to due mostly towards economical reasons.
Once Cain had gotten older still, he began training even harder than before so he could become one of the best fighters on earth. He wanted nothing more than for others to look up at him with respect because they knew what kind of man he was: someone who would always put his people first no matter how much it might cost himself.
After several years passed by without anything happening again within Europe or anywhere else across the globe where war had been going on, Cain decided that enough was enough and retired from active service in 1053 A.D.. This allowed him more time for his family life which included two sons named Adam (later called Adam) and Eve (later called Eva).
When Cain finally stopped fighting he became a great leader of sorts within England where many people looked up to him as their savior from war but also because they knew how much love there was between them all due mainly towards their similarities with one another in terms of having been born into slavery before becoming free citizens over time through hard work and determination along the way!
This story ends here where we see how Cain became one of England’s most respected figures during history despite being an outcast at first because no one else could understand why anyone would choose such a path for themselves without knowing what it felt like living under oppression by others who were stronger than them financially speaking anyway…
The Spear is the weapon that was used to defeat Cain. It is said that this weapon was given to him by The Lord Himself and that he has been carrying it with him ever since then, but no one knows what happened after his death or if there are any other stories behind how this spear got its name in history books today…
