ares to believe they'll be enough...''
It is not the first time that your hero has found himself in possession of great powers beyond his control. It would seem that this particular genie knows a thing or two about human nature, and your hero is not at all pleased. `` But what if I want only five wishes?'' he asks with an exaggerated pout.
`` Five! Oh no, you don't! You get the full six-wish deal! No arguing it either; that's how the magic works. There are no half measures. Now you've got a problem: how to make these wishes last forever, and never use up your whole supply?''
This is where we begin our tale...
You may have noticed in the storyline description for this level that the first 6 wishes can be done again if they are not used up beforehand. This gives us an extra opportunity to test various strategies to see how many of the six wishes can be saved and how many need to be spent immediately.
One obvious strategy is to make one or more of the wishes unfulfillable in any way, shape or form: a wish that turns out not to do anything useful; a wish for something you have no interest in ever achieving, etc..
As it happens, this idea works just fine with the very first wish - the genie himself is an unintended casualty of one of his own wishes! We can get him to come back on board by making a wish that includes him in some way. Then we will have the power to make our subsequent wishes conditional upon the outcome of this wish, as long as it remains intact...
There is just one problem with this strategy: if we are going to spend two wishes on the genie's first condition, then there will only be four left for the second. We need a way of avoiding or minimizing wastage on wishes that turn out not to do anything useful.
So what if the first wish has no effect at all? Can we do that and still fulfill some of the other wishes, without using up any more of them than necessary? This would require a fairly sophisticated use of conditional logic: we must be able to tell when our wishes are in fact being fulfilled.
We can start with an obvious wish: a castle (which will provide shelter from the rain). We'll make sure it has everything in it, including a magic carpet so that you can travel to other locations - and you should have enough money to be able to buy anything you need along the way.
Now we make another wish for an item called the `` genie bottle '': this is something that can hold another wish or two (perhaps up to five) in the same manner as our original bottle did. We will fill it with wishes later on, so it has no use by itself - but you should be able to re-bottle and store an unspent wish somewhere safe for future use.
Once we have our castle, you can now make a further wish: that the genie himself (or his bottle) is given a home in your castle. You need only take possession of him when he appears - if you do not want to see him just yet then you should be able to hold off on this for a while.
Now comes an important part of our strategy: we need to create some `` rules '' which will decide what happens after the first wish is made. The most obvious of these rules is that, when the genie makes his first wish in response to your command, he should be given instructions to use this power to help you fulfill a second wish - but if this does not work then we will need something else to fall back on...
The game will now start off as usual; once it reaches the point where the genie appears and asks what wish would you like? you can choose `` I'd like you to stay here with me '' (or some such request) instead of making any actual requests. The next time we make a command it will be after this initial request has been fulfilled; only now do we know that our second wish has gone into effect and so can continue with other wishes as normal...
The following rules apply during each step in the process of making multiple wishes:
1. When you make your first wish, the genie must make sure it is not unfulfillable - either by fulfilling it immediately or sending it back to the well if necessary (and you will be told which option was chosen). If there are no further conditions for this first request then move on to step 2.
2. Once a condition has been met, go through all remaining wishes one at a time and make sure each is fulfilled before moving onto any other condition that might have been set up by the genie's previous command - if none are found then proceed directly to step 3 (unless you have an additional `` backstop '' wish which must be fulfilled in order for everything else to work correctly).
3. Once all conditions have been met, return control of game play back over to yourself so that you may continue with any remaining steps required before moving onto the next round - if no further steps were taken then proceed directly into step 4 (unless there is another `` backstop '' wish which must be fulfilled in order for everything else to work correctly).
The key thing about this strategy is that it allows us to use all six wishes, without having them expire prematurely. We can keep using up each one until we get down to our last three or four; then when they run out we have two `` backstop '' wishes which will ensure everything else works correctly even if these are not fulfilled!
By using this technique I was able to save enough space in my castle to house an extra room that held a large quantity of gold coins for me. So far, so good: but what happens when it starts raining? Well...
