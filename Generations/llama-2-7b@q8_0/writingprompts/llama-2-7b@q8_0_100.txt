30 minute drive has taken almost an hour to get here and I'm not too happy about that.
I pull into the driveway of the house and see that there is no sign of any police presence but I can see the emergency light on the roof of the ambulance, so I park next to it and climb out of my car. As I walk up towards the entrance of the front door, I'm greeted by a middle aged man wearing dark blue clothes with red stripes on both sides.
"You must be from H.Q?" He said as he held out his hand for me to shake it.
I shook his hand and replied, "Yes I am. What happened here?" I looked around the property, "Where is everyone else? We need to take a statement from the lady who owns this house."
"The police and ambulance have been called," he said as he turned towards me, "but they haven't showed up yet. She's in the garage downstairs." I look at him confused because I don't know what he's talking about then I remember that this is the property I was sent to.
I turn around and make my way back to my car, get my statement pad out of the trunk and walk back into the house. As I reach for the handle to open the door, I hear someone call for me.
"Are you the police officer?" They ask, "You're not from H.Q are you?" I look behind me at them. A woman is sitting on a chair with her hands tied behind her back and a gag in her mouth. I walk over to her and help her up off of her seat then remove the gag from her mouth. She pulls it out, looks at it and then looks around before turning towards me again.
"What happened here?" The woman asks. "Well we received a call about an accident and when we came down here..." I look back behind her and see that she has been tied to the chair by her wrists. I remove them too and help her up off of the seat and then walk with her over to where Lloyd's car is parked. "Can you tell me what happened?"
"We got home from a night out, went straight into our bedroom," The woman started to talk as she walked over to Lloyd's car, "then I heard a bang on the front door. So I left my husband in the bed and I went downstairs, then I saw this man at the door." She paused for a moment, "he had his hand wrapped around a knife and he was saying that we needed to come with him or else there would be consequences."
"That's when my husband woke up," she continued. "So I told him to get dressed, grab our phones and keys, and then we left the house through the garage door which leads onto a pathway in the backyard and he ran across it, but the man was waiting for us there."
"He came at me, so my husband ran over and tried to protect me," she said as she stopped walking. "When he got there the man swung his knife, hit him on the arm with the handle of the knife then stabbed him in the chest. We both fell down onto the ground but I managed to get away." She paused for a moment and looked around.
"I don't know if he saw me go or not," she said as she shrugged, "but I ran back inside, locked myself into our room then called Lloyd on my husband's phone because his wasn't with us that night." Her voice was breaking. "And now this is what you see right? So can you please get me the police, he needs to be arrested!"
"Yes ma'am," I said as I put her arm over mine and walked back inside. "I'll go outside and wait for the police then come and get you when they arrive." As she walked away towards her bedroom I turned around and started walking back out of the house but I stopped in my tracks, I heard a door open somewhere downstairs so I waited until he came up from the staircase before I made my way outside.
As soon as he opened the front door I could see that it was a young man who looked like he had been crying. I walked over to him and asked "Are you alright? Are you hurt?" He said nothing as he turned around, put his hand up against the side of his face then nodded, so I decided not to push my luck any further.
I went back inside and picked up the statement pad from where it was on the kitchen counter. The woman had sat down at the table again and I took a seat in front of her as she stared down into her lap. After a few seconds she looked at me, "He's not going to kill us is he?" She asked with a voice that broke my heart.
"No ma'am," I said as I looked over the statement pad and started writing. "The police will be here shortly so we have to wait for them." I turned around, "can you tell me where your husband is? What happened when you came downstairs?" She didn't reply so I waited until she finished staring at her lap before asking again.
"He was dead," she said as her face contorted with sadness, "I don't know why he had a knife on him." I turned around and wrote that down in the statement pad. I looked back over to her but there were still tears rolling down her cheeks so I put my arm behind me, placed my hand against it then gently pulled it up until we were face to face.
"I'm so sorry," she said as she grabbed a hold of my hand with hers and held onto it tightly. "Are you going to let him get away with what he did? You can't let this happen!" Her voice started rising in volume, the tears on her face turned into angry, frustrated sobs.
"I promise," I said as I pulled my hand from hers and stood up again. "He won't hurt either of you." The police sirens came down the street and they became louder and louder until finally I heard them stop outside in front of Lloyd's car, so I walked towards the garage door to let them inside then opened it for them as they ran into the house.
The woman got up from her seat at the table and hurried over towards me, "Thank you," she said with a smile before turning around and walking towards her bedroom. The police officer came through the kitchen entrance so I walked over to him.
"Sir, what happened here?" He asked as he looked down at Lloyd's body lying on the floor next to his chair then back up at me again. "A man was threatening a woman and her husband," I replied. "They had been out for dinner that night but when they got home there was a man waiting for them in the garage, so he tried to protect his wife."
"And the other man?" The officer asked with a serious tone. "He stabbed Lloyd through the chest and then killed him," I answered. "But before she died, her husband managed to escape and run into their room upstairs." He nodded at what I said next before looking around the house again.
"We have no idea who he is yet or where we can find him," I said as I pointed towards Lloyd's car, "but this is all that was left in his possession when they got here so if it helps you guys out any then that might be a good place to start." The police officer turned around and looked over at the woman sitting on her bed.
"This is your statement ma'am," I said as she stood up from where she had been sitting, "but please remember everything that happened here tonight because we need you both to testify against him if he manages to get away." She nodded and walked out of the house with one of the police officers.
"So what now?" The officer asked me as I closed up Lloyd's car and locked it, "do we have any idea where they took her? Or how much time has passed since this all happened?" I shrugged at him. "All I know is that when he got here..." My phone started ringing in my pocket so I pulled it out.
"Lloyd," I answered the call as soon as I saw who was calling me, "I'm just finishing up here now." I paused for a moment then said to him, "do you think you can come and pick me up? There's been some trouble at H.Q so we might not be able to get back until tomorrow morning."
"Yeah sure thing," Lloyd replied as he put his phone down on the table, "I'll come and pick you up in the next half an hour then?" I nodded as I turned around again before heading back inside.
"Okay, so this is what we need to do now." I said to him as soon as we got into my car, "we drive straight over to H.Q where Lloyd will pick us both up and we can head home together from there." The police officer nodded at me again before getting out of the vehicle and walking around the side of the building to get inside himself.
The sun was setting by now so it wasn't long until I parked my car outside of HQ, got back out then walked through their front door where Lloyd
