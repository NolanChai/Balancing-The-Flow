st in the room was served with a hot cup of coffee and a huge plate of freshly baked croissant! The food was delicious, and my body loved every bit of it.
 
 ``I am going to miss this place when I leave'', I thought as I made my way up to my suite. I was in paradise, but there was more to come. That evening, I got a chance to meet the owners of the resort and hear their story about how they started it all.
 
 They were two brothers who grew up together on an island where this resort used to be owned by their grandparents. It has been passed down for generations and is now run by the family. The resort has a special place in their heart, as do I for mine. This was my first time away from home without any distractions or worries.
 
 ``Now let us get to our next adventure!'' said one of them excitedly while showing me around some secret spots on the island that only locals know about. They were amazing places like hidden waterfalls with natural swimming pools created by nature herself, where I could take a dip underwater and explore the wonders that lay below - giant sea turtles who had made their home there for hundreds of years!
 
 ``We have to go snorkelling next'', said my friend. It was time we went exploring the reefs around here. We found some amazing fish, octopuses and other creatures living in these waters just offshore from our hotel room window!
 
 ``I feel like I am a kid again'' I thought to myself as I swam through this hidden world below sea level that most people would never even know existed. It was truly an amazing experience, but now it was time for me to go back home.

``I'm going to miss my new friends! But I can't wait to share these experiences with them when we get back'' I said as I made my way upstairs from our hotel room window. My heart felt full of joy and happiness after such an incredible experience at this beautiful resort in the Caribbean Sea.
