The war began years ago. When the human plague spread beyond their lifeless solar system. No longer were the invaders content to destroy their own planet but they sought out the furthest worlds from their galaxy and destroyed them, leaving nothing behind. They arrived on our homeworld without warning and the battle for survival began.
Now Earth is under siege by the invader's armies while mankind desperately scrambles to find a weapon that can stop their advance.
The planet has been ravaged by war and the few humans left alive live in fear of being overrun and enslaved. To defend against this fate, the people have created the Iron Legion: an army of robots designed for combat. The robots are the only thing standing between mankind and extinction.

The Iron Legion is made up entirely of robots who serve as soldiers for humanity's cause, but they are not the first robots to be given free will. For 20 years before the war began, a robot named Aidan fought to keep his humanity and stop a war that he started by accident. But when the invaders arrived on Earth, he was forced to abandon humanity for their cause. Now, in the midst of a civil war between humans, robots who can think for themselves are feared as the greatest threat to mankind's future.
