apping again. I opened the door and walked over to see if something was there.
I peered through the small gap between the curtains and saw nothing, so I closed the door. As I turned away from the window, the taps came again but this time much louder. I immediately checked back to see what it was and, to my surprise, the tap on the glass had left a smear of blood there.
I went over to investigate and that is when things began to happen. The window started to rattle violently and the curtains were being pulled from the sides by an unseen force. I yelled out for my son to come to his room as fast as possible, but by this time he was already standing in front of me, eyes wide with fear.
The tapping continued and then a small hole appeared in the middle of the glass pane which began to bubble up like it had been scorched from within. A second later, a white face appeared through the hole and its eyes were so large they filled up the whole space. The blood was still visible on the window as this thing looked into my son's room with a vicious grin before it slowly faded away.
I ran over to the door and locked myself inside and then turned around to see that my son had just been thrown against the wall by an unseen force, his eyes bulging out of his head in fear.
I went over to him, but he would not speak or look at me as I held him close. The tapping resumed and again a large hole formed on the glass but this time when it faded away, there was nothing left. Just an empty pane where the window used to be.
It took two hours for my wife to calm down enough to sleep because of our son's screaming and sobbing in his room. The next day I had a new window installed by a company which specializes in home security systems, and we haven't been bothered since.
