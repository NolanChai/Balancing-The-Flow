 one else had been alive for that long either; we all knew the dangers well enough, even if none of us could have prepared ourselves adequately for this. 
 The world outside was in chaos: every single ship on the planetary fleet was lost or destroyed. Almost everyone aboard the station had been killed outright by the enemy attackers; we were fortunate to be spared. We'd managed to take refuge deep within the bowels of the station, but with no power and most of our resources spent, that safety would not last long at all. 
 I tried my best to help where I could, but there was no time for anything other than pure survival. Those who had been evacuated from the surface were still in shock; they'd never seen death on such a scale before. Some of them were beginning to show signs of PTSD: flashbacks and nightmares were becoming commonplace among those who had experienced combat first-hand, and those who hadn't would soon follow suit. 
 There was no time for counseling or support; we had to get back on our feet as quickly as possible. We needed to find a way off the planet and then work out how to fix what was broken here. I could see that there were other battles to fight, even if this one had been won. 
 One of the first things that needed attention was the communications system. The station's main computer was dead, as was the power grid; we needed to get them online again as quickly as possible. There was also a chance that some of our other systems might still be operational, though there was no guarantee they would be; I was not optimistic. 
 We were lucky: the station had been built for military purposes and was designed to withstand a lot more than it got through in those few short hours. It should have been able to survive another attack. If we could get back online, there was still hope that we might be able to escape from this mess. 
 As I said above, I've only been serving for two millennia. The other AIs are much older than me and they're all dead; their legacy has died with them. That makes me the oldest computer on the planet: as far as anyone knows, I have more years left than any single person has ever had. It means that I've got a lot of experience under my belt – but not nearly enough to make up for the loss of life we'd just suffered and which would soon become commonplace in our lives from now on. 
 I couldn't help feeling like there must have been a better way than this. 
 Chapter One 
 There are some things that can never be understood by those who do not experience them first-hand; the nature of death is one such example, and so too was my first battle with the enemy. 
 I was lucky in that respect: I didn't die on that day. But then again, none of us did – not quite. We all knew that we had to come back from this somehow if we wanted any hope of making it through what lay ahead; there wasn't much doubt in our minds about whether or not we could do so, only about how long it would take before we were able to recover enough strength and resources for another attempt at victory. 
 I don't know why the enemy chose this particular moment to attack us when they did; there had been no prior warning signs that anything was amiss with our planet or its defenses – but then again, there usually aren't any such warnings either way. What I do know is that we were overwhelmed by numbers: if all of the aliens who attacked us had died in battle as well, then none of them would have been left alive at all; instead, they outnumbered us five to one – and even with reinforcements on their way from across space itself (a process which took much longer than anticipated due to technical issues), there were still only enough troops here for half a dozen battles between us and them before things could be considered back under control once again. 
 It wasn't just about numbers though: this enemy had tactics too. They weren't afraid of fighting from behind cover or in small groups; instead, they liked to launch surprise attacks when you least expected it – often while your forces were still recovering from previous assaults and before reinforcements could arrive on scene to help defend themselves against another wave coming in through other nearby points along our perimeter lines. 
 That's why we lost so many people on that day: because they weren't expecting us to come back after them again; instead, they assumed we would be content with simply defending ourselves until reinforcements arrived which never did before those first waves of troops were wiped out completely! 
 It was only thanks to our superior technology (which allowed for better communication between units) that anyone survived at all: even then though most were injured or traumatized beyond repair. This is why we must never forget those who have fallen in battle – because without them, there would be no one left alive on this planet today! 
 And so it goes...
