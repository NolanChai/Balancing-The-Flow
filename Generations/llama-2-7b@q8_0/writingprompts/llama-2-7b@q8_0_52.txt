 "Their' code was like nothing I had ever seen before, but it seemed to be the same as mine. If they were trying to communicate then they had succeeded."
 
 
 
 He called for his father and they tried working on the message together. After a couple of hours of attempting to decipher the binary language they still could not understand what the message meant, although the contents were starting to make more sense now that they knew it was their' own code.
 
 
 
 "I can't believe we were able to create something so amazing yet so simple," said his father.
 
 
 
 "But how did we get our' hands on the formula for it?" asked Michael.
 
 
 
 His father looked at him as if he had lost his mind, "It was never a formula, son!"
 
 
 
 "I don't understand," said Michael.
 
 
 
 "Well of course you don't, we haven't been able to teach it to you because you wouldn't be ready for the information yet."
 
 
 
 "That makes no sense," protested Michael. "If you couldn't understand it how was I supposed to?"
 
 
 
 His father looked at him sternly, as if he was talking about something very serious and important: "This is not your time yet." He continued, "We have kept this from you because we felt it would be too much for you to process. But now that you know the message is for you...well it's up to you what you do with it."
 
 
 
 Michael was confused as his father led him back to the secret room where the formula had been kept hidden. He was so perplexed he didn't even question why they were giving him access to this code when he was only a boy and it had not been taught to him yet; perhaps because they knew that he would be able to understand it if given time but they didn't want him to have to wait until the end of his life to learn it.
 
 
 
 He found himself inside the room, alone with the formula. His father had already left and he was completely unaware how much time had passed as he began to study the code. At first it seemed like nothing more than a collection of gibberish symbols but he knew that if anyone could find a way through them then he would be able to do it.
 
 
 
 He spent many hours trying to decipher what it was all about, and though his mind was often full with frustration because he didn't seem to be making any headway in figuring out how these characters worked together, there were moments when he would suddenly feel like an electric current had gone through him. It was as if a part of himself that had been hidden away for all those years began to stir, coming alive once again after being dormant for so long.
 
 
 
 Whenever he had these feelings it was always followed by intense headaches which lasted until he could no longer concentrate on the formula. His father was right: this was not his time yet and it seemed like it would remain that way indefinitely. However, just because something wasn't meant to happen at a certain moment doesn't mean that it won't ever take place; sometimes things have a habit of happening when we least expect them to.
 
 
 
 The next morning he woke up feeling unusually alert and energetic despite his late night spent poring over the code until dawn broke across his bedroom window, casting long shadows across his face from where they were cast by some unfamiliar shapes that were hanging there. When Michael looked back at them again he noticed they were mirrors: large enough to fill an entire wall and made of glass which reflected everything around him so perfectly it felt like looking into another world entirely; one full of infinite possibilities waiting only for those who dare to step inside and explore what lies beyond its boundaries...
