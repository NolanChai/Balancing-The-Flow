iped from my eyes and chest and throat by hand-scraping cloth, clumping, wet on my fingers. I hold it to my mouth, breathing it in. The water is warm, but I don't care because I have sweated through the clothes that were my bedding last night and there's no way for me to get a new shirt before we reach my home town of Avalon, Michigan, where everything will be all right again.

 Water. In the ditch. It's cold and it stings as I dip into it up to the elbow, holding my arm out of the water in case I need it for anything else. It's got a smell like dead fish and metal, and my knee aches where I tore my jeans on the edge of this fucking ditch and I can hear the sound of tires crunching through dry leaves, the noise growing louder as they get closer; I should have been running by now but my body is screaming for me to stop. The metal-fish smell is everywhere in my mouth and nose and it's too late because there's a headlight shining into my eyes, blinding me and making the water look like blood, and it's getting closer.

 Water. It's cold, but I don't mind because there are people who need my help, and they are all around me. They need things that only I can provide – the water I swim in every day, the air from my lungs that I share with them through my words; I am their life-support system. It is a constant responsibility that I accept gladly; I cannot imagine ever not being able to take care of these people. They are everything to me and they need me for survival.

 Water, in the sink. It's running down my body as I stand over it, letting it drip from my face onto the floor, letting it slide across the tile and down the drain into some other place where there is no one for me to take care of and protect; where I can just let myself go and not worry about anything.

 Water. It's raining, which means I have to get back inside before it gets too cold in the tent tonight; it will be better than sleeping underneath a wet blanket. But then again, maybe not; there is no fire that will warm me up here at the bottom of this fucking ditch, and I am scared because it's dark around me now, even though the moon shines down from somewhere behind the clouds – it's too high to be able to see anything clearly. There are leaves on the ground, crunched into my knees as I try to get up out of the water; and there is a noise in the forest, like some wild animal sniffing the air for me.

 Water. In a glass. It's not mine because I can't afford it right now and anyway, it tastes funny in this hotel room – like there is something bad in it that wants to come out of my mouth if I drink it. My roommate, who doesn't know yet what has happened to me or why I have come here for him, has been staring at me silently from across the room for what seems like a long time; he is sitting on his bed with his legs crossed and one foot tapping against the other ankle. I can feel my mouth drying out in the way it does sometimes when I'm not thinking about drinking water, and I'm glad to see that there is some left in the glass next to my bed.

 Water. In a bowl. There are apples floating in it; we cut them up before putting them in the water for decoration, and they smell like they're going to taste good once I pick one out. But that won't be until after I eat all of the other food on my plate and have my fill from whatever else is left over from last night's dinner party – there was too much for me to carry back home with me in order to feed everyone who didn't get invited, so now I am just going to have to make do without.

 Water. In a cup, being poured out of a glass bottle by my roommate who has been staring at me silently from across the room for what seems like a long time; it is warm and tastes funny in this hotel room because there's something bad in it that wants to come out of my mouth if I drink any more than I already have, which isn't very much since we are both hungover after last night's dinner party – too much food for us to carry back home with us so now we just have to make do without.

 Water, in the sink. It's running down my body as I stand over it; but then again, maybe not – there are no people around here who need me for anything, so maybe it doesn't matter if my clothes get wet while I wait by this ditch until somebody comes along to help me out of it?

 Water. In the bathroom sink, where I have been standing for a long time trying not to look at my reflection in the mirror and wondering what has happened since last night's dinner party; there are no people around here who need me for anything, so maybe it doesn't matter if my clothes get wet while I wait by this ditch until somebody comes along to help me out of it?

 Water. In the shower; it is not mine because there is no one else using it right now, but I am glad that there isn't since otherwise somebody might see me naked under this hot stream of water and then think bad thoughts about what kind of person would do such a thing? But then again maybe those kinds of people exist out here too; maybe they have come from another town to take advantage of our natural resources or because they know that we don't want them here anyway – so maybe it doesn't matter if my clothes get wet while I wait by this ditch until somebody comes along to help me out of it?

 Water. In a cup, being poured out of an unlabelled bottle onto my head and shoulders; the heat makes sweat run down my face and neck like tears as I struggle to breathe in through my nose because there is nothing left inside my lungs but air. My roommate who has been staring at me silently from across the room for what seems like a long time, looks away when he sees me turn off this hot stream of water; it's not his fault that we both got hungover after last night's dinner party – there was too much food for us to carry back home with us so now I am just going to have to make do without.

 Water, in the shower; it is not mine because there's no one else using it right now and I don't know how long we will be staying here before we have to go back home again – but then again maybe those kinds of people exist out here too. Maybe they came from another town just like us, only with different clothes on their bodies than the ones that they were born into – so maybe it doesn't matter if my clothes get wet while I wait by this ditch until somebody comes along to help me out of it?
