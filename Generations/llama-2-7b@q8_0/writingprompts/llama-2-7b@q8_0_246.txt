eless white, but that wasn't what caught my attention. It was the thing on the floor that did. A pair of golden wings, about as big as I was. I looked up at the woman standing behind me, who was wearing a white lab coat with her hair in a bun. She smiled down at me and said something I couldn't make out.
The next thing I knew I woke up in my bedroom. It was a very messy room, covered in paintings of various types of dragons.
"So that's where you slept..." The woman said from the doorway as she entered. She was wearing an all white lab coat, with black sneakers on her feet and black hair tied back into a ponytail. Her eyes were bright green. I stood up and stretched. "You're awake!"
"Yeah." I said. "Who are you?"
She laughed slightly before replying "I'm Dr. Nora, the scientist who found you on that island where you slept for a year." She smiled. "What's your name by the way? You don't have to tell me if you don't want too... I won't be mad at all."
"I can call you Dr Nora?" I asked, before replying with my own name; "Gabriel."
She nodded. "Alright then. Gabriel, we need your help." She smiled. "There are two types of dragons in existence, there's the regular kind and then there's this special kind... They call them 'special'. It's not because they're beautiful or anything like that; it's because their genetics are different from normal dragons, so we don't understand how to breed them with each other."
She paused for a moment and then continued "And I believe you may be able to help us with that. You see... The first special type is this one..." She said pointing at the picture of the dragon on my wall; it was an Ancient Dragon, and the second one was... "Well the second one is you."
I frowned slightly. "Wait... What?" I asked.
Dr. Nora smiled. "That's right... You are a special kind of dragon." She explained, taking me by my hand. "Now come on! We have to go back to our lab."
