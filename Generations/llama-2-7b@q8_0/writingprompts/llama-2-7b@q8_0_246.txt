ieving and an entire life that had turned to shit in a few short months.
"You're having one of your bad days," I said as he pushed away his plate of fried chicken. I waited for the usual argument about how it wasn't fair, that this world was supposed to be easier. That's what George always started out with. The same complaint that he had every night for months now.
"Yeah, but don't you understand? I don't want pity or anything like that," he said as tears welled in his eyes and began sliding down his cheeks. "I just want to feel like I belong again."
He continued staring at me, his chest shaking with emotion until my voice broke the silence of our meal.
"So don't," I replied, looking directly into his sad face, a place where you could see every bump, wrinkle and scab that life had left on him. "Don't tell people your story."
He shook his head in disbelief at first before it slowly began to sink into him as I continued speaking.
"George," I started, "You can feel like you belong again by not telling people your story. You are the only person who can know how you feel on a daily basis and the rest of us? The people who have been trying their hardest to help you out? We don't need all that extra information. All we want is to get you through today. So stop thinking about what happened yesterday or will happen tomorrow. Just live right now, right here."
George had no idea why I was talking so much to him. He didn't know me from a hole in the wall but his sad face and my own selfishness made it impossible for me not to keep trying until he believed that all the things we were telling him might actually help him.
"You gotta stop thinking about how your wife died," I said as George wiped the tears from his eyes. "You can't tell us what you're feeling every single day anymore and I know it hurts but if you keep trying, you'll get through this."
I reached across to pat him on the shoulder before he stood up. He looked me dead in the eye as he said, "Thank you. Thank you for talking to me like that."
And from that night forward George stopped telling everyone about his troubles. I never asked how he was doing because if he wasn't okay today, it wouldn't matter what happened yesterday or what would happen tomorrow. As long as he kept breathing and living one moment at a time, everything else would fall into place.
And by the way, George still has bad days but so does everyone else and I can honestly say that I don't know him anymore than I did on that day when we met for lunch and had the most important conversation of our lives together.
