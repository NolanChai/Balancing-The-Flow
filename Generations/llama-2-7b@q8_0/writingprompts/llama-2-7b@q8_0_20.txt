 
 ``I should have killed you then!'' he growled. 
 
 I shook my head. ``It's too late for that now, isn't it?'' I asked him softly, as I drew my dagger from the scabbard at my belt and walked up to where he was sitting. My gaze focused on his heart. 
 
 He swung around in a frenzied attempt to defend himself, but too late - I had already thrust my blade into him with all the strength I could muster, and my hand found firm purchase on the hilt as I dragged it back. The fox gave a choked gasp as he felt his life blood spill out onto the floor. 
 
 His body shook violently and then grew still, and the yellow eyes gazed up at me with a look of shock before closing for good. 
 
 I wiped my blade clean on his shirt and stepped back, staring down at what had once been the fox's face. The nose was gone - blood-drenched rags hung from it now in place of fur. 
 
 I reached out a hand and touched it gently - it was still warm...
#  Chapter Fourteen - The Tears
The fox had fallen to the ground, his body still twitching spasmodically as he shuddered through the last throes of death. My blood was boiling now with fury at what he'd tried to do to me and my friends, but I knew better than to act rashly - after all, it would be too easy for him to turn back into a fox if his body wasn't dead yet. 
 
 The thing that had been the fox was still warm to the touch, so I took my dagger and sliced downwards with it, severing its head cleanly from its neck as if I were cutting through butter. 
 
 My work done, I stared at what was left of him for a moment longer before turning away, my fists clenched in anger. There wasn't much blood on the ground around his body - it seemed he had tried to avoid making too big a mess as he'd made his way through the town, and he hadn't managed to drain anyone completely dry yet either; only two of the bodies were already completely drained by that point. 
 
 I took a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down before stepping over to the wall. There was something written on it there - as I looked more closely I noticed that it was just one word, but it was scrawled over the whole thing: ``KILL''. 
 
 I frowned at it for a moment. Why would anyone write something like that in their own blood? Was this some kind of threat, or a declaration of victory? Or had the fox been trying to send me a message somehow? I shook my head and walked back over to where his body lay - maybe it was just as well I'd killed him rather than let him kill me. 
 
 I turned away from the bloody mess that he had made of the town and went in search of the others, hoping that they were safe. My friends were all waiting for me at the edge of the woods when I found them - and it seemed I wasn't alone in my anger. 
 
 ``Why didn't you kill him when we first met?'' asked Aaron furiously. He was pacing up and down, his arms swinging back and forth as he did so. 
 
 ``It would have been too easy to get rid of him that way,'' I told him. ``I wanted to catch him red-handed, and now we've got the proof we need!'' 
 
 The others all looked at me in astonishment - they had no idea what proof I was talking about. But before anyone could ask any more questions, a sudden crashing noise sounded from within the house that the fox had been hiding out in and my friends quickly drew their swords and started towards it. 
 
 ``We can't leave him to do this all over again!'' I yelled after them, but they didn't stop - instead they raced inside with Aaron leading the charge. I could hear some screaming coming from within and followed quickly behind. We were running towards another room in which two men lay dead on the floor - their bodies drained of blood, and both showing signs that they had been killed by a creature who was using its claws like knives. 
 
 ``He's going to kill them all!'' Aaron cried as he stared at the bodies lying in pools of their own blood on the floor - one of which belonged to his friend, Peter. He turned and ran from the room quickly, not stopping until he was back outside again where I was waiting for him with my sword drawn. 
 
 ``You have to stop them!'' Aaron shouted at me, his eyes wide with fear as we watched through a broken window what was going on inside. We could see that there were several more people being slaughtered like that now - all of the town's residents seemed to be turning up at the house where the fox had set up camp and they weren't fighting back, even though it would have been easy enough if anyone tried hard enough. 
 
 ``We can't let him do this!'' Aaron cried out again. He was right - we couldn't just stand there and watch these people being murdered like animals while their attacker did whatever he wanted to them without any interference from us. I nodded my head in agreement, then turned back towards the house. 
 
 We could still hear some screaming coming from within the building now - someone was still alive inside despite all of what had happened already and we knew that they would probably die if we didn't do something soon enough to stop it happening again. I took a deep breath before stepping into the house where my friends were waiting for me just outside one doorway while another stood slightly further away from us - there was no way we could reach this person in time to save them unless we did something now, but what could we do? 
 
 Then it hit me: I didn't need a dagger or sword anymore - all I had to do was run at full speed and grab hold of the fox before he could transform back into his human form again! It wouldn't take long for him to realise what was happening once I did so, but that would give me plenty of time to stab my blade right through his heart while we were both still in our animal forms. 
 
 The fox had been inside the house for less than five minutes when it happened - he didn't stand a chance against three people running at full speed after him! He tried everything he could think of to get away from us, but none of his tricks worked and before long my blade was right through his heart. The fox fell over dead on the floor with blood pouring out of both sides of its mouth as I stared down at it in shock - had I just killed one of my friends? 
 
 It took me a moment to realise that Aaron and Peter were already back outside, standing next to each other as they watched what happened. Their faces looked so pale, but they didn't say anything - instead their eyes remained fixed on the fox who lay sprawled out upon the floor with its blood trickling out onto the floor around it in thick red streams that seemed never-ending...
