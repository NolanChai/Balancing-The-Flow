30 miles and they will leave Iraq to you. It has been a long time since I wrote my last letter, but I am finally writing again!
 
I hope you're doing well in the United States. I miss my mom and my brother and everyone else too much; I think about them every day. It is hard here because it seems like all people want to do here is fight. There are no good things except for those that come from Allah, and even they are not perfect.
 
I hope you can tell me the name of a town near my mom's house so that I know where she lives, but there aren't any streets in our city; just houses with numbers on them. Write to me soon!
Your son, 
  
Dad,  
 
 I am really happy that you are coming home and it is great news to hear that the Americans might leave Iraq to Allah. There are not too many good things here except for those that come from Allah, but they are still perfect even if they're not good. Write back soon!
Your son,  
 
Dad,  
 
 I want you to know that I really miss my mom and brother and everyone else at home. It has been a long time since I wrote last; I have a lot of homework, but now I can write again because we don't do much these days for Muharram.
 
I am so glad that you will be coming back to America! You must have good news from home and I hope it is true. It would be very nice if the Americans left Iraq; they are not good people, but our country does need help because there's a lot of work to do here.
 
Write soon,  
Your son,  
 
Dad,  
 
 I really miss my mom and brother. We don't go out much for Muharram; it is good that we have the time to study. It would be nice if you can tell me a town near our house so I know where your mom livesâ€”she doesn't live on a street, just by number.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you when you come home! You must have great news from America and it will be nice for us all to see each other again soon. Write back soon.
Your son,
