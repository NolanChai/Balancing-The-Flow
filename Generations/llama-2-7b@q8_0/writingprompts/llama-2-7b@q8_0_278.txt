umping footsteps on concrete, the creak of leather-soled shoes, a loud, angry voice, the slamming of doors. The air outside was cool and wet. He opened his eyes just enough to see that it was evening already; sunset had come and gone.
He had been here before in the darkness of night when there were only shadows, only the sound of insects buzzing through the silence. Then, too, he heard the sounds of men's footsteps and their voices. They had all passed by, they had stopped on his floor, they had been standing just a few feet away. But then he felt the darkness descend again as if a curtain had fallen across his room to seal him off from the world.
It was a relief, at times, not having to hear. He could feel everything around him but he did not have to interpret it into anything more than its basic sound. The air itself was soothing; in it he felt himself calm down, relax, sink deeper inside himself. It was a warm and dark place that seemed safe.
This is how he lived when he was little.
He had been born with ears like everyone else's: they were pointed, just like all his classmates'. But while others heard only sounds, he felt the vibrations of those sounds; this was something they did not have to learn. They could see colors and shapes in their mind, as well. But this too, he had been born with: it was a part of him that went hand-in-hand with his hearing. He never thought of it as an ability or a curse; it was just a way for him to perceive the world around him.
When they were all little, everyone had their own ways of understanding the world and living in it. The little girl could move things with her mind, she could make them stop in midair. The boy on his floor could light small fires by rubbing two sticks together. All of them had some way of interacting with the outside world. They had a natural instinct to do so; they needed to, as much as they needed air and water.
They lived in the forests that surrounded their homes at the foot of the mountains, where everything was wild and untamed. They were all born there and knew every tree and rock by name, every plant, every animal. They didn't need a language to speak to each other; they could just point at something or make a sound and everyone would know what they meant. It was this way that they communicated with the animals around them, too: a whistle and the deer would come out of hiding, and birds would swoop down on their arms when called by name.
His name was Eanrin; he had no memory of ever having been given one but it seemed like something everyone else knew. His mother told him that his father had named him. He was very young when she died—the oldest of the children, with five younger siblings all born within three years after her death.
His name meant little to Eanrin then or later; he did not remember ever having a time where he didn't have it. In his earliest memories there were no other names in his world but his own and those of his family and the others who had been born with them. They spoke their names aloud, though, just as everyone else called out their own: sometimes to ask for something, but mostly just because they felt like doing so.
When he was very young, they didn't need words at all; they made sounds together. Sometimes their cries and yelps were happy, sometimes they were sad or angry. But each person knew when someone else needed help, and if there had been danger, everyone in the group could protect themselves and the children around them with a sound.
It was how he had saved himself so many times during the years before he went off on his own, when he lived near his family. He was never quite sure of why his ears were different; he wasn't sure why they needed him to be as strong as he could be in order for them to survive. But it seemed that he had always been able to protect himself and the children with a sound or a call.
And if there had been danger, everyone knew what to do: they would make an alarming sound and all run off into the forest until the danger was gone. They never needed words for this, nor did anyone ever explain why it worked. It just _did_. Eanrin never thought about it much because it wasn't like a question in his head. There was no confusion about what he should do; there was only the knowledge that if everyone made a sound together, they could be safe again.
He had been very young then when he first realized this was happening. He remembered lying underneath one of their camping trees with some of the others while his mother and father sang him to sleep. In those days it wasn't called singing; it was simply a way to soothe someone, and they would often do it without words. They might hum or make strange little sounds that he didn't understand then but came to love as much as any song later on.
There had been many nights when Eanrin lay in his father's arms, listening to the trees sing their songs around them while the animals made little noises all around. There was always something happening underneath and above them at all times; even now he could feel a rush of air as it passed by him, almost a sound, as if someone was breathing.
He was not an unlucky child. He didn't remember much about his mother but the little bits he did remember were good ones—she had sung to him and read him stories while he nursed at her breast; she had laughed with him on a sunny day in the summer when they watched a squirrel chase another animal away from their tree. She was a warm presence around them both, always gentle and kind to Eanrin even though she was not his true mother—his father's wife had been killed years ago by a beast while he and his family were hunting in the mountains.
He knew these things about her because when she died, they had all held him very close and told him who she was; they had sung to him as well. He did not remember that time at all but later, looking back, he could see that it must have been terrible for them all. They were so sad afterward, although Eanrin had not understood why.
He remembered other things from the time before his mother's death. There was one day when she and everyone else around him had been laughing because of something Eanrin said; he did not remember what it was. He tried to think about it later but couldn't, though he knew it must have been funny because they were all laughing so hard that tears came from their eyes—tears of mirth.
His father had been angry with him for some reason after this, although Eanrin didn't remember what he did wrong either. He knew only that his father was looking at him very sternly as if he wanted to hit him but couldn't quite do it because they were all surrounded by their friends and there would be a fight if anyone tried to touch the children.
This, too, Eanrin had known back then: never raise your hand against another person, unless that person is in immediate danger of killing you or someone else. If you must strike another person for any reason at all, do it with your fist instead—a closed fist will hurt less than an open palm and will cause less damage to the other person.
This was the way things had been when he lived among his family in those days; this was how they survived. Everyone was kind and gentle, except for his father who sometimes hit him or tried to scare him by making a growling sound—the only time Eanrin ever heard his father growl at anyone else other than himself.
The others weren't as strict as his mother; she was the one who taught him not to touch certain things, like fire and knives, unless he absolutely had to. He knew when someone needed help because they would cry out in a particular way—a sound that came from deep inside their bellies like an animal's growl.
But Eanrin did not understand what she meant until later on: it wasn't just animals who grewled, but people as well! His mother had taught him this through her own example and by showing him the way of things with her hands—her touch was soft and gentle even when she was angry or sad. She would take his hand in hers whenever he needed comforting; if someone else needed to be calmed down after an argument, she would come over to them and stroke their back as well until they felt better again.
These things were not taught to him by anyone else; these were the things that his mother did for all of them when they needed her most—the way she treated them, the way she spoke with them, how much she cared for them. He remembered everything about those days: the feeling of her arms around him as she sang him to sleep at night, how he loved it when they were all together because there was no one else like them anywhere in the world.
That's why his mother died. That's what caused people to start leaving and never returning—they couldn't live without their family anymore because they knew that this feeling would never come again once she was gone. It was such a sad time for everyone, although Eanrin did not remember it himself until much
