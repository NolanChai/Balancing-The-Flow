o and had just arrived in Atlanta after having spent two days on the train traveling from Los Angeles. His daughter, Ginny, met him at the door.
"Daddy!" she said, grabbing his hand as he stepped off the elevator. "We've been so worried."
Ardin didn't reply. He pulled her close to his chest and inhaled deeply as if trying to drink her in. She was a tall, thin girl who looked like her mother more than she did him. He felt guilty that he had only seen her every six months over the last two years while he served on various committees throughout Earth's governments. He always promised himself that when his duties were completed and he had the time to spend with his family, it would be the best. But now that was all about to change.
"You ready?" Ardin asked Ginny as they stepped into the kitchen where her mother waited for them.
She looked at him, "Of course."
He nodded to his wife and then led her out of the apartment while Ginny began preparing dinner. It was the last time he would eat on Earth. He wondered if it was worth it to go through all the trouble just to be able to get a steak cooked exactly as they liked it, or if it might have been easier just to give up and move to Atlantis, as his wife suggested.
He shook off such thoughts. Once he reached Mars, things would change. The food on Earth wouldn't matter any more. He was about to be a part of something that could truly make a difference in the lives of billions, not just millions like what he did now.
The thought gave him a little lift as they stepped into the elevator. Ginny pressed her hand against the control panel and ordered it down one floor to their landing pad. Ardin turned toward her mother and asked, "What about your husband?"
"I'll let you two talk," she said with a smile that seemed too bright. "You have some things to work out."
Ardin felt like he was going into battle. The thought scared him more than it did his wife, who had been in politics most of her life. But the decision was made and there would be no going back now.
The elevator doors opened onto a large parking garage beneath their building, which led out to a landing pad where several vehicles were waiting for them. Ardin's ship was one of the last in line, but it looked like they wouldn't have to wait long. The flight attendant standing at the top of the ramp waved him on and then pulled it up toward the rocket while another man helped Ginny into her seat.
As soon as he entered the cockpit, Ardin began flipping switches on the controls. "What's the status?" he asked the pilot who was standing to his side.
"All systems green," he replied. "We're good to go."
Ardin took a deep breath and then said, "Let's get this show on the road." He watched as Ginny settled back into her seat and felt a lump forming in his throat that made him want to choke it down.
"Daddy?" she asked as he turned away from her to check his displays. She had been born on Earth so, for her, this was just another ride up to the stars. But for Ardin and his wife, they were leaving everything behind in order to make their way to a new home that they hoped would bring them much more than what they could ever have expected from Mars.
Ardin looked back at Ginny one last time before he turned toward the pilot once again. "Let's go," he said and then took his seat, pushing down on the control panel as hard as he could.
" _Velum_ ," he ordered and watched as the doors opened to the sound of air rushing out around them. He closed his eyes as they shot off into space and then leaned back in his chair before saying, "That wasn't so bad."
The pilot chuckled at him and said, "You get used to it after a while, sir."
Ardin opened his eyes again and watched as Earth fell out of sight. He could see the blackness of space all around them now with only the bright light from the sun casting an orange glow in front of their ship. The moon was just visible on his display, but there wasn't much else to see as he began checking through their flight plan once again.
He turned toward Ginny and asked, "Ready?"
She nodded. Ardin reached over and grabbed her hand before they both leaned back in their chairs together. Their ship pushed forward on its own without the need for a pilot or navigator anymore since the computer knew exactly where to go. Ardin watched as his daughter turned around, looking at him with a smile on her face.
"I love you, Daddy," she said.
Ardin smiled and then turned back toward the viewport. "I love you too, sweetie."
