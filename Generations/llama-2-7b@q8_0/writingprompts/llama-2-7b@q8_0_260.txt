ette just looked up and grinned, `` Didn 't see that one coming did ya?'' 
 
 Cassidy just shrugged his shoulders as he watched her walk into the room, he shook his head at the sight of her. Her clothes were torn in places, but it was obvious she had been very well taken care of after what ever had happened to her, and Jackie had certainly helped with that. She walked over and leaned down so that they could see her bandaged chest as if to say `` Look at me now! '' 
 
 Francinette couldn 't help but laugh out loud. Cassidy just smiled at the sight of her daughter, a smile he hadn 't used in years. It was one of the things that had hurt him the most when they had separated. The last few times he had seen his daughter she had been crying. He wasn 't sure how this happened exactly but he was pretty sure it didn't have anything to do with her mother leaving, Jackie had never cried in front of him and now the sight of her smiling made him happy in a way that had not been for a long time. 
 
 Jackie looked up at them, she smiled at Cassidy, `` She is your daughter!'' she said proudly as if he needed to be reminded. She turned back to Francinette and held her hand out. `` Come here little girl. Let us take care of you! '' She said sternly, her eyes never leaving the young woman. 
 
 Cassidy had known Jackie for years and even though she was a tough as nails cop with an attitude to match his own he always knew she had a heart of gold. `` Come here! '' He said just as loudly as Jackie, his eyes never leaving Francinette's. 
 
 Francinette hesitated but finally walked over to them and took their hands in her own. She looked from one to the other. Her mother was smiling at her and holding out a hand to her, her father looking just as proud of her as his wife had been. It took a moment for her to understand what she should do next but before it all registered in her mind she walked into Cassidy's arms where he held her tightly against him. She knew they had wanted to know who she was and that meant something. It would take a while but eventually she would tell them. 
 
 They spent the rest of the night talking. Francinette couldn 't believe how much had happened in just the last few hours, not even stopping when Jackie left to go and find Jesse and Cassidy was sure they would all want to get a good nights sleep. As she sat with her parents she listened as they talked about what had happened and that got her thinking again about who she was and how it had all come about. She had been living in fear of being found by people she knew since the day she was rescued from the island. Her head hurt trying to figure everything out but right now there were too many questions for any answers, all she could do was let her mind wander and hope that eventually it would lead somewhere. 
 
 Jackie came in at a little after six, still dressed in her jeans with the gun slung over her shoulder. She sat down next to Francinette and smiled, `` Hey there,'' she said as she gave her daughter's hand a squeeze. Cassidy just shook his head as he looked on, the smile that had been plastered to his face all morning was fading quickly at the sight of Jackie, she was one tough woman but even she couldn 't fight back against this little girl who sat right next to them in a chair with her hands clasped together. She smiled at him and he just shook his head again as if to say `` I can't believe you had me fooled! '' 
 
 Francinette felt herself blush when she looked up at Jackie, this woman was an officer of the law but it seemed to her like a very long time ago that she had been one. She could remember Cassidy as he sat in court and argued her innocence. Her mother had already told them both what had happened but for some reason Francinette felt like she still had to tell them herself. She didn 't know why it was such a big deal but maybe it just didn't feel right telling them through another person, `` I don't want you two to think I did something wrong or that I did anything bad,'' she said as if explaining it all would make it easier on the both of them. 
 
 Cassidy smiled at her, `` We 're not thinking any such thing. You came back for me, that shows me you're a good person and nothing could ever change my opinion of you.'' He was smiling but she saw his eyes well up as he said it. 
 
 Francinette looked away from him at first, `` I have to tell you something. I just want to be sure that both of you are ok with me telling you this before I do...'' She wasn 't quite sure where to begin and she looked down at her hands for a moment as if trying to come up with the right words. 
 
 Jackie looked at her daughter then back at Cassidy, `` Are we?'' she said simply and Francinette couldn't help but smile, `` You don 't have to say it out loud like that! I know you want to hear me tell you this because it must be something bad if it keeps you from saying anything. '' She said as she looked at Cassidy again. 
 
 He just smiled back and shook his head, `` This is our daughter. You can trust us both with the truth. We 're not going to judge you for who you are or how you got here. We'll love you no matter what.'' His eyes were filled with hope as he said this and Francinette couldn 't help but smile back, she was glad that she had finally decided it would be best to tell her parents the truth after all. It had been a long time since either of them had seen their daughter in anything more than a nightmare and now they were holding onto her so tightly it was almost painful at times. 
 
 She looked back up at Jackie who smiled as well, `` You know what? I can see where you get your stubbornness from!'' she said as she put her arm around Cassidy's shoulders and pulled him to her side, `` We promise not to judge her or throw her out of the house if she was to tell us something bad. That goes for either one of us. '' She looked up at her husband with a smile that made Francinette wonder how he ever got away from this woman in the first place. 
 
 `` And I promise you two, I 'm not going anywhere and if I do ever do anything wrong, then I hope you both kick my ass for it!'' She said as she looked into her daughter's eyes before turning to Cassidy. He smiled at her again and Francinette felt like crying again but instead of doing so she leaned over and hugged her mother tightly, `` Thanks mommy... I love you too. '' 
 
 Cassidy smiled as he watched the two women embrace one another before Jackie finally let go and walked back towards the table where her gun lay on top of it. He looked down at his daughter then back up at Jackie again. `` Is there something wrong with me?'' he said jokingly. 
 
 She smiled back at him, `` No. You have always been able to love anyone and that is one thing we are going to need from you right now...'' She left the words hanging as she looked into his eyes and waited for him to answer her question. He just nodded his head and Jackie turned back towards Francinette who was watching them both, `` I guess it 's time I tell my daughter what happened...'' 
 
 Cassidy was sitting on the sofa next to his wife when he heard the sound of someone walking up the stairs. He looked over at her and noticed she had a smile on her face that was more than a little bit strained but she just shook her head at him as if trying not to laugh, `` It 's just Jesse!'' She said before jumping off the couch and heading towards the top of the stairs. He watched her for a moment then got up and followed her as he walked over to the railings and looked down, his eyes immediately went to Francinette who was walking right behind Jackie on her way to their room. 
 
 `` I'll be back!'' Cassidy called out after her before turning to look at his daughter who had stopped for a moment just below them, she smiled up at him then walked over and leaned against the banister with her arms crossed over her chest as they looked down at Francinette. 
 
 `` What 's going on?'' Cassidy asked but he could see that Jackie was trying to stop herself from laughing again, `` Did you do something funny? '' He said as he put his arm around her shoulders and held her close as he watched them talk below him. His daughter looked at him with a serious expression on her face but in her eyes Cassidy could see that she wanted to laugh as well. 
 
 `` You think this is funny?'' Jack
