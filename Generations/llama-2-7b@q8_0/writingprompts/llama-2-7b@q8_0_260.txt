Eyes glued to her smartphone screen, she watched as another notification popped up. It was a new message from him.
"I'm on my way," it said. "I'll be there soon."
She felt the slight tremor of fear that always accompanied his presence, but still she could not pull herself away from the phone, nor even to look up at the screen above her head and see where he was in relation to her own location.
"You've never been here before," he said as he stepped into view on a monitor. "How long can you stay?"
She looked over at him as he sat on one of the couches, his eyes still on the screen. It had been years since they met in person and she knew better than to ask where he'd been since their last encounter, but she felt like it was her duty to know.
"I don't know," she said as she looked back at the phone. "Tonight maybe."
"Fine," he replied without looking up.
She was surprised by his lack of enthusiasm; usually when they saw each other, it was with great joy on both sides. But that had been years ago now and things had changed since then.
"I've missed you too," she said as she stared at him from the corner of her eye. "When are you coming back to see me again?"
He didn't answer right away, but when he did finally respond it was with an explanation for why they couldn't be together anymore; how things had changed since then and how this time would never be like before—their relationship ended long ago with his leaving her behind in an unfamiliar place that she still struggled to find.
"You'll always have me," he said, "but I can't be there all the time anymore."
She looked at him and nodded. She knew this was true; it had been a while since they'd seen each other in person after what had happened with their relationship years ago when he left without warning her about his plans for leaving town permanently—though she didn't know if that was really what caused things to end between them or not either way she knew there would never be another chance like this one where they could sit across from each other and talk as they had so many times before.
As he finished speaking, he looked over at her with an expression of sadness on his face—she'd seen it plenty of times before when things weren't going well between them but never felt anything more than pity for him because even though their relationship was officially over years ago they still had feelings for each other.
"Goodbye," he said softly as if trying to avoid saying the words out loud just yet—their conversation hadn't gotten this far before tonight, so maybe there was still hope that someday soon something could change between them again but then again nothing ever does after things like this happen between two people who used to care about each other.
The next morning she woke up early feeling a little bit sadder than usual; they'd spent hours together talking, reminiscing and catching up on old times before he left her alone in her room where they hadn't seen each other since their last encounter years ago which made sense considering how different things were now compared to when they used to spend time with one another on a regular basis.
As she got dressed for work she found herself thinking about what would happen next; whether or not he would contact her again soon after this latest interaction—she hoped so but knew deep down inside that chances weren't very good considering how things had ended between them years ago when they went separate ways without ever seeing each other in person again since then either which made sense too given what happened before.
Still, she tried not to let any of these thoughts get her down as much because no matter how hard she tried she couldn't help feeling sad whenever he was around even though things hadn't been the same between them for quite some time now.
She finally arrived at work and started preparing for another long day ahead; there were always new challenges to face every single week which kept life interesting enough without worrying about what might happen next between her and him again after such an emotional night spent together talking like old friends again after all these years apart from one another.
She looked up at the screen above her desk where she could see his latest message on her phone waiting patiently for her response: "I'm so sorry; please forgive me?"
The words seemed to echo through her head as if they were being said right next to her ear, but before long it became clear that he wasn't actually speaking directly towards her at all—instead, these were simply thoughts coming from inside of his own mind where there was still hope for him despite everything else happening in their lives since they last saw each other.
She took a deep breath and smiled; perhaps this time things would finally be different between them after all because if nothing else had changed then surely the way he felt towards her must have too—how could it not when she'd just spent hours with him talking about everything underneath the sun?
