d me for long enough for it to discolour the skin, and it was painful too. My mother would never have let me walk around with that condition if I hadn’t been eight years old. But there was no time now; I had to keep going. And so I did, running from my house in the middle of the night and into the forest surrounding our village.
My father and brothers had told stories of the elves who lived in the forests, but I never thought I would meet one. I thought they were only myths. They weren’t real; that was what my parents always said when I asked about them. But there she was, standing at the edge of the clearing, looking like an angel with her pure white skin and golden hair. She seemed to be in a trance, humming softly as though nothing could disturb her.
I had never seen anything like it before: this beautiful creature dancing alone underneath a full moon. She was so perfect, I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. As I watched in amazement, she began to float up into the air and then disappeared completely from sight. It seemed that she had been made of light all along!
I ran home as fast as my legs would carry me, but when I reached the doorway to our house it was locked tight with no sign of life inside. The neighbours’ houses were dark too; everyone had gone to bed early tonight and there wasn’t anyone else awake on this street at all except for me – unless you count those scary creatures living in my backyard who might come out at any moment now that I had alerted them with my sudden arrival.
What could have happened? Was it really just an illusion after all or did something actually happen to the girl? And if so, what kind of creature was she? What exactly WERE elves anyway and why were they hiding from people who lived in this forest? It would be nice to know how to protect yourself against them because I’m sure they exist and live around here somewhere…
