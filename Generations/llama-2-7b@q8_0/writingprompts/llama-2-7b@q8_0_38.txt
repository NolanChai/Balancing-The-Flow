. But, like the first time I'd seen him, I couldn't turn away and I watched as he crossed the street in front of me. It had been almost a year since we'd last spoken and my heart was pounding again. What the hell? I told myself. Just breathe. It would be alright.

 "You don't know how much it means to me that you're here, Nina."

 "I can't believe I found you. It was the most amazing thing when you showed up at my door," he continued. "I never thought I'd see you again after that night. God, it felt like forever."

 He leaned in and kissed me on the cheek before grabbing both of my hands and pulling me close to him so he could whisper against my ear. "I was going crazy when I couldn't find you online," he said. "It wasn't until I heard about the accident that I realized what had happened." He released me from his grasp and walked toward the couch, sitting down. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 My heart was racing again. The fear of being hurt was back in full force as I sat down across from him and watched his every move. "You know," I said nervously. "I tried to contact you too." 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 He looked at me like he hadn't expected that, then he smiled before responding. "But why wouldn't I have received your message? What did it say?" 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 My face flushed with embarrassment as I sat down in the chair across from him and told him what had happened that night on Facebook, how he had blocked my messages and how I couldn't get a response out of him. "I was so desperate to talk to you after finding out about the accident," I finished. "But then when I got an answer back it was from your mother. She told me not to contact you anymore."

 I thought he would get angry, but instead, he laughed and shook his head. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 "I'm so sorry," he said. He looked at me with sad eyes. "That is not how we were supposed to part." His voice was low and serious and I couldn't look away from him. The last time I had seen him, it hadn't been this way between us. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 He leaned in toward me again and kissed my lips softly before pulling back to look into my eyes. "I missed you so much," he said. "You don't know how it felt not knowing if you were alive or dead." 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 I couldn't hold it in anymore and I let the tears fall down my cheeks, streaming past my lips as they connected with his. He leaned closer to me again so he was right up against me and then he lifted a hand up to my hair before cupping the back of my head in his hands. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 "I'm sorry," I whispered as I ran my hands through his hair. It was softer than it had been all those years ago and it sent a shiver down my spine. My heart was pounding wildly as I thought back to that first time we met, how he looked at me with such intensity. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 "I've missed you so much," I said again before pulling away from him and kissing his lips, savoring the taste of him on my tongue. The feeling was like an electric current through my entire body as he held me tightly against him. His hand reached down to cup my ass as his other hand went into my hair again, holding me close to him while our tongues tangled together. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 I knew right away that he was going to take me upstairs, and even if it meant I would get caught by my parents for having a guy in my room at night, the risk was worth it. This was what I had been dreaming about since we'd parted ways almost a year ago, and now that I finally had him here with me, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that he would do anything to keep me safe.

 As his lips trailed down my neck and up the side of it, my breathing picked up speed as I felt myself start to get wet. I bit into his lower lip a little harder than necessary before he pulled away from me just enough for us both to catch our breaths again. "You have no idea how hard this is for me," I said after looking at him with an intense stare that had never left my eyes since we'd last seen each other. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 He just smiled before running a hand up and down my arm. "It would have been easy for me to keep my distance from you after finding out about the accident," he said. "But when I saw your picture, I knew it was you." His eyes were full of life as they searched my face and body hungrily. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 The look in his eyes made me want him even more than before. He was everything that I needed right then, but I had to be strong for both of us because there wasn't a doubt in my mind how badly this situation could turn out if we weren't careful. "I want you," he said with a growl as he brought his face down so it was only an inch or two from mine and whispered into my ear, "but I need to make sure that nothing has changed." 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 His lips were soft against my neck, but they still stung slightly as I felt them leave the skin again. The way he looked at me was enough for me to know what would happen next and just like before, it didn't take him long to find out exactly what kind of woman I was now. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 He gently pushed my shirt up over the top of my breasts as his mouth trailed along the side of them, sucking on my skin hard enough so that it was visible underneath where he had bitten me. I pulled him closer to me and he didn't have a choice but to go with it because this was what he wanted too, even if it meant taking me from behind in the bedroom instead of making love to me on top or inside like we used to do before everything changed. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 When I felt him pull my shirt completely up and over my head so he could get a better look at what had been hidden from him for the past year, it was all I could do not to moan out loud as he looked me straight in the eyes. It took everything in my power not to make any sort of noise when his mouth found mine again while our tongues intertwined together slowly and gently until they became one unit that only knew how much it needed each other right then and there on that couch.

 It was almost like he was trying to make up for lost time when his hands ran down my sides before moving underneath them so they could go lower until they reached the waistband of my pants, which were still on me but only because I hadn't taken them off yet. He lifted each leg in turn before pulling them down to my ankles and then he stepped back from me just far enough that his eyes never left mine as he looked at what lay before him--my body completely exposed for the first time in over a year.

 "You are so fucking beautiful," he said before taking off all of his clothes too and throwing them somewhere into another room that I couldn't see from where we were standing at that moment because it would have taken away from what needed to happen between us right then. His cock was already half-hard when he stepped back in front of me again, letting me take my first look at him since we had last seen each other and the feeling made me gasp loudly before I could stop myself as my hands went down to touch it for the first time too--only this time, there wasn't any hesitation because now that he was standing in front of me again, all thoughts of anything but him were gone from my mind.

 "I need you," I said as I started to take off his jeans so they would be out of the way when it was finally time for us to make love on this c
