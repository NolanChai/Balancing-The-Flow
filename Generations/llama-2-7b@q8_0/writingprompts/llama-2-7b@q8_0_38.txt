anescently close increments, and even knew the exact location of every single particle on Earth. He was so precise that when he wanted to know where something was, all he needed was a small piece of it, like a hair, or a fingernail. It would have been impossible for Sebastian to find the thing without some way to locate it first, and he had found his own means: using a time machine he'd created.
The only trouble with this technology was that it took far too long to create each device, as well as an immense amount of energy. As such, Sebastian could only travel forwards in time by one second at a time; backwards, however, he could go any speed he liked. This meant he couldn't use the time machine to make instant decisions and correct mistakes before they happened, but that wasn't important right now because Sebastian didn't have a mistake to fix: his present situation was perfect.
The first problem Sebastian faced in this particular situation was that he had no idea why he was here. The second problem was that he couldn't even get out of this spot without having to go back in time, which was impossible. He had tried going into the future but found himself in a different place and time, with a new set of problems.
`` I hate it when my plans turn out to be wrong...'' Sebastian said bitterly. `` No wonder God is so angry at me.''
