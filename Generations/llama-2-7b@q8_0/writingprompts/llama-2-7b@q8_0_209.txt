ep...it's just me.
But it could have been real...because there was something at the front of my house and I thought it was a knock on the door. I sat up quickly out of bed to check but then I realized that it wasn't really the sound of someone trying to get into the house, it was more like...a sound from the house. It could have been anything! Like an old wooden board settling, or a floorboard creaking, something like that.
So anyway...it could have been real but I'm thinking there's nothing out in front of my house at night so it was probably just another one of those "strange" sounds we hear in the middle of the night. Maybe you heard something last night too!
