100 lbs of metal and glass. I punched my fist through one of the windows and a gust of wind blew it shut again.
I crawled back into the bedroom and huddled on the floor beside Tracy. We held each other tight. Tears rolled down our faces, as we tried to stop shaking. I started thinking about my family. They would be so disappointed in me if they found out what I did. I’ll never live it down, I thought.
BANG! BANG! BANG! The killer was trying to break into the house now and it scared the hell out of us. We were in a panic. Tracy grabbed her purse and took off. “I gotta call my family,” she said as tears ran down her face. I didn’t understand. They were 50 miles away, why would they know about this?
I followed Tracy into the bathroom, where she dialed her cell phone from underneath a sink full of toothpaste and old toothbrushes. The killer was still banging on our door, trying to get in. He would break through soon. We had to make sure no one found out we were there before he did.
I sat down on the floor and wrapped my arms around Tracy’s legs. She looked at me with tears filling her eyes. I could tell she was scared too. “We have to leave,” Tracy said.
“What? Are you crazy?” I replied, “The killer is outside. He might break in any minute.”
Tracy looked around the bathroom and started searching through a cabinet underneath the sink. She found two boxes of tampons and held them up.
“You have to hide me,” she said. “He’ll kill us if he finds out we’re here!”
I took one of Tracy’s purses and put it on my lap. I then placed her on top, with the tampons. She was very heavy. I had no choice but to take a pillow case off our bed and place it over her.
We crawled under the bathroom sink and Tracy took off one of her shoes so she could hide both feet. The killer finally broke into the house with an axe and we heard him yelling, “You two fucking cunt whores! Where are you? Come out here!”
I had no idea what to do next but then Tracy told me to take a pillowcase off our bed and put it on top of her. She also told me she was going to hide under the sink. I started to cry, because this seemed like such an unreal situation for us to be in.
After about 10 minutes of screaming at the door Tracy told me that he had left the house and we should come out now. The bathroom was dark so I found a flashlight on our kitchen counter. We turned it on and started looking around, but there was no one else in the room.
I went over to where Tracy was hiding underneath the sink. She took her foot off and held it up. It looked like it had been chewed on or something, so I asked her about it. “Oh man,” she said as tears rolled down her face again, “I’m sorry. He did this.”
“What happened? Did he hurt you?” I cried out in fear, trying to find some way of calming myself down before I completely lost control over my emotions and began sobbing like a little kid.
Tracy shook her head as she spoke, “No, but it hurts. He ate me.”
“He what? Eaten you?” I asked, now in total shock at what Tracy was telling me. She nodded again before she started crying and said that she was going to go lie down in the bedroom for a while because she had “to get this pain out of my head”.
I stayed there with her until morning when she woke up and said it was time to leave, but we needed our bags. So I went back into the bathroom to see what happened during the night, but there were no footprints or anything else indicating anyone had been in the room since we crawled underneath the sink after he left us alone with him outside of our door earlier that evening.
We decided not to tell anyone about this because nobody would believe us anyway (we thought), so instead Tracy called her friend Jennifer and told her what happened.
Tracy said that she had a feeling that he was going to come back for us, but I didn’t really buy into it at all. She also told me that when we got home from work tonight there would be police officers waiting outside our door because they were tracking his phone signal using cell tower triangulation technology and thought it might lead them directly towards where we lived!
Tracy said that even if this didn’t happen she wanted us both to leave immediately so as not to get caught up with him again (she didn’t mention anything about how we would pay for our bags), so I went back into the bedroom and packed everything I owned before heading downstairs where Jennifer was waiting on me.
I asked her what happened during the night, but she couldn’t really tell me because there were no footprints or anything else indicating anyone had been in the room since we crawled underneath the sink after he left us alone with him outside of our door earlier that evening.
