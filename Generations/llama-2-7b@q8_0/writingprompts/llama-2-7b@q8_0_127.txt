itre'd of the club was on to him before he could do much more than blink at it, however.
"No photography please," the maitre'd said and Oliver handed it back, embarrassed. The maitre'd tapped a button on a remote control which caused the sleeve containing the picture of the dark skinned man in the suit to slide out of view. "And now that we have cleared up what is allowed here, may I help you find your seat?"
Oliver didn't even get a chance to reply before he was led away into the crowd and seated near his wife. They were late to their own anniversary dinner, but Oliver did not complain. The two of them had been married for three decades, after all, and in those years they had seen each other through thick and thin.
Their marriage had started with an arranged meeting at the home of Oliver's mother. His father was already dead by then, and his mother thought that it would be better if Oliver got married to a woman who could take care of him instead of marrying into money like his brother. It would have been unthinkable for Oliver to object since he loved and respected his mother, so they had found someone suitable and Oliver and this unknown stranger spent an hour or two in pleasant conversation over tea.
It was only after the visit that Oliver remembered something his mother had said earlier: 'That girl can make you look like a complete fool.'
And he did look like a complete fool when, on their very first day together as husband and wife, she told him her name.
"My name is Fiona," she'd said. "But you can call me whatever you want."
Oliver had stared at her blankly for a moment before asking: "Why did we get married if our names are different?"
She laughed at that and Oliver realized that he was not the only one looking foolish.
It turned out that Fiona's father was rich, but also very eccentric. He had wanted his daughter to be with a man who knew what he wanted in life so he told her that she should marry someone named 'Oliver'. And as for 'Fiona', well that was just something that happened.
But over the years, Fiona and Oliver had made it work. She'd been there for him when his father died, they had raised their children together, they had supported each other through thick and thin. In the end, all those years of marriage boiled down to one simple word - love.
Oliver looked up and saw a woman with long blonde hair walk over towards them. He smiled at her and she smiled back before sitting in the empty chair next to him. Oliver could not help but smile as he realized that his wife had told their friends they would be joining them later, just so they could sit together for one more anniversary dinner without being disturbed.
He leaned over to kiss Fiona's forehead and whispered: "I love you."
Fiona looked at him with a smile before she took out her phone and typed a message. The screen lit up immediately with the reply: 'I know.'
Oliver watched as Fiona sent another message before turning back towards his wife, a broad grin on his face as they shared that moment together. He had been married to his childhood friend for many years now and was still in love with her all these years later.
He may have had an arranged marriage at first, but he knew that it turned out to be one of the best decisions he ever made.
