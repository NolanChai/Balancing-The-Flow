elps you. `` My eyes were closed! ''

 The other children laugh. Their teacher cries: `` Stop it right now! ''

 When you are eight, you ask your mother why she is not a doctor. You are lying in bed and can hear her on the kitchen phone, talking about the things that make men and women different. You are too young for these words. 

 `` What's wrong with me?'' you yell into her ear. She pulls away.

 Your mother says she does not know what to tell you. 

 When you are twelve, you read a book about sex. Your friends tease you about it until the next day when they learn that your mother has bought the same book for each of them. You are pleased at first until you see how easy their questions make her blush. She never speaks of these things again. 

 When you are twenty-five, a woman you work with comes to tell you what you need to know about sex. She says she wishes that she had been taught by someone like you. You look away and do not know what to say. 

 When your mother is forty-seven, she tells you that there was another girl in the family who could never speak. She died a year before your father did. 

 When your mother is sixty-eight, she shows you two boxes of old photographs and tells you how lucky you are to have been born into this family. The first picture you look at is of you as an infant. You cannot remember being a baby but see yourself with eyes wide open, staring at the camera without seeing it, your hands clenched in fists around a pillow.
