Laurie and Charles
# The End
Charles was never able to remember how he got from Sarasam, to his room. When Laurie left, she told him he would be asleep for days. After she closed the door behind her, Charles sat up on the edge of the bed and looked around the room. His eyes scanned the white walls until they rested on a dark wooden mirror.
Charles stood from the bed and approached the mirror. He held out his right arm toward the reflection, which was now just black and white. The reflection of his arm looked like it was made of glass, shattering in slow motion as he approached it. Charles's hand began to tremble as he realized that the shaking in his reflection was coming from his own hands. He quickly pulled them back into a fist and tried to control himself.
Charles stepped backwards, but couldn't help himself from looking again at his reflection. This time he looked more closely at the eyes, the mouth, the nose. All the features were still there but now they were frozen in place like carved stone. Charles felt himself falling over backward and hit the bed face first. He curled into a fetal position and held his hands tightly around his head. 
 
 `` I can't take it!'' he cried out, feeling helpless against something so powerful and mysterious. ``I won't be able to do anything! I will lose everything!`` Charles shouted to no one in particular as he curled into a ball on the bed and started to cry.
