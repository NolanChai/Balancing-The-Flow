aked bodies of men were strewn on the ground in various stages of decay and disfigurement, their skin pale and translucent as if they had died under water.
In a daze, Jack stumbled his way to the nearest corridor, his arms wrapped around his chest to try and block out the smell of death that assailed him at every step he took. The floor was carpeted with decaying organs, all glistening like wax in the dim light, and from every corner he heard strange noises.
There were whispers and voices, but there was never anyone to be seen when they spoke. When Jack looked up towards the ceiling it appeared that someone had tried to write something on the wall, a name perhaps, or even a few words of warning, but whatever had been written was completely illegible due to the decaying paint.
He wandered through this place for days, barely eating and never sleeping, trying not to look at anything that might frighten him. The noises still continued as well, like a million tiny claws scratching the walls of his mind, and every night he would lie down on some nearby floor or bed, but he could never sleep.
There were only two things he was certain about; firstly he was alone in this place, and secondly there was something that did not want him here. He had no idea why it did not like him being there or even where the thing was coming from, and every time he thought of going back home to his family and friends a new wave of fear overcame him so strong that he would turn on his heel and run through the corridors as quickly as possible.
After what seemed like months but might well have been years Jack found himself in a familiar room, a door standing open with an inviting light spilling out from inside onto the floor. His heart was filled with such joy that he felt that it would burst at any moment and he could hardly believe that it had finally come to this after so many years of searching.
He stepped inside and saw a small table covered in books, all of them written in languages unknown to him. He began to read the first title but found himself unable to understand a word of the text, his mind telling him that he should not read any further for fear of what might happen if he did so.
“Perhaps there is something more useful to be gained by reading the pages inside?” A voice asked from behind him. “Come here and you shall know all.”
Jack turned around but saw no one in the room. He began to walk towards the door and was suddenly stopped by a hand placed against his chest, pushing him back until he stood against the wall.
“You have come this far,” The voice spoke again. “You must not return now, for you would be lost forever.”
Jack had no answer but remained where he was, trembling in fear of what might happen next.
“Please, Jack…” His father’s voice came from behind him and the sound of a man crying filled his ears.
The hand against his chest vanished into thin air and Jack felt his strength come back to him. He ran through the room as fast as he could, past books that had been left out on desks or piled up on shelves until finally he reached the door at the far end of the corridor and dashed outside, stumbling over the floor in his hurry to escape this place.
Jack stood there for a while, shaking with fear as memories of what had happened before flooded back into his mind like a waterfall bursting its banks. He knew he would never return to that room again, and although the things that had occurred there had given him many years of happiness they had also taken away some of his sanity in the process.
After that day Jack stopped going out as much and eventually grew to enjoy the quiet company of his books once more, which was all he needed anyway since most of them were written in a language unknown to him.
