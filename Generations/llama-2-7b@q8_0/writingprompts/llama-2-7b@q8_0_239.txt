ubbles and sludge. The shaft was sturdy and thick but not wide enough for a man to grip it comfortably; the weight would pull down on his wrists when he pulled back to throw. It had seen battle more than once, judging by the cracks that ran along its length.
"Not my sort," he murmured, pushing it away with his palm as if it were something disgusting.
He continued past, heading for a quieter place where he could think and work without distraction or interruption—where he would not be interrupted. 
 The corpse lay in the bottom of an old well, its back bent and blood-stained where the spear had punctured it through the spine. One arm was drawn up across his chest, as if for protection, but the other one stretched outward—its fingers still clutching a dagger.
The corpse's head was tilted back and its eyes were closed, and that was how he knew that it was dead. He had been a good hunter once; he recognized such things easily.
But he was not going to touch the body. 
 He would have thought they would be easier to find in such a place, but his first search of the area around the well turned up nothing—no bodies, no weapons, no discarded clothing or possessions. They must have been picked clean long ago. Or perhaps the scavengers had been spooked by his appearance; it was an uncomfortable thought to entertain that they might know he'd come looking for a body.
He made a quick search of the well itself, but all he found there were stairs and a rope leading down into deeper darkness. He would have to return with light if he wanted to find out what waited below. 
His eyes moved on across the forest floor and he spotted another body lying in the shade—a man this time. He knelt beside it, studying the face for recognition. The man was tall and thin and dressed only in a torn tunic that hung loosely around his hips. His long hair had been shorn close to his skull but it hadn't completely covered up all the scars—the marks of torture and hardship—that covered his face and arms. The man was barefoot, too, as if he hadn't had time to grab a pair of boots before dying.
"I know who you are," the dead man whispered. His voice was like gravel scraping across bone. "You should not be here."
The words were a surprise—so many people came back from the dead that he'd learned to ignore them, to concentrate on what they said and try to find meaning in it—but the words themselves were unimportant. He wasn't listening for their message; he was listening because the voice had called out to him. 
He pushed himself up onto his knees and looked into the dead man's face again. The eyes stared back at him, dark and empty. "You should not be here," the dead man whispered once more.
"Why?" He kept his voice quiet. He didn't want to draw attention from anything else that might be lurking about in the trees—creatures like the scavengers, or worse. The dead man had been a hunter too and he knew there were things that would take advantage of an easy meal, especially if it was something as tasty-looking as this corpse.
The dead man shook his head, his mouth opening slightly in dismay. "I do not have the time," he murmured.
"Time for what?" It wasn't a fair question to ask but he couldn't stop himself from asking it—the dead man was his first real contact with other people since they'd died and he wanted to know everything about them that he could before they were gone again. He hadn't even been able to name the dead man in his mind, so he might as well find out what kind of life the hunter had lived while he still had a chance.
But the corpse didn't answer him—it just stared at him with those empty eyes and its mouth hung open like it was too surprised for words. He wasn't sure why that bothered him so much, but it did. 
He stood up and brushed himself off, not wanting to be there any longer. "If you have something important to say, speak," he told the dead man. "But if I'm here when I shouldn't, then what difference does it make?" He started walking away. "I'll find another place—a quieter one."
The corpse stayed where it was; its face watched him as he walked into the forest and out of sight.

He had known his father would die young, even if only because he had been born early in a time when most men lived to be middle-aged at best—a time when they fought hard for every year. But it still came as a shock when it happened so soon and left him without any direction or guidance on how to live his own life.
He was only twelve years old, too young to have been expected to take over the family farm after his father died. He didn't know enough about farming—or anything else—to be able to run a property as large and productive as theirs was supposed to be. And he certainly wasn't ready to run off on his own into the world, like his father had done when he left home in pursuit of adventure and glory.
The only thing that he knew for certain was that he didn't want to live the life that his mother would have tried to force upon him. He wanted nothing more than to find some way out—a way of escaping the drudgery and routine of working a piece-meal farm, with no chance of ever rising above it or doing anything else in life.
And he knew there had to be something better for him to do with his days; he just didn't know what it was yet. All he knew was that if he waited for someone—or something—to tell him what he was supposed to do, he might never find out.
So he went looking for answers. 
He walked away from the farm and headed eastward across country in search of a better life. He wasn't sure where it would be found but if he didn't start somewhere then he'd never know what was possible for him to do or be.
He could tell by the way his mother looked at him that she had been disappointed—but also relieved and grateful as well, for no one would have to take on the burden of farming their land now—and it was obvious that many other people felt the same way about it. She'd cried a little, but he knew she'd done so more out of relief at having been spared the responsibility of running her son's life than anything else; and he wouldn't have wanted to see her unhappy even if there was nothing he could do about what had happened or would happen.
So he had left home with only his sword as his companion—and not much more in terms of possessions, but that was fine by him; he wasn't going anywhere special and he didn't want to be burdened with a lot of unnecessary weight while he tried to find out where he belonged.
It hadn't taken long for him to discover that the answer lay in the forest—in the creatures that lived there, and in the stories they told. 
He was drawn to the forest by curiosity as much as anything else: it had been a place of myths and legends from the time he first started learning about his world, and many of those tales involved strange creatures and magic beings. But until now none of them had ever seemed quite real—not in any true sense—and most of them were told in a way that made it clear that they weren't supposed to be believed; there was always some sort of moral or lesson at the end of each one, telling kids like him what kind of behaviour they should avoid.
He didn't want a lecture about how he had to behave himself; he wanted an adventure and something new in his life, which meant that if he ever hoped to find it then he would have to go out into the world on his own. So he made his way deep into the forest with no plan or direction except where it took him—and when he found himself near a lake at last he decided to camp down there for the night rather than go any further, because it was safe and quiet enough that he knew no one would be able to find him if they were looking.
It wasn't long before he realized how wrong he had been about his decision though; because once darkness fell upon the forest it became a very different place indeed—and not just in terms of the light or the sounds either: creatures began emerging from their lairs and sliding through the trees as if they were made out of shadow itself. He heard snarls and growls, and the sound of fur brushing against bark; he saw eyes glinting in the moonlight like jewels set among leaves—and each time it happened he was terrified enough that all he could do was stand there frozen, watching while something unseen but unmistakably hostile moved through the night.
He kept his sword ready—he wasn't going to let himself get caught off guard again; this time would be different
