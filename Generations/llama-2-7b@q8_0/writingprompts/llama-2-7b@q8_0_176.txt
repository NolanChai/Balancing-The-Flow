 world and still haven't gotten any answers.
I don't know what it's like to be able to hear, but I know what it feels like to wake up every morning without hearing anything around me. That's the reason why I was so thrilled when I discovered Cochlear Ltd.'s new Nucleus Freedom 2 implant system. It lets deaf people regain some of their lost hearing -- a prospect that seemed impossible for me until now.
Cochlear, which has been making cochlear implants since the mid-1980s, recently announced an updated model of its device. The original Nucleus Freedom system was the first "bionic ear" approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people with severe to profound hearing loss. Now Cochlear has added a new miniature receiver that can be surgically implanted underneath the skin, eliminating the need to wear an external device behind your head like many other bionic ear models.
The original Nucleus Freedom was about as big as my cellphone when I had it on top of my head (and still could only hear a little bit). Now with the miniature receiver implanted, you can't even tell that someone has an implant at all unless you look closely for some kind of microchip.
For me and many other deaf people, this is not just another high-tech gadget but a godsend -- finally something we've been waiting for to make up for the loss of hearing.
