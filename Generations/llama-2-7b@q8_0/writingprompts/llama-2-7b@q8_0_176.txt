 had been some time since I had used my full strength and, though it was exhausting work, the end result was a satisfyingly clean cut through the earth. The chisel's head punched into the rock, leaving behind its mark. I knew that if anyone were to look at this stone in a hundred years or so they would see 'R' carved into it with absolute precision.
I had always been very good at what I did, but as of late my skills seemed to be increasing at an exponential rate. There was no denying the fact that I was growing stronger. This was not the result of hard work however; I simply had a natural advantage over those around me.
I could do it all better than anyone else. 
 
 I was a prodigy, but there were times when I felt my skill was nothing special in comparison to my peers and that was what made me question myself the most. No matter how powerful I became, Serpent Mogar had no qualms about telling me I could do better and it always left me feeling slightly guilty.
I looked up at him as I finished the cut through his eyes I saw a mix of admiration and pride, but also a little annoyance. I was not sure if my skill was truly that exceptional or if he wanted to see me fail simply because of my heritage. 
 
"Thank you for your help."
"It was nothing, boy! You're just beginning to learn the true value of hard work, and this is only a small fraction of what lies ahead of you. I would give anything if you could have spent more time under my wing!"
I wanted to tell him that he did not have to go through all this trouble for me and I should be thankful enough just being able to make it here, but I could not find the words. 
 
"As you can see, you've made an excellent start so far." I nodded as my master spoke, "I won't waste any more time and simply tell you what we're going to be doing today." He pulled a sheet of parchment from his belt pouch. The writing on it looked like gibberish to me at first, but after studying it for a bit I noticed it was a map of the city. "This is your destination; the center of the capital."
I read out its name and memorized the location,  'Northwest, near the bridge.' 
 
"Here's where we're going to begin today. We need to move about three hundred feet into the north side of the map. We have an hour until sunset so you should be able to get it done before then." He gestured back and forth across the map, "I want you to dig a small hole there just next to that pillar on this street. You need to make sure no one sees what you're doing. It can't be too obvious or else we'll have problems later down the line. There is also a shop in this area selling materials for building; I want you to buy them here instead of trying to get them yourself."
I nodded as he talked and began planning out how best to do what he told me to. 
 
 "We need to dig it about twenty feet deep," He looked at his wrist as if checking a time, "so there's not much room for error here."
"I understand sir," I said calmly. It did not take long for me to figure out what the best way of doing this would be. 
 
 I would simply cut straight down until it hit bedrock and then make an arching cut that pointed in the direction he wanted the hole to go. The plan seemed sound enough, but he still had some qualms about my plan. "You can do better than that." He said confidently.
I raised an eyebrow at him as I prepared for battle. 
 
 "You've gotten pretty good since the last time you did this; keep it up and you won't have a problem getting into any school."
"Thank you sir," I said politely. As he continued to speak, my mind began thinking about what he had just told me. 
 
 I knew that if anyone else were to say these things they would be laughed at or shamed for it. Yet here was a man who could give me nothing but praise and encouragement. It was strange and uncomfortable at first, but I began to notice the difference in my attitude towards his words. 
 
 He continued to talk as we walked down the street. 
 "What we're going to do today is teach you how to dig a hole that goes through several layers of soil and rock in order for us to get access to something underneath." I could not help but let out a little chuckle at his enthusiasm. He was quite amusing with the way he went about doing everything, and I almost felt bad for laughing; after all, I had only come here because of him. 
 
 "I know you think it's funny, but this is what will be required of you to get into any school in this world," He said sternly, "The moment someone sees us working together and tries to stop us they are dead. There won't be a second chance. If the work we do gets noticed then we will need to do everything possible to cover it up before anyone else is involved."
I nodded in agreement. I knew that this was important and I would not fail him or myself by not doing my best at everything he asked me to do, no matter how simple it might seem. 
 
 "We're almost there," He said as we stopped in front of a large wooden door. There was a sign on the outside which read 'The Wilderness Shop,' but when we opened it I realized why he wanted to buy here instead of getting them himself. 
 
 Inside were dozens upon dozens of items used for all sorts of building and repair work. The place seemed like an adventurer's dream; there were tools, food supplies, armor, weapons, books, clothing, jewelry... I could not believe the amount of stuff they had on display. 
 
 "What do you want to buy today?" He said as he looked over at me with his usual smile. I knew he was just teasing and did not expect anything specific from me, but I also felt a little embarrassed that I didn't know exactly what it is that I wanted to buy or what would be best for the job we were about to do together later on today. 
 
 "I can't say for sure." I replied as politely as possible while trying not to sound like an idiot. I looked around at all of this stuff and tried hard to think of anything that would be useful in my task but could only come up with a few ideas; none of them were very good however so I figured it might be best just to leave it there until we got home later on tonight or tomorrow morning when he told me what else needed doing next week before school started back up again. 
 
 "That's fine," He said, "We don't need anything right now anyway; you can pick up whatever you like and come back for more at another time." 
 
 I was relieved that he did not seem annoyed by my lack of knowledge on what was best for our task. I also felt a little embarrassed by how much it seemed to bother him, but then again maybe I should have known better than to think otherwise; he has been doing this type of work long before me so I doubted any mistakes made would be taken too lightly by someone like Serpent Mogar. 
 
 "Don't worry about it," He said as we walked towards the door, "You can come back whenever you need to get anything else done." With that he turned and walked away without looking back at me once before disappearing into the street behind us. I stood there for a moment thinking about what had just happened before walking over towards where our next task would begin... 
 
 I knew this was going to be my first real test as an apprentice under Serpent Mogar's tutelage, and despite how much experience he has with all sorts of jobs like this one it still felt like something new for both me and him.
