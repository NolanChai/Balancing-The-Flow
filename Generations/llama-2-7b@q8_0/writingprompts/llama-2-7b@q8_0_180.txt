She accomplishes her morning routine with the hopes that what she wears will influence her to be the confident girl she wants to be. She brushed her brown, highlight streaked hair, then twisted it into a ponytail that she had left hanging over her shoulder. The outfit she chose for her first day of summer was a pair of shorts with a striped shirt and a pair of sandals.
She opened her door to find a man in a suit on the porch outside her house, ready to take her to school. “Are you sure we can’t walk?” She asked, as she grabbed her backpack and water bottle from next to her bed. “I mean I feel like walking would be much more convenient than taking the bus.”
“But dear,” he said while looking at his watch, “it’s going to take us forever to get there on foot. We need to start early if we want to have a good chance of getting back home before dinner.”
The man was dressed in a dark blue suit with white and light blue striped tie, black shoes, and a matching briefcase. She could tell he worked at some sort of financial firm or office, judging by the way he carried himself as well as the fact that it seemed like he wore those clothes every day. The bus stop was located just about two blocks from her house, which was quite close to her school, yet this man insisted on driving her all the way there. She found his desire to drive her very strange because she felt that it could have been easier and less time consuming for him to take the bus with her.
“Hmm,” she thought as she stepped out of her house with her bag slung over one shoulder, “I wonder what he wants from me.”
The man stood up and opened his car door for her so she could get inside. He didn’t offer to help her carry her stuff, which seemed kind of rude because the backpack was heavy. She placed it in the trunk along with her water bottle and got into the passenger side of the car as he shut the door behind her. “Thank you for driving me,” she said while sitting down on the leather seat.
He gave her a smile, then put his hand on top of the steering wheel. As soon as their fingers touched, he quickly pulled it away like if he had burned himself on the hot surface of the metal. The girl’s eyes narrowed in confusion but she decided not to make a big deal out of the awkwardness and instead looked back outside at the scenery. She didn’t want her first day of summer to be ruined because of some strange man.
She was right about that, too; for they made it to school in under ten minutes, which was quite impressive considering how far away it actually was from their house. She got out of the car with a smile as he opened his door and stepped out next to her, then closed both doors before coming over to stand next to her again on the sidewalk leading up into one of the many school buildings located nearby in this area. “Thank you for getting me here so fast,” she said while giving him another friendly smile, hoping it would help ease some of his nervousness towards being around someone like her who looked different from most of the other students at their school.
“No problem. I’m glad we could get to class on time.” He replied back, but his voice sounded rather off as though he was uncomfortable speaking with her and trying hard not to show it. She didn’t care about that because all she wanted was for them both to have a good day at school. “Hey…um…I have an idea,” She said while walking closer towards him so they were standing shoulder-to-shoulder again, “what do you think about grabbing lunch together after class? It would be cool if we got some of the food that’s being served in the cafeteria today and then went somewhere nearby where there are lots of other people around since I want this day to end on a good note.”
He stared at her for several seconds before finally speaking again. “Uhh…I-I don’t really know if I can do that,” He said while looking away from her, “I need to be able to get back home soon because my wife and children are waiting for me there.” With that he quickly turned around as though he was going somewhere else.
She could tell that what she suggested had made him uncomfortable since they were both strangers with no reason why they should feel like they needed to spend time together on their first day at school together but this was also the first time in years where her father wasn’t around so he didn’t know how much longer it would be until his daughter stopped needing him. “I see…okay,” She said before letting out a long sigh that came from deep within herself as she realized how lonely things had become for her recently without anyone else being around except for those two people living with her father at home who also happened to be strangers themselves, just like her new friend on this first day of school where everyone seemed so excited about starting up their education once more after having a long summer break away from it all.
The man didn’t say anything else as he quickly walked away into the building where classes were being taught at their school today without looking back to see if she was still there or not before disappearing out of sight within seconds, leaving her standing alone on this sidewalk while wondering why they couldn’t have made things work out differently between them both instead of having such an awkward interaction like that one had been.

The girl’s eyes narrowed in confusion but she decided not to make a big deal out of the awkwardness and instead looked back outside at the scenery. She didn't want her first day of summer vacation ruined because some strange man was making things uncomfortable for them both inside their car while driving towards one school building where classes would be taught today by this time next week or whenever they decided to get started back up again after having been closed off for so long now during those last few months since March 12th had ended all across America as well as most other countries around the world too.

She placed her backpack into their trunk along with her water bottle before getting inside on one side of our vehicle while he shut his door behind me so we could start driving right away towards where we were headed today which was school since classes would begin again shortly after they're finished up today here at this location where I currently reside inside my home because this place has been closed off for so long now during those last few months since March 12th had ended all across America as well most other countries around the world
