 the sprawling mass of buildings in front of him, with their crumbling walls and peeling paint, he doubted the wisdom of coming here at all. But he had no choice; it was where they sent him.
He knew it by its old name: New Amsterdam. Not the glorious city on Manhattan Island that today was known as The Big Apple, but this one: an ugly, dirty, miserable place in a land even uglier and dirtier than home. He had no idea why his parents had chosen to leave the warmth of their village for such a God-forsaken place. And now he wasn ’ t sure what to make of it himself.
A few hundred years before, New Amsterdam was one of the greatest cities in the world; and so were its inhabitants, Dutch traders who made deals with the Indians, brought in African slaves to work their farms, and built a town on the west bank of the Hudson River that they proudly called “the finest city in all the new world.”
But those days had long gone. The Indians were all dead or enslaved; the Dutchmen were a distant memory. Only one thing was left: the name Amsterdam. And it was this that brought McGregor here. A letter from his uncle, who owned some land here in New Amsterdam, had come with the news that he would be leaving his son—McGregor ’ s cousin—in charge of his business. The young lad could scarcely wait to meet his new brother-cousin and see what he thought of the land on which it was built. But it seemed unlikely McGregor would find much to like in this place, so unkempt were its streets, and so poorly kept its buildings.
He came here with a sense of duty; he knew his uncle expected him to be more dutiful than pleased at the prospect of leaving Scotland for an unknown land. It was something McGregor had no intention of being—in fact, it was his determination not to feel anything about the place that kept him going during those first few months in this city. He would work hard, make a living here, and return home as soon as possible—that is what he told himself, though there were times when he doubted whether he could keep that promise to himself, much less to his uncle.
But what choice did he have? Even if it had been the finest city in all of the new world before, McGregor knew nothing about it now, so he had no idea how it would be different from any other city. He was here on business only, and that was all he planned to give it.
His first task was to find a place for himself, and his best hope was the address he ’ d been given by Uncle Donald: 15 Church Street—a tall building, three stories high. It stood in the very center of town and was surrounded on both sides by buildings almost as big, each with their own front doors that opened to empty streets. There were no people around; McGregor could see neither men nor women walking the cobbled roads leading from one doorway to another.
But he found himself drawn to it anyway—perhaps because he knew there must be something special about this place for his uncle to want him to come here, and that gave him hope of finding out what. So he walked over to 15 Church Street; its tall, three-story walls rose above him like a castle of the past. There were no windows in the top floor, which meant there must be something special up there as well: perhaps a large room with a high ceiling? McGregor ’ s imagination ran wild as he stood beneath those walls.
“ Hello, is anyone home?” He called out into the silent air. No answer came; but the building itself seemed to reply—a low hum that grew louder as he approached and then subsided again when he was gone. It was a sound he ’ d never heard before: like a giant bell being rung without anyone to do the ringing.
McGregor walked around the building, but there was no sign of any door or window; even if there had been one, it would have been hard for him to get through it because all the doors in this place were made from oak and iron—harder than stone walls themselves. He ’ d never seen such a thing before, not in Scotland; but here it was the rule rather than an exception: every building around him had similar features that made McGregor feel as if he was walking through some kind of maze designed to confuse or even frighten anyone who came looking for their way out.
As he walked past 15 Church Street, there was nothing but a gray wall in front of him—no windows and no door; just an empty space where McGregor assumed there should be one if his uncle had meant him to come here instead of somewhere else. Still, it wasn ’ t the first time something strange happened during his stay in this city: when he arrived at what was supposedly his uncle ’ s house on Hudson Street—another three-story building made from oak and iron—there was no door either; only a small window with bars across it so that no one could get inside.
“ Hello, is anyone home?” McGregor called out once again, but still there was no answer; just the sound of his voice echoing against those walls like an angry dog barking at nothing in particular—except maybe himself for having come all this way without knowing what he would find here or why it had seemed so important to him back home.
McGregor walked past another house that was even bigger than 15 Church Street: a three-story building with four windows on the top floor, each one covered by wooden shutters. There were no doors anywhere either; just as with 15 Church Street, McGregor knew they ’ d be there somewhere but couldn ’ t find them unless someone told him where to look for them—and even then he would probably never see them because all the buildings in this city seemed designed to hide themselves from people who came looking for something specific: a door or window; an entrance of any kind.
The more McGregor walked around these streets, the more he became convinced that they were built with one thing in mind: to confuse anyone who wanted out. There was no way anyone could find their way around here without being led by someone who knew every step of the journey—and even then it would still take hours or days or even weeks just to reach a place where there might be some kind of door that could lead you back home again.
It was like walking through an endless maze without any landmarks: no windows, no doors, no signposts or guides; just buildings piled upon each other until they blocked out all sense of time and space, leaving only darkness behind them as proof that someone had been there once before you came along.
McGregor was tired from his long walk through these streets when he finally reached a building that seemed different from all the others around it: a three-story house with glass windows on each floor; no oak or iron anywhere—not even bars across any of them because here at least people were allowed to look out onto what lay beyond their own walls without being trapped inside like prisoners waiting for someone else ’ s release from jail so that they could finally get back home again.
“ Hello?” McGregor called out once more; but this time he knew there would be no answer because whoever lived in this building had seen him coming long before he arrived at its doorstep: his uncle ’ s house on Hudson Street—a place where people were allowed to look out onto what lay beyond their own walls without being trapped inside like prisoners waiting for someone else ’ s release from jail so that they could finally get back home again.
But even though the man who lived here had seen him coming long before he arrived at his doorstep, it still took McGregor a few more minutes of walking around these streets until he finally found what looked like an entrance to 15 Church Street: another small window with bars across it—and this time there was no door either; just a wall where you could see someone standing behind glass staring back at him while waiting for someone else who ’ d never come.
McGregor knew he should have been grateful that someone had finally let him inside their house and given him something to do while he waited here in this city, but instead all he felt was fear as he looked into that window where a man stood watching over his shoulder: waiting for something or someone else who ’ d never come.
McGregor took a step forward towards the doorway with its iron bars across it—and suddenly there was nothing but darkness behind him because someone had switched off all the lights in this house while he walked around looking for an entrance that would lead him back home again. It felt as if time itself was standing still inside these walls, and now it seemed like an eternity before McGregor could hear footsteps coming up behind him: a man ’ s voice calling out his name—a voice so familiar that even though he couldn ’ t see who it belonged to, he knew exactly where they were going next.
“ James? It’s me.” The man said. “ I was wondering if you had gotten lost again?” He asked with an edge of concern in his voice that made McGregor feel more frightened than ever before as he stepped back into the darkness behind him, leaving only a small window covered by wooden shutters behind him—and this time there would be no one standing on the other side watching over his shoulder while waiting for something or someone else who ’ d never come.
