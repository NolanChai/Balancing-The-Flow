its for him to walk out of camera range in hopes that this will be their first break from the day's horrific coverage. The TV anchors all look relieved, even if only for a moment, as they switch back and forth between their monitors and their faces.
``Thank you very much for joining us on 4Wired News. We'll have more details as soon as we can get them, but right now it looks like the police are trying to get everyone out of that building before it falls completely apart.''

It is then that a small part of the building explodes from within and sends a shock wave through the crowd. The reporters all gasp in unison as they watch people fall. In this one moment, thousands of people are killed by falling concrete or by being crushed beneath it. This is the reason for today's story: the deaths of thousands of innocent men and women and children.

``Oh my God!''
 
 The entire set screeches to a halt as the camera pans back toward the studio, where one reporter is on the ground holding his arm while others try to get him off.

``What was that?'' asks another reporter.
 
 ``The building just fell apart!'' shouts another. ``I don't think anyone made it out of there!''
 
 The camera pans back toward the street, where a few stray cars are moving in and out of frame as people scream and run from the scene. Police cars drive up to try to keep traffic away from the site as more reporters join the frenzy that has now ensued. People are still falling on top of one another. Some buildings collapse while others explode. The entire city is in a state of chaos and complete confusion.
 
 ``Is there any way you can get a tally of how many have been killed here?''
 
 The reporter pauses for a moment to listen, but then shakes his head as he realizes that the answer will probably be impossible. In his experience, no one in this city has ever counted the dead, nor would they if they could. It is simply not something people do here, and so it is never done.
 
 ``I don't think we can count them...'' shouts another reporter as a few more people fall to their deaths on live television.
