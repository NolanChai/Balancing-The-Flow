Fortunately, I was able to pick up a few scraps here and there during my travels through this world. While none of these memories are particularly important or revealing on their own, together they form an interesting glimpse into life in the Underground.
I do not recall much about where I came from. All I can remember is that it was a very dark place with no visible source of light. There were others there as well – perhaps a dozen of us total. Our existence was spent within small, cramped cells which seemed to be made of stone, but also felt like they had some form of organic makeup as well. We were always hungry and thirsty, yet we could not seem to get enough to eat or drink.
We slept on hard, cold floors and each morning would awaken with a feeling that our bodies hadn’t been used in days. Our cells seemed to be arranged in some form of hierarchy based off strength. Some were larger than others, with thicker, stronger walls that separated the cells from one another. I can still remember the way they always stood at attention and kept their eyes closed as we entered their cells – like a guard dog who refused to look into your face or meet you eye-to-eye.
I don’t recall if there was anything in our cells besides bedding, but it felt as if that was all we needed. As I said, we were always hungry and thirsty, yet despite my best efforts, I never seemed to be able to find any food or drink. Each morning we would awaken with aching stomachs and dry mouths, and by the time evening rolled around it felt like all of our energy had been drained from us.
Whenever we weren’t working for our captors – whatever they were – we spent most of our days in a small courtyard outside one of our cells where we could gather together and talk. This was also the only area that got any sunlight or natural light, as everything else remained pitch black at all times. The walls around us had strange symbols painted on them that I can’t quite make out to this day – perhaps it would be possible for a person with more experience in deciphering such things than myself to see what they mean?
The only thing of any importance that was ever said during these meetings was that we needed to work together if we wanted any chance of surviving this ordeal. Unfortunately, the strongest members among us were always trying to assert their dominance over others and take control for themselves rather than working as a team. They would force their way into cells which weren’t even theirs in order to make sure no one else could get anything out of them – such as food or water – before they did.
During those times when I was alone with my thoughts, it felt like there were invisible hands reaching down and grabbing hold of me from all sides. It was so heavy that I couldn’t move at all; everything around me seemed to slow down but yet also speed up all at the same time. In these moments, it felt as if an eternity had passed before finally opening my eyes again and seeing a face staring back at me with an expression of concern or worry on theirs.
As I said earlier in this post, our cells seemed to be arranged in some form of hierarchy based off strength. Some were larger than others, with thicker, stronger walls that separated the cells from one another. I can still remember the way they always stood at attention and kept their eyes closed as we entered their cells – like a guard dog who refused to look into your face or meet you eye-to-eye.
I’m not sure how long we were all together in this place, but it felt like an eternity had passed before finally opening my eyes again and seeing a face staring back at me with an expression of concern or worry on theirs. The next thing I knew, several people were pulling me away from the cell door by my arms as others stood guard outside – ready to fight if anyone tried anything funny.
Things were starting to get more complicated now… but there would be no time for rest before we had our next challenge thrown at us!
