-yos from dropping to the floor and breaking. When Sarah had gone into the other room to get the broom and dustpan, Rabecca had made her way over to a shelf that had been filled with old books. The books were all about witches and ghosts and creatures in the night. They had told her about fairies and pixies. And they'd talked to her of magic.
Rabecca had died soon after, leaving Sarah alone and wondering what would happen next. 
But she hadn't given up on the books; she'd read them often, imagining herself as the witches in the stories. She had pretended that Rabecca was still there, telling her to do whatever it took to protect the house from anyone who might come and take their belongings.
But now Sarah knew no one would ever come and take what she had, so long after Rabecca's death. The books had been the only thing left of them. But that wasn't the worst part. 
The worst part was knowing her sister had been crazy to believe there really were witches out there. And yet, Sarah still felt a strong connection with Rabecca and the things she believed. They'd grown up on the stories that their grandmother told them about the magical places of Ireland and Scotland and Wales. Their grandfather's family was from Ireland; they came over to America in 1863, on what they called _the_ Great Famine Ship. He'd been a sailor then—that was how he had met their mother. But when he'd come back home again after the war, he fell in love with Rabecca and married her right away. Sarah remembered their grandfather saying that no one would ever find him out here in Colorado. He was going to have his own land! And Rabecca had been happy then, and she'd become even happier when she found out they were pregnant—twice!
So Sarah was the youngest of a family of five children. 
She thought that was a lot until she met her classmates on the first day at school. There she learned that one of her friends had a whole bunch more siblings than her, and that another friend's father was dead and her mother had to work at night so they could eat something more than bread for supper.
It wasn't until Sarah got older that she found out how crazy Rabecca was. She'd heard the stories from the neighbors who used to come over all the time. They told her about the nights when Rabecca would run up and down the hall, talking to herself or maybe someone else. The other children laughed at her behind their hands; they never asked Sarah why she had two front teeth that were too big for her mouth. 
She'd been happy just being with her sister. They used to sing all night long until Rabecca's voice got so loud, the neighbors called the police and said there was someone running around outside screaming bloody murder! But Sarah didn't care what they thought—she knew Rabecca wasn't really crazy; she had just believed in things no one else did.
Rabecca was her heroine and her idol, and although Sarah was now alone on the ranch, she never forgot the stories or the dreams their grandmother told them when they were little girls. 
She was only twelve years old, but she'd read every single book in that house! She knew more than anyone else at school about witches and ghosts and magical creatures. The other kids thought Sarah must be crazy too—she didn't mind; she had her sister to look up to.
But Rabecca was gone now, so Sarah decided that it was time to stop believing in the stories of old and become a regular girl instead. She started reading books about science and history instead; those were things they taught at school anyway. 
Sarah thought she might even like studying all of that—it would keep her busy until she became an adult. Then she could find herself some man, settle down with his family in the big house, have lots of babies and raise them up right! But then a witch had come to her in a dream . . . 
The witch was beautiful—her face was all pointed like a cat's. She had long black hair that reached down to her waist. Her dress was green and flowery, with spidery black lace at the neckline. Sarah had never seen anything so lovely as this witch; she told herself it must have been one of Rabecca's dreams come alive—Rabecca believed in things like that when she was crazy! 
The witch whispered her name in a singsong voice, and then said: _"You will never be alone. I will always be here for you."_ 
Sarah was so scared of this strange woman that she cried out loud. She thought the witch would go away, but instead she came closer. The green eyes were all bright with light as they looked right into Sarah's own black eyes and said: _"You are my daughter now."_ 
Sarah had woken up then, terrified that the witch was still there in her room. But when she got out of bed and went over to her window to look outside, no one was around! She thought maybe it had all been a dream—just like Rabecca's stories. So Sarah forgot about what had happened . . . at least for a while. 
Then a few nights later she heard a sound out in the hallway. It wasn't her imagination this time; the door to the kitchen was open, and it was the middle of winter! The snow was piled up in great drifts on either side of their house. Sarah didn't know how the witch could have opened that door without using any force at all! But when she went downstairs into the kitchen, there were no footprints left behind—only the open door and a fire roaring in the old cookstove.
Sarah tried to go back up to her room, but then she heard the sound of something moving around up there—the noise was coming from underneath her bed! 
Sarah jumped off the mattress onto the floorboards; then she reached down and grabbed hold of whatever it was that had made that strange grunting sound. The witch turned out to be a mouse, but Sarah wasn't so sure this time. She lifted the little creature up into her hand and looked at its sharp teeth and pointed face—and there was no doubt in her mind: _It was her!_
The next morning when she went downstairs again, Sarah was careful not to look underneath her bed. But this time it wasn't a mouse that ran past; it was the witch herself! She came running around the corner and stopped just in front of her sister's old rocking chair. 
Sarah didn't know what to do—she felt like screaming but instead she found herself standing there, staring at this beautiful creature with the green dress and the long black hair that was almost too heavy for her head to bear! She wanted to ask about what had happened in her dreams, but then Sarah knew it would be like talking back to an evil spirit—it might make things worse. 
"Please don't go," she whispered instead. "You can stay here with me!"
The witch gave a little shiver of surprise; then she reached out and touched Sarah on the arm. Her skin was smooth and cool, but her touch sent a shock right through Sarah like something out of a bad dream! 
Then the witch turned to run back around the corner into Rabecca's room—but when she got there, it wasn't her sister who came out instead. It was an old woman with white hair and wrinkled skin; she was wearing one of the long flowery dresses that Rabecca used to wear years ago! 
"I am your grandmother," the old lady said. "I have come back to stay here." She pointed toward her room at the end of the hallway. "Rabecca's spirit has finally come home, and she wants you to join us!" 
Sarah felt so scared that she ran out into the yard—it was still snowing! But as soon as the witch saw this, she disappeared right in front of Sarah's eyes like a puff of smoke. 
"How did she do that?" Sarah asked herself. She had never seen anything move that quickly before.
She thought maybe it would be best just to go back inside and forget about all of this. But then something came flying out from under her bed: It was the witch again, wearing a different dress than before! This one was dark blue with spidery red designs on it—the same colors as the bloodstains that were still on their floorboards! 
Sarah ran outside and hid behind the tree at the edge of the yard; she thought if the witch found her, she would do something really horrible to Sarah. She remembered how Rabecca had been crazy, talking in her own language and telling people that they were going to die soon. 
Sarah was afraid that maybe her sister had passed this on to her somehow! She didn't know
