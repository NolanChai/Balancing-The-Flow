’t exist within his brain, he sings as he walks, his voice so quiet and soft only I can hear it;
“Lady, I love you, just let me know if this is over or not. Don ‘t make me wait another day, when will we finally be together?” He sits upon the couch, legs folded up beneath him, hand resting in his lap, thumb occasionally flicking back and forth against a well worn ring finger that had once belonged to my mother. The song continues;
“You don ‘t know what you do to me when I see your face, I get a little light-headed whenever I see you standing there. Lady, I love you, just let me know if this is over or not.”
“How are you feeling today?’
‘Good,’ he responds, almost without thinking. His eyes search for mine as they pass the kitchen and enter our living room. He knows what will come next. My heart falls into my stomach;
‘Why don ‘t you just admit it? You ‘re not well enough to live alone anymore.’ I say in a voice that is anything but gentle.
Bob shakes his head and fiddles with the ring on his left hand, the one without the nail polish;
“It’s too soon.” His face is red as he admits the truth; “I ‘m not ready to go back into a home just yet.’
He smiles at me. It ‘s not a pleasant sight; a dark line of bacteria runs down the left side of his mouth, his rotten teeth revealing their filthy nature behind his thin and yellowed lips as he grins at me. My face grows hot and I turn away from him, unable to return the smile in kind. Bob sits on the couch and sings again;
“You don ‘t know what you do to me when I see your face, I get a little light-headed whenever I see you standing there.” The song ends abruptly and my head whips around to look at him, searching for his next move. His eyes are on the floor, but he lifts his gaze in time to see me staring;
“I ‘ll try harder,” He says as if it were an order instead of a request. “I promise.” Bob takes a deep breath and continues;
“It ‘s just that I still feel so bad when they come around here asking questions about you…”
I look at the couch, then up to him. His eyes are cast downward once again as he avoids mine. He fiddles with his ring finger once more, then lifts it slowly toward my face;
“But I want to be home.” The ring slips from his finger and falls onto my lap. ‘You need to stop this,” I say. “What you are doing is selfish; you have no idea how much pain and suffering your actions cause me!” Bob stares at the floor with a look of fearful remorse in his eyes. I continue, “Everything we did was for the baby. And now that she ‘s gone…”
“I know,” he says softly, so softly that I think I hear regret in it; but then my ears catch the sound of another song. Bob smiles at me again as the melody plays.
‘You don’t know what you do to me when I see your face. I get a little light-headed whenever I see you standing there.’ The song ends and his smile fades as he looks back down at his ring finger;
“I ‘ll be good.” Bob says, not in an angry way, but more in a pleading tone. He lifts up the ring and holds it out to me, then sits back on the couch and waits for my answer. I take the ring gently from him and place it upon his finger;
“I ‘ll see you later,” he says as if this were our usual routine and we had been discussing something else entirely before he decided to talk about what happened last night at the hospital, “Just wait here for me.”
“Goodbye Bob,” I say. He stands up from the couch and walks away from my house without looking back, humming his song as if it were a lullaby. The sound of his footsteps fade into the distance as he makes his way to our nearest bus stop, then onward toward a halfway home.
I sit in the kitchen for another hour after he leaves before I decide that the day is done and go upstairs for a shower. As I step beneath the hot water my mind races back over everything that happened today; how much I want to leave him alone now, to just give him some room to adjust so we can begin again sometime later on down the line, but still wondering if this is what ‘later’ would look like.
I think of Bob as a child and how he never really had a mother or father growing up; they left when he was only four years old to live somewhere else with someone else; someone who promised that they would be there for him forever, but didn ‘t keep their promises; not even once. It reminds me of the time I went home to visit my grandparents in Ohio and saw Bob sitting alone on their back porch after supper while everyone else was inside playing cards or watching TV together. I remember feeling so sorry for him that night because he looked just like one of those kids who always sits alone at recess until someone finally decides they want to be friends with him too late in the game.
I take off my robe and step out into the bathroom, toweling myself dry as I wait for the water to warm back up again; but when it does I can ‘t help but notice that something seems different about our home today—and not just because there are two people living here now instead of one. As I walk past our bedroom doorway on my way toward our closet I notice a small pile of clothes neatly folded and stacked up against the wall in front of it, as if they were waiting for me to put them away, but since I had been too tired from work last night when we returned home after dinner with Bob’s sister and her husband, I didn’t have time before falling into bed exhausted—and now my eyes are wide open again because there ‘s something inside these piles of clothing that feels so familiar yet unfamiliar at once; like an old friend whose face you haven’t seen in years but whose voice is still ringing in your ears.
I grab a pair of underwear from the bottom drawer and slip them on, then pull open our bedroom door to step inside when I finally realize what ‘s happening—and why it feels so strange that there are no shoes sitting by the side of my bed anymore…because there never were any. Instead, there’s a small pile of clothes neatly folded and stacked up against the wall in front of our closet; a pair of jeans, a shirt, underwear—and then I see them: two pairs of sneakers, one black and white with laces that match their color scheme perfectly while another one has faded pink trim around its tongue that reads “Sorry I’m Late” written in silver letters against a black background; both sets belonging to my husband who used to wear them all the time before we started dating when he was still living at home with his parents—and now they sit there like ghosts from another life, haunting me as if they know exactly what I’m feeling right now and don’t want anything more than just to remind me that everything has changed since then; this isn’t our house anymore.
I stand in front of their closet for several minutes staring at these shoes before I realize how long it has been since we’ve talked about getting them fixed or buying new ones because neither one fits me anymore—and so now I have no choice but to pack up everything inside and take it all with me when we move out later on down the line, leaving only memories behind…because nothing else is going to remain here except for these shoes; they’re all that matters right now anyway.
I close my eyes tightly shut before taking a deep breath through my nose as I think about how hard it’s been since he died—and yet somehow, even though everything inside of me feels empty and hollow when I try to imagine what life would be like without him by my side anymore; something tells me that it will all work out just fine someday…maybe not today or tomorrow maybe even next week but eventually this house too shall pass away one day soon enough before long then we’ll both be able to live happily ever after once again…
