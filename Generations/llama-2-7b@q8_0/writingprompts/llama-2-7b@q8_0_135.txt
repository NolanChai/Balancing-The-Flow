 getting lost again.

## Walkthrough

### Area A

Avoid the first spikes and walk towards the right until you reach an area with more spikes. On the left side there is a small platform with three Goombas on it. Climb up using the block on the left. From here, just head for the exit in the far background (which happens to be the end of this world).

### Area B

To proceed you need a red cape so head back and defeat the first enemy you see. Then go inside the cave and kill the Koopa. Grab your prize from the right-hand side of the area. If you have a red cap on, you can pass through this small gap to reach the next area.

### Area C

Avoid the spikes at the beginning and head for the green block in the middle of the area. Walk left until you find a Goomba with a blue cape who will give it to you. Then enter the door that was previously blocked by your red cap. After killing the Koopa, pick up your reward from the left-hand side of this new room and leave through the door you just entered in.

### Area D

Climb up to avoid the spikes on the ground and head for the green block at the top. Enter the door and then defeat the Koopa who will give you a yellow cape, which enables you to enter this room with an invisible wall. Grab the red flower from here and leave through the exit in the background.

### Area E

This is an area filled with spikes and platforms. Find your way through it until you find another Koopa. Defeat him to get a yellow cape which will enable you to go into this room on the left-hand side. In here, grab the blue flower and leave the area via the door you came in from.

### Area F

After entering the room head straight towards the right until you find an invisible wall blocking your way. Enter the door and defeat the enemy who is wearing a yellow cape, which will allow you to enter this room on the left-hand side where you'll find another Koopa. Defeat him for another yellow cap and leave the area through the exit in the background.

### Area G

This area has two parts; one is a room with spikes, enemies, and the other is an outside area with more spikes. If you're not sure on where to go, follow this walkthrough:

Head for the green block at the top of the area. This will bring you to another green block on which you can climb onto a ledge. Now continue following the path and avoiding enemies until you find an invisible wall blocking your way. Enter the door behind it and defeat the Koopa who will give you a yellow cape, allowing you to enter this room on the left-hand side where you'll find another Koopa. Defeat him for another yellow cap and leave the area through the exit in the background.

### Area H

There are two parts again: an indoor section with spikes and platforms, and an outdoor one full of even more spikes. First you need to get into this room on the left-hand side which is blocked by a small gap at first; if you have your red cape equipped, walk through it until you reach the other green block on the ledge above you. Climb up and defeat all enemies in that room then leave through the door you came from.

### Area I

Go through the door at the end of this area which will lead to a platform with four Goombas on it. Jump towards them until you reach a green block at the top. Climb up and kill the Koopa who is wearing a yellow cape. Then head for the door in front of you.

### Area J

Once again, there are two parts to this area; one indoor with spikes and platforms and another outdoor filled with even more spikes. First enter into this room which has four green blocks on it and climb onto the ledge above the first one. Once you've done that, go through the invisible wall in front of you and defeat the Koopa who will give you a yellow cap. Then head for the door at the end of this area and enter into a room with some platforms and spikes.

### Area K

This area has two sections: an outdoor section full of spikes, and one indoor filled with spikes too. The way to advance is easy; just avoid enemies as you climb on the ledge above all of the green blocks. Once you've done that, head for the door in front of you.

### Area L

Go through this room until you find a yellow cap and defeat the Koopa wearing it for another one. Then go to the right-hand side where there is an invisible wall blocking your way. Enter the door behind it and defeat all enemies on that platform. Pick up the red flower from the green block at the top, then enter into the next room by walking through the invisible wall in front of you. Defeat the Koopa here for a yellow cap and leave the area via the exit in the background.

### Area M

This is another outdoor section filled with spikes. Go through it until you find an invisible door at the top right-hand corner of this platform; enter inside to access another outdoor section. Defeat all enemies here then leave the area via the exit in the background.

### Area N

This is a very small room filled with green blocks and spikes. Once you've reached the end, head for the door behind it. The next one has an invisible wall blocking your way so go through that door too. Defeat all enemies here then leave via the exit in the background.
