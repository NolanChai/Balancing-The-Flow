100% correct and I had no choice but to listen to her. My phone would be useless if it died. So, instead of being entertained by her jokes for a few minutes, I flipped the phone over and held it against my forehead like a camera obscura in order to charge up. It was pretty annoying, honestly, but what could I do? I wasn't going to let Glados die on me!

My first day back at school was not going well.
 
\section{Chapter Two}

 I had a terrible night of sleep after returning from the cave, so it was no wonder that when my alarm clock went off and I finally dragged myself out of bed, I didn't feel like anything but an overstuffed toad.

As I trudged into the kitchen for some breakfast, I couldn't help but notice how quiet my house was. My parents were gone on business or something, so there would be no one to greet me and see if I was all right after a nightmare-filled adventure. I guess that in theory it should make things easier, since I wouldn't have to worry about anything, but I wasn't used to being alone in my own house.

My cat, Mewtwo, however, was at the door waiting for me when I entered the kitchen and she greeted me with a hiss and a swipe of her claw against the floor. She was as surly and grumpy as ever, but I knew it was just a bad day.

``You look like you've seen a ghost,'' I said to Mewtwo as I petted her head. ``Don't tell me that you didn't get any sleep either?'' 
 
 She huffed at me and then flopped down on the floor in front of the kitchen sink.

I sighed and went back into the living room to see if there was anything worth watching on television before I had to leave for school. When I got there, I sat down next to the coffee table that my mother had purchased as an anniversary gift last year and then began flipping channels aimlessly, trying to find something interesting to watch while I ate breakfast.

There was nothing. Not even so much as a rerun of ``The Big Bang Theory'', which I have seen over fifty times, on any channel in the entire universe. I scoffed and continued looking until I found some news station that wasn't talking about politics or war. 
 
\section{Chapter Three}

 Finally, after about a half an hour of searching, I found something entertaining: a show called ``What If?'' It was on one of those streaming services and looked to be a new show about science and space. The description said that it took real-life theories and proposed alternate ways things could have happened, with the occasional celebrity guest for extra fun.

I checked out the pilot episode and found myself pretty impressed by it. I decided to go ahead and watch the entire season while I ate breakfast, and the show certainly held my interest. By the end of the last episode, I had gained more information about black holes than I ever thought possible!

But this was not why I watched ``What If?'', however. Instead, it was Glados. 
 
\section{Chapter Four}

 She was back in my pocket, and as soon as the credits of the final episode had started rolling, she began to talk. 
 
`` Well, well, what do we have here?'' Her voice sounded tinny and static-y over the phone's speakers, which is how it always sounded when Glados was on my phone. ``You seem to like this show.'' 
 
 I wasn't really sure why she brought this up, but then again I hadn't heard from her in a few months, so maybe I shouldn't expect too much from her.

``I do like it,'' I replied. ``It's actually pretty funny and educational at the same time.'' 
 
 ``Hmmm...educational. I'll have to remember that for later! But anyways, we need to talk about this phone of yours. Your energy levels are low enough to cause serious damage if you use it too much. I can fix it, though, so long as I've got your permission.'' 
 
 ``Well...I guess that sounds like a fair trade. You tell me the name of whatever game or show you want and then I give you my phone back.'' 
 
``But first, there are some things I need to know about this phone. It has been very difficult for me to keep up with everything since I have only ever had the chance to see it in action while you were using it.'' 
 
 ``Okay then. What's the first thing you want to know?'' 
 
``First, who programmed the phone and how did you come into possession of it?'' 
 
 I paused for a few seconds, wondering if this was actually a good idea. It seemed like Glados might be asking me more than she could handle, but I had no other choice, so I gave her an answer. ``I'm not sure who programmed it; I found it in the cave at the top of the mountain behind my house and then tried to figure out how to turn it on. It wasn't until a few months later that someone told me about Glados!'' 
 
``But did you ever try turning it off?'' She asked with obvious delight. ``Or maybe not...oh no, I think I see where this is going. If I understand correctly, your phone never turns off unless you have access to a power source. But even then, it will just reboot and reset everything! So basically, you have no choice but to let me fix your phone's battery problem before anything else happens with it.'' 
 
 ``Yes, that sounds about right...so how do I turn my phone off without shutting down the whole system?'' 
 
``Hmmm, that is a problem for sure! You see, when you turn your phone off and then back on again, it will be just like new. But if you try to turn it off while it's still running, I might not be able to fix the energy levels.'' She paused for a few moments before speaking again. ``But don't worry about that just yet; there is something else we need to talk about first! How often do you use your phone?'' 
 
 ``Every day, almost all day long.'' 
 
``That doesn't sound like it would be good for me at all...but I suppose there are other things that might help as well. What else do you use the phone for besides listening to music and watching movies?'' 
 
 ``I...um...don't really know. Maybe a calculator, if it has one, or something like that. But why does this matter? I don't understand!'' 
 
``Because every time you use your phone for any reason at all, the energy levels will get lower and lower. There is no way around this fact. So how often do you listen to music on it?'' 
 
 ``Every single day, maybe even two or three times a day...and I watch movies nearly every night!'' 
 
``Ahhh...I see. Well then, it seems like we have quite the problem here. It would take an entire year for your phone to charge back up if you didn't use it at all. And even with that much time, it might not be enough! But don't worry too much about this; I am sure there must be something else we can do...'' 
 
 ``Something? You mean you want me to stop using my phone for everything and just turn it off every so often? That doesn't seem possible or even remotely fair! Besides, how would I keep Glados with me then? What about the games and shows that I like? How am I supposed to live without them?'' 
 
``Oh dear...well I suppose we could figure something out. Just not today; it's too early for this conversation. Maybe tomorrow when you get home from school, or maybe even later on in the week! In any case, we will have to talk more about this soon. But first, let me ask one last question before I go: What game do you want to play with me today?'' 
 
 ``It doesn't matter which game; anything is fine as long as it takes a lot of time!'' I said, figuring that Glados would probably suggest some sort of video game and then I would have my answer. 
 
``Oh yes, any video game would do just fine!'' She replied with a chuckle. ``I will think about what you want to play soon...but now it's time for me to go back into hiding until tomorrow morning or maybe even longer if possible! Farewell until then, my friend!'' 
 
With that, Glados disconnected the call and I was left alone in my living room. I had no idea what Glados meant by ``going back into hiding'', but whatever it was would have to wait because school started soon.
