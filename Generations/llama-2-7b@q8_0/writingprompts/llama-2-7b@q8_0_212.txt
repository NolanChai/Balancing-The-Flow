ps on the radar meant nothing to them anymore. ``
The man on the radio, or whatever it was, said we were being attacked by a goddamn cloud. I didn't believe him at first, but then one of my friends got hit in the face and his eyes started glowing green like fuckin' Christmas lights. "I told ya...," he said.
After that, we ran for it. We all made it out, except my friend who was blinded. The rest of us ended up at a local bar; this was no time to get drunk and make stupid decisions. We needed to be sharp and alert if we were gonna survive the night.
As we sat in silence for hours, I thought about how many people would've made it out had they just waited instead of rushing in like fuckin' idiots. But this wasn't their fault; they were born into a world where we were taught to be brave and unafraid. To fight anything that came our way with weapons or words. This was the first time I realized how stupid it all really is, when there are things out there we have no hope of understanding, let alone defeating.
That's what I think about sometimes... if only they knew.
