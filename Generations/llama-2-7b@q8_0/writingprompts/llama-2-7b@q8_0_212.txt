''Mark's a very nice man...I can see why you fell in love with him.'
`` Well, he is rather charming. And his hands are incredible.... '
`
``What do you mean? They're just hands.' 
"Well, I could tell right away that they were special.'
`` What makes them so special?' `
``Well...I don't know how to explain it exactly, but Mark can give me the best massage of my life. Just by looking at his hands.'
`
`` So you want him to do that to you a lot, huh? Well...that would be pretty nice for me too.' `
 
``That's not what I mean!'
`` Really? Then what do you mean?'

Jessica looked at Mark with longing in her eyes. 

 ``I want to make love with him, but I don't know how to break the news to him.' `
 
``You're a little too late for that. I think we already know what he wants you to do to me...`
`` I was hoping to be able to surprise you both.'

Jessica stepped toward Mark, and kissed his lips. She took his hand in hers and ran her fingers through the silky soft hairs on the back of it. 

 ``I want your body,' she said, placing a soft kiss upon each finger. `
``Well, you're going to have to be very patient with me...` 
`` I have all night.' 

 ``But won't he want some too?' she asked, her eyes still on Mark's hand.

Mark laughed and said, ''I can always share....`
``Oh good!...`
``I bet you would be a very good teacher...`
``Well, I do have centuries of experience....`
``What was that for?! I thought you said it was over?' Jessica cried. She walked toward Mark with fists raised. ``How could you kiss her after all these years? Why didn't you tell me how she felt about you!' `
 
``She told you everything,' Mark replied. ``We can talk about that later. I want to see what you think of my new garden.' He walked out the door, and Jessica followed him with anger in her eyes. ``Why did you do that?' 
``I was hoping we could both have some fun tonight....`
``I don't need your help!' she spat at him, as he led her toward his new garden. `
``Well, I'll be there,' Mark said with a laugh. ``But first let me show you this.' 
``I want to see what you have done here....`
``Okay...but don't expect too much from these small plants yet...they are still young....`
``Oh, they look great! I can't wait until they grow up!' `
 ``They will take many years of care and attention,' Mark replied. ``And that is why we need to talk about what you plan on doing with your life.' 
``My plans have not changed....' 
 ``Well, when you are old and gray, I don't want you to be working in some boring office, surrounded by people who are just as old and gray. I want you to come here for a few days at a time, or even a month if you like.' `
``What?! Why would I do that?'
``Well...you see...I have something very special planned for my garden. There is going to be an area with hundreds of beautiful flowers and plants. They will all be the same color and type....and when they are finished blooming, we are going to pick them up together in your arms.' 
``You would not believe how beautiful a man can look holding these flowers in his arms...`
 ``Well I certainly do know! You have been doing that for a long time!' `
 ``But this is something new....'
``What are you talking about?' Jessica asked. ``I thought we had already established what was going to happen tonight.' 
 ``You and I can go to my garden, and the two of us will pick up all those flowers together. And after that...well....that will be our little secret.' `
``Well, why should it have to be a secret? You are not afraid of me, are you?' she asked as she pulled him down onto his knees in front of her, and began kissing the palm of his hand. 
 ``Of course I'm not,' he answered with a laugh. 'I want you to know what I have been like for all these years, but I also want to protect your reputation.' `
``You needn't worry about that any longer....`
``That is very nice of you...but there are still many people who do not understand our relationship. They would be shocked if they knew the truth. And some may even hate us because of it. But I don't care what other people think.' ``Well, I can see that about you,' Mark replied, kissing her lips. 
``But what about you? You are a very nice young woman...and you deserve to be loved and respected by everyone....`
``I have never had anyone tell me that before....' 
``Then let them know how special they are.' ``I am going to shower right now, and then we will go outside. It is finally starting to get warm enough for us to enjoy our garden again.' `
``Are you sure it won't be too much of a shock for you?' Jessica asked as she wrapped her arms around his waist and began kissing him all over his body. 
 ``I don't think so...` 
``Oh, I see....' She started to laugh at the thought of how surprised he would be when he walked outside. `
``Yes, it is a little difficult for me too,' he admitted. `
``That's okay....we will figure something out.' `
 ``You have got to admit...it does look very nice!' she cried as Mark led her outside and began walking toward the garden. ``But you don't see what I am seeing right now!'' 
 ``What do you mean? What are you talking about?' 
``I am looking at your garden, and all these beautiful flowers....and they are so much bigger than mine!' She smiled with joy as she continued staring out over his gardens. `
``They really are quite something...aren't they?' he asked, as they both looked out over the expansive fields of flowers that surrounded them.  ``Why do you look so sad? You seem upset....` Jessica was silent for a moment, and then she said, ``Well, I suppose it is my fault. If we had been able to have children, we would have had so many more plants....and our gardens could have been even bigger!' 
``You really miss your children?'' 
``I do...and the older they get, the more difficult it becomes for me to accept that I can't be with them. You know...as they grow up and move on in their lives. I used to feel so young and full of energy when I was able to see them every day....but now there are just a few times each year when we can get together, and it is always for such short periods of time.'
``Do you have any siblings that could help you?' 
``No...I am an only child. My parents died long ago....and I don't even have children of my own anymore. It is just me now...completely alone, and all alone in my garden. But you know what? You are the best thing to happen to me in a very long time! And I want you to come here as much as possible...` 
``I would love that....' 
 ``But we have to be careful with how many times we meet, don't we?' 
``Yes. We can't go around getting caught and having all these rumors start again. And it is going to be hard for me as well...because I want to see you every day.' 
``Well, then I guess we will just have to plan things out so that we spend less time together. You know....it isn't always about us...there are a lot of other people who need our help and guidance too.' `
 ``Yes, but you mean more than anyone else in this world,' Jessica said as she stared into his eyes with passion. 
``You can be my life partner if you want to be....'
``I would like that very much. I don't know why it took me so long to realize what a wonderful man you are.' `
 ``But don't forget who you really love, and how special they are.' Jessica walked closer to him as she began kissing his neck again. 
``Of course not....but I would like for us both to be happy...so if that is what you want too.....then let us do it!' ` 
 ``And why do you think we should only have one partner in our lives?' Mark asked as he returned her kisses with his lips, and then ran his fingers through Jessica's soft hair. `
``I don't know...' she said with a sigh, as they continued to walk toward the garden together. ``But I do feel like we are
