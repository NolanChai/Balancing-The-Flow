issures that cut deep into its surface. Those fissures are where Eshu gets all interesting.
The first one is called "Hell's Mouth". It stretches along the equator and curves up to touch the southern pole. The second one, called "Mother's Hand" (because it has a claw-like shape) cuts through the northern part of the moon and meets Hells Mouth at a 90 degree angle just north of its tip.
Between the two fissures is a ring of land. It's mostly made up of large, jagged pieces of stone that look like giant toothpicks. It was originally believed that these pieces were once part of Eshu, but recently evidence has been found that suggests the rock came from somewhere else entirely.
The ring is about 20 kilometers thick at its thinnest point and about 90 kilometers wide. The ring's circumference is a little over 1568 kilometers long, meaning it takes Eshu exactly one day to go once around the ring in one complete rotation.
Inside of Hell's Mouth are a series of craters. There are three in particular that are very interesting for scientists and engineers, but they will be discussed later on. For now we shall focus our attention on Mother's Hand.
The inside of Mother's Hand is almost perfectly circular with the exception of one long, narrow slit that runs straight down its middle to its tip. It cuts through the rock from one side and ends up in a hole on the other side. Scientists don't know what causes this slit or why it exists, but they do have some ideas about how Mother's Hand got its name.
The first one is that there was once another moon orbiting Eshu which somehow ended up getting sucked into Hell's Mouth. The second theory says the moon once had rings of its own and those were torn apart when something large collided with it, sending a piece of rock flying into Mother's Hand. The final one is that a meteor hit the surface causing an impact crater which then collapsed in on itself forming the slit we see today.
Now that you know what kind of terrain you can expect from Eshu I think it would be nice if we took some time to explore our surroundings. As we're traveling through space at a speed faster than light, our ship will continue rotating around its own axis which makes looking out the windows pretty interesting! You see, while one side of your window shows stars and galaxies that are hundreds or even thousands of light-years away, another part of it reveals something much closer: A small asteroid field.
The asteroid belt is made up of rocks ranging from as little as 0.03 meters in diameter all the way up to some as big as a few kilometers across. In total there are about 1,269 known asteroids in this system and they are all orbiting around Eshu's equator at an average distance of just over 44 million kilometers (about 100 times Earth's Moon). This means that even though we can see these tiny pieces of rock as they pass by our ship, most people wouldn't be able to spot them from back home because they would be so small compared with everything else!
Now that we know what kind of terrain Eshu has and where it is located in space I think its time to take a look at some other interesting things about this little world! First off, let's talk about the planet itself: what does Eshu actually look like?
Well first off there isn't really one specific color for all of Eshu because there are different areas with varying shades depending on their surface composition. For example you can find regions full of bright red sand dunes while others may be covered in dark purple rocks and cliffs which makes it easy to tell where you're going just by looking at them!
Next up we have the planet's atmosphere: how thick is it? Well according to some calculations scientists believe that Eshu has an average atmospheric pressure of about 1.5 bar (equivalent to Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level) which means that even though you're traveling through space at super high speeds, once you land on the planet there shouldn't be any problems breathing because everything will feel just as normal for you!
Finally let's talk about the weather: what kind of temperatures do they have? Well according to some researchers Eshu has an average temperature range between -10 degrees Celsius (-23 Fahrenheit) and 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). This means that while you're on Eshu you shouldn't have any trouble wearing clothes like shorts, tank tops or even just a simple t-shirt since it doesn't get very hot during the day but can get pretty cold at night!
And with all of these questions answered I think now would be a good time to give some examples of what kind of things people have been doing lately on Eshu: building new homes, exploring ancient ruins and even starting their own businesses which means that this little world has become quite popular in recent years!
The first thing we're going to discuss today is the city of Kadam. It was originally founded by an Earthling who moved there after leaving his home planet because he wanted to find some peace and quiet away from all those busy streets so he could focus on himself for once! This guy named David built himself a house made out of stones which he later turned into one big building where people could come and stay as well.
In addition to this, there are also many other cities located in Eshu including: Tartan, Glebe, Yarrow and Kensington which means that no matter what kind of place you're looking for chances are high that it will be found somewhere within the boundaries of this beautiful planet!
Now let's talk about some interesting things about Eshu itself. For example: did you know that there is an asteroid belt located right around its equator which means that people can travel through space faster than light but still be able to see everything going on inside our solar system? Or maybe we should mention how beautiful sunsets are over here because sometimes they look so colorful even though they're nothing compared with those seen on Earth!
Now it's time for some interesting facts about Eshu itself including: how thick is its atmosphere, what kind of temperatures do they have, and finally... did you know that there was once another moon orbiting this planet which got sucked into Hell's Mouth? The answer is yes!
And with all of these questions answered it seems like we've reached the end of this chapter but don't worry because tomorrow morning I will be writing a new one for you where I talk about more details of Eshu so stay tuned to find out what else there is waiting for us in this amazing world!
Thanks everyone for reading my blog today and please make sure that when we get back from the holidays on Monday, January 6th; there will be new articles here every single day until April 30th when I take my annual vacation! See ya then :)
