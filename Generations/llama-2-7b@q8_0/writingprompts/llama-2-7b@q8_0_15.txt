 where a doctor pulled out a sponge that looked like a tire inner-tube, put the bulb at the end of the surgical needle to a hole in his lung. “Let’s start pumping,” he said and they began a long operation to squeeze the air out of his lungs, squeezed him hard enough that he screamed for them to stop. The doctor ordered more anesthesia and the pain eased but he still gasped for breath as it continued on and on in that room with a surgical team all around him, their eyes watching every move the doctors made. Finally when they’d done what they could, he was rolled into another room where three nurses stood over him while one checked his pulse, the other two looked at his chart as if they were reading a book.
The bullet had gone through his lung and out the front of his chest. When it hit the ribs on either side of the hole in his lungs, it broke the bones and sliced into the muscles that held them together. The bullet came to rest in the shoulder of the man who was riding with him at the time. His friend’s shoulder was cut open to extract the bullet from inside the man and the surgeon removed it then sewed up the wound. After his friend left, the soldier with a broken rib on his right side began coughing and more blood came out of his mouth every time he did it and by that time they’d gotten him onto an ambulance that had been waiting for them in another room.
The bullet had gone through his lung and out the front of his chest and then hit the ribs on either side, breaking bones as it went. When it was all done, a doctor stood at the foot of his hospital bed in a surgical mask while he stared up at him and listened to what he was telling him. “You’re going to be all right,” the man said. “I have to remove some of your ribs to stop the bleeding.” The soldier watched as the doctor slipped on a pair of blue rubber gloves then grabbed his ribcage with both hands and began pulling out his right side. A nurse held up an oxygen mask when he gasped for air but he didn’t take it because his body was screaming at him to get more blood into his lungs and that’s all he could think about as the doctor kept yanking on his ribcage until they both began to sweat. The soldier clenched his teeth together until they ground down into something that felt like stone and then it was done, the last one of his right side coming out with a wet sound at the end before he let himself lean back against the headboard as if he’d just finished running a marathon.
The bullet had gone through his lungs and out the front of his chest. When they got him onto an ambulance to take him away, he couldn’t breathe or even cough because it felt like there was something stuck in his throat and he thought he might start gagging so they stopped the vehicle on a hill outside the city where soldiers were digging trenches for bunkers. The driver stepped out of the ambulance to get some water from an army truck, then handed him a bottle when he came back with it and sat down in his seat again. He drank as much as he could because the pain was so bad that he thought if he didn’t stop he might throw up in front of them. But then another man showed up at the side of the truck carrying a first aid kit on his shoulder while others stood around watching what was going on and when they saw him, they stepped away from their work to watch him too because they were curious about it, maybe because it happened so often that no one bothered anymore. The man with the kit knelt down beside the soldier then opened up its contents and started pulling out things from inside before he sat back on his knees again and began rubbing an ointment onto the wound on top of his chest where the bullet had entered it, then wrapped a bandage around what was left after he’d finished. “I want to keep this dry until you can get some medical treatment,” he said before putting everything back into its case again and closing it shut.
The bullet had gone through his lungs and out the front of his chest. When they put him on an airplane, a nurse sat beside him with her head against the windowpane watching as farmland disappeared from beneath them until all that could be seen were mountains covered in snow. The soldier was so tired that he closed his eyes for most of the trip but then it started to hurt again and he couldn’t take any more pain, so when they landed at an air base outside a city with lights shining all over its skyline, he stepped into a room where doctors were waiting for him. “Let me see your wound,” one said after another had finished examining it. Then he pulled out his own scalpel from inside of his pocket and began cutting away at the bandages wrapped around the bullet hole before they were all gone and only what was left of it showed through like a white line against brown skin. “Let me take some pictures first,” said another doctor then started taking pictures of what could be seen on x-rays until they were done with their work, he put them away inside his own pocket after they’d finished taking them before walking out into an area where other men were waiting for him to come back.
The bullet had gone through his lungs and out the front of his chest and when it hit the bone on either side, it broke both of them along with a couple others as well which made his body hurt so much that he didn’t care about anything else anymore until one day after they’d done what was necessary to save him from dying. “You’re going to be all right,” said a nurse then stepped back against a wall, watching over him while another doctor finished sewing up the wound on his chest before wrapping it in gauze.
“What happened?” asked someone at one point during their time together, looking down at him as he lay in bed recovering from what had just transpired between them all those days earlier which is when they’d found out that there was something wrong with her heart because she wasn’t supposed to be alive anymore.
“I guess we didn’t pay much attention to it,” replied another man who happened upon the scene as if he hadn’t expected what had happened any more than anyone else did either and then they left him alone afterward until one day later when another person showed up at his door again asking questions about whether or not anything was going on between them anymore because he knew something wasn’t right inside of her chest which caused him to pause for a moment before answering that no, everything seemed fine with both of them now.
The bullet had gone through his lung and out the front of his chest but when it hit the ribs on either side, they broke bones along with muscles holding them together which led to an infection that made him sick for several days until finally getting better enough where he could breathe again without feeling like there was something stuck in his throat. “You’re going to be okay,” said a nurse who came into the room one afternoon after he had been sleeping most of the day, watching as they cleaned him up while another doctor finished sewing up the wound on top of his chest before wrapping it with gauze again before she stepped out of there too.
“What happened to you?” asked someone else who happened upon their scene later that evening when he was lying down once more after having been awake most all day, staring at nothing in particular until finally falling asleep. “I guess I didn’t pay much attention to it,” replied another man who had shown up there earlier asking if everything seemed okay between them now because they knew something wasn’t right inside of her chest which caused him pause for a moment before answering that no, everything seemed fine with both of them again.
“You’re going to be all right,” said the nurse before she stepped back against the wall as he lay in bed recovering from what had just transpired between them all those days earlier which is when they found out that something was wrong inside her heart and it caused him pause for a moment before answering that yes, everything seemed fine with both of them now.
