 my mates are all gay. But she 's the one girl I 'd really be interested in going out with.
But here was my chance. It was our yearbook picture day at school and she had to come up front to get it taken. Her friends were there too and they did n't know me from Adam, so I could not very well ask her out then right? So I got the courage to go talk with her friend.
" Hi!" I said, "I 'm Joe. I 'd like to know you."
" What ? " she asked. " Who are you?"
" Oh, yeah, sorry," I replied, "My friends call me Joe."
" Hey !" they exclaimed, "It's the yearbook picture day! It 's time for us to get our pictures taken." They all started going up front and I knew that this was my chance. I went over to her and said, "Look, it 's no problem if you do n't know me now but will you go out with me sometime?
" What ? !" she screamed. " What did you say?"
" I asked if you would go out with me!" I repeated, feeling so embarrassed and stupid at the same time.
" Oh." She said, and I could tell she was thinking it over in her mind. Then all of a sudden, she said, "OK! I 'll go out with you." And then she smiled sweetly at me.
The rest is history... I guess !
