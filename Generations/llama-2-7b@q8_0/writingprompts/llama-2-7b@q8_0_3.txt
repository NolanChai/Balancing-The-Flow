 at their local diner, The Happy Steakhouse. She's always there on time and has never been late in over ten years of visiting Riley in his hospital ward.
Rachael sits down opposite him, across the small table that is a little too low for two people to sit side by side comfortably. There are no other chairs at their table. The Happy Steakhouse doesn't do bookings or reservations. If there aren't any seats at the counter, then you wait until someone leaves and takes up a new spot.
The diner is full of men in suits who have just come off work for the day; the smell of their aftershave mingles with the smoky scent of the juicy steaks that are grilling on an open barbecue behind the counter. Rachael always orders a cheeseburger, while Riley has chicken fingers and fries. The waiter brings over two tall glasses of ice-cold Coke – one for each of them – and asks if they'd like some coffee to go with their meal.
No, says Rachael, smiling sweetly at him in that way she hasn't changed since he was a boy. It's always the same. She has never changed anything about the routine and neither does Riley. He just looks up at her without moving his head. Sometimes people wonder if he can really hear them from where he is, but they never ask him directly; it feels rude somehow. And anyway, he'll have heard them: he always knows when Rachael has arrived.
Today, she smiles and leans across the table to kiss his cheek gently.
'So how are you today? I hope you haven't been too bored?'
She winks at him and sits back in her chair. Riley doesn't blink as he watches Rachael pick up a fry, then suck it into her mouth and chew it slowly.
Rachael has always had a full figure; she was the only one who didn't turn out to look like their mother with her tall, slim figure and long, dark hair. They don't know what happened that day when they were four years old. Riley's mum walked into his bedroom and found Rachael hanging from a rope in the top bunk of her own bed. She was swinging slowly backwards and forwards as she tried to climb up onto the ceiling, and it wasn't until she came crashing down on Riley's bed that their mother realised what had happened.
Rachael is only five years older than him, but she has always taken care of Riley since then, even though they are twins. She looks after his needs like a mother hen.
They never talk about what happened to Rachael on the day of their mother's funeral. Even though her father went straight from the hospital and buried her, it was too late for anyone to revive her. Riley had been found crying by their grandparents who were waiting at home with his dad – they couldn't understand why he wasn't with his mother when she died. But their grandmother just hugged him tight and told him that his mum had gone to be an angel in heaven, looking after them both now.
And so it was that Riley spent the day sitting on a chair at his parents' graveside as the minister talked about their lives; he watched Rachael's coffin being lowered into the ground while the snow fell from the sky above him, blanketing everything in white and making the whole world seem peaceful.
Rachael takes another fry out of her bag and crunches it between her teeth. Riley watches his sister eat with a wistful look on his face; he hasn't had anything to eat since he was five years old, but even if they asked him to have something now – and they never do – he couldn't take another bite.
It all started the day after Rachael hanged herself. When their father went into the kitchen and found his children sitting together on a chair eating a bowl of cereal each, he was too angry at first to say anything. But then something seemed to break inside him; Riley doesn't know what it was, but he suddenly saw his children in a way he never had before – as two little humans who needed love and care just like any other child would.
Rachael was only four years old when she died, so she didn't understand how to die or why; she simply went up the stairs that day with her jump rope dangling over one arm and stepped off into nothingness. But Riley knew what had happened; he remembered the way his sister's eyes looked at him as she lay in the hospital bed, staring at him with no life in them anymore. The look haunted him for years afterwards, until their father took them both away from that house and never spoke to anyone about what had happened there.
Rachael finishes her fry and takes another one out of the bag; Riley looks up at his sister and she smiles sweetly back at him before putting it in her mouth.
She sits down and starts drawing pictures on her napkin, like she always does during their meals together. The waiter comes over again with a new Coke for each of them and asks if they want anything else – another burger or maybe something off the dessert menu? Rachael smiles at him and shakes her head.
Riley's mouth opens slowly as he stares down at his sister who is drawing on the napkin, but all that comes out is a thin stream of saliva running down his chin. It doesn't matter how hard he tries; nothing will make his jaw work again after that day eleven years ago when his father locked him in this room and said never to come out again until he was well again.
Rachael is still drawing on her napkin while Riley looks up at the ceiling, his gaze slowly wandering across the white paint as it meets a hole with a light bulb hanging from it.
There's nothing to see in here; it has all been covered with fresh coats of paint since that day so long ago when they came for him and took him away from Rachael. But she never forgets to visit, just like every month at this time when their father brings her over for a meal together – no matter what hospital or mental ward they are in nowadays; he always takes care of that himself without asking any questions.
Riley reaches out with his hand and touches the wall behind him as if feeling something there, but there's nothing on it except the white paint like everywhere else inside this room – just like outside too, where everything has been painted white so people can't see what happened here long ago when their mother died.
He closes his eyes for a moment and tries to remember her face as she looked down at him from above with one hand reaching out towards him but never quite making contact. Rachael stops drawing on the napkin and looks up at Riley; he opens his mouth and tries once more to say something, but only saliva comes out this time instead of words – like it always does nowadays whenever they talk together here in this hospital ward where they don't know if anyone else can hear them talking or not.
Rachael watches her brother for a while until finally she says what she needs to say. She doesn't ask any questions; there are no secrets between these two twins who have been together all their lives despite everything that happened when they were just children. They always talk about anything and everything, but now it is time for Rachael to tell Riley something important – something he should know even though she hasn't told him yet.
She takes a deep breath before speaking again: 'I'm pregnant.'
Riley looks up at her with a shocked expression on his face; Rachael has never been pregnant before, so this is new news for both of them. She smiles down at Riley and says it again: 'I am pregnant.'
The waiter comes over to collect the empty plates as Rachael stands up from her seat and takes some money out of her purse – enough cash for their meals plus a little extra, but not so much that he would think they were rich or anything like that. She hands him two twenties before turning back towards Riley who is still staring at the ceiling with his mouth open; she laughs softly as she takes his hand and leads him outside into the sunlight where everything seems normal again – just like it did before their mother died when they were small children together.
Rachael walks past her father's truck without saying anything; he is sitting inside smoking a cigarette while waiting for them to get out of this diner so he can drive them home from there. She looks up at him as she goes by, but he doesn't acknowledge her presence in any way – just like always nowadays whenever they meet each other outside these four walls where Riley has been living since the day their mother died when he was still only five years old.
Rachael turns away from him and walks towards the truck instead; she opens one of its doors with ease before climbing inside next to her father who is already smoking a cigarette there waiting for her arrival like
