puttered when I saw the big spider. The poor kid looked so pathetic lying there with Wealthy's head cradled in her arms and one of her long legs twitching. I grabbed a towel off the bathroom rack, wrapped it around my hand as best I could, and tried to pick up Bites People by the leg.

She was too quick for me, though. She swiveled right into me so fast that she knocked me over. She rolled onto her back and coiled her body in front of Wealthy like a cobra ready to strike. Her eyes were just little black beads with no pupils, but I knew they could see me clearly. 
 `You don't have what it takes to kill me,' she hissed at me. `Now get out.' 
 
 `` You first!'' I shouted. She shook her leg violently and spun a long stream of silk from the corner of her mouth. I stumbled backward as if I were trying to dodge an arrow, but Wealthy had already come up behind me. He grabbed my arm and helped me stand straight again. 
 `` Let's get out of here,'' he said. `We can finish this later.' 
 
 `` Right!'' I cried. But when we were almost to the door I heard a loud bang on the ceiling over Bites People's head. My heart was racing and my breathing came so fast that I could feel it rushing up under my armpits. Wealthy held out his arm for me, but I didn't need any help. I was off like an arrow myself, leaving him to follow me as best he could. 
 
 `We should be safe in the next room,' Wealthy said when we were downstairs and out of sight. `You did a good job up there.' 
 
 `` How come you didn't have any spiders around, though?' I asked him. `I thought spiders liked to hang around in attics.'
Wealthy shrugged as he looked around the hallway. `Maybe I don't like them,' he said. 
 `That must be it, then,' I told him with a smile. He had been so upset about having to fight the spider that I thought we might just start over on the next floor, but now I knew better than ever how important it was for us to finish this project today. 
 
 `I want you to get ready right now,' Wealthy said. `If she's still around when I get back up there, I don't know what we can do.'
`What if you leave me alone with her?' I asked. `I could just kind of hang out there and see what she does.' 
 `N-no,' Wealthy stammered. He was biting his lower lip again as he rubbed the side of his head where Bites People had hit him. I couldn't help smiling at my friend, but then I looked up to see a huge shadow gliding across the wall like a ghost. It was coming toward us! 
 `No,' Wealthy said in a shaky voice. He pushed me back into an alcove and turned around so that he was facing the thing himself. 
 `Okay, okay, I'm going,' I heard him say to it. But just as he started walking away, Bites People swung down from her web with one of her legs outstretched! She landed right on Wealthy's shoulder and put her spider face so close that I could see the beads in her eyes. 
 `What do you want?' she asked him. Her voice sounded like a thousand little fingernails scratching across glass. Wealthy reached up with both hands to push her off his shoulder, but instead of sliding down he was lifted right off the floor. He floated into the air as if somebody were holding a giant magnet under his feet!
`Let him go!' I shouted. `That's my spider! It's my job to keep her under control.' 
 `` What are you talking about?' Bites People asked me in a strange, gargly voice. She sounded like she had something caught in her throat. 
 `Let him go!' I cried again, but Bites People didn't listen to me. Instead she put her leg around Wealthy's neck and began to squeeze! He twisted his head backward so hard that I could see his eyes bulging out of their sockets, but the more he tried to fight it off, the tighter Bites People squeezed.
`She's trying to choke him!' I screamed. `Help me get her off!'' 
 `` Oh no you don't,'' said a familiar voice as two arms came around my waist and pulled me out of the alcove. It was Wealthy, but he didn't have Bites People on his shoulder anymore. Instead it seemed like somebody had replaced him with another little boy! 
 `I know you, don't I?' the new kid said to me. His voice sounded just like Wealthy's, but there was a slight lisp in it that made it sound like he wasn't used to talking much. `You're that guy that talks about spiders all the time.' 
 `` That would be me!'' I told him. I guess I must have sounded kind of surprised because he looked at me and asked, `What's so weird about a kid who likes spiders?' 
 `` Nothing is weird with you guys,'' Wealthy said as Bites People continued to choke the life out of him. Her fangs were dripping venom onto his face, but he didn't even seem to notice it. `I think I like them too!' he cried. 
 `Oh, thank goodness,' the little boy told me. `I thought you liked spiders more than any other kid in the whole world.' 
 `` Well . . .'' I said. But just then Bites People let go of Wealthy's neck and landed on my shoulder instead! She looked at him with her beady eyes, and then turned to me as if we were a team that had worked together for years. 
 `What should we do now?' she asked us. I could hardly believe it. Just as soon as the little kid came along and took over Wealthy's body, he started acting just like my friend did when they were in spider form! He shook his head back and forth and said, `I don't know.' 
 `` Should we fight her?' I asked him. The words poured out of me so fast that I barely had time to think before I spoke. I guess I was just scared for Wealthy, who was still dangling from Bites People's leg with both arms behind his back! 
 `Do you have a better idea?' asked the little boy. He looked around the hallway as if he were thinking about running away. But I knew he wouldn't do that; it would be more like him to try to fight the spider. Wealthy was just playing the part, though. 
 `` What are you going to do now?'' Bites People asked us as she began wrapping a thin strand of silk around her body for safety. `You can't have me! You have too many other kids already.' She started laughing at our confusion and then she spun into the air, leaving us all dizzy in her wake. 
 `` Weird!'' I whispered to myself as I followed after her, but when I looked over my shoulder I realized that the little boy was gone again! It didn't make any sense; how could he just disappear like that? 
 `We're not done yet,' a voice said from behind me. The same voice that had spoken earlier: `You do what you want with your life, but don't ruin mine.' I turned around and saw Wealthy standing there in the hallway next to his real body. He was smiling at me as if he hadn't been afraid of Bites People at all. 
 `` Do you know how to make a spider web?'' I asked him. `Because we need one pretty badly right now!' 
 `Oh yeah,' Wealthy said with a laugh, his smile fading just enough so that I knew he was joking around again. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the stairs leading to our floor. `Come on,' he told me. `We'll go up and talk about it.'

Chapter 7: Spiders in Space

The next morning at breakfast, Bites People came back with us into the kitchen. She was spinning a web off the side of my plate when I started to tell Wealthy what had happened that night, but he stopped me before I could go any farther than `I think we need some spider web.' 
 `That's okay,' Bites People said from her perch on top of one of the kitchen cabinets. She was looking at us with her beady eyes and moving her legs back and forth to make the silk strands twist around each other. `I have some ideas, too.' 
 `` Do
