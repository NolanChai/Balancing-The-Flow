ru observation, I don't have a crystal ball or anything like that.
My ability would only work if there is an earthquake nearby, otherwise it wouldn't work at all. The same goes for the few psychic events I've experienced during my life. It was always when there was an actual event happening in real time. And by a "psychic" event I mean something that couldn't be explained by common sense and logical reasoning, such as some people feeling their house shaking and then it actually did.
I can feel earthquakes coming or on the way before they happen if i am close enough to the epicenter (within a mile is when its easier). It can get very unnerving because I will be able to feel one but noone else in my family can. It does help me sometimes though by letting me know to get out of the area or take shelter before it hits.
I have some dreams that i am convinced are premonitions, which has never failed to happen when they've occured. But as far as earthquakes go i don't think I could stop them if I had a chance, I would only be able to give warning and possibly save lives depending on how much warning it was and how many people were warned (if any).
I have been having these weird premonitions since childhood. I had one that happened years ago, when my family were staying in our holiday home in France, when I dreamt we would all get crushed to death by a huge tree that was growing out of the garden wall at nighttime and woke up and told everyone, only to find they did not believe me. Later that day I went for a walk on my own through some woodland that surrounded our holiday home and there I found this enormous tree growing right out of the garden wall with branches hanging over us in our bedroom (we were staying there alone at night) and when I tried to get upstairs it was crushing me so I had to climb over. The whole thing was very vivid, I could see every detail and smell everything but my parents would not believe me or take any notice.
I don't know about earthquakes because I haven't had any experience in this area but if the premonition is coming from a real source then it would be impossible to stop even if you were aware of it beforehand, as your body will always try and protect itself. I am also interested to know what your feeling is like when an earthquake actually occurs. Do you feel something or does it just happen suddenly?
I can't help but think the last few earthquakes in Japan might be some sort of warning from the Earth herself about nuclear power stations. They keep saying that they are safe, yet Japan keeps having these massive disasters and I wonder if she is trying to tell us something...
Well it would depend on what I was given for a warning...if it was just an earthquake, yes, I think I could. If the dream/psychic feeling was of the scale of an asteroid or meteor strike, no. It's all about how big the event is. The problem with these types of predictions is that they're usually not specific in regards to when and where it will occur, so there are millions of possibilities.
I can only feel them if I am near enough to one (within 10-20 miles). They kind of start out as a little twitching at the back of my head or neck, which then turns into a light pressure that moves upwards and sometimes downward along your body in waves. It's not a painful feeling, just very distinctive. The best way to describe it would be a shaky feeling but one you feel throughout your entire body, from the back of your head all the way through your legs to your feet, and not just at one point like an actual earthquake will do.
I've experienced this sensation twice in my life - once during an earthquake, and then another time when I was driving with some friends a while back. The first time was obviously when the actual earthquake happened, but the other time I was driving down a dirt road in West Virginia. There was no way it could have been caused by a passing truck or something like that as there were no nearby vehicles at all. It lasted for about 15-20 seconds and then stopped, but I wasn't sure if it had anything to do with an actual earthquake as the location was nowhere near where any of them would have occurred in this area.
I don't know how many people out there get this feeling before an earthquake actually occurs though, and if it is something that happens to everyone or only a select few (like myself)...
Sorry for my late reply. I was away from home and had no internet access. I do not have any specific experiences with the Earth's quakes, but in some cases I can feel them coming in advance. This usually comes in the form of an intuition about what could happen to me - I could be feeling unsafe or something like that. In such case I would try to find a way to avoid such an event - e.g. by leaving the area, but this does not always work out.
I am pretty sure that if there was an event big enough for the Earth to give some warnings about it (such as tsunami) then most of us would be able to sense something is going to happen soon. But in many cases we are only able to see things happening right at the very moment when they occur, so I am not sure if there would be any chance to stop them - but still worth a try!
