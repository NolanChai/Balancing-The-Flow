uma possible; each town burning, each village ravaged, each child slaughtered, each family destroyed. The Scorched King was convinced that only his complete and absolute destruction would bring peace. His army believed in this as well, so long as their commander had a strong enough reason for them to keep going.
The campaign began with the usual atrocities of war. The first day after the conquest of the northernmost holdings, the soldiers gathered in the main plaza of the town and set up the gallows where they would hang those citizens who dared resist. They were few. Most had fled the moment they saw the army coming. Those remaining were mostly old men and women, children and infants, some too ill to move at all.
The soldiers laughed as each was brought forth from their hiding places. The Scorched King stood on a small dais near the gallows, watching as each person came before him with a noose around their neck and a rope tied around their hands so that they could not struggle free when it was time to hang them. He would watch as one by one his own soldiers lowered them onto the ground in front of him and then he would nod at them, ordering them hanged.
The first few people went quietly. They were elderly men who had been too ill to resist or flee, and they seemed grateful just to die without any further pain. But the Scorched King was not pleased with this. He ordered his soldiers to gather all of the women from their hiding places and bring them out in front of him one by one, so that he could pick one of them for himself.
The women were terrified as they came before him. Some of them wept silently, but most stood silent and still, trying to hide the fear and revulsion written on every line of their faces. The Scorched King watched each of them in turn, his eyes lingering on the youngest girls until he chose one for himself. He looked up at her as she was brought before him. Her face was bruised and torn from where she had been beaten when captured and now her eyes were wide with terror.
"So, this is the first of the fruits of our victory," he said. His voice sounded like a snarl to those who could hear it. "This woman shall serve me tonight in my chambers. If she performs well I will have many more such women brought to me." He smiled at her as one would look at a dog, or a horse.
She looked from him to the soldiers and back again. She shook her head slightly and then turned away. The Scorched King gestured toward his soldiers and they grabbed her and forced her down to the ground before the gallows. He nodded at them as they began tying her hands, and she struggled against their grip but they were too strong for her.
"You will serve me," he said again. "And if you do well, then I promise that I will have many others brought to me."
She tried to reply but the Scorched King had already turned away from her. He was not interested in what she had to say anyhow. His eyes were drawn toward one of the soldiers who stood there. The soldier was young, just a few years older than the girl they had captured, and he had been staring at her breasts for quite some time now. He looked up as the Scorched King turned around and their gazes met.
"Get your hands off that woman," the Scorched King said harshly. "You think she belongs to you just because I have taken her from her home?" He laughed bitterly. "She is my slave now, not yours." The young soldier stepped back a bit as if afraid he might be struck but then looked at him defiantly. "Do not look me in the eyes," the Scorched King commanded and the soldier had to resist the urge to obey him.
"You can't own her!" he shouted. "She's mine."
The Scorched King laughed again. He was enjoying this. "Who says she is yours?" he asked, and then his smile faded as he turned toward one of his guards who stood behind the soldier. The guard pulled out his sword and in a single motion slashed the young soldier's throat from ear to ear. He stumbled forward for just an instant before collapsing on top of the woman beneath him, dead instantly.
"Now you will never be able to take what belongs to me," he said with a grin, gesturing toward his soldiers as they dragged her away, kicking and screaming in terror. "You would do well not to get your hopes up." The last thing the woman saw of him was the smirk that spread across his face as she was taken away from him, leaving behind nothing but a pool of blood beneath her body.
The Scorched King did not come out again for several hours and when he finally did emerge he looked even more terrifying than usual. The soldiers were already gathering around the gallows and he watched them with interest as they began to prepare another group of prisoners for execution. He stood silent, watching the soldiers hang man after woman, child after child.
He had given orders that all children under the age of five be executed regardless of their gender. They were not even worth his time to take prisoner. As they hung they screamed and cried and begged but there was no help for them in this. Even their parents could do nothing but watch helplessly as each one of their own died.
The Scorched King watched the hangings carefully, smiling grimly whenever he saw a child die especially hard, twisting on his rope and struggling to pull it away from its hands and neck until finally giving up in exhaustion and dying still, unconscious but with no suffering.
"It seems that we have struck a nerve," he said aloud as one of the women died, her body swinging slowly back and forth. The soldiers looked at him strangely, not understanding what he was talking about until he turned toward them and gestured for them to move on with the next person on the rope.
"Their own are suffering," he said when they had all been executed. "This will force our enemies into battle." He chuckled, imagining how they must be feeling. There was no way that they would not fight now. Not after this. "Now we shall have to see if the enemy is as cowardly as their women are," he said and gestured to one of his soldiers who had been standing idly nearby. The soldier began to walk toward a group of men and children, armed only with a club which he used to strike down every adult that stood before him.
The Scorched King watched the blood flow and laughed as the first man died. "You shall not go quietly into the night," he said to them, though they could not understand his words. He gestured for his soldiers to take up their own clubs and follow him but he did not need any encouragement from them. They fell in line behind him without hesitation.
The Scorched King looked at each man who was struck down by the club as he passed, grinning all the while until finally only two were left standing. "Take this," he said, holding out his own hand and one of the men reached for it with shaking hands. It held a golden ring set with a blood red stone which glowed faintly in the light of the full moon above them. The man stared at it as if afraid to touch it and so the Scorched King had him dragged up onto the gallows before him.
The man's eyes were wide and filled with fear, but he was no coward. He looked down into the crowd below him and then back again at the Scorched King. His eyes were like burning coals of flame. "You will not win," he said in a voice which was barely more than a whisper.
"I do not need to," the Scorched King replied coldly. "This is but another battle won for me. I shall have many such battles before my enemies are crushed beneath my heel." The man only smiled as his body went limp, but then he suddenly gasped in shock and horror as a ball of fire shot from the Scorched King's hand and struck him full in the chest. He screamed in agony for just one moment before falling silent, his eyes going lifeless even though his mouth continued to move as if still trying to speak.
The Scorched King nodded toward his guards and they took the ring from the man's finger after he fell down dead. "My enemies are no more," he said aloud for all of them to hear, but they had not understood him anyhow. He turned to leave and the last thing that anyone saw was a fireball which shot up into the sky behind him as he stepped into it, leaving nothing behind but a cloud of smoke and an odor of sulfur in his wake.
The Scorched King knew what he had done was wrong. Even he could not deny that. But he did not care about any of this. Not anymore. The war between Ol and the Scorched King had gone on far too long to do anything but continue now, until only one side remained standing.
The war was beginning to take a terrible toll on both sides. Neither army was in any condition to be fighting right now. Most of them had not even seen a battlefield for months or years and
