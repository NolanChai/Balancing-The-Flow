…
That last day was exactly what God needed. He woke from his slumber and rubbed the sand from his eyes. God lumbered out of bed and stood in the kitchen, bleary-eyed and wondering what to have for breakfast. The fridge door creaked open and he saw nothing but a jar of pickles.
"Ugh… pickled eggs?" he groaned. He turned around with his hand over his head trying to look at the ceiling. God felt something drop onto his finger, then on his cheek. He looked down and saw one of His sons standing there smiling. "Hey Dad!" said Jesus, as He put a kiss on God's cheek.
"Jesus… you startled me." The Lord smiled back at His son. They both stared at each other in silence for a moment before Jesus spoke again. "I thought we could go for a walk and talk about this thing called 'pride,' Dad?" the Lord's only child asked, then added, "You know I don't like surprises…"
The Father smiled, and He took His Son by the hand and led Him outside. "What have you been doing?" God questioned with a grin. Jesus just shrugged and said nothing more as they walked out into the garden. The sun was starting to rise and they were both bathed in golden light. It was beautiful… but not nearly as beautiful as the love that radiated from their faces.
"So what do you think about pride, Dad?" Jesus asked. "Well," God began, "I don't know how to explain this properly since it's so complicated." He paused and looked down at his hands. The Son of Man was walking beside him and waited for Him to continue. "I guess I can tell you what happened from my point of view…" God started again, but then stopped suddenly as he felt a sharp pain shoot up through His backside.
God turned around and saw an arrow sticking out from behind where Jesus had just been standing! He looked at the Son of Man in disbelief. "That was my fault," said the Lord. "I've been thinking about your question all day long…" God said, trying to catch his breath after being struck by the archery projectile.
Jesus reached out and touched His Father on the shoulder gently. The Lord closed his eyes in thanks. It was just then that a voice called from above. "What are you doing?" asked an Angel who had been watching over God since He began creation. "He's fine now…" replied Jesus as he helped Him back to His feet again.
The two of them walked on together until they came to some trees at the edge of a small lake. They sat down beneath one and drank from their water skins before resuming their conversation about pride. After a while, it started raining harder and heavier than ever before in all history…
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men." – John 1:1-5
God is love, and we are loved because He made us in His own image and likeness. It doesn't matter where we came from or what happened before this life began… it matters who you become here on Earth. That is all that really matters!
What did God do the first day after creation?
On the fifth day of creation, God created man and woman in his own image to rule over the world. He also made animals to be their companions and servants. In addition, he planted trees for them to eat from; fruit trees like figs, apples, grapes, olives… You get it?
What did Jesus do on the first day of creation?
Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1). He lived a sinless life and died on the cross for our sins. Three days later, he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven. He is now seated at Gods right hand where he waits for his return to earth to rule as King of kings and Lord of lords!
Did Adam and Eve have sex?
Yes. After the fall of man in the Garden of Eden, they were naked but not ashamed. They had sexual intercourse before marriage because God created them that way - its a part of being human beings who love one another unconditionally without reservation or restriction!
Why did God create the sun and moon?
To give us light during our daytime hours, as well as providing an endless source of energy for all living things on earth today through photosynthesis (a process that converts CO2 into oxygen). The moon also serves another important role: It acts like a giant reflector that bounces back some sunlight so we can see whats happening at night without having to use artificial light!
What did God create on the second day of creation?
God created light by separating dark from bright areas - which then allowed him to see everything clearly during those early days before man had developed eyesight capabilities yet again later down life's path once more after thousands more years had passed since we last saw each other face-to-face once more after all this time away from eachother
What did God create on the third day of creation?
On the 3rd day, He created dry land and sea - so that there would be plenty for animals to eat (fish) as well as human beings who had yet not been born yet because they were still in their mothers wombs waiting patiently until God gave them life first! The Bible says "So God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above it: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven."
What did God do on the fourth day of creation?
On the 4th day, he created the sun, moon and stars - to help him keep track of time throughout his long journey across space-time continuum before getting back here again at some point down life's path once more after thousands more years had passed since we last saw eachother face-to-face once more after all this time away from each other yet again later down life's path once more after another few thousand years had passed since then.
What did God create on the sixth day of creation?
On Day 6, God created humans in his own image - but he gave them dominion over everything else on Earth including animals like lions and tigers as well as bears too! So now we can go out into nature without fearing being eaten alive by carnivorous creatures because they know who is boss around here :)
What did God create on the fifth day of creation?
He created birds, fishes and reptiles - to populate this new Earth that he had just made! It was an amazing sight for him to see his own creation coming together so nicely.
