 
 As I sit on the toilet, I wonder if my mother ever feels the way I do: 
 
 My mother's eyes are red when I come back downstairs from my room. "You were supposed to go to church with us," she says, 
 
 When I try to leave the house a half an hour later, Mom grabs me by the arm and pulls me back inside, 
 
 Mom's fingers dig into my skin as she drags me downstairs. Her eyes are full of anger now; her face is contorted in a way that I have never seen before. "I'm not letting you out of this house until you tell me the truth!" she shouts. 
 
 My mother locks my door and goes back upstairs, leaving me trapped inside our home, all alone with my thoughts. 
 
 A few minutes later Mom returns with an old pink box. She hands it to me. "Go on," she says, "open it." 
 
 The lid pops open easily, and there's a little brush inside that looks like it belonged in the set of a play. It has a round handle, 
 
 When I go to school the next day my classmates are already waiting for me when I arrive. "I heard about you," they say as one. I try not to look surprised. 
 
 For a moment there's nothing but silence. Then Jolene starts laughing, and her friends laugh with her. "You don't know anything!" they all say in unison. 
 
 At recess I sit on the bleachers and watch as the kids play tag. When I see Alexandra run by me, I want to go after her—I always do. But today is different. This time, for once, I let her go. 
 
 As soon as recess ends, Mr. Kinsler pulls me into his office and closes the door behind us. "So," he asks, "what did you tell your mother?" 
 
 The next morning I wake up and realize that it's Sunday again—the day I go to church with my mother every week. But today is different. I won't be going. Today is the first day of the rest of my life. 
# Part One
The Secret of Sleepy Hollow Lane
Chapter One
When I look out my bedroom window, I can see Mom in the garden, tending to her roses. It's a warm summer morning—one of those days where you almost feel like you could lie in the grass and just stare up at the blue sky forever. 
  1. Today is going to be a good day. 
  2. My name is Rachel, and I have always lived on Sleepy Hollow Lane with my mother, Alice. Mom is a nurse at the local hospital and likes to garden in her spare time—she grows roses out front because she thinks they're beautiful flowers that make people happy. She has a lot of friends who come over to visit, especially during the summer months when everything is green and full of life. 
  3. I used to think Mom was my best friend, but lately she's been acting strange—and so have I! 
  4. The day before yesterday was a Saturday like any other except that it was hot outside and everyone seemed to be in a good mood because there were fireworks at the fair later that night. As usual, Mom had gone out early to pick flowers from our garden for her church friends, so I didn't see her until after dinner when she came home tired but happy-looking. 
  5. "Did you have fun with your friends?" I asked her as we sat down together at the table for supper (that was what Mom called it). "Oh yes!" she said enthusiastically, "it was wonderful." But then something happened that made me think twice about how happy my mom really was—she started crying! 
  6. When I asked her why she was upset, all Mom would say was: "I just feel sad sometimes . . ." So after supper we went to bed early and slept for a long time without talking much at all—something we rarely do because we are such good friends! 
  7. The next morning when I woke up again it felt like I had been dreaming about what happened yesterday afternoon but couldn't remember any details except that Mom had cried a lot and I didn't know why she was so sad now . . . But then something strange happened right before school started—someone knocked on our front door! 
  8. "Hello?" called out Mrs. Evans from across the street, who lives next to us with her husband and three kids (two boys and one girl). 
  9. I heard her voice calling for me again as Mom came downstairs in her slippers so quickly that she almost fell over! But before either of them could say anything else, there was a loud knock at the front door, so Mrs. Evans went out onto our porch to see who it was . . . And then I heard my mother screaming: "Oh no! Oh God no!" 
  10. "Rachel?" asked Mom as soon as she came back inside again, "is that you?" But when I didn't answer right away because I was still so shocked by what had just happened (I couldn't believe my eyes!) all she could say was: "Oh Rachel . . . please don't go anywhere!"
Chapter Two
"Rachel?" called out Mrs. Evans from across the street, who lives next to us with her husband and three kids (two boys and one girl). 
  1. I heard her voice calling for me again as Mom came downstairs in her slippers so quickly that she almost fell over! But before either of them could say anything else, there was a loud knock at the front door, so Mrs. Evans went out onto our porch to see who it was . . . And then I heard my mother screaming: "Oh no! Oh God no!" 
  2. "Rachel?" asked Mom as soon as she came back inside again, "is that you?" But when I didn't answer right away because I was still so shocked by what had just happened (I couldn't believe my eyes!) all she could say was: "Oh Rachel . . . please don't go anywhere!" 
  3. I looked up from my book and saw her standing there with tears in her eyes. "Rachel?" she said again, but this time it sounded like an order rather than a request or plea—like maybe if I didn't answer then something bad would happen . . . So even though I didn't really know what was going on yet myself (or why my mother seemed so upset), somehow instinctively I knew that whatever it was she needed me here for right now 
  4. As soon as we got back inside our house, Mrs. Evans came over again and started talking about how nice it would be if Rachel could come out with us later that afternoon . . . But then something strange happened right before school started—someone knocked on our front door!
