asted as sour as that of my former love for numbers. I never excelled at mathematics and yet it remained one of the few things i was interested in, which makes me wonder how I ended up here at all...
It is an odd situation being a private investigator with no formal qualifications to back your claims. The only thing I had to fall back on were my skills of deducing and observing. Not exactly what you would call the best choice for the job, but it was better than sitting in my room doing nothing. I needed some kind of income for survival; i couldn't live off charity all year round.
I stood outside of a cafe in an otherwise empty street. There were no customers and the baristas were making tea for themselves instead of their patrons, they were bored too. The door opened behind me, causing my hand to drop down from my chin which I had raised out of instinctive habit. 
"Are you waiting for someone?" An older woman asked as she walked in through the open door and turned her head to look at me with a puzzled expression on her face. She was wearing a grey tracksuit, which made her seem somewhat like an athlete. I shook my head. "I'm not sure." I answered truthfully, though I felt slightly dishonest because I was lying and she knew it. 
"Have you come to interview us?" Another voice asked from behind the lady. It was a much younger woman wearing a yellow sweater with a blue flower pattern on her chest and a pair of tight jeans that were clinging to every curve of her body. The older lady seemed quite surprised by this, "Jenny! What are you doing here? You said that you would be home by now." She replied. 
"I know mom! But I wanted to come meet your new partner in crime." Jenny answered with a smirk on her face. There was a noticeable age gap between them both, but they were clearly mother and daughter. Their similarities were apparent. 
The older woman frowned and walked over to the counter, taking one of the cups that had been left out for customers and sitting down at an empty stool. She raised her eyebrows in my direction as if she was wondering whether I would like a drink or not, but I shook my head once again. 
Jenny walked towards me with a grin on her face, "I'm guessing you are the new guy?" Jenny said with a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
"Guilty." I replied.
"Mom thinks that we should help him find his feet so he doesn't get lost." She added while staring at me.
The older lady looked at us both with an eyebrow raised. "You want to help a stranger? Aren't you two a bit young for such things?" The mother asked with her mouth turned downward in disapproval, though her voice wasn't angry. 
"That was not what mom meant." Jenny said as she frowned. She had a habit of raising an eyebrow whenever someone spoke to her like that. It made me wonder whether this was some kind of sign between the two of them or if it was just something that they did when talking to others, I didn't think much more on the matter at all. "Mom, you don't need to worry about him getting lost in a crowd." Jenny said as she rolled her eyes and looked at me with an expression similar to hers. 
"You have no idea what is going through that boy's mind right now! I bet he's thinking about whether he should run away from us or not!" The mother responded while looking in the direction of a passer-by who was walking past on the other side of the street. 
Jenny burst into laughter, causing her mother to look at me with a grin and tell me "She's never been serious for more than five minutes." Then she turned back to Jenny again, asking her what made her laugh so loudly. 
"What makes you think that he would be scared of us?" She said in return. It seemed like the two of them had a relationship similar to that between a brother and sister; they bickered with each other but it was clear that there was also much love within their words and actions. 
Jenny's mother stood up from her chair, "I am going to go home and have lunch now." She said in a calm voice while walking towards the door, "You two can stay here all day if you like." With that she opened the door and left us alone. Jenny chuckled as soon as her mother had disappeared into the hallway. "I think I would rather be home with her than here with you, but anyway... what do you want?" She asked while sitting down on the stool opposite to where I was standing. Her body language was quite hostile; she crossed her arms across her chest and looked at me with a frown on her face.
"I am trying to find a girl called Rachel." I said calmly, "She's eighteen years old. Has green eyes and dark brown hair... very beautiful in fact." I added while smiling at her. Jenny seemed slightly taken aback by my response, though she quickly recovered herself and returned the smile. 
"Sorry! It took me a moment to understand what you meant. You mean Rachel, like the girl who went missing?" She asked while leaning forwards on her elbows with curiosity written all over her face. "That's right!" I answered cheerfully, feeling rather pleased that she had found out already; I didn't really expect it but nevertheless appreciated her help nonetheless. Jenny sat up straight again after this response and looked at me for a few moments before asking another question: "How long have you been searching?" 
"About an hour." I said. 
"Why is she missing? Have the police found anything out?" She asked, looking at me with eagerness in her eyes. This was clearly something that interested her more than it did me; either way however, I knew that I should not disclose any information regarding what had happened to Rachel until we had met up again and I could be sure of the security of our conversation. 
"That's not really relevant." I replied without thinking about what I was saying, "It's important to find her though... so I can make sure that she is alright!" Jenny gave me a puzzled look as she continued staring at me before asking another question: "What makes you think that she is in danger?" 
"I don't know really..." I replied, feeling slightly embarrassed for my lack of knowledge regarding Rachel. It was clear to both of us however that we were not going anywhere with this line of questioning and instead decided on changing topic. 
"So... what do you want me to do? What can I help you with?" Jenny asked while looking at me intently, trying her best not show how nervous she was feeling inside. This seemed like it could be one of the most important conversations she had ever had so far in life. She felt sure that Rachel would appreciate someone being on their side if things went wrong; there wasn't anyone else left for them to turn too at this point. "Well... I guess you could help me find her." I said calmly as if it were no big deal, though inside my stomach was churning with excitement. This was exactly what I wanted: someone willing to do anything possible in order for me not only get back home safely but also find out where Rachel might be hiding at the same time! 
Jenny looked at me as if she were expecting some kind of response, though instead she saw only a look of confusion on my face. "What?" I asked while scratching my head in confusion. This was something that had never happened before; it made me think that there must be more to this situation than I first thought! 
"I want to help you find her." Jenny said with determination and confidence written all over her face. She didn't seem worried by anything at all; she seemed confident in herself knowing that if anyone could get through these tough times together it was definitely going to be them! We both smiled before turning away from each other and getting on with our own lives once again, feeling good about having made new friends while searching for something so important like Rachel's whereabouts.
I didn't realise how far I had walked until I saw the building that I was looking for in front of me; it was an old school house which hadn't been used as such for many years now, though there still remained some students attending classes inside at times when nobody else was around or busy doing something else instead. I stopped outside its main entrance and stared up towards the sky above me trying to see if anything stood out but nothing seemed interesting enough to catch my attention so I decided on walking past this place as well, knowing full well that there might not be any answers inside at all!
The building had no windows or doors visible from where I was standing so it felt like an enclosed space; although many things could happen in here they would remain unknown until someone else found them first. This made me feel uneasy about entering but it seemed like my only option right now unless I wanted to give up searching completely which wasn't something that sounded too appealing either! 
I
