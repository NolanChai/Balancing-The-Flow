 links to your photos from the internet straight into my cell phone's camera roll. Now when a friend asks to see pics of my last vacation I don't have to dig through my entire photo collection - or worse - admit that I have nothing.
But it also gives people an easy way to find those pictures and links back to them on the web. Which means, like, 10 times a day I get some random person sending me an email about how awesome one of my photos is (or was). Or asking me if they can use it for a school project (ummm... no). And while most are harmless enough I have to delete the occasional threatening or inappropriate message.
I guess it's too late now. I'm hooked and I need my fix of random internet attention. And if I have to put up with some creepy, stalker-ish email occasionally so be it!
