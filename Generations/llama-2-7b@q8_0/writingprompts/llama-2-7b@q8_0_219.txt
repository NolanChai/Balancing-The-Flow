6:00 pm, had gotten out and it was a mass of people all coming back to their cars after a long day at work. My job? Direct traffic. It was a good gig for my first time.
In between rushes I watched everyone else do their thing, a few times actually stopping to admire the variety of vehicles that came in and out of our lot. At some point, and I couldn’t tell you when since the day had been blurry, I was asked to step inside and chat with a potential employer.
I shook his hand and said hello. He said he enjoyed what he saw and wanted me to call him back if I needed any help in finding a job. I said goodbye and watched as he drove away. A few minutes later my boss called me over.
He asked, “How did you do?”
“You’re hiring?!”
“If you can stay another two days.”
So that was how it began.
