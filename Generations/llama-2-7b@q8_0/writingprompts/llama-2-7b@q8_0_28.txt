"So it's come to this," said Harkon, as he paced across his office with his usual imperious gait. "The end of an era. The final glorious hours before the fall of an administration that wanted only to bring prosperity to a land of misers and civil war." He stopped by his desk to peer out at the city beyond the window, as if to see the signs of the collapse of everything he had worked for since the day he was crowned.
"I was to be their leader," said Harkon bitterly. "Instead I'm left with nothing but my memories and this damned curse. I have a grandson who is as much like me as a worm is like a man. And I am left with this, my city on the verge of collapse."
He looked back at his desk, a pile of papers lying there that was supposed to be a triumphant report of the latest progress in his grand rebuilding project. A copy of The Chronicles lay upon it - Harkon's favourite copy of the book, printed in the first days after he had taken power and unveiled his plan for the new era of prosperity he would bring to the land.
"So it is done," said Harkon, turning back to face the window. "I will not live long enough to see it come to pass."
And so I lay down my pen.
- The Curse of the Vampire, 1328
So it’s come to this.
The end of an era. The final glorious hours before the fall of an administration that wanted only to bring prosperity to a land of misers and civil war. I was to be their leader… instead I’m left with nothing but my memories and this damned curse. I have a grandson who is as much like me as a worm is like a man. And I am left with this, my city on the verge of collapse.
