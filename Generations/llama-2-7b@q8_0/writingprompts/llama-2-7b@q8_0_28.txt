ain't wake up from....
During my first night here, I heard a voice coming from behind me. The sound of it was not human like, more robotic and mechanical. As I turned to see who the voice belonged to, there was nothing there. When I got closer to where it had been coming from, I saw that there were no wires or cords near by. There was no way the sound could've been made artificially...
I don't know why I decided to come here in the first place but I think its because of my best friend, Zane. I'm not sure if he's still alive after everything that had happened to him.. but for now I have to keep on hoping that he is just fine and that when I get out of this mess, he will be waiting for me outside...
I don't know how long I was standing there thinking about the whole situation. In fact, it didn't even occur to me that time could pass. That's how much I was stuck in my own thoughts. Eventually though, after a while, I snapped out of it and realized how late it must be.
I decided then that I would have to sleep in the library tonight since I had no other choice but to do so. As I walked over there, I noticed that someone else was inside studying as well... This is crazy! Is this really happening? Did my mind actually make up these things because it was bored?
The person seemed like he didn't hear me or cared about what I had been thinking... He kept on looking at something. His head wasn't even facing in my direction. When I walked closer to the table where he was sitting, I realized that there was a small box attached to the side of it with some wires leading up from it to connect into his ears somehow...
I couldn't make out what this person's face looked like since all of their features were hidden by dark glasses but still... It seemed kinda creepy when I thought about how they were staring at something without even blinking or moving around..
When I went to sit down next to the box, it immediately started playing music. I guess that's what was making all of those noises before!
I decided to ignore him and just start reading some books instead...
"Hey there stranger!" He said with a smile on his face as he walked towards me. "You seem like you could use some help."
"What? Who are you?" I asked confused by how he knew my name after only knowing each other for about 5 seconds before this.
"I am a student here and your new roommate! I'm Kai!" He introduced himself with an outstretched hand as if to shake mine but instead he just took it without asking permission first like it was nothing.. It wasn't anything bad though since his hand felt really soft...
"My name is Kali and I don't need any help." I told him. "I can handle myself fine, thank you very much!"
