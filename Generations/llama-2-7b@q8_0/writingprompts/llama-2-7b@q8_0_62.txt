ank back into the chair. He looked like any other man, except he had a small tattoo on his forearm that said "G-3" in block letters.

`` Well, I've heard enough about your case. Let me give you my professional opinion.'' The G-man stood up from behind the desk and moved toward her with hands extended. ``I'm not here to convict you, or send you back for trial, nor do I have any plans to do so. I'm simply here to tell you that what you did was wrong and illegal, but also a necessary course of action in your position as an Air Force officer.''

`` It wasn't me! '' Mary tried to shout past the stinging in her eyes and mouth. `` It wasn't my fault! I didn't do anything! He came out on his own...'' The G-man cut across her sentence with a raised hand.

`` Now, now, don't go trying to get yourself off the hook there soldier.'' His expression was no more than polite and Mary was suddenly ashamed of herself for feeling that she had been unjustly accused.

`` I know this will be hard on you, but the facts are very clear. The evidence we have shows without question that the crashed aircraft is yours. It has your serial number stamped on it and you were the only person in the area.'' He stopped to let her absorb these words before he continued again. `` We have the records from the airbase computer that show that the plane took off from there and then disappeared. Also, we have a recording of the radar data which clearly indicates that you flew straight out over the ocean without making a turn or coming back to the base.''

Mary tried not to stare at him but it was all she could think about. If her plane had crashed she knew this man would be able to prove it and he was doing exactly that. Her eyes were burning with tears, but she refused to let them spill down onto her cheeks. He continued his speech.
`` The only question now is the length of time you stayed in that area after your plane disappeared.'' 
 `` What do you mean? '' She asked through a pained throat.

The G-man nodded for him to continue. `` We believe, and I quote myself here, that you spent at least twenty hours in that region, if not longer. That is a considerable amount of time and indicates a serious problem with the aircraft, perhaps engine failure or something of that nature. The question now becomes what did you do in those twenty plus hours?'' He paused to let her consider his words. `` We have no idea, and we certainly don't know where it might be by now. If I were in your shoes, I would be very worried indeed about the safety of that area.'' 

Mary sat there for a few moments, staring into space as if she could see the entire world at her feet. `` That was when I went back to retrieve my weapons and supplies. When I came back it was dark and the plane was still missing...'' She trailed off as her voice failed her and he leaned forward with an eyebrow raised.
`` Now wait just a minute! '' She spoke up loudly, startling him into silence for several moments. `` That's not what I did...'' She was speaking slowly but firmly now, almost stabbing the air around her with her words. `` I went back out to search for my plane after I got back from my supplies!''
`` Now, wait just a minute here, '' he began again, this time in a more aggressive tone of voice and she stood up quickly.
 
 `` That's not what I did...'' She was speaking slowly but firmly now, almost stabbing the air around her with her words. `` I went back out to search for my plane after I got back from my supplies!'' He sat down with a thump and Mary sank into the chair again with her head hanging in shame.
`` Well, soldier, if that's what you did then we have no need of any further discussion. Please stand up and come with me for your transfer papers.'' 
 `` I can't. '' She looked up from her arms which were wrapped tightly around her legs to see his expression changing into one of confusion. `` My plane crashed...I was in the area for a long time...I didn't come back.'' He sat back and considered the words she had said, then he sighed.
`` Well soldier, you certainly do seem to have your own ideas about what happened. We can't be responsible for that and as it happens, neither can I. If we wanted you on trial we would have brought you in by now but we don't want that at all...and we won't bring that upon ourselves if we can help it.''
`` How could I go back there? '' She asked, knowing what his answer would be but desperate to hear him say it.
 `` What do you mean 'go back?' We have no record of the crashed plane being anywhere near where you were...or even in this sector for that matter. It was gone and no one saw anything at all. So if that is true, then there's nothing left for us to investigate except what happened between you and your missing craft.'' 
 `` How can I get back? '' She asked desperately.
`` I don't know. You will just have to ask yourself how...or whether you even want to go back there at all.'' He smiled as he finished speaking, revealing his crooked teeth and then stood up. The G-man extended a hand to her and she took it reluctantly, pulling herself upright with his assistance. `` Please have those papers ready for me when I get down there...and soldier?'' 
 `` Yes sir? '' She responded.
`` Just remember that no matter what you do, you can always count on the Air Force to give you a second chance if it's needed.'' He paused and smiled before turning to leave with her eyes following him until he was out of sight.
