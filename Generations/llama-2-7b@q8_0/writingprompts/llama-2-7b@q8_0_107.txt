 mouth had dried up, my heart was racing, I could hardly breathe! It felt like an earthquake was happening inside of me and I didn't know how to stop it. All I knew for sure was that I wanted to be in his presence and I couldn't stand it one more minute without him, so there we were. 
 
 He had black hair and dark eyes, he was wearing a grey t-shirt underneath a white jacket. I could barely look at him, I could only focus on the lunch menu, on my french toast! 
 
 "What do you want?" I asked him, trying my hardest not to sound like a fool. He had the most beautiful smile I had ever seen and he was smiling at me right now! It felt incredible, it made my knees go weak. 
 
 "I'll have a burger," he said to me, he was so cool, he wasn't going to ask for fries or anything, he didn't even want a soda, just a plain old hamburger! He had such simple taste. 
 
 I asked the cashier for my order and then paid for it with one of the few dollars that I had saved up from my job at the bookstore. That money was so important to me; it meant freedom! It meant that I could go anywhere, do anything, and have fun doing it! 
 
 We ate our food quickly and silently, we were both too nervous for conversation, but when he started walking away I felt like I would die of a broken heart. So I ran after him and grabbed his arm, "Wait!" I cried out as tears began to form in my eyes. 
 
 He looked back at me with those gorgeous eyes and that beautiful smile. There was something about him that made me want to be his girlfriend right then and there. I wanted to take care of him for the rest of our lives, I wanted to love him as long as I could, but I knew he wasn't going to wait for me forever. 
 
 "You can walk away if you like," He said to me in that same sweet voice as before. But when he walked away my heart broke in two and then it stopped beating altogether.
