ats away at my soul.
When I first went to Iraq I was so young and had so much time on my hands that I thought I would die soon. Now, three years later and six months before leaving the country, I am haunted by the things that I see. No matter how many times you go through this type of suffering, it will never become normal to anyone.
I have seen some of the most horrific injuries that a doctor could ever witness. Patients come in with their arms blown off or missing their legs and they are still so happy and alive. Their faces light up when I talk with them and tell them how beautiful their wounds look. There is always something to make you smile, no matter what happens to you in the world.
I don't know who these patients are anymore. I don't even remember some of my patients names or where they were injured. I can see them, though. The people that I have treated have become a haunting presence that still walk among me in my dreams and wake up to every day.
I am a doctor for the military and no matter what I say this is how it is. I am not going to apologize or make excuses but I am here because someone else put their lives on hold to go fight so that we can live freely as Americans. We owe them our lives, even if we don't know who they are.
When I first went into Iraq and Afghanistan, there were times that I would go weeks without a day off or sleeping for more than an hour at a time. As much as people complain about their jobs, I can assure you that no one is going through what we do over here. It's not like the movies where everything happens in less then 30 minutes and everyone has their lives together when they come back home.
Some of my patients have had to be amputated or have limbs removed because there was nothing else I could do for them. Some of these people had to relearn how to walk after having one of their legs blown off by a bomb. Others were injured so severely that they couldn't even move on their own anymore, so they had no choice but to accept the fact that they would never see life without some form of assistance again.
I have seen it all and I can tell you this: I am not going to apologize for anything because this is what we do here in America when we serve our country in war zones around the world, where everyone else has forgotten about us or moved on with their lives. This is just another day at work as far as most of us are concerned; it's nothing special compared to any other battlefield that anyone else might have fought before but it still matters because this is what we do here in America when people put everything aside for something more important than themselves so that they can help others out even if those individuals don't know who they really are anymore either.
There is one thing I would like to add: sometimes, despite all of the suffering and pain, there is still a light at the end of your tunnel. You might not see it now but just remember this, "A doctor in Iraq has seen more death than most people can handle in their entire lifetime." I am proud to serve my country even if no one else recognizes me for what I do anymore because that's okay with me.
I have never been a religious man. I don't believe in any type of organized religion and I don't think there is such a thing as god or heaven. I believe this world was created by man, not some invisible being who watches over us all the time. However, sometimes when things get too tough for me here on earth it helps to look up at the stars above knowing that we were put here to serve one another instead of just ourselves alone like everyone else seems to do these days.
It's hard being alone in your own head sometimes but I think about everything every single day and I try to find some sort of peace within myself so that when other people come into contact with me they don't see the pain or suffering inside my soul; instead, I want them to see only joy and happiness because it's all we ever need in order for things not just exist but thrive.
I think about all this stuff every single day of my life here in Iraq so please forgive me if sometimes you see me looking at myself too hard or maybe even staring off into space without saying a word when really everything inside of me is crying out for someone else who can hear it too because sometimes there isn't anyone left around anymore except those whose lives were taken away from them by war itself, which is why we must keep fighting until one day soon enough we will have won this battle against terrorism once and for all so that everyone else has a chance at living without fear anymore.
