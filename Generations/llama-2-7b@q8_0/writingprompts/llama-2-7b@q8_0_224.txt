alk about the worst introduction in history, though he was sure his companion had meant no harm by it. Still, he could do nothing but grit his teeth and bear it, for what he wanted to say would be uncouth indeed and not only because it sounded like a threat. This woman was young-and she was a woman, that much was obvious-but she also seemed to be well educated enough. She had the bearing of someone who knew her place in society: a lady with manners. Or perhaps not so well educated as he imagined, for there were moments when she spoke too informally for his liking. And now this. He had just arrived at a hellish prison after traveling from his home world to here only to find that he had been mistaken for someone else! It was enough to drive one mad. 
 
 
 `` I do not believe in your God,'' she said, with a laugh that sounded almost gleeful. `` No. What I mean is, I do not believe you are who you say you are. In fact … well, perhaps it is just as well for you to have this beard. It would be terribly embarrassing if someone did see you like this and recognized you.'' 
 
 
 He shook his head, smiling at the absurdity of her words even though he wanted to punch her. Or, better yet, slap her! Of course, a slap was far more likely to cause an outbreak of violence among such hardened prisoners than a smile would be. And what would this young woman do if she did happen to see him in the midst of all his rough companions? She certainly had no right being here at all, and yet it seemed he could not simply order her away even if that were possible-which he knew from experience it was not. 
 
 
 `` …so then you are the one who is going to be our new tutor,'' she said, as though this explained everything. She paused for a moment before adding, with a laugh, ``But I do not believe in your God, either!'' 
 
 
 He stood there dumbly, frowning at her and trying not to smile. She was beautiful. This he knew from experience, as she was one of those rare women who had the kind of face that could be covered with a veil or a wig and still look ravishing. There were many beautiful faces in this world-and they were all around him now! He shook his head again to clear it of these thoughts. This young woman, despite her beauty and her youth (which he was certain was only apparent), did not seem to be the type who would fall prey to such weaknesses as love and lust. She was a serious-minded sort of person, with strong opinions about everything that she said aloud without any need for an invitation. 
 
 
 `` …So then you are the one who is going to be our tutor?'' he asked finally, knowing what her answer would be but pretending he did not know it. He also knew-and this was all he really cared about-that there was no one else in this world to give him an education and so it had fallen upon his shoulders. His heart sank at the thought of it; yet again he was thrown into circumstances beyond his control, with only himself to blame for being here in the first place. 
 
 
 ``Yes!'' she exclaimed, her tone as sharp and clear as a bell ringing out on Christmas day. She sounded very much like an over-enthusiastic schoolgirl who had been told that she would be getting to go home early from class one afternoon because of some special event or another happening at their schoolhouse: something that all the other children were looking forward to but which did not seem quite as exciting for her. He could relate to this, as he had once been such a girl himself, with dreams and aspirations far beyond what most others in his world seemed capable of conceiving or understanding-and these same dreams had led him to the point where he was now: imprisoned by those very people who were trying to bring him up from out of his darkness into their light. 
 
 
 `` …And you are not going to be teaching us anything,'' she said, her tone dropping just enough for it not to sound like an accusation but rather something closer to a statement of fact; and yet there was still the hint of a question about whether he might change his mind before too long. He smiled again-and this time because he knew better than anyone else that they were all going to be teaching one another in this place where no one was any smarter than their neighbor regardless of how cleverly they might have disguised themselves with expensive clothing or fine jewelry or even fancy education; it made little difference here as far as intelligence went because none of those things meant much at all compared to what mattered most in this place: being able to survive amidst all these other hardened prisoners who were fighting for their lives against each other and anyone else who was not like them …
