 and looked down, uncomfortable with the conversation. 
 
 ``We found out that you have a mild case of lupus, which is an autoimmune disease. This means your body has started attacking itself for some reason. It's not serious but you can never be certain it won't become more severe at any time.'' He said this and paused to look around the room, I guess looking for my response. 
 
 ``I understand doctor,'' I say, still trying to control myself from crying. 
 
 The doctor looks back down at me and continues with his explanation. ``There are two kinds of lupus, a mild case like yours where you have minor symptoms that come and go and a severe case where it can attack the heart or kidneys.'' 
 
 I nod again. 
 
 He stands up as he finishes with me. ``You've had a great day today so take care of yourself, alright?'' 
 
 I walk out of his office and down the hallway to my room. My head is spinning from all this new information that has been thrown at me in such a short amount of time. 
 
 I sit down on my bed for a moment as tears roll down my face. 
 
 What's going to happen to me?
