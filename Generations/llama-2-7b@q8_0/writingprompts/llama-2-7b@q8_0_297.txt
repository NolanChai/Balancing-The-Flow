uthanized my sister a couple months ago. I was pretty bummed for a while, but I'm over it now. You can only get so mad at your sibling who is undead and eating people, you know? So yeah, zombies aren't bad."

- "Fuck, fuck, FUCK!" I screamed into the phone. "What do you mean 'dead?'"
"Well, that's what it says on my end, at least. The radio transmission is coming in, but no voice, just music. And now it sounds like it's static, or something."
"Fuck! I'm calling everyone who I know and love, right now!"
- "I know, right?" She replied with a laugh that sounded so far away from me. So foreign. The only thing familiar to her voice was the tone of joy and excitement when she spoke. That's how I knew it was her, before the call dropped out. I felt like throwing up."
- "Well then! You seem to be the best person to contact. Can you come over? It would mean a lot if you could."
"Oh my God!" He screamed in response and hung up on me.
- "I'm not sure what happened, but it looks like the radio is back. Maybe we can get some information from it?" I asked with no real faith or hope that this was going to work. But I knew I had to try."
"Yeah, I think so," I said and got out of bed to turn on the lights in my room. "You want anything to drink? Because I'm pretty sure I can make coffee, or something?"
- "Yes! Thank you!" He replied through gritted teeth. "Coffee is always amazing."
"Okay," I said and went back into my room to get started on the coffee. This was going to be a long night.
- "Okay," I said in response, not knowing what else to say. It was weird how comfortable we were with each other despite having just met. But it felt right. Like he had been here for me this whole time."
