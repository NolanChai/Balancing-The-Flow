ped out onto the street. He turned his head to look back at the store and almost tripped over himself when he spotted her sitting there.
“Wha-what are you doing here?” He stammered as he caught hold of the counter on either side of him before he fell on his face in the street. The girl giggled, a soft sound that sent tingles down Christopher’s spine. It was too early for her to be awake let alone waiting outside a store like this, but she was there all the same and Christopher could only think about what had happened earlier between them. He reached out and took hold of her hand before he lifted it up so that they were both holding hands.
“I’m not allowed to tell you why I am here,” She said quietly. “But you can come with me if you want.” Her words sent another shock through Christopher’s body, the girl was beautiful beyond belief and her smile was enough to make him weak in the knees. He shook his head, unsure of what she wanted him to do but not wanting to let go of her hand either.
“Come on then,” She smiled up at him before leading him out of the street and through a doorway that Christopher didn’t realise was there. “Welcome to my home.” He looked around as they walked into a small hallway, a single step away from the kitchen, and his eyes widened in amazement. “I hope I haven’t let you down,” The girl said as she smiled up at him again, “I was going for something…” She paused and Christopher couldn’t help but stare at her as he waited to hear what she was going to say next.
“A little bit more magical.” Her words broke through his thoughts and he found himself blushing when he remembered the kiss they shared earlier that morning. “Come on then,” The girl said again before leading him into the kitchen, where Christopher noticed a small cage with two large black birds inside of it. “I’m sorry about my birds,” She said as she sat down at the table. “They are very noisy.”
“Don’t be silly,” Christopher replied. He turned to look at her again before realising that he was staring and quickly looking away. She laughed softly, the sound of it filling him with joy. The girl stood up from the table and walked over to where the birds were sitting, reaching out to stroke one of their heads. “They’re very nice,” Christopher said quietly as the girl turned around again and walked back towards her chair.
“Thank you,” She smiled before pulling a chair closer to his side of the table so that they could sit down together. There was another moment where neither of them said anything, both unsure of what to do next but wanting nothing more than to spend as much time with each other as possible. Christopher glanced over at her once more and saw that she was smiling again, her eyes sparkling with mischief that made him want to stay there all night just so he could keep watching her smile like this.
Their meals arrived at the same time which meant that Christopher had to take his plate from the table before he could see what the girl ordered for herself but he didn’t mind because she was already eating hers when he sat back down again next to her. “I hope you like them,” She said as she took a bite out of her burger.
“They look fantastic.” Christopher smiled as he leaned across to take a sip from his coke. The girl giggled softly, something that sent more tingles through him before turning back around so she could finish off what she was eating while keeping an eye on the birds in their cage next door to her kitchen table.
“I think you’ve been awake for quite awhile now,” Christopher said after a minute or two had gone by with them both quietly enjoying the food they were eating. The girl looked up at him before nodding her head slowly as she continued chewing on her burger. She took another bite before looking back at him again, this time with an expression that made his heart race even faster than it was already doing.
“I know,” She replied softly before turning away once more to eat the rest of her food before standing up and walking over towards where she kept them. “I’m sorry I don’t have much left for you.” The birds squawked at him as he walked past but Christopher ignored them, knowing that it was only because they liked him so much already.
“That’s alright,” He smiled at her before picking up his plate and walking over towards where she was standing in front of a small window looking out onto an area filled with trees on all sides. “How long have you been here?” The girl turned around to face him, one hand resting lightly against the glass as she looked back down towards where her birds were sitting on their perch inside the cage next to it.
“About two years,” She replied quietly before looking over at Christopher again with an expression that he could only describe as sadness mixed in with happiness all at once. “It feels like yesterday though, doesn’t it?” The girl said as she reached up and touched her cheek lightly, the gesture sending another rush of joy through his body so strong that he was almost afraid to breathe for fear of losing everything right there on the spot.
“You mean you have been waiting here for me all this time?” Christopher asked in disbelief before laughing softly at himself as he realised what an idiot he must look like with his face lighting up every time she smiled or said something sweet to him. The girl laughed too, her voice filling the room until it seemed as if everyone was smiling along with them both without even trying very hard at all.
“Yes,” She replied softly before turning back around once again so that Christopher could see how much love there still was in her eyes despite everything they had been through together over these past few days alone apart from each other but never truly apart because their souls were always connected no matter what happened between them or anyone else for that matter.
“I’m sorry,” He said after a moment or two had gone by without either one of them saying anything else, the words falling out of his mouth so quickly he didn’t realise what they meant until it was too late and all he could do was hope that she would understand why he needed to apologise.
“Why are you sorry?” She asked in confusion before turning back around once again so as not to lose sight of her birds while they were still inside their cage on either side of them both eating the food they had left over from yesterday’s meal. “I don’t understand why you feel like this right now,” Her words filled him with joy, making him want nothing more than to be able to look into those eyes again so he could see everything that was going through her mind as well as his own.
“Because…” He said softly before taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly until all that remained were tiny little puffs of air escaping from between his lips, “I don’t want to leave you.” The words hung in the air for a moment or two before falling back down onto themselves so he could catch them as they fell from her eyes, making him feel like an idiot again for having said something that was true but shouldn’t have been said at all because it wasn’t what she needed to hear right then when everything between them felt like nothing more than a dream come true.
“You can stay,” She smiled as the birds squawked loudly enough for him to hear them over his own heartbeat, “I promise.”
