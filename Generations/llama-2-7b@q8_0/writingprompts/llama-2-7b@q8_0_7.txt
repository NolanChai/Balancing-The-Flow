 He smiles warmly and sits down on the bed beside me, `` How are you feeling today?'' I try not to flinch at his touch as I smile back, `` Not so bad Doc, just a little tired and sleepy but otherwise fine.'' 
 
 The Doctor pauses for a moment before continuing, `` You're doing well Will, much better than we thought you would be honestly. It's remarkable how quickly your body has begun to heal itself now that it is no longer under the influence of the virus and the infection from your wounds have been cleaned away.'' 
 
 I smile as he speaks, `` You're not just saying that are you?'' He shakes his head before continuing, `` I've been a doctor for many years Will, but even I'm still impressed by the rate at which your body seems to be recovering. The scarring on your stomach is already starting to fade away, and there have even been a few improvements on other areas of your body.'' 
 
 I pause for a moment before replying, `` Well it's not like you've had much practice at this Doc...'' 
 
 He shakes his head as he chuckles lightly, `` Oh but that is where you are wrong young Will. Despite your doubts and questions, there have been many other cases just like yours in the past, and while most of them did not survive beyond a few days at the most, I was able to save one particular young man who had almost no chance of recovery.'' 
 
 My eyes widen as he continues, `` He was only four years old Will, but even after being bitten by a vampire on his neck and suffering many more injuries in an attack he was still left with a chance to survive. After we brought him here, I used the same methods you have been using to treat yourself over the last few days as well as some experimental ones that are not available elsewhere, and within three months time he was already almost completely healed.'' 
 
 `` That is... Amazing!'' I reply with a wide grin as my body begins to tingle from head to foot, `` But how? How did you do it Doc? He didn't have any special abilities or anything like that, so what was it?'' 
 
 The Doctor shrugs his shoulders before continuing, `` There is no easy answer for that Will. While I had a fair idea of the correct course of treatment based on my research and previous experience with other cases like this one, even I did not expect such an incredible recovery to be possible. But there is only one way we are going to find out...'' 
 
 He stands up from the bed as he continues talking, `` Well Will, now that you're feeling a little better, it would seem only fitting for me to introduce you to the rest of my family. It has been a while since I have seen any of them and I can think of no better time than right now!'' 
 
 I nod as he reaches down to pick up his coat from where he had left it on the floor, `` Of course Doc. Where do we go first?'' He chuckles warmly before replying, `` We're not going anywhere yet Will... Your family has been waiting for you in our home since early this morning.'' 
 
 The Doctor turns to leave my room with me following close behind him as he continues talking, `` I am sure they are just as excited to see you as I am Will, so don't disappoint them now!'' With that, he opens the door and steps out into the hallway before turning back for one last look at me with a smile. 
 
`` Good luck... ''
