 my sister’s voice, yelling at me to wake up. That was the first time she ever raised her voice to me.
The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed, alone. A nurse walked into the room and tried to be comforting by telling me that my family had come to see me. It didn’t matter because they were gone. The door was closed for good. There wasn’t any more visitation allowed.
I didn’t understand what was happening to me, but I knew it would change everything forever. I tried to scream, but nothing came out of my mouth and my tears turned into hot ash. Even so, the nurse kept repeating that things would get better and she was right because they did.
The day after the ECT, I woke up in a room full of women dressed all in white. They were staring at me as though I had no humanity left inside me and I tried to scream again but nothing came out this time either. The nurse led me to a table where she hooked up some machines. They started asking questions. They wanted to know what my name was and how old I was, but I couldn’t tell them anything because of the mask they were forcing me to wear.
After that, everything happened so fast. They put me on this big needle-filled bed and then they turned off the lights. When it got dark inside the room, I felt like someone had poured a bucket of cold water over my head. The only sound was their voices whispering to each other about what they were going to do next.
I heard one of them say “inject.” Another answered with “yes” and then all went silent again. A few minutes later, the woman came back into the room with a smile on her face. She told me she was glad I was awake. I didn’t know if this was good news or bad because I hadn’t been able to tell them anything they needed to know about myself yet and that seemed like it could have serious consequences later down the road when everyone else found out what happened next: how my family had abandoned me when I needed them most, how no one believed in me anymore except for these women who wanted nothing more than for me to be their little girl forever.
It’s been a few weeks since the ECT treatment and I can’t get it out of my mind. It was so scary! They said they were giving me anesthesia, but when I woke up on the table with these women standing over me in white coats staring at me like they wanted to cut off my head and put it in a jar for display purposes only, my heart started beating so fast that I thought it might explode right out of my chest.
The first thing they did was ask if I remembered who they were from previous sessions we’d had together before this one where everything went wrong because nothing went according to plan like how everyone usually does things around here when you’re doing something bad without even thinking twice about it even though maybe deep down inside somewhere beneath all those layers of lies and deceit there is still some goodness left over from what used to be called “the old days” before everything changed into something else entirely different now that nobody seems able or willing enough anymore nor does anybody seem too interested in changing things back again either since everyone seems completely satisfied with where we’re currently living right now anyway which honestly feels like an eternity ago when you think about how long it took me just for them to get around to doing anything at all after I’d spent days on end waiting for someone else’s approval before even getting started working on my project!
