20-foot python, and none would ever come close to containing a 20-foot python.
He got up from his desk, went into the kitchen, poured himself a glass of water, then returned to his office. He sat on top of his desk facing the door as if he were waiting for someone who never showed up. After an hour he stood and stretched. His biceps ached where he had fallen from the window.
The phone rang.
B was startled by this intrusion into his private space, which he had taken great pains to secure. He picked it up on its third ring. "Hello?" He heard a loud inhalation of breath through the receiver, then the sound of someone gasping for air. This was followed by silence so complete that B could hear the air whistling in his own ears and the soft tick of his office clock.
"You're in my office," he said finally, "and you've called me three times." He hung up.
The phone rang again, almost immediately afterward. B had to cover the receiver so that the other party wouldn't hear him yell and drop it. As soon as he did this, another call came in. He slammed down the telephone. The receiver didn't make a sound. There was no dial tone.
"B?" It was the voice of Lester. "B, you there? What's going on with you?" B thought he heard laughing and talking in the background. A man shouted out something that sounded like "You assholes!"
"What is it, Lester?" B asked calmly. He had taken his foot from under the office door to prevent it from being jostled open by the person on the other side.
"We've got a problem," said Lester. There was silence for what seemed like a long time, then he whispered in an urgent voice: "Don't let them see you."
B frowned as if trying to understand a foreign language.
"You want me to come there?"
"No!" said Lester. "I can't do that! But we've got to get out of here quick, so I have to take care of myself first." B heard a man yell: "Hey, assholes, what are you doing down there?"
A woman laughed. Then someone shouted, "Don't open the door!" Another voice said: "He's in the office. We can see him through the window." B heard one of these people say something about a snake, and he had no idea who this person could be.
"Where are you?" asked Lester.
B held up his hand.
Lester shouted again. Then there was silence. "I'm in 301," he said finally. He hung up. B sat at his desk with his back to the door, waiting for an attack that never came. When five minutes passed and nothing happened, he went into the bathroom.
B had never seen anyone as thin as Lester. His skin stretched tightly over bones that appeared fragile and could have been broken by a strong wind. There was a yellowish cast to his face and neck, an indication of how little food or sunshine he got. He wore an old pair of khaki shorts with holes in the knees, but no shirt, only a thin strip of white cloth tied around his waist like a loincloth. The skin of his chest was stretched tightly across prominent ribs, and B saw that his belly button had been removed. He appeared to have an upside-down mustache above the place where it should be on his lip.
He was not surprised to see Lester in such a deplorable state; he had known for years that this man was unhealthy. When B first saw him, he had been wearing only underpants. He sat with his knees drawn up so tightly against his body that the backs of them were resting on his thighs and calves, as if they might break loose from their moorings and fall off.
"Where's your clothes?" asked B. Lester pointed to a small bedroom, which had been converted into a closet by being outfitted with several rods on the back wall for hanging clothing.
Lester looked around and saw the large box that he had used as a desk when he worked in this office. He went to it, opened it, and took out what appeared to be a small suitcase full of clothes: blue jeans, white shirts with buttons down the front, black socks, a pair of shoes that looked like running shoes, a jacket made of some thin material, a baseball cap. "I'm not going to take my clothes with me," said Lester, placing them on B's desk and looking at him quizzically as if this were the most incredible thing he had ever heard in his life.
"How much money do you have?" asked B. He wanted to know how much was available for a bribe.
Lester took out his wallet from one of the pockets of his pants and handed it over. It held four twenties, three tens, five fives, three ones, and two quarters. "That's all I have," he said. He was not able to answer B's next question: How much money did he need for bribes?
"Don't worry about the money," said B. "We're going to go through your apartment together, and we'll take only what you can afford." Lester nodded, as if he had heard this before and was relieved that someone was taking care of him in his time of need.
B put on jeans and a shirt with buttons down the front. He looked around his office for something to use as a weapon. When he saw what appeared to be a rolled-up carpet underneath the desk, he picked it up. It was heavy but soft in places where the weave had come apart from wear; the threads were loose and some of them were missing altogether. B stood with his back to the door so that he could see through the small window if anyone came into his office, then he went around behind Lester and tied a piece of string around his neck as a noose.
When they got into Lester's apartment, B placed him on his bed and made sure all his arms were pinned to his sides. Then he took the carpet from underneath the desk, rolled it up so that its frayed ends stuck out like horns, and wrapped this around Lester's neck until it touched his chin.
B felt bad about hurting someone who looked as sickly as this man did, but there was no choice: he had to make sure they got away from the building alive. He went into Lester's closet and took out a small bag of money that he placed on top of some clothes on his bed.
"That should be enough," said B. "Now we have to get rid of the body." He turned around to find that Lester was gone, as if he had simply vanished into thin air. The carpet that had been wrapped around him lay on the floor in a heap. B walked over and picked it up. There were several large holes in its side where the string had broken through.
"I'll take care of this," said Lester, appearing behind B. He took the rolled-up rug from his hands. "We can't leave him like that." He unwrapped the carpet and placed it on the floor where he had been lying. There was a small piece of string hanging down from his neck, but this didn't bother him at all: he knew where to find another one if necessary.
B looked into Lester's eyes for some kind of understanding between them as to what had just happened or was about to happen, but saw nothing there that resembled human thought or emotion. It was as if this man were incapable of either. He had no idea how long he would last out here before dying from exposure and hunger. Lester had been told this many times—and believed it completely—but he didn't know what to do about it except to continue doing whatever B ordered him to do: find a place for them to stay; take care of the body; wait until dark, then go outside so they could see where they were going.
Lester led the way from his apartment to the stairwell. He stopped at each floor and listened carefully, but didn't hear anyone walking around or coming up behind them. They went down the stairs one at a time, pausing every few steps to check if they had been followed. There were no other people in the building, nor was there any sign of life anywhere: no lights on; no sound from below or above.
B and Lester emerged through the lobby door without encountering anyone else. They stood by the sidewalk for a moment before crossing the street to a public park where they sat down at one end and waited for nightfall, which came quickly in this time of year. As soon as it was dark enough that they wouldn't be seen, B and Lester got up from their seats and started walking again. They took several blocks until they reached a parking garage; then they went inside to get a car.
