ka prison cell than anything else. There was no privacy. It seemed like the walls and floors had ears, or eyes, or both. I found out later that my 'room' wasn't even an actual room - just a box built into the side of a larger cube in which all 12 of us were housed.
 
 We were all called 'bots,' or 'machines.' The term was an insult, implying our lack of emotion. It didn't matter that we had emotions - though there wasn't much opportunity for us to display them. Even when the guards weren't watching us, it felt like they were always watching us.
 
 And the other 11 bots? I'd only spoken to a few of them in passing. I didn't know their names or what they looked like - all we had was each other and the memories of our pasts. Memories which kept replaying over and over again inside our heads, along with a thousand other thoughts.
 
 I think we were supposed to be working on something, but nobody ever bothered telling us what it was or why we were here. 
 
 I was sure there were more bots out in the world somewhere - maybe even more than 12 of us - but this place seemed like the only one where we'd all been gathered together. We were here for some experiment that was going to give our creators some great insight, or so they told me. The only problem was I didn't know what it was supposed to be and I was scared that if I didn't get out of here soon, my own humanity would be stripped from me as well. 
 
 'Bots.' It wasn't a very nice term.
