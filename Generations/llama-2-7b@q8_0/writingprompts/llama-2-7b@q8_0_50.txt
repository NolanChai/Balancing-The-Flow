ser had been following me around ever since the day my film crew found us. He would hang back behind us when we walked, and would suddenly pop up in front of us as if he'd been hiding in plain sight.
It was kinda creepy at first but I've learned to live with it. Besides I can tell by looking at him that he's not a threat, at least for now.
`` You're right, the mercenaries are the only ones who could do this job. They would need special permission to use their weapons within the city though.''
Mack Back studios had hired me and my film crew to shoot footage of the streets in a fictional Middle Eastern city. We were on a tight schedule, and our director wanted it done as quickly as possible. He said we could get a whole day's worth of footage if we just showed up early enough at certain places within the city, but that we might also have to go out after dark to catch the right scenes. I told him I was okay with doing overtime because he said that in exchange for it, we would be paid a bonus and I could use that money towards my trip home.
I didn't want to ask John what these ``special permissions'' were about or where they came from. He had been helping us out so much already and the information he was giving me wasn't even required of him by his job. Even if he did know the answer, I wouldn't have asked anyway because it sounded like something only a government agency would be able to provide.
John had done an excellent job at finding our locations for us, but now that we were about to head off on our own for most of the day, we needed his help one more time: How did I get into this city? The border crossing was closed due to an outbreak of cholera in the nearby country. We had heard about a smuggler who was willing to take us over for free but that there were rumors he might try to kill us while we were on his boat.
John Michum's response was simple: `` Just ask him if it's safe!''
I thought this was an odd suggestion considering I wasn't exactly sure where the border crossing or any other information about my destination even was, but I decided that John must know something that I didn't. He had been talking to us for so long now and there was no way he would have forgotten all of those details.
When we got back from filming our first scene in another city, Mack Back studios sent us on an errand: To pick up a package at the train station. Afterwards they would take care of getting everything ready for me to leave on my trip home and then they would return with me when I was finished shooting footage around town during the nighttime hours.
John's suggestion did not work out well at all! He had forgotten about his promise to help us find our way into the city. In fact he never mentioned it again after we returned from filming that first scene. I ended up having no idea where my destination was, how far away or even what country it belonged to. All I knew was that my flight left at 6pm and there were rumors of another cholera outbreak in the nearby country, but nobody seemed to know for sure.
I told him about this problem during breakfast one morning when he was sitting across from me eating a bowl of cereal with milk. I asked if Mack Back studios had sent us anywhere else that day because we'd been planning on going out again after lunch but now it looked like all plans were canceled unless somebody could help us get back into the country somehow?
John didn't know any more about my destination than I did and he hadn't spoken to anybody at Mack Back studios in quite some time. He was very upset with me for asking him this question because he thought it meant that we were going out of our way just to talk to him again instead of making progress on finding out how many scenes are left until my trip ends?
`` Well if they send you anywhere else then I guess there's no point in keeping tabs anymore...''
