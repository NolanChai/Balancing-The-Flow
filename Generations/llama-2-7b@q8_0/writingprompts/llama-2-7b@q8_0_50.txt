 much?''
Camila looked at me in horror, and we both laughed.
That's what I mean by being an intimacy specialist: having a conversation that changes someone's world view. I help people change the course of their lives simply by asking different questions, because all you have to do is ask a few simple questions and your life will begin to take on a new shape.
In fact, if you don't like where your life is right now, try asking yourself the following questions:
1. Do I know *exactly* what I want?
2. Have I taken any action toward achieving that goal recently? If so, was it effective? What steps do I need to take next?
3. Is this something I will regret not doing when my time is up on the planet?
4. Am I happy with where I'm at right now?
5. Do I have a plan B for if things don't work out how I want them to? What are my options in that case?
6. Is what I'm working toward aligned with who I am today and who I've always wanted to be?
7. If I were to die tomorrow, would anyone notice or care?
If your answers are not yes, then you have an intimacy issue (and that's a good thing - it means there is still hope!). And the good news is that this situation can change very quickly if you know how to ask yourself better questions.
