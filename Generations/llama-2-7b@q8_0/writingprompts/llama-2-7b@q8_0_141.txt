bove me hung two black crows, staring at me intently as I stared at the Orb.
I’ve never had an interest in magic or any such supernatural nonsense, so this was quite a surprise to say the least. As far as I could tell, the Orb didn’t seem to be attached to anything else, and was floating just above my head. The crows seemed to notice me too; they started moving around me in circles and then flew away, cawing loudly.
As soon as they left, the green light of the Orb pulsed rapidly for a few moments before fading out completely. I couldn’t believe it! It had been there one moment…and gone the next! I waited several minutes to see if it would return, but it never did.
The Orb was mysterious and intriguing, yet I knew that I wouldn’t get any answers from it-so what was the point? The whole thing seemed like a dream; something I had imagined in my sleep.
I got up to leave, and as soon as I moved away from the spot where the Orb hovered over me before fading into nothingness…it reappeared! My heart raced with excitement at what might happen next-but no, just like that it was gone again.
