 he can remember; this is how it feels when the time has come to decide, to say yes or no.
He stared at the doorway of the building. In the darkness beyond lay the waiting room where he had spent more than half his life, and beyond that was the open reception desk, where his wife stood smiling in anticipation; a smile that began when she saw him standing there, and went on until the moment he came inside.
'The decision has to be made,' he said at last, to no one in particular. He had known this for months but he hadn't been ready to acknowledge it. Now he was. Now he could admit that he needed help. This wasn't the first time his wife had taken him there and he knew that she wouldn't make the journey again without a guarantee of results.
He took off his hat and walked slowly through the doorway, feeling like a child who has been called to school for the very first time. He couldn't look at his reflection in the mirrored wall but it didn't matter. It was what lay behind him that was important: his life; everything he had ever done and everyone he loved. His wife took his arm as he came through into reception, gently reminding herself of her power over this man who could never understand how lucky she was to have married him.
'You will be okay,' she told him. 'I promise.' And as they walked down the corridor and up towards his therapy room she saw that he did not believe what she said, but neither did she care: he would come back from this with a new lease of life. She had seen it happen before; he would be restored to her just like every other time.
# _THE THERAPY ROOM_
'Tell me about your family,' the therapist said, making notes as she spoke.
He looked at his hands and shook his head. It was an automatic gesture that served no purpose but he could not stop himself from doing it. The therapist waited for him to say something but he didn't respond, instead sitting in silence. After a moment the therapist checked her watch and smiled gently; this would be easy enough.
'I don't think you have anything to tell me about your family,' she said eventually, 'but perhaps we can start with what happened after your mother died.'
He nodded but didn't look at her.
'I know that it was a very hard time for you; you were just fourteen and this was your first experience of death. Do you remember how it felt? What happened?'
Again he shook his head, the motion almost imperceptible, as if the movement itself would keep the answer away from her. He wasn't sure where to start, or even what to say. She waited for him to speak but there was no point in asking: she had seen this before and knew that it wouldn't happen today.
She watched him for a while, letting the silence hang between them, but he still did not look at her. Instead he stared straight ahead into space; somewhere distant where he didn't really want to be. This was how he liked things; he preferred to stay out of sight and out of mind. It suited him perfectly well: it gave him the illusion that there was no need for him to change, that life would continue as before without his interference.
'I'll take a break,' she said, rising from her chair. 'We'll resume in ten minutes.' She smiled and walked towards the door, leaving the room empty again: just this man and his thoughts; just him and his memories; only him and the past.
# _THE THERAPY ROOM (2)_
It had been three years since he first started coming to see her for therapy but it felt like a lifetime ago that she'd found him crying in the waiting room. She had asked him what was wrong, expecting nothing more than an explanation of how difficult life could be at times and how hard it was to get things right, but he told her there was nothing he needed to talk about; all he wanted was to lie down on the couch and not say anything at all.
She had taken a quick look around his office before sitting down opposite him on one of two chairs positioned either side of the couch. The walls were covered in paintings that she had bought from art galleries for reasons that were never explained: they didn't represent the way he wanted to remember himself, nor did they reflect how he saw life as a whole; but they provided a pleasant backdrop for their conversations and allowed him to feel that there was something special about the place in which they met.
He had been a patient for two years by then and had begun to notice the things he could not control: his ability to be happy, his propensity towards violence when he felt threatened or frightened, even how easily it was for him to think that everything bad that happened was somehow his fault. He could not help himself but believe that nothing would ever go right as long as he lived; that there were so many things in life that he couldn't do and never would be able to: the only way forward was through her.
She had asked him what made him unhappy, trying to think of a starting point for their work together, but he didn't know how to answer the question. He knew that something bad happened to his father when he was younger; he had seen it happen and he remembered every detail perfectly: where they were standing in front of a building, what his father said, what followed next. But he did not know how those events made him feel; whether or not they had changed the way he felt about himself.
He was silent for most of their sessions, answering all her questions with simple nods and shakes of the head, and by the end of each week he would leave without saying a word; neither thanking her for her help nor apologising for his bad mood that day. And when she asked him about his father's death or his mother's illness he told her that they were both the same: it didn't matter what had happened to either of them, because nothing would ever make a difference anyway; not now, and probably never again in the future.
His wife was happy with the way things were: she liked seeing him smiling when he came home from therapy every week; his demeanour was more pleasant, less guarded than it had been before. She knew that there would still be times when he fell into a rage for no reason but the episodes had become fewer and farther between: if anything they seemed to be under control now.
'There are a lot of things I have seen in my time,' she said, as she entered his room on their first day together; 'a great deal of anger and sadness and pain, but never before has someone made me think that everything is pointless.' She looked around the room; the paintings and the books and the photographs: all things he had chosen to fill up a space which he did not really need. It was his way of making sense of things, of proving that there was more to life than just what he saw in front of him.
'I want you to leave,' he told her after she finished talking; 'this isn't anything like I thought it would be.' She looked at him for a while and then started to turn towards the door but stopped herself before moving, wondering if this was a good idea or just another part of his game.
'You can't leave now,' he said, interrupting her thoughts; 'this is what you came here for: to tell me that I'm doing things wrong.' He laughed, not because he found anything funny but because this was the only thing left in him that could keep him alive.
She stayed where she was and waited for him to continue his story, or at least offer some explanation of why he had come here on the first place. She was afraid that she might never find out what had happened in his past; if there were things she needed to know but which he would not reveal. But then again this wasn't really about finding out what he was thinking, or trying to make him understand: it was more an exercise in control: taking back some of the power that had been lost when he was younger and forcing him to do something that he had always done very well on his own.
'Do you know why we are sitting here?' she asked him after a while; 'it doesn't have anything to do with me, does it? I didn't come into this room looking for answers. You did.' She looked at the floor and waited for him to tell her what he wanted from this session: whether or not they would be able to find some way of making him feel better about his life.
He nodded; 'I know,' he said, finally talking again after so many weeks in silence, 'but I can't get it right.' He thought that perhaps she might laugh but when she didn't say anything he began to wonder if he had misinterpreted what was going on and if all this time they had been doing the same thing.
She could see where this conversation was heading: nothing she said or did would change his mind about how things were. He knew that it couldn't go any other way: not now, not ever. But he kept talking anyway; as if there might be some possibility of a breakthrough, something to make the whole process worthwhile.
He told her what had happened when they first met in his mother's house on Christmas Day
