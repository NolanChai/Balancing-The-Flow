ulogy, while my friends stand in a silent vigil around me. A woman weeps uncontrollably by my side.
I try to get up on one elbow, but the pain is too great, and my body doesn't respond. I am still alive, but I won't last much longer...
Suddenly it all comes flooding back: the mission, the ambush, my friends in peril, the sniper.
I have only one thing to say before the end.
"YOU FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!"
The story behind the making of this song:
The band is named for the lead character in the 1975 novel, "A Clockwork Orange," by Anthony Burgess. The book deals with the subject of violence and free will - specifically the question of whether humans can be held responsible for their actions if they are psychologically conditioned to carry out violent acts. I wanted this to be a song that sounded like it could have been written in the 70s, yet still had the feel of a modern death metal song.
The lyrics deal with an unnamed character who is shot in the back by an unknown sniper while on patrol (a reference to the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy). In his dying breaths, he has one last thing to say about the sniper. The theme of "free will" came from a recent debate I had with my girlfriend where she claimed that our minds are just chemical reactions in the brain (this is basically the brain-in-a-vat argument made by Descartes), and we have no real choice over what we do - it is all determined by chemicals in our brain.
The name of the band is a reference to the Russian saying, "What's good for the goose is good for the gander." (i.e., what one person does another should be allowed to do.) I used this phrase as inspiration for writing lyrics dealing with issues like sexism and racism - but you don't have to be a Marxist-Leninist to appreciate it!
The "Rape of the Female Body" is a reference to how women in certain countries (namely, Saudi Arabia) are often subjected to rape by men in power. In this case, it could be interpreted as referring to either female genital mutilation or forced marriage - both common practices among some Muslims that I find repulsive and disgusting.
The lyrics to "Genocide" deal with the Armenian genocide (1915-18), which is one of the worst examples of human rights violations ever recorded. It should be noted that the genocide was committed by Turkey against its own people - not some foreign invader as it often seems to those who haven't read any history books about this topic!
The lyrics "You are the reason why" deal with how people are quick to blame others for their problems, yet rarely take responsibility themselves. In other words: don't be an idiot and try to solve all your problems by attacking someone else instead of trying to improve yourself first (as it was said best in one of my favorite songs called "Motivation" - which I wrote with some friends back when we were all living together in college).
The lyrics deal with how the world has been shaped by conflict throughout history and will continue to be so until there is peace. The song ends with a message of hope: that one day, we'll have no more war - only peace!
