10000, was finished with his epic battle, Garth Gatorade would take his place on top and rule this world for all eternity.
He began the final countdown. As he counted down from 3 to 1, he heard a small explosion behind him. He turned around to see what had caused it only to see an old man in overalls looking at him with a grin on his face. Garth Gatorade was confused and upset at this point for the old man would have been dead years ago if not for the power of Zac Rocket.
*He must be a secret agent from the government, sent to take me out! No one can beat Zac Rocket! I’ll just kill him* Garth Gatorade thought. He jumped at the old man and began punching away when suddenly he felt his face being grabbed by the same hand that had been holding a glass of water for years. The old man was pulling Garth Gatorades head down into the glass, filling it with liquid.
“What is this?” asked Garth Gatorade as the old man started to pour more and more water onto him. “The secret government plot? Nonsense! This must be some sort of…” Garth Gatorade thought before he was finally drowned by his own stupidity.
*I should have known better than to trust an old man.* The old man said as he dusted himself off. *And Zac Rocket, I’m going to tell you right now that he is not the chosen one of 10000. No, that title belongs to me!* The old man said and began laughing hysterically.
