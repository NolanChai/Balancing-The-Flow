lices were cut and distributed. This wasn't a typical birthday celebration. My birthday fell on Ash Wednesday—the first day of Lent, when many Christians give up something that is dear to them (I was once told this included alcohol, chocolate, or coffee). It meant we didn't get cake until after Easter, and the fact I would have to wait for it made me miserable.
My family has a long tradition of celebrating birthdays with cakes on Ash Wednesday morning before going to church services. My mother would spend hours in the kitchen making cookies and candies for this ritual—even if we were all getting older, she was convinced we still needed treats to mark our special day. But my father did not agree. He was a devout Catholic who followed the traditions of the church, including Lent. My mother's baking skills were put to use only for holidays such as Easter or Christmas and the occasional birthday.
I had no choice but to eat the cake my parents brought me that morning and enjoy it while I could; after all, I knew there would be a lot of penance involved in Lent.
In Christian tradition, Lent is a time of sacrifice for believers who observe this period before Easter. They give up something they love or feel strongly connected to as a symbolic reminder of the suffering Jesus experienced on his journey toward crucifixion.
But my parents didn't just participate in the traditional Christian practice; we had our own special rituals, which I was expected to follow with my brother and sisters. My mother prepared all the food for Ash Wednesday night, including a feast of dried fruits that she served at a table set up in our living room.
My siblings and I sat in one chair as the candles burned in front of us. We placed our palms together and sang "Happy Birthday" before eating our birthday cake and desserts. The children in my family then gathered at a table that was set up in another room. Here we each held hands in prayer, recited the Lord's Prayer, and prayed for the sick and suffering around the world.
Lent began on Ash Wednesday evening—a night of penance. I felt sad as my parents took turns placing a small smudge of ash on our foreheads that we were expected to keep on until Easter Sunday, when it would be washed away in water during church service. As the eldest daughter, I had to take on more responsibilities than my younger siblings. This year, as I got older and bigger, I also carried a special cross made of wood that we all wore for the next forty days. It was too heavy for me to hold comfortably, so I let it dangle around my neck as I walked. The other kids followed suit, with their own small wooden crosses.
As Lent progressed, our lives became more difficult than usual: We had to abstain from eating meat on Fridays and were only allowed one meal a day that included vegetables and fruits (usually two for the older kids). My mother prepared a special soup in a large pot—a mix of lentils, beans, cabbage, and other root vegetables cooked together. We would sit around a long wooden table for dinner, where we'd eat with our hands from big plates filled with food.
After the meal, it was time to pray. My mother knelt in front of each person as she recited Bible verses and then asked us to repeat them after her. We did this for about fifteen minutes before sitting down at another table that had been set up for our evening snack: a large bowl of warm milk with pieces of bread floating on top, which was called a _pane di luna_.
The next morning came my favorite part of Lent: Mass in church. On Sundays we were not allowed to eat until after the service, so we would go early and stay for several hours. During these services, I loved watching my father at the altar with his white robe and red cape over him. He was a man of many talents, but it seemed as though he had been born to be a priest.
When Lent ended on Easter Sunday morning, we gathered in our living room to listen to recordings of traditional Catholic hymns that my father had made himself. We listened intently and sang along with him while he played piano or organ. The house was filled with the sound of music as we celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
The last week of Lent is called Holy Week, which includes Maundy Thursday (the day before Good Friday). This was our busiest time in terms of church services: On Thursday night we had a special service called _Sacramento della Cena_ , during which the priest would perform the ritual of the Last Supper. The following morning, my father celebrated Holy Mass at our local parish while my mother cooked an elaborate meal that included homemade pasta and sauces made from scratch using fresh tomatoes picked from a garden in our backyard.
On Good Friday afternoon, we walked through town carrying crosses made out of wood with nails sticking out of them—the very same kind used to crucify Jesus Christ on Golgotha. We stopped at each house along the way and rang a bell as people came out onto their front porches or opened up shop doors so that we could give them blessings for free, which was part of our tradition.
Finally it was Saturday evening—Holy Saturday! My mother had spent all week preparing our family's traditional _pasta e fagioli_ (pasta and beans) meal, while my father prepared a special dessert called _colomba_ —a cake made from yeast dough shaped like a dove. We celebrated Easter Sunday morning by going to Mass together as one big family before coming home to enjoy our delicious feasts!
My childhood experiences with Lent were not so different than those of other Catholic children in my small town, except for the fact that we were lucky enough to have a very religious mother who was always ready and willing to help make sure everyone had an amazing holiday season—one filled with lots of love and joy!

# The Birthday Party
My first birthday party happened when I turned seven years old. My mother made me a cake in the shape of a mermaid, which was my favorite character at the time (I still have that cake in storage). She had always been good at decorating, and she didn't want to disappoint her daughter.
We also played Pin the Tail on the Donkey, but it wasn't like today where everyone gets one shot at it. My mother made sure we took turns pinning tails onto a donkey cutout that was hung on our living room wall. Then my sisters and I each got to have our own go.
I remember feeling so special when I had my turn—but not just because of the game itself: It felt amazing to be singled out in such a way, especially as an only child with no siblings!
My parents also threw me a birthday party at their friend's house, which was really more of a social gathering than anything else. We played games like Truth or Dare, and I got asked some embarrassing questions about what happened behind closed doors in my family (I wouldn't tell).
The adults drank beer and wine while the kids got ice cream cones. My mother had made sure to ask the hosts if they would like us to bring anything specific, so we showed up with a birthday cake (this time in the shape of an angel), pink balloons that read _Happy Birthday_ , and some party favors for everyone who was present.
The only thing missing from my birthday party was my father; he didn't show up because he was too busy working on his new book, which had become a best-seller.
Later in life I asked him why he didn't make it to my birthdays when they were growing up—and this is what he told me: "I knew how much you loved your mom and sisters, so it felt wrong for me not to be there with them on these special occasions."
My father's absence was something that bothered me a lot as a kid, but over time I realized just how lucky I was. He wasn't present physically at many of my birthday parties or school events (he worked a lot), but he was always there mentally—and emotionally too!
Whenever we would get together with our extended family for holidays like Easter and Christmas, I used to feel so special because everyone would be looking at me while they talked about what had happened in their lives recently. It made me feel like they loved spending time with _me_. And that's what really mattered most—not whether or not my dad was there on these occasions!
I knew he cared deeply about all of us, but he just couldn't always be physically present because his job required him to travel. This meant that sometimes it took weeks before he could make it home from a business trip abroad; however, when he did return, our lives were filled with joy and laughter!
It wasn't until years later that I finally understood
