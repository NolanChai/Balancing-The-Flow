 He'd started to stand up but was pushed back down by the woman, who's name he learned she was Helen, and not some random girl in an alleyway. Helen took his hand and pulled him to his feet, looking into her eyes she seemed as surprised at being alive as he was. 
 
 `` Jeb? Is that what you told her your name is?'' 
 
 He nodded and she turned to the other three men sitting in chairs along the far wall of the alleyway. They were all dressed in long, black robes with hoods drawn tight over their heads. The man closest to him looked up at Helen who was talking to them, `` Do n't tell me you don't know?'' 
 
 `` No. I 'd forgotten.'' 
 
 He knew it was a lie as soon as he said it. 
 
 She nodded and motioned for him to come closer. 
 
 `` Jeb, these are the leaders of this group called ' The Order' '' 
 
 `` The Order?'' 
 
 Helen smiled at that, `` Yes. This is a secret society, one that I have been a part of since my early teens. We're here to help you understand what has happened to you and to assist you in getting back home.'' 
 
 Jeb shook his head in disbelief, `` And you 've only known this for the last thirty-six hours?'' Helen nodded. 
 
 `` How can I believe any of this? '' 
 
 She stepped closer to him and whispered in his ear. 
 
 `` This is my real name Jeb, just as it was when you were alive.'' 
 
 Jeb stood there dumbfounded for a moment before he asked the question that had been running through his mind since waking up. 
 
 `` I 'm dead?'' 
 
 Helen nodded again and smiled, she reached out and touched his face and began to trace her fingers along his skin. 
 
 `` It was a car accident Jeb. You were unconscious for four days before you came around. We thought we'd lost you after your injuries.'' 
 
 He shook his head in disbelief as Helen continued to touch him, it felt so real; he could feel her skin under his hands and smell the scent of her perfume on her neck. But that was all an illusion, he knew. This was a dream or some sort of nightmare. 
 
 `` I can't believe this'' he said as tears began to stream down his face. Helen wrapped her arms around him and held him close as she rocked him back and forth like the mother that she'd never been. It was all an act; she knew it deep in her heart but couldn't bring herself to stop. 
 
 `` I 'm sorry'' Jeb said, looking up into her eyes. His lips parted slightly as he tried to say something else but his words were lost before they could escape his mouth. He leaned forward and kissed her gently on the lips, his tongue exploring every inch of her mouth as if trying to capture it with his own. 
 
 She pulled away slowly and stared into his eyes. 
 
 `` Jeb'' she whispered. 
 
 He nodded and smiled, `` I know'' he said with a chuckle. The other three men looked at them in surprise, `` What's so funny?'' the closest to him asked. Helen stepped away from his grip and walked over to where they were sitting; she looked down at one of them who was now speaking up. 
 
 `` I 've seen enough of this Jeb'' he said, looking into Jeb's eyes as if daring him to try something stupid again, `` And you're going to tell me what it is or we all have a problem.'' 
 
 Helen turned and stared at Jeb for a moment before turning her gaze back to the man in black. He stood up quickly and walked over to them and whispered into her ear; she smiled then nodded slowly as if coming to some kind of conclusion. 
 
 `` I 'm sorry.'' he said, his voice deep but calm. Helen stepped toward Jeb once again and took his hand in hers. She turned back around and faced the men sitting in chairs. 
 
 `` You will leave us alone now?'' she asked them as she pulled him away from her side; he looked at her for a moment before nodding slowly and letting her lead him out of the alleyway. Helen turned to the man who had been speaking and pointed towards one of the other buildings that surrounded them on two sides, ``That's where we sleep'' she said. 
 
 He nodded as he got up from his chair and followed Jeb and Helen into the building. The three men sat there for a long moment before the closest to them spoke up again, `` I can 't believe it. We all thought that this was some sort of nightmare or just wishful thinking on her part'' 
 
 His two companions nodded in agreement as he continued speaking, `` But she was so calm about it and kept saying that they were going to help us get out of here. I mean how could anyone be that wrong? '' 
 
 The other two men looked at each other with disbelieving eyes before shaking their heads in silent unison; then all three stood up, turned towards the street and walked away from the alleyway.
