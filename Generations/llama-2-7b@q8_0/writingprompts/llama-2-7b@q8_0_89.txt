 (or get married for some women) your eyes will change to purple if you are not claimed by a pack of wolves. This is called "becoming'' - in other words, becoming prey to the wolves who have now taken on the role as their guardians.
After one has become, they live their lives under strict rules and regulations, with punishment for disobedience or death. The human race relies on these wolves to protect them from rogue vampires, werewolves, and other foul creatures of the night. But when a pack is broken by tragedy, they begin to wonder if they're better off dead...
Inspired by Greek Mythology and set in a post-apocalyptic setting, Aletheia follows 2 girls who discover that the world they knew has been a lie their whole life. While searching for answers about her sister's death, she stumbles upon a new society where humans are considered to be livestock instead of prey.
The more she learns about this secretive group known as Aletheia (the Greeks' word for "truth" and the name given to these people), it becomes clear that humanity is far more complex than she ever realized.
There are a lot of interesting and unique aspects to this story, including the idea of using animalistic shapeshifters instead of vampires as our main antagonists in order for them to be less predictable and easier to sympathize with when compared to other mythological monsters who tend to behave like mindless killers.
It also explores how humans will use technology in ways that are both beneficial but potentially destructive at the same time - something we see happening every day nowadays thanks to social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook which have been known to cause mental health problems among users due their addictive nature combined with an overwhelming amount information being shared online all at once (which can lead someone down a rabbit hole).
As for my own personal opinion on this book? Well let me put it this way - if you're looking for something different from your typical "teenage girl meets vampire" type story then I would highly recommend giving Aletheia by Ashley Lavering a try because chances are that once started reading about what goes down between these two girls living separate lives until they cross paths again thanks fate or whatever else forces them together then chances are good enough where if anything else happens throughout their journey through this dark fantasy universe together!
The main characters of the book are Aletheia, a young woman who is trying to find her place in this strange new world; and Cassie, an ordinary girl that just wants to live a normal life.
Aletheia was born with white eyes (in other words "not claimed"), while Cassie has purple ones (meaning she's become). When these two girls meet at age 18/20 they form an unlikely friendship based on their shared experiences as outcasts from society due to the way their bodies look.
Aletheia is a strong-willed woman who stands up for herself and those around her when they need it most; however, she also struggles with self-doubt which causes her insecurities about her appearance (especially after seeing how other people view them). Cassie is more reserved than Aletheia but still loyal enough to do whatever needs doing without hesitation because of this bond between them - even though neither one understands why it exists!
The world in the novel is a dystopian future where humanity has been turned into livestock and guarded by animal-shapeshifting predators. The author uses Greek mythology to create an interesting story about how people would act if they were forced into this situation, but she also brings it all together with modern technology such as social media platforms or even things like video games so readers can relate more easily than before!
