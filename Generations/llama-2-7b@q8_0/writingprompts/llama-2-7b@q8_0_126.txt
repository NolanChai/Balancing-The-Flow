aking in a hot kitchen with no windows, but her nerves were still twisted tight enough to make her stomach gurgle. She was tired but she needed to be alert. This last debate might decide how the entire election played out and it was critical that she won.
She had made a lot of enemies during her tenure as President over the past few years. Some called her too aggressive, others claimed she wasn't forceful enough. She had taken some unpopular positions but it all felt right to her. She was the first woman president and she didn't want to be remembered just for that. She wanted to make history as an effective leader and help guide America into a new era.
She knew that her opponent was watching her, waiting for her to slip up so he could exploit it in the next day’s media coverage. The President was younger than she was but more seasoned on the campaign trail, having previously run for vice president and then as governor of his state. He had been an ally of hers early on in their careers but now they were enemies, not to mention political opponents. He would do anything he could to win this debate so that it would help him secure the election.
The President's face was almost hidden by a heavy beard and long hair which gave his appearance an air of mysticism. His eyes were dark brown with flecks of amber in them, as if he had been watching her for some time, waiting for just the right moment to strike. She knew that he had his own plans for the election but she didn't know what they were.
The President was known to be a man who didn’t like to lose and had shown aggression on numerous occasions in both personal and professional relationships. He had made enemies all over Washington D.C., even amongst those closest to him, including his wife who had left him for another politician with whom she had an affair.
The debate would be moderated by a neutral party but it was clear that the President's campaign manager had been given the task of preparing questions which he would ask throughout the two-hour event. He had been given access to all information about both candidates and their views on issues so it would be difficult for anyone else in attendance at this final debate before election day to throw anything off guard or catch either candidate unaware.
The President's manager was a well known political figure who had previously run against the current Vice President in a Senate race where he lost by only 2% of votes cast, but now they were allies again and working together to try win back what they both believed could be their rightful place as leaders within Washington D.C..
Mrs Dunbar was trying desperately not to think about how she had gotten into this situation in the first place; it had taken her years of hard work, dedication and determination but here she stood now at just weeks from election day facing off against someone who might beat her fair or foul.
She knew that if she won today then chances are high that he would not try again in four more years so perhaps this was an opportunity for both parties to move on from what had become such a bitter rivalry between them both over recent months, but it seemed unlikely given how much at stake there really was.
Mrs Dunbar stood up straight with her hands clasped together as if praying; she hoped that God would guide her through this debate so she could come out on top and win reelection as President of America once more despite all odds being stacked against her ever since her opponent began campaigning earlier this year.
As the moderator approached the stage, he was met with an almost audible sigh from Mrs Dunbar who knew that there would be no escape now that they had finally made it to the final debate before election day itself took place next week. It seemed like so many months ago when she first ran for President against her current opponent but here we were again; debating over everything under sun - except maybe their personal lives which was something neither wanted revealed during this televised event where millions would be watching from all over America and around the world too!
The moderator stepped onto his podium and began speaking, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's final presidential debate before election day next week. I am (name). My job here is not only to provide you with information about both candidates but also ensure that there are no personal attacks or insults thrown back-and-forth during this event so please remember that we are all part of the same democratic society who must work together for our future."
The moderator paused for a moment before continuing, "Now let us begin. Mr Dunbar and Mrs President thank you both for coming today." The room erupted into applause as each candidate walked up onto their podium; they shook hands firmly but didn't smile at each other which seemed strange considering how long ago they used to be allies working together towards something greater than themselves.
Once again Mrs Dunbar took her seat while Mr President waited until everyone had finished clapping before he sat down too - both looking serious despite their past friendship being put aside for this debate alone where anything could happen!
