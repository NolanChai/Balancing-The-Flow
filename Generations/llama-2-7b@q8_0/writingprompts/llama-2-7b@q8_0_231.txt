# The First King

The first king was named Mighty Olaf, and he ruled for three days and nights. He came with a huge army from the skies, led by his son, who carried a great sword. And indeed the lands of the sea had never before seen such an army; its warriors were unlike any that the people of the sea knew, their skin was gray, and they moved faster than the winds themselves. 

But King Mighty Olaf did not take possession of all the land. He agreed to settle on a small piece of ground for himself and his son, as long as he could have everything else. It took the people of the sea two years to recover from this terrible shock; they were forced to trade with these invaders, and many gave up their freedom without realizing that it was being taken away. But finally the people realized what had been happening, and decided to fight back. 

The leader of the revolt was named King Bold Eric. He led his army against Mighty Olaf's men, and with the help of many others he managed to kill all but three of them. The king and two of his warriors were taken captive; one was killed by a small boy who threw a stone at him. 

King Bold Eric ruled for some time after that, and then passed away, and King Long Nails took over from him. He had been an ally of Mighty Olaf's before the war. But when he saw how strong the people were now, he knew it would be hard to maintain his power without fighting; so instead he agreed to let them govern themselves. 

The first thing that King Long Nails did was to send out a proclamation saying that anyone who wanted land could come and claim it. This gave rise to many new kingdoms, some of which were ruled by the descendants of Mighty Olaf's warriors. And so for centuries afterward the people lived in peace, even though there were still differences between them. 

In time King Long Nails died as well, and his son took over. His name was King Gorgeous George, and he ruled for many years until finally dying at a very old age. After this no one knew what to do; they could not agree on who should become king next. So eventually King Long Nails' grandson took power instead of King George's son. 

King Gorgeous George was succeeded by his cousin, King Big Mike. He ruled for quite some time before being overthrown in a coup d'état led by one of his warriors named King Randy. But even after that there were still disputes about who should take over; finally it turned out that the people wanted to have elections instead of having kings, and so they elected their first leader democratically. 

The first leader was a man called President Long Hairy Legs. He had long hair which he wore tied up into two braids; this made him stand out from other men in those days when everyone wore short pants or no pants at all. In time many more kings followed, and they ruled for several years until finally someone decided that the best thing to do would be to let everyone decide how they wanted their own country to be run; so the first republic was born! 

In this way the people of the sea grew stronger, and were able to stand up to those who came from afar with greater ease than before. As for King Mighty Olaf's army, they finally left after being defeated by one of his own men named King Randy; he killed them all but for one man who managed to escape back home. The only other thing we know about him is that he was known as 'The Lone Wolf'. 

And so it came to pass that King Long Nails' son took power, and then passed away without having any children of his own; this meant that no one knew what would happen next. But the people were able to find a way out of their predicament, and they decided instead to have elections for kings again—and so it came about that King George became king once more! 

In time another man named President Long Hairy Legs took over; he was followed by others until finally someone else named King George became king yet again! This time around there were no disputes over who should rule next because everyone agreed to let people choose their own leaders—so that's how it all started, and now we know about how things went back in those days when men fought with swords instead of guns.
