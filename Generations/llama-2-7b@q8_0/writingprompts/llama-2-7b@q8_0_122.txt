ge-bathed and cooed over and fussed over. My life was very good.
When my father came home from the war, things changed for me. Before he went off to fight with the United States Army in Vietnam, I had a pretty normal life for an immortal child. After his return, I lost everything except my mother. She was left alone to raise four children on her own. My older brothers were gone, off serving in the U.S. Navy and Army respectively. One had died in a car accident before he could finish college. My sister was left behind in Vietnam because of that war.
My father’s return from the war changed everything. I was five years old when I became an orphan. The day he came home, my mother called him to tell him his youngest child was missing and had been gone for two days. He rushed over to find me on a park bench surrounded by men who were trying to get me to say where I belonged.
My father recognized me instantly. I knew him, too, even though he did not remember me from the time before the war. In the end it took years of therapy for my mother and siblings to really be able to live a normal life again without constantly seeing someone they loved missing and dead in their minds.
The first night back in his house was like something out of a horror movie. I don’t remember much about it other than there were lots of screaming men who would not let my father touch me. I know that is what made him take me from them, but I also know they did not want to leave without taking me with them. I remember the pain in his eyes as he carried me through their ranks and into the house.
When we finally got inside, he placed me on the couch, then walked away. He said that if I needed anything I was to call him. There were noises in the background of screaming men breaking things downstairs, so I waited for them to get louder before calling my father’s name again and again. Each time he would appear from behind me and walk back down to whatever was going on. Finally, after many repetitions, he returned upstairs and held me in his arms until the men left. He said that they were not friends of his and that they did not need to know where I lived anymore.
I’m sure they found my father later because it didn’t take long for him to leave again on a mission to find my brothers. This time, he had me with him. We spent three years in Europe, mostly France, living as far from civilization and immortal men as we could get. It was nice.
But my father did not know when his service was up and when it ended there were no more places to hide. There were also no more people to hide us from. After that war, the world knew about mortals who lived with immortals and it had changed how they acted toward one another. As a result we moved back to America where my father bought his first house in Chicago and raised four children on his own as best he could.
But by then I was no longer the cute child everyone liked because of her age, but instead an awkward teenager with a face that had grown older than she expected and body parts that were still not developed beyond those of a nine-year-old. There was nothing my father could do to make up for what I had been through, other than love me unconditionally like he did.
I wasn’t sure if it would be enough as I moved into the hallway outside his room with the rest of our family. He lay on his bed and moaned as pain shot through him. His wife was in the kitchen crying, while my brothers waited by the front door. They were all looking at me expectantly, waiting to see if I would do something other than just sit there and watch them all.
I had a lot of questions for Father, but I didn’t ask them right then. Instead I walked over to him and sat on his bed next to him, my arms wrapped around his chest. He could feel the pain I was feeling. He knew I wanted to make things better by helping him get well again. But we both knew it wasn’t possible.
I hugged him tighter, whispering that everything would be okay as long as I was with him. He just held me and did not move or speak for the next few minutes. When he finally spoke he said “I have always wanted to grow old like you.” The look in his eyes was pained but it was also peaceful.
“I know,” I whispered. “You always told us that we could go wherever we wished to when we got older, and now that the time has come, you don’t want to leave me.” It broke my heart knowing he didn’t want to die alone in an old person’s home with no one around him.
“I know,” I repeated, “but what about Mother? How can we help her?” My mother would be devastated when she woke up and found Father gone forever. She needed us now more than ever before.
Father sighed as if he was very tired from all the pain. “There is nothing you or anyone can do for me except make sure that my children have a good life without me.” I knew he was right, but I wanted to disagree with him so badly that it hurt inside my chest. I thought about arguing with him and trying to change his mind, but I could tell from the way he spoke that there was nothing more we could do for each other. He would not be swayed by anything I had to say.
I stood up next to his bed and said “Father, if there is something you need me to do while your body fades away into dust, then tell me.” My voice cracked with emotion as the tears ran down my cheeks. I felt like he had let me down for the last time.
He sat up straighter and looked at me sternly. “Don’t worry about me,” he said in a raspy voice that sounded like it was coming from someone who had not spoken for years. He knew his death would affect us all deeply, but he didn’t want us to dwell on what we could no longer change or stop him from doing. Instead, he wanted us to concentrate on the things in life that made us happy and satisfied with our existence as individuals and a family unit.
I nodded my head and smiled weakly at Father while I stood there staring into space. My heart was broken by this time of my father’s death because it reminded me too much of what had happened when Mother died two years ago, except that time she didn’t have any warning signs beforehand like he did today.
I felt helpless again as I watched Father die in front of us all with no one able to do anything about the pain or suffering he was going through while our mother lay there crying on her own bed across from his room where we had gathered together so many years ago when they were both alive and well.
The final moments passed quickly before I realized what Father meant by telling me “Don’t worry about me.” It wasn’t a warning or an instruction to keep silent. Instead it was just another way of letting us know how much he cared for us even if we didn’t always show him that same love and appreciation in return.
I cried harder than ever before as I realized that Father had finally let go of his mortality once again, but this time there would be no more chance to say goodbye or tell him anything else important because he was already gone forever. My heart broke into pieces when I thought about how much my father loved me and all my siblings too much to want any of us to feel sadness after he died, so instead he asked us to do something for ourselves before we left his side forever: remember him fondly even though you may never see him again in life.
I nodded and told Father one more time “Thank you” just as if I were saying it for the first time because although our family had been through many difficult times together since Mother died two years ago, I still loved my father very much despite everything we’d gone through during those past few months without him around us all day long like he used to be when we lived with each other in one house instead of four different ones throughout the city where our family grew up together before moving out on their own after graduating high school or college respectively.
As soon as Father heard me say thank you, he smiled at me with his eyes closed tightly and whispered “I love you so much.” With that last word coming out of his mouth like a kiss from heaven itself, I knew for sure that everything was going to be okay now since Father finally got what he had been waiting for all this time – peace.
The day my father died, the sky looked very dark and dreary because it reminded me how much pain there is in this world sometimes even if you don’t know about any of it at first glance like I did during those early days after Mother passed away so suddenly last summer without warning anyone around her what would happen next or why. But now that my father has left us behind forever, everything seems brighter than ever before because we all know exactly where he went off to go live again with God up above where no one can touch him anymore once they’ve crossed over into heaven itself just like how Father wanted things for himself when he finally let go of his mortality completely last night after watching over us from above our house forever without saying anything else important until today when
