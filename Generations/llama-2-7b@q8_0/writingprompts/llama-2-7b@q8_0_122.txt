 In perfect and unison 
 Their rhythmic beats incessantly pound 
 Hindering any peace of mind. 
 Clocks do not care if you suffer, 
 Nor if you wish for relief from the torture they bring; 
 They only count the moments that pass by, 
 The time it takes to get through each day and night. 
 But when clocks are set free from their chains, 
 And we no longer have to be slaves of our brain, 
 Time will never again become an annoyance or pain; 
 But rather, the precious seconds, minutes, hours that you share with your loved ones.
