38 minutes late.
`` I'm sorry I'm so late.'' Pete said apologetically as he stepped out of the stall and leaned over to hand Shelly a half-full bottle of champagne from his coat pocket. `` Here, you take this, I want to save some for my friends.'' He said, taking one last look at himself in the mirror before stepping into the crowd that had formed outside in front of Shelly's parents' house.
`` Where were you?'' She asked, accepting the bottle with a smile and walking toward her car.
`` It took me awhile to get over there.'' He said with a grin. `` I'm not 10 anymore, ya know?'' He added, winking at her. `` I got lost in traffic, and then it rained and...'' His voice trailed off as Shelly opened the driver-side door of her car and slipped into the passenger seat, shutting the door behind her.
Pete sighed to himself as he walked around the outside of the party crowd toward his friend's house, wondering where in hell the rest of his friends were.
It was a strange feeling for him, not being able to find anyone to talk to at Shelly's birthday party. He looked up and down the sidewalk, hoping to spot any familiar faces but saw nothing except people who had come with her, including her parents. `` They're probably in the house having a little adult time,'' Pete thought to himself as he walked back toward his car.
As he got closer, he could hear laughter coming from inside, and he knew that the adults were entertaining themselves quite well. The sound of the party grew louder as he reached the front door, and when he opened it to step in, he was hit by a wall of music and conversation so loud he had to hold his ears for a few seconds before he could hear anything again.
As he stepped through the crowd toward the bar, Pete could tell that the party had already been going on for several hours. The air inside reeked with cigarettes and alcohol, and every conversation was being screamed over the music pumping through a dozen speakers set up throughout the house.
`` Hey, what took ya so long?'' His friend's wife, Liz, shouted into his ear as he walked toward her. She looked at Pete in surprise before pulling him down onto one of the bar stools beside her and handing him a drink from one of several bottles sitting on the counter.
Pete leaned back against the bar stool, trying to catch his breath and his balance at the same time as he drank down half the glass of beer she had given him. `` It's been a long night.'' He mumbled. `` Where are all my friends?''
She smiled knowingly before looking over toward the crowd in front of her. `` They're probably all in the kitchen, huddled around the television, watching football or something.'' She said, as she handed Pete a full glass from one of the bottles on the counter.
`` You and Shelly seem to be having fun.'' He commented.
Liz sighed before shaking her head in disgust. `` Not me, I'm stuck here.''
Pete frowned at his friend's wife as she turned around to take another drink from the bottle beside her on the counter. He knew that he was missing something here... but what?
`` Hey, Pete! Over here!!'' His friend shouted from somewhere in the crowd. `` Come on over, I want to introduce you to someone!''
Pete looked back at Liz for a second and then down toward his feet before getting up off of the bar stool with a smile and starting toward where he had heard his friend's voice coming from. The music was loud enough that it was nearly impossible to have a conversation, but Pete knew his friends well enough to realize that they would find some way to yell if one of them needed him.
It took several minutes for Pete to make his way through the crowd, and by the time he found his friend and his new friend sitting in the kitchen, he was nearly out of breath from all the yelling and pushing. `` Where's Shelly?'' He asked, as he sat down on a stool next to them.
`` She got tired after dinner, so I sent her home,'' His friend explained. `` So now it's just us boys!''
Pete chuckled at his friend's explanation and then leaned back in the stool, resting his head against the counter behind him for a moment while he caught his breath again. The newcomer, who was introduced to him as Brian, smiled at him and took another swig from the bottle of beer he had been drinking since Pete arrived.
Brian seemed like a nice enough guy - if a little rough around the edges for Pete's taste -- but it wasn't long before his friend started complaining about how Brian didn't understand the game he was watching and that he had never met another football fan who was such an idiot. `` What are you, retarded?'' He yelled at Brian as he threw down another swig from the bottle of beer in his hand.
Pete rolled his eyes as his friend went on for several minutes about how terrible it was that Brian didn't know which players were on the field, and then he stopped to take a long drink before shouting `` Do you really think I'm that stupid?'' at the man beside him, who had been sitting quietly through the whole thing.
`` What do you mean?'' Pete asked as his friend turned around to look at him.
His friend's eyes widened in surprise and then narrowed into a suspicious glare, but he didn't answer right away before turning back toward Brian with an exasperated sigh. `` Oh, never mind!'' He said loudly, throwing down another swig of beer as the other man sat quietly beside him for several seconds before saying anything.
Pete noticed that the man sitting next to his friend was much younger than either he or Liz, but they both seemed friendly enough, and Brian appeared to be pretty good company despite being a little drunk already. He wasn't sure what exactly it was about Brian that made him feel uncomfortable, though -- other than the obvious fact that he seemed a little too interested in Pete himself.
`` So what do you think?'' His friend said suddenly to Pete. `` Do I need a refresher course on football or... '' He paused as he looked over at Brian and then back at Pete, who nodded and shrugged his shoulders at the same time while looking down at his hands on the counter in front of him.
Brian's eyes followed where they had gone as he leaned forward in his seat, staring at them both curiously for several seconds before he spoke up again with another question. `` Do you think I need help?''
Pete looked over toward Brian once more and then back at his friend, who seemed to be considering the offer. His friend nodded as he glanced around the kitchen one last time before turning back toward Pete with a smile on his face. `` Yeah! Let's do it!!'' He said enthusiastically while standing up from where he had been sitting and walking over toward Brian, who smiled in return before following him out of the kitchen and back into the living room area.
Pete stood there for several seconds, watching as they left the house, before turning around to walk back through the crowd until he found Liz. She looked at him curiously when she saw where he was going, but Pete just smiled at her and walked over to sit down next to her again while she leaned back against the bar with a sigh.
`` Well?'' She said after a few seconds of silence between them. `` What's up with you and Brian?''
Pete shook his head in response before taking a swig from the bottle on the counter next to him, which he had almost finished already. He wasn't sure how much more he could drink tonight anyway -- especially after watching his friend get drunk enough that he couldn't even stand up straight anymore!
`` I don't know... '' Pete mumbled as he took another drink before glancing at Liz, who was staring back at him with an expression on her face that made him uncomfortable. `` It's nothing... just some stupid joke my friend wants to play... '' He added as she continued looking at him without saying anything in return for several minutes until finally turning around and walking out of the kitchen area into one of the bedrooms beyond it with a frown on her face.
Pete stood there, trying to figure out what exactly had happened between them before he followed her through another set of double doors across from where they were sitting and into the room where she was going. It seemed like she wanted to be alone for awhile, so Pete sat down against one wall with his back up against it while watching as Brian and his friend continued their argument in front of him until finally settling down on opposite ends of another couch across from them after drinking several more bottles of beer between themselves.
`` I don't think this is working out too well for you,'' Pete said quietly to himself before turning around to
