 “The same thing as last time! ”  I’m not sure why it took him so long to realize. It wasn't exactly a hard question. He knew that I had picked out this particular route the last time we met, and he was just asking again. Or maybe… I don’t know what he really wanted. Maybe there was something more to it than just making conversation?
 “And why should I be picking your choices for you? You can make up your own mind! ”  It felt like a slap in the face, but he had already pushed me against the door of my cell with his hand before I could react. The metal door clanged against my head and I fell to my knees, blood trickling down from where my cheek had been scraped by the edge of the door.
 “You don’t have a say in it anyway! ”  My vision was starting to get blurry. This isn't good, not now… I can’t afford another strike right now. The last one still hadn’t healed up completely and… dammit… if I hadn’t made up my mind so quickly, maybe things would have been different…
 “That is why you are here! You think too much, you think that you deserve to choose your own punishment instead of accepting the right choice that was made for you. ”  He held me by my collar and pressed my head against the wall, so I could no longer move or breathe properly.
 “I… I don’t know what I want anymore! I just… I can ’ t make a decision, I can't decide anything at all anymore. It was easier when I was still in school! ”  He let go of me and walked away without saying anything else. His footsteps faded into the distance but then stopped abruptly, as if he had remembered something important.
 “I will make the choice for you this time, maybe that’s what you want anyway. Maybe you are too weak to decide on your own… ”  He came back to where I was and stood over me. The light from his torch flickered across his face. It looked like he had just been smiling a moment ago. Now the smile had vanished, leaving only cold eyes and a sadistic expression.
 “Don't you think so? ”  He grabbed me by the back of my head again and pulled it down to the ground. I struggled in his grip but couldn’t break free. My neck was starting to hurt from being pushed down this way. It felt like he wasn't holding me anymore, rather that I was hanging from something.
 “What would you want more than anything else? ”  The voice sounded even colder now as the light of the torch reflected off the wet stone floor and walls. His footsteps stopped again but when I looked up to see if he had left already or was coming back, all I saw were his boots, slowly shuffling backwards.
 “You want to know what is best for you… right? You’ve always been so eager to receive whatever punishment they decided for you. ”  The boots continued to move further away until they were no longer visible and I could only hear the echo of his steps fading into the distance.
