esses as her smile shined brightly. It took everything in my power to not run over and jump into that water with her. Instead, I put my camera on the tripod and prepared for one last photo shoot before we said goodbye to the sun.
As I stood there, a tear slowly slid down my cheek as Audrey and I looked at each other, knowing that this moment will be one of our last ones together. Soon she would have to go home, back to where ever it was that she lived, and I’d be left here all alone in the wilderness with nothing but a camera, a computer and a few more good friends to keep me company.
Audrey and I met each other during one of my first years at school. I was walking through the hall when I passed her locker, which had a picture of a cat on it with the word “Catty” written below it. As soon as I saw that photo, I knew she was a crazy cat lady in the making. So I introduced myself to Audrey and we started talking about animals – or cats specifically.
It was great getting to know her because she was one of the few people who actually liked me. Sure there were other people at school that seemed nice enough, but none of them ever wanted anything to do with me after I told them what I did for a living. Audrey was different though. She knew how hard it was for me as an aspiring wildlife photographer in the middle of nowhere, and so she was always supportive whenever anyone else tried to put me down for my career choice.
It took us a while before we became friends though – mostly because I wanted nothing more than just being alone out here in the wilderness. But eventually our friendship blossomed into something much deeper as Audrey would often come over to my house and we’d watch movies together or play video games until the early hours of the morning.
I guess you could say that meeting Audrey changed me for good because now I know how important it is to have people around you who care about your well being despite what others may think or say about you. She showed me this through her unwavering support of my career choice and always being there no matter what happened between us two during those years we spent together at school before moving on with our lives afterwards
As the sun set over the lake, I stood there and stared out into the horizon as Audrey swam in the water. I could feel her love radiate through the air as she floated on top of the lake like an angel descended from heaven to meet me. It was a beautiful sight that reminded me of why I came here to begin with: to find my one true love and spend the rest of my life with her by my side, no matter what happened between us in the future or how much time passed until we could see each other again.
The sun set over the lake, and Audrey and I stood there watching as it disappeared below the horizon. The orange light reflecting off of the water made her look like an Egyptian goddess, and my heart ached for her. She was so beautiful and perfect in every way possible, yet she never saw it because she thought of herself as ugly or less than other people due to the fact that she had dark skin and curly hair instead of blond hair like most girls did at our school back then (and still do now). But I knew better – Audrey was one-of-a-kind, and there would never be another woman like her again.
I stood there, staring out into the distance as if my eyes could pierce through time itself to see what lay beyond the horizon line. It seemed impossible that I was looking at someone who meant so much to me but yet didn’t know it until now because we had never spoken about love or anything else besides schoolwork and homework assignments during our years together in high school (before graduating). But even though this was true, something still told me there would be more between us someday—that maybe if we gave ourselves another chance after all those years apart then things might change once again…
I stood there, staring out at the horizon as my mind raced. What had happened to me? How did I end up here in this place? I couldn’t remember how it all started but one thing was clear: Audrey and I were never meant for each other. It didn’t matter that we had been friends since elementary school or that she was the only person who ever really understood what my life was like growing up with an alcoholic father and a mother who tried her best to keep us safe while also making sure we weren’t forgotten about by everyone else in town (which made sense considering how small our hometown was). The fact remained: Audrey didn’t love me back; she didn’t see anything special about me at all—and that hurt more than any rejection could ever possibly do.
I stood there, staring out into the distance as my mind raced and my heart ached with pain for what had happened between us years ago when we were still young enough to believe in fairy tales like these ones I’m writing now. But it didn’t matter because even though Audrey didn’t love me back, she was still my best friend who would always be there for me no matter how long it took before either one of us found true happiness again (or maybe never).
Audrey and I stood there together, staring out at the sunset as if we were seeing it for the first time. We both knew that our lives were different now, but in a way they had changed forever because Audrey was still my best friend who would always be there no matter how long it took before either one of us found true happiness again (or maybe never).
I stood there with Audrey by my side as we watched the sun set over the lake. We were both thinking about what our future held, and I couldn’t help but smile to myself when I realized that she was still my best friend who would always be there no matter how long it took before either one of us found true happiness again (or maybe never).

But even though our lives were different now, they were still linked by something greater than ourselves: friendship itself!

It was a moment that I will never forget; it’s one of the most important moments of my entire life, and I know that if you were to ask me now whether or not we could have been happy together after everything went down between us back then—I would tell you yes because even though our lives are different now, they are still linked by something greater than ourselves: friendship itself!
