.
Though she was used to this by now, she still felt that the universe owed her something more out of life than just being alone and not having anyone to cook for on weekdays.
Her daughter, Mintarolli, had gone through the same thing only a couple hundred years ago when she left Thulgaria for the bigger cities in the north.
Thulgaria would have been happy to see her, but then again that’s what mothers are supposed to say even if it wasn’t true. She knew Mintarolli had moved out because of her, not despite her. Every time she looked at Mintarolli, all Thulgaria could see was her own flawed image staring back at her with a look that said “I will never amount to anything.”
When you’re the mother of an overweight, incompetent dragon who’s only good for making other people feel bad about themselves (because they’ll never be as talented or attractive as she is), it can take a huge emotional toll. Thulgaria felt like her life was slipping away from her and she didn’t know how much more heartache she could endure before her own flame sack died out entirely.
The only thing that kept Thulgaria going, aside from her ever-growing love for chocolate bars (she had become addicted to them after an unfortunate encounter with a particularly bad batch of them) was the fact that she had finally found a new job as an employee at the local bank.
At first, this seemed like it might be another dead end because banks are notoriously difficult for dragons to work in. But then again, Thulgaria had no choice but to take what jobs she could get if she wanted any chance of getting her life back on track and making herself feel good about something other than food or chocolate bars.
Things started out well enough: she was hired as a teller right away because of her experience with working in similar positions at the grocery store before moving into financial services work last year (that job ended poorly due to being fired after only two weeks). And while this new position did offer some challenges such as dealing with irate customers who wanted their money back despite never having given it up, overall it wasn’t too bad until one day when something happened that changed everything…
When Thulgaria started working at the bank, she noticed that there was a lot of paperwork involved in her job. There were also many different types of documents to keep track of and file away for later use. This made things very difficult because if you didn’t have any idea what you needed when it came time for taxes or filing your income tax return, then chances are pretty good that something might go wrong with all those numbers!
This was especially true during the first few months of working at this particular institution due to her lack of experience in these areas (she had been working as an accountant before moving into customer service). Thankfully though, Thulgaria’s boss was very understanding and would help her whenever he could but even so, sometimes things just didn’t seem like they were going to work out at all…
Things got worse when one day she accidentally misfiled some important files. It took months before anyone realized this had happened and by then it was too late; they couldn’t retrieve anything from what should have been in the right place anymore! This was bad news for Thulgaria because now all her hard work would be wasted as well—she had spent hours upon hours trying to make sure that everything was correct before making mistakes like this one happened…
She knew she was going to get fired. She couldn’t do anything about it, no matter how much time or energy she put into her job and her company, nothing would ever be good enough for the people in charge of hiring new employees at this bank. They were so unreasonable! First they made her wait months before even considering letting her know whether or not she had been hired; then when they finally did decide that yes indeed they wanted someone with more experience on their team, they waited until just after the holidays to make sure there wasn’t anyone else available who might want this position as well (even though every single other teller position was already filled). And now here she was stuck being told off by some pencil-pushing suit for making a mistake that wasn’t even her fault!
Thulgaria stormed out of the building, angry and hurt. She had no idea where to go or what to do next, so she went home instead—and then got distracted by chocolate bars.
When Thulgaria finally returned from her short break at home, she was in a much better mood than before (at least until another teller came up behind her). This time around though it didn’t seem like the bank’s management wanted anything to do with their employees: they just kept shouting orders at each other and generally acting like complete fools!
The situation soon became too much for Thulgaria who decided that it would be best if she left again—but this time without any chocolate bars! Instead of heading straight back home though, she went to see what else was happening around town…and found out about an important event coming up at another nearby bank: one where people were being invited to learn all about new ways in which they could save money while saving money themselves. This sounded perfect for someone like Thulgaria who had always struggled financially despite working so hard for everything she had ever owned…
She walked into the event, looking for the manager of this bank (she had met him before and he seemed nice enough). Once there though she found out that he wasn’t around—but then again neither were any other employees who might be able to help her with anything regarding opening an account or getting more information about how things work here at this bank…
After spending several hours going from one teller counter to another looking for someone who could give some advice on what she should do next, Thulgaria finally found herself talking to someone named Mary (who was very nice and helpful). They exchanged numbers so that they could keep in touch later on down the road; but before anything else happened between them though…
She heard another teller shouting at her again! This time it wasn’t just one teller though—it was three! One of which even seemed angry enough to start throwing things around while yelling something about how much better he or she was than everyone else who worked here…
The situation quickly got out of hand and soon there were several people running toward the door screaming for help from anyone nearby (including Thulgaria). Thankfully though one of these people turned out to be Mary so they headed outside together where things seemed less chaotic than before, even if they weren’t exactly calm either…
As they walked through town towards her home she suddenly realized that this was not just another normal day—it would go down in history as one of those days when everything changes forever! And it did too: while walking home later on she got into an argument with someone over who should pay for dinner tonight (she won). Then after having been attacked by a group of teenage boys who wanted money from her purse she was able to escape without injury, thanks partly because they had seen how strong and scary dragons can be when defending themselves!
This last part made Thulgaria think about all the things that happened during this one day; and also what might happen next…
It is difficult to say whether or not these events were meant as some kind of sign from fate, but they certainly seemed like it at times—especially when you consider how many people ended up getting involved in them without knowing why! Maybe it’s best just leave things where they are right now though since nothing seems certain anymore anyway…
And so ends our story: Thulgaria still doesn’t know what she wants to do next but after seeing how much she has accomplished already today alone, maybe there will be even more adventures in store for her down the road…
