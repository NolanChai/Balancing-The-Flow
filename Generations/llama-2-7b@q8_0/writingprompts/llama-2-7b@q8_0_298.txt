 It was cold outside and snow had been falling for hours. Inside it felt warm despite the freezing temperatures without sheltering from the elements. They were all tired; the night shift on a subway line never ended for them, but the station they were in was abandoned for nearly a decade - no one bothered to remove their personal possessions after closing up shop and leaving it to decay.
 
 "Alright," said the head of the group, a man whose name no one knew other than as 'Officer'. He stood on what had been platform number two's bench seat, facing them from above. "Everybody good?" he asked. The fire was still blazing away, flickering in the wind and snow that howled outside of the station. "Good."
 
 "We'll be staying here tonight," continued Officer. "That means we have to make sure things are secure - you all know what happens when the authorities find a shelter like this. They take it away from us. If that happens, where will we go?" he asked rhetorically. The other members of his group all knew; there were only three places for them to sleep on this side of Los Angeles and they had taken the best one in the city. The others had been left empty - or filled with squatters who would not stand up for what they believed was rightly theirs. Officer continued:
 
 "So we must make sure that nothing happens here tonight." He paused to let his words sink in, and then he held a hand out towards the fire. "We can't get through this winter without more wood - do you all understand me? We need fuel if we are going to survive the next few months - so I propose that one of us go out tonight and find some." He paused again, looking at each member of his group in turn. The faces around him were tired but determined; they had been living here for weeks now and their lives depended on the subway shelters and the few people who protected them.
 
 "Is there anyone else with me?" he asked, but no one spoke. After a moment he continued: "All right then - let's go."
 
 The group moved down platform two, past the old ticket booth towards the door into the tunnels that led to other parts of the subway line. Officer had not been on this shift; he was new to LASS4 and their latest operation, but he knew all too well how dangerous it could be out there in a place like Los Angeles - even more so after dark when the authorities patrolled the streets with less concern for life than they did during the daylight hours. He glanced at his watch as the rest of his group waited impatiently at the door leading to the tunnels, but it was still several minutes before midnight; if he left now and took an alternate route back to LASS4 headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, then he would be able to make it home before anyone else did. He closed his eyes briefly as a particularly strong gust of wind howled through the subway station; when they opened again he smiled grimly at what lay beyond the doorway into the tunnels - a row of barrels full of wood stacked on either side of an open door, waiting to be taken by someone who wanted fuel for their fire. He turned back towards his group, looking for any sign that they were ready; when none was forthcoming he stepped through the door and into the cold night air of downtown Los Angeles.  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
