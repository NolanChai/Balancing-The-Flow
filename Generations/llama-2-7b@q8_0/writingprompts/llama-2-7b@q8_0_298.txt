 walls and floor. 
 
 Nothing happened. No answer came forth. 
 
 He felt his way through the room. There was a window on one wall, which let in a gentle breeze. Outside there were no buildings, or any signs of civilization. Just open land. 
 
 And so he sat by the window for some time to recover from his frightened state. Then he ventured outdoors and began walking. The sky was cloudless blue and the air fresh. A warm breeze blew gently across him, ruffling his hair. He continued on, looking down at the ground, which was a mix of dirt and grass. 
 
 A path appeared ahead of him, running east to west, as far as he could see. The path looked like it had been travelled by many people before him. It stretched on into the distance. 
 
 He continued walking along the path for some time, when suddenly a strange object came into view off in the distance ahead of him. He couldn't tell what it was at first. But as he got closer to it, it began to take shape. 
 
 A white horse lay dead on its side on the path ahead of him. Its body was covered with dust and its coat matted and dull from lack of grooming. Its legs were bent backwards beneath its belly and its tail hung limply by the sides of its body, as if it had been cut off. 
 
 A trail of blood led away from the dead horse's head, towards a white house that appeared in the distance beyond it. The house was made of stone, and stood on a small hill. He walked over to the door of the house and tried opening it. But as he expected, it was locked. 
 
 He wandered around the outside of the house for some time before returning to the path and continuing his journey westward. 
 
 He walked until he reached a wide river, which flowed in the opposite direction from him. The bank on the other side of the river was littered with dead bodies. There were people from all walks of life lying there: men and women; young and old; healthy and sickly. All dead. 
 
 He stood there for some time, looking at these corpses, trying to make sense out of it all. It was impossible. He had no idea what this place was or where he might be. All the thoughts running through his head just made him feel more confused than before. 
 
 Finally he continued walking westward along the riverbank until he reached an old boat resting on a dock. The boat was black and rotten, as if it had been there for years. It looked like a very small thing to take him across this wide body of water. But it would have to do. 
 
 He climbed into the boat and sat down at its helm. Then he pulled out the old oars which were lying on either side and began rowing. The river was wide but there was only one other boat on it, floating in front of him a few hundred feet away. He could see people moving around inside it. 
 
 The current carried his boat quickly towards the other boat until he caught up to it. As he drew nearer, he saw that the other boat had been charred on one side and its mast had fallen over. Its sails were black with ash. It was obvious this was not a normal occurrence but something terrible had happened here recently. 
 
 He rowed closer until his boat bumped up against it and he could see people moving about inside. There were three people on board, two women and one man, all of them sitting near the front of the boat. One woman was sitting with her back to him, but as he watched he saw her head turn towards him slightly. 
 
 She looked at him for a moment before looking away again. Then he noticed that she had a strange face; her eyes were sunken in and there were dark circles under them. He wondered if the woman was sick, or perhaps she was old. But he could not be sure as it was hard to tell from such a distance. 
 
 As he watched these people through his binoculars, the other boat continued to move away downriver and he lost sight of them. Then suddenly there came another bump against his side of the river and he turned around in time to see another boat approaching him. This one was much larger than the first one he had seen earlier, but its sails were black with ash just as well. 
 
 It too was charred on one side and its mast had fallen over. But it was moving very slowly down river, like a ship that had been damaged in some way by a storm. A few people sat inside it, including another woman who looked just the same as the first one did. They both appeared to be around his age; he couldn't tell whether they were old or young because of their sunken eyes and dark circles under them. 
 
 The second boat continued drifting down river until it was almost gone from sight, when suddenly a third boat came into view behind it on the other side of the river. This one had no sails at all and its mast had fallen over too, but unlike the others, this one didn't seem to be damaged in any way. It moved quickly downriver, heading for an opening that led out of the river towards some trees beyond it on the shore. 
 
 This boat was larger than the other two and seemed to have more people on board: three men were sitting at its helm and several others stood by them; one man was even standing up at the front of the ship holding a large sword in his hand as if he was going to fight off something or someone. 
 
 As this boat reached the opening, it turned into another wide river that flowed northward away from the shore where they had just been. The river was wide and shallow with small islands scattered across it; on some of these little islands were houses that looked like they belonged to wealthy people, but there were no other boats in sight anywhere else along its banks. 
 
 This new river continued flowing northward until it reached a large town ahead of him which was called "Townville". The streets within the town were paved with stone and the buildings looked like they belonged to some kind of castle. There were people moving around everywhere, both inside and outside these structures. But they all appeared to be dead: their skin had turned grey from lack of oxygen, their eyes were sunken in, their faces were wrinkled and their hair was matted on their heads. 
 
 It seemed like the entire town was made up entirely of corpses. The man rowing ahead of him continued rowing his way into Townville until he reached a dock which was filled with many boats all bumping together at one end while another group of people stood waiting patiently for their turn to come. 
 
 This man got out of his boat and walked up the riverbank towards an old white building that looked like it might be some kind of castle; its walls were made of stone and its roof was covered with snow. As he approached this building, a door opened at its entrance and three people came out holding guns in their hands as if they were going hunting. 
 
 He walked up to the front door and knocked on it before opening it himself and stepping inside. It was cold inside; there was no heat coming from any of the fireplaces or stoves he could see anywhere in the large hallway leading to other rooms off to either side. The only light came through small windows set into each wall, but even so they were covered with snow outside which made them look like dark holes leading into nothingness. 
 
 He walked down one of these corridors until he reached a door on the far end, behind which was another hallway similar to this one; its floor was littered with old furniture and there were empty bottles everywhere in sight as well as garbage scattered across its stone tiles. In the distance off in another direction he could see more staircases leading down into darkness below ground level, but they all looked blocked up so that no one could go down them anymore. 
 
 He continued walking until reaching a large chamber at the end of this hallway; it was filled with dust everywhere and there were holes in its ceiling through which sunlight shone down onto the floor below. It didn't look like any living being had been here for many years, but yet he could tell that someone had lived inside this place because of all the furniture lying around: an old wooden table; chairs made out of wicker; and a few beds covered with blankets which seemed to have belonged to people who once slept there. 
 
 The man walked over towards one of these beds, but before he could do so he stopped abruptly in his tracks as he suddenly realized that he was being watched by someone on the other side of this room from where he stood; it was another person just like him who had been standing there all along watching everything unfold without saying a word. 
 
 The man turned around and saw that this person was an old woman sitting on a stool behind one of those holes in ceiling through which sunlight shone down onto her face; she looked at him with eyes as dark as night before getting up from where she sat to walk over towards him. She wore nothing but some old clothes made out of rags, but even so they still
