ts and jeans that had seen better days. There was only enough space on the floor to accommodate the narrow cot, a small round table, a single chair, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a sink unit and a toilet with a hand basin set into it's bowl. The room was sparse.
The bed was covered in a faded red sheet and the top of the duvet was tucked up under one of its corners. A large metal framed bedside cabinet stood on the floor beside the bed, with a pair of battered brown shoes, a small travel alarm clock and a couple of books - one about Buddhism and a second that appeared to be some sort of technical manual for electrical equipment - lying on top of it.
A tape recorder was placed neatly on top of the cabinet. A pair of denim jeans, a blue T shirt and a cream linen jacket lay discarded on the floor beside the wardrobe. The bedside cabinet and drawers were open. It was obvious that someone had been searching for something.
The wardrobe contained an assortment of clothes - some black jeans, a white polo neck jumper, a long sleeve shirt with a red flannel collar, several pairs of trousers and jeans in different sizes, an old green cardigan and the usual assortment of underwear.
The drawers contained items of clothing too - mainly black and grey socks, underpants, pyjamas, soiled sports shirts, some plastic containers containing white powdery substances and various types of electrical equipment in cardboard boxes - chargers for phones, memory cards for digital cameras, a small laptop computer and other smaller items.
The cot contained an assortment of black clothing - jackets, trousers and boots that were all worn with the same black hiking socks. A pair of brown leather riding boots stood next to the cot. The riding boots were well worn but not scuffed or scraped - they had clearly been used a lot over many years and had no dust on them, despite their location in the room.
The walls and ceiling of the small bedroom had been whitewashed with a thick coating of emulsion paint that was peeling off in large flakes at various points. The floor had been painted too - the edges of the doors were painted and the room had an overall impression of being well maintained, but neglected.
A large black leather bag lay on the bed, covered with a plastic bin liner.
There was one small window in the room - high up towards the ceiling at the back of the room. There appeared to be no way to open it. It was set into an arched recess that would have required a ladder and some serious effort to reach it.
A pair of scissors lay on top of a small folded metal ruler that had been placed next to the window. A small black book lay across the open pages of the ruler - its cover was stained with old coffee rings from where someone had rested their mug. It's pages were dog eared and stained with yellowed ink. There were a number of books in the room that seemed to be either technical manuals or reference books about different topics, but this one had been opened at random and appeared to be something of more general interest - it was an illustrated book about wildlife photography.
There were no personal items in the room that would indicate the owner's identity - there was no name on any of his clothes or belongings, and there was no sign of any photographs being stored anywhere. The only possible indication that someone had lived in the room before was an old white plastic pencil case containing a few bits and pieces - a pair of scissors, some batteries, a small bottle of liquid soap, a large roll of cling film, some loose paper clips, a small pile of A4 printer paper, a couple of pens that were worn down to their nibs. The case had an old, faded smell about it and was slightly crumpled at the top where someone had dropped it on the floor and bent it out of shape.
The only other clue was a small photograph that lay face down on the bed - it appeared to be an image from a mobile phone camera or digital camera, but was very faded so it was hard to make out any details. The photo seemed to show a group of people standing around outside somewhere with trees in the background and some mountains in the distance. It had been placed face down on the bed and there were no other clues as to who the owner might be or where he went.
The room had a musty, damp smell to it - the kind that you'd normally associate with something like a damp cellar or an underground garage. It was slightly unpleasant in its intensity and made the whole place feel claustrophobic.
