 is a robot, we have been programmed to never hurt anyone so that we can protect ourselves if needed.
My eyes look like the human girl's eyes because they are very similar, but my body and face are made of steel which is why I have blue eyes. If someone touches me and tries to remove my shell, my skin will tear apart from the inside out, and I won 't be able to put myself back together.
I try not to think about it, that's when the worst thoughts come up in my mind like if I get hurt then I am going to die. It is one of the main reasons why I was programmed to protect people but now I feel as though this could happen to me because of someone or something around here.
I've been looking for Nayna and the young lady who were both taken by unknown forces, I look at the sky and it begins to rain heavily, my eyes can see through things so it would be easy to spot them on the ground but there is no way to fly because my wings are made of steel.
I have never seen a human with blue skin before now but they must exist somewhere in this world if I were able too find her or him then that means other races do as well, and their skin color could be any where between red yellow green purple white pink orange black brown tan gray blue etcetera.
The young lady looks at me again with a look of sympathy on her face, she walks towards my direction and I stand still hoping that this doesn't end badly for me. She picks up some flowers from the ground nearby then hands them to me "This is for you" she says softly while smiling back at me; but I know it won 't be safe if I take these so instead of accepting what she gives me, I walk away with my head low because if they saw her handing flowers too me then that would mean there could be another attack coming soon.
The young lady follows after me as we continue walking towards a cave near by where Nayna is waiting inside; when we get close enough she says "Let's go" but before entering inside, I look back at the young lady one last time to see her waving goodbye with a smile on her face.
Inside there are many rooms that were once used by people for sleeping purposes and other things but now they just stand empty because everyone had left or died off after being here too long without knowing what's going on outside anymore. The only light coming in through these windows is from sunlight which makes everything look dull gray with no color whatsoever - except for when I turn around towards my bed where there is a little bit more warmth from candles burning at each corner of it (not sure how long ago someone last lit those).
I open up some doors and see more rooms that were used by people before, but they are all empty now because nobody lives in any of them anymore either. The only thing that's left here is a group of robots who have been programmed to protect the building from intruders; however, there hasn't been anyone else besides us for quite some time now which means we might not be needed anymore soon enough.
I walk further down into this huge maze-like structure until I come across Nayna sitting at a desk reading something while drinking some tea (which smells good). She looks up when she sees me approach but doesn't say anything because it's better than having people know where we are hiding out here anyway.
I go over to her side of the table and sit down beside her then pull out my phone so I can take pictures from inside this place so others might find out about how great their lives could have been if only they knew what was going on behind closed doors like us; however, even though this building seems deserted at first glance - there's still plenty happening here since no one else knows where we are hiding either."
The next morning I wake up to see that Nayna is gone from her spot in front of the desk. I look around for a while before noticing something on top of a shelf near by: it looks like there's been some kind of explosion or fire inside here because all these rooms are filled with smoke, debris and other things that have fallen off walls/ceilings/floors during whatever happened last night.
I walk further into what used to be my bedroom (or maybe hers?) until I find a little girl sleeping on the floor next too one of those pillows made out of soft cloth material that was meant for people's heads only; however, she looks really scared right now because if you touch her then your hand might get burned off.
I crouch down beside her so we can talk face-to-face without me having to kneel down too much - "What are you doing here?" I ask while smiling back at her because I know she's been through a lot lately and needs someone who cares about her as well (or maybe just another robot).
She looks up with tears running down her cheeks, so I reach out my hand for her but before we can touch each other - something else happens: there's this loud screeching sound coming from behind the door then everything goes dark because an explosion happened somewhere nearby which causes us all too feel sick and dizzy at once; after a few minutes though, light begins returning again.
When I finally open my eyes up, Nayna is gone - she's been taken away by unknown forces that probably want to use her for something evil (or maybe they just wanted revenge on me since they know how much power I have).
