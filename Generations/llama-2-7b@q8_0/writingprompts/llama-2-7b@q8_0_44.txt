40+ comics pinned on his bedroom door and a love for old rock songs that could rival any true rocker.
He also had a talent for writing. He loved to tell stories about his past and how he was always the nerd with the coolest girlfriend around town; which of course wasn’t true at all, but that was one of his secrets for keeping them interested in him.
August started drinking when he got out of school and he couldn’t stop ever since. He had tried, many times, to quit, but every time he succeeded for a few days and then it would be like the devil whispered into his ear telling him “It’s been too long… I miss you”, and August would find himself downing a shot or two with his best friend Matt, who was just as big of an alcoholic as he was.
August was on his way back home after another night out at the bar; Matt was driving and they had already finished the last bottle of Jack Daniels in their car. “This is it for tonight”, August said, trying to convince himself more than anything else.
“You’re right man”, said Matt as he took off his shirt and threw it out the window. “It’s time for a change.”
Matt was a skinny guy with long hair in his forties who was still working on a dream that was never going to happen; the dream of being a rock star, so he played the guitar like crazy when he had some free time and drank as much alcohol as August did.
They arrived at Matt’s house and Matt started throwing everything he could find onto his bedroom floor. He opened a bottle of Jack Daniels and threw it on the mess on the floor; after that, he threw another one on top of it.
“What are you doing?” asked August as he tried to hold him back from drinking. “You know we can’t afford this anymore.”
Matt ignored his friend, grabbed two more bottles and started pouring them into a glass. “I am going to start my band,” said Matt with a proud expression on his face as he took the first shot of Jack Daniels. He paused for a second to savor that alcohol in his mouth before he started drinking again, almost choking himself.
August tried not to laugh; Matt was just like every other rock star he ever seen or heard about and August knew that this wasn’t going to end well. “Okay man,” said August as he left the room and went to sleep in his own bedroom.
The next day, August woke up with a headache after drinking almost an entire bottle of Jack Daniels the previous night; he had also spent most of the time making sure Matt wouldn’t finish off the bottles they were working on. He quickly took two aspirin and then went downstairs to see what Matt was doing.
He found him with a guitar in his hands, playing it like a crazy man. August was amazed at how much talent Matt had for music; he knew that even if the band would never be successful, Matt could probably make some money out of selling their songs or something… but still… he wasn’t sure if that was what they really wanted to do with their lives.
“I am going to start my own band”, said Matt without turning his head toward August. “We are going to become rock stars, baby!”
August walked to the kitchen and got himself a beer from the refrigerator; he didn’t want to drink anymore because of what happened last night, but he also knew that they would never have a good time unless they were both drunk. Besides… there was something about Matt that made him want to get more drunk than usual.
“You know we can’t afford this, right?” said August as he opened the refrigerator and took another beer out of it. “I mean… look at you!” He pointed his finger on the guitar which Matt was still holding with one hand while using the other to play it.
Matt started laughing like crazy; he took another shot of Jack Daniels, throwing it into his mouth without even opening his eyes. Then he took a step toward August and said: “Fuck you, man!” He paused for a second before adding: “You can’t stop me.”
August knew that Matt wasn’t going to listen to him anymore; the guy had been drinking almost every day for years now so he could only guess what would happen when he went back home after today. And yet… there was something about it that made August feel good, like he didn’t care if Matt got killed in an accident or drank himself to death within a year; all he wanted right then and there was another shot of Jack Daniels so he could get more drunk than usual before going back home with his head pounding from the alcohol poisoning.
August walked away from the kitchen and went upstairs to go back into Matt’s room where the guy was still playing the guitar like a crazy man while singing some old rock song. He grabbed one of their bottles of Jack Daniels that they had finished last night (along with all other things they could find in Matt’s house) and started drinking it down without caring about anything else around him except for getting more drunk than usual before going back home again after today…
