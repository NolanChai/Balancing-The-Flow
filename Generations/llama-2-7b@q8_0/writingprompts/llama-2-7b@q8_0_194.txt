ittle bubbling at the corner of his mouth.
I stepped forward, ignoring the stench and the horror of it all, and leaned over to check him for a pulse. There was none, but that did not mean he was dead. I had seen men die many times before. Even those who had been blown apart by shell fire or shot down in the street sometimes managed to linger for minutes, hours even if they were mortally wounded.
I pulled out my field dressing and began to clean away the filth of war from around his head wound, sponging it gently with water I had scraped from a nearby shell hole. He was very young, just eighteen or nineteen, and although he was in uniform I could see that he was not one of our army. His face bore no insignia but the name tag on his tunic told me he was an officer.
I tried to cover his eyes with the dressing as gently as possible but the screaming face seemed to be mocking me, twisting its mouth into a sneering smile that dripped spit and bile from the corner of his lips. I pulled my head away and turned to leave. He had been dead for some time so there was no point in lingering.
It took longer than usual, but eventually the noise of battle began to fade as shells stopped falling around me. There were still the occasional whistle overhead but it was nothing like before. I could now hear the sound of distant voices and the clanking of metal on metal. The fighting had moved away from here.
I knew that our army had already won this battle, just as they would win any other. It was only a matter of time before the Germans were forced back to their own borders but it was not the outcome that interested me at this moment. I could hear a rustling behind me and turned around, my rifle in hand.
“What do you want?” I shouted at him.
I knew that voice. It had been there with me through so many battles and he seemed to have survived them all but I still did not know who this man really was. He looked different now; his uniform was stained by the mud of war, his once neat and short hair hung down past his ears like a scarecrow’s. It was as if he had forgotten what it was to be human.
He took another step closer but I kept my rifle raised and aimed at him. This time he didn’t bother with the usual greeting and just stared at me, his face expressionless once more.
I knew who he was now; he was one of mine, but not in the same way as some of my other soldiers. He wasn’t from any army or regiment that I had ever heard of before. Even the insignia on his tunic were not those of any country that I knew. The only reason I could be sure it was him was because he always came to me at times like this, when men were wounded and left bleeding in no man’s land, waiting for someone to find them.
“I am not leaving until you do,” he said as he took another step forward. “There are too many of the dead here.” I raised my rifle a little more and pointed it at him.
It was then that I noticed that one side of his face was burned beyond recognition, like he had been caught in the crossfire of machine guns and shrapnel, but it was not until I turned to look down at the ground behind me that I realised why there were so many dead here. He was burning them; piles of bodies lying in shallow graves on fire as smoke rose into the air.
“I am a doctor,” he said. “I only want you to leave.” I could smell his body, the stench of death and decay mixed with something else that was strange but familiar at the same time. It reminded me of the stink of some of my soldiers in the trenches, even though they had not yet seen battle.
The soldier from no army was right; there were too many of the dead here for it to be safe and I could feel my legs beginning to shake. The urge to run back through no man’s land to our own lines was strong but I knew that if I did then he would come after me, dragging me into hell with him.
“I am not leaving,” I said as I lowered my rifle and pointed it at the ground. “Just go.” He nodded his head a couple of times in acknowledgement and turned around to walk back towards the burning piles of bodies. I watched until he was out of sight, wondering if this was some new trick that the devil had cooked up just for me, but after a few minutes my legs finally gave way and I sank into the mud behind one of the fallen trees where I lay like a man dying until dawn came back again.
I woke early in the morning, feeling much stronger than I had before. I stood up and looked at the forest that surrounded our trench, knowing full well that the war was still going on outside. The sky was grey as usual and the sound of guns were constant in my ears. I could hear voices too but they belonged to people who lived back home; those of family and friends whom I had not seen since this whole terrible nightmare began.
I went down into the trench where all my soldiers were sleeping and shook each one awake. They moaned and groaned at first until I explained that there was a battle going on right outside our door and that we needed to get ready to fight once more. Eventually they stopped complaining and began to prepare themselves, pulling on their uniforms and weapons in the darkness.
I had an uneasy feeling as I did so, knowing that it would not be long before the enemy found out what was going on here. They might be at a disadvantage right now because we were ready for them but I knew that if they really wanted to destroy us they could still do it in no time.
The soldiers stood around me as I spoke and I could feel their fear, knowing full well that the same fear was inside of me also. This battle had been going on for months now with little sign of either side giving ground. They were digging in even deeper every day and the war seemed to be getting more intense as it went on.
I tried not to think about what would happen if we lost this fight but I knew deep down that it would mean nothing less than our certain deaths. It was only a matter of time before our trench was overrun by an enemy army much larger and better equipped than our own. Even though some of my men had been here for years, they were all young and strong; too good to be killed on the battlefield in this way.
“We will fight to the last man,” I said as I finished speaking. “This is what we have always done and it is what we shall do now.” There was no doubt in their eyes that they would follow me into battle but there was also fear. They had never seen anything like this before, an entire army of men marching towards them with nothing more than rifles and bayonets at their disposal.
The battle began soon after dawn as the first shots rang out across no man’s land. The enemy’s guns were much bigger and louder than ours which made it difficult for us to respond properly but eventually we found a way through all of this chaos and fought back with everything that we had.
I led my men into battle and they followed me without question, knowing full well that this was not the time to ask questions or show any hesitation in doing their duty. The fighting went on for hours until finally it seemed like things were getting too much even for me; so much bloodshed and destruction had occurred in such a short space of time that I could no longer tell who was friend or foe anymore.
Then suddenly everything stopped as if someone had flicked off a switch somewhere far away from here, leaving nothing but silence behind where there had once been noise and violence beforehand.. It was at this moment that I realised what was really going on; it wasn’t just another battle between two armies anymore..
The last thing that I remember seeing as night fell around me was a man running through the forest towards our trench. He was not an enemy soldier but rather someone who seemed to be fleeing from something much bigger than him, or perhaps even himself. As he ran by me I reached out and tried to grab hold of his arm but instead my hand passed right through him as if he were made of smoke rather than flesh.
I was lying in a pool of blood when they found me later that morning; it seemed as though someone had cut off one side of my face with an axe or something similar while I lay there unconscious on the ground. There was no sign of any injuries anywhere else but this parting wound was deep enough for me to know that I would not survive much longer..
“No,” he said as he stood over me, staring down at me with eyes full of hate and pain “I won’t let you die.” With those words spoken so coldly, it was like a knife being twisted into my heart; it felt as if this man was ripping out my soul with every word that came from his lips.
I tried to speak back but no sound would come out of me except for the occasional moan or groan which did nothing more than add fuel to his fire. Finally, after
