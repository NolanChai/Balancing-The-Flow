ater than I’d ever seen it cleaned before. He mopped the stairs with more care, then he took to scrubbing the tiles at the front entrance.
“What are you doing?” asked my dad. “That mop is worth ten cents.”
“It’s not a mop,” Kiro said. “It’s a machine.” He paused and looked out of his eyes like he was seeing something in the distance. His chin dropped to the floor with the rest of him and I knew from experience that it was time for us to leave.
“Let me get you some water,” I offered, but Kiro shook his head.
“I’m fine,” he said. “Gotta keep my strength up.”
The next week, Kiro wasn’t on the clock anymore. No one knew if he quit or if they just let him go, and no one talked about it much anyway because even though we were in the sixth grade at that point, the mop boy was no longer a subject of conversation for our class. We moved onto other things. But I didn’t forget what Kiro had taught me about mops—that they could be more than just tools to wipe away water and dirt. They could be works of art in their own right, as long as you took the time to appreciate them.
“You guys wanna go hang out at my house?” I asked the next day after school. My friends were already outside with their bikes by the curb. They turned up their noses at me because they’d never been to my house before.
“It’s a little weird,” said Joey, who was on his second year of puberty and had no idea how much more weird it could get. “You’ll see.”
They didn’t want to come in at first but I promised them that they’d be fine if they just stayed outside and kept quiet, so eventually they agreed. But the moment we stepped inside the doorway of my house, Joey bolted back out onto the street.
“Why is this place so weird?” he asked as soon as he was far enough away to talk without shouting over the noise. “I saw a mop.”
My mom and dad were in the kitchen when we came inside, but they were too distracted by whatever they were doing to notice us. Soon after we arrived, I realized why my house felt so different from everyone else’s. Mops weren’t just hanging from racks in our garage and basement like they were everywhere else; they littered the entire house. They were on the walls of every room. There were mop head prints on the ceiling of almost every hallway, and even though some of them had dried and cracked with age, I could still make out what shapes they’d been before: an elephant, a cat, a giraffe, a bunny, a fish.
“Come on,” I said to my friends as I led the way downstairs. “It’s cool.”
In the basement, we found another mop hanging from the ceiling and all of us—even Joey—stopped what we were doing to look at it. It was shaped like a spider but with no legs; only eight small arms hung in midair like the claws on a chalkboard eraser, each one just as long as a man’s finger, all of them black and dotted with green.
“What do you think it means?” asked Joey. “It looks like a spider.”
I shrugged. I didn’t know what the mop meant or why my parents had hung it there. All I could see were the arms, each one bent downward into an impossible angle like they were all pointing to something on the floor below, and for some reason that made me feel a little nervous.
“I bet it was there before we moved in,” said Joey as he examined the mop head more closely, running his fingers along the damp, shiny surface of it, “and your parents just didn’t want to throw it out because they don’t like throwing things away.”
When Joey said this, my mom called down from upstairs. She told us that lunch was ready and to come eat if we wanted to. I left the mop hanging on its hook in the basement and followed my friends up into the kitchen where they were eating sandwiches at the table while my dad stood over them, talking about how he’d seen a new movie that weekend and was planning on renting it as soon as our meal was done. My mom sat across from him with her arms folded against her chest like she couldn’t wait for his lunch to be over so she could go back to whatever she’d been doing before we got there.
As I watched my friends eat and my parents talk, the more I thought about the mop spider hanging in the basement. I wanted to tell them how weird it was that our house had so many mops all over the place—not just because they looked like they’d been drawn on by a six-year old with crayons but also because I never really understood what they did for my parents or why they seemed so important.
“I wish we could have a mop like that,” Joey said to me after he swallowed the last bite of his sandwich and wiped his mouth on one of our napkins.
“What?” asked my mom. “Why do you say that, son?”
Joey shrugged. He didn’t know what else to tell her so instead of answering she just kept staring at him with this weird expression in her eyes that made me think something was wrong but I couldn’t figure out exactly how or why. All Joey did was smile back at us until finally my mom broke the silence and told us that we should go outside now if we wanted to ride our bikes around town before it got dark.
Outside, they were all playing basketball in the driveway while I watched from where I stood on top of one of those big green rocks that look like giant mushrooms except they’re not because scientists say that they’re actually just clumps of dirt that grow over time because nobody wants them around and so no one ever tries to get rid of them by picking them up with their hands or digging them out with shovels even though it would only take about fifteen minutes for each rock to disappear if someone put enough effort into making it happen.
“It’s kinda weird that your house is full of mops,” said Joey as he tossed the ball back and forth with me over my shoulder while we talked, “but I guess they make sense too because you guys are so into cleaning.”
I shrugged again but this time it was because I didn’t know what else to say. I just wanted them all to leave already so that way I could go home and see the mop spider by myself without having any other people around me who might think it looked like a joke or something else besides an artistic masterpiece made by Kiro himself, which is exactly how I felt about it even though he’d never said as much.
“It looks like your dad would like this house more if there were mops everywhere too,” Joey added when we got back inside again later that night after dark had fallen over everything else around us except for the lights coming from our windows, which I always thought made it look like we were living underwater somewhere deep in the ocean.
“I know,” my dad said, “but there are just so many of them and they take up so much space. It would be hard to keep track of where all those mops went when they weren’t hanging from racks or standing next to the sink.” He paused for a moment before continuing his thought aloud with these words: “They’re like family members—you have no idea how much space they take up until one day you wake up and realize that there are so many of them that they could fill an entire room if only somebody would clean it out.”
My mom didn’t say anything else but I noticed the way she rolled her eyes while she went about getting ready for bed. She told me to come help myself if I wanted a glass of water before turning off the lights and closing my bedroom door behind her so that I could sleep alone in peace without any more noise from outside or inside our house, which is why when I finally did fall asleep later on that night after lying there for hours thinking about how weird it was to have mops everywhere around me instead of just being hung up somewhere safe and out-of-the-way like they were supposed to be, I dreamed of Kiro standing in my room with his arms stretched out against the wall above where we used to sleep together when we were kids before our parents told us that it wasn’t appropriate anymore because we had reached an age when we should know better than to share a bedroom while also sharing such intimate details about ourselves as children.
