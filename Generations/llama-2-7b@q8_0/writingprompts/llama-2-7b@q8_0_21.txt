ancour nor resentment in him at the prospect of leaving his old home for good.
He would be missed by many, but he had lived long enough to fulfil his purpose and die with dignity; all the while making it known that he had not been afraid to take risks and live life as fully as possible. As much as he loved this earth, there was no question in his mind that heaven awaited him on the other side.
There were many things he had wanted to say before he departed but had not gotten around to it until that night. As a young man he’d had a wild streak; he’d made up for lost time and done many things with which his father would have disapproved, though the old man was already dead by the time he really began to come of age.
He did not regret any of these adventures, but knew there were things that he hadn’t told those closest to him – friends and lovers, people who had been a part of his life as much or more than anyone else. But he would have been seen in a different light if they’d known about it all. There was also no sense in rehashing what he knew to be unchangeable events.
But then, one night just before midnight on Christmas Eve, the old man awoke from his sleep with a start. A strange sense of peace and calm had suddenly overtaken him. He lay there quietly for a few moments as if listening for something or someone, but heard nothing. No voices or footsteps to be heard. He wasn’t even sure how long he’d been lying in bed before the door was opened cautiously.
In came his wife of forty years and her two children from their first marriage; a daughter of eighteen who had lived with them since she was fourteen, and a son of twenty-two who they’d taken in as an infant. The family gathered around him to bid him farewell. The old man smiled weakly at his wife and gently stroked the hair from her face.
He looked up into the eyes of each of his grandchildren, and he could see that they were both trying very hard to hide their tears, even as they waved goodbye to him with a smile. “I love you,” the old man whispered. He knew his strength was failing but wanted to say it all the same; he wanted to let them know how important they’d been in his life and how much he would miss each of them now that he no longer had them close by.
The room was silent as everyone waited for the old man to pass away. All at once there was a loud, thunderous knock on the door just as the man exhaled his last breath, and all eyes turned toward it. There were three more hard knocks, but no one moved except for the son of twenty-two, who slowly rose from his chair by the window and made his way to the door.
The boy opened the door a crack; he could see that there was no one outside as far as he could tell, so he wrenched open the door with all his might, and what was on the other side of it came crashing in through the frame.
He looked down at the floor just in time to see an old woman come stumbling toward him out of the darkness. She’d fallen and hurt her leg, but she made a valiant effort to get up on her own before he helped her to stand. “I’m sorry,” he whispered as he saw that she was in pain.
“Please,” he said quickly, “Come inside.” He didn’t know what else to do other than help this stranger who was clearly in need of his help. With a weak smile she allowed him to assist her into the house and then into her chair. “I have water,” the boy told her as he went back toward the kitchen to find some for her.
“Thank you, dear.” The old woman had been watching him quietly while he was gone; she could tell that he was a kind young man who would go out of his way to help someone in need. She knew then why it had taken so long for him to get here. “I’ve been looking all over the house for something to drink,” he admitted sheepishly as he poured her water from the tap and brought it back into the living room.
“Oh, I see.” The old woman smiled as she took a sip of water; it was ice cold, but that didn’t matter in this heat. “I must have been so thirsty,” she said to herself before turning her attention back to the boy who had been waiting for her return.
“You’re welcome.” He sat down on the couch and looked over at his grandmother as he watched her take another sip from her glass.
She shook her head sadly. “I suppose it will have to be that way,” she said with a deep, soft voice full of sorrow.
“Well then…” She smiled again; this time it was an understanding smile between two people who knew one another very well and shared the same kind of past as friends should. He took her hand in his own and held it tightly while he spoke to her about what had happened in his life since they last saw each other – or at least since she’d come back into this house again after so many years apart.
“Yes,” the old woman said with a smile on her face as tears began to form in her eyes; “I understand.” She turned her head toward the kitchen and called out for him once more before closing up his room door behind herself.
As he watched her walk away, he couldn’t help but feel grateful that someone had come along at just the right moment when he needed it most.
