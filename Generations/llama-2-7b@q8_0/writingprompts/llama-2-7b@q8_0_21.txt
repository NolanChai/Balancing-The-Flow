hg' program and we decided to check it out, for ourselves. What they were doing in there was horrifying.

 ``... and you'll thank me later''
 
 ``No, no, I won't! '' I said, breaking the grip on my arm that had been holding my wrist behind my back. The man with the cold eyes had a tight grip on my shoulder from behind and was using it to pull me backwards out of the room. It took some doing, but we managed to escape just as a door at the other end of the hallway opened. A nurse and two orderlies came through the opening and stopped when they saw what I had done.

 ``Stop right there!'' the man with cold eyes said.
 
 ``Let him go! He was going to hurt me!''
 
 ``You're just a child, you don't understand...'' The man with cold eyes told me sternly and dragged me back into the room where my sister lay bound. I tried to struggle against them, but they had their hands on me and it wasn't working. They pushed me down onto a stool in front of my sister's bed, forcing my wrists behind my back so tightly that it was starting to hurt.
 
 ``...but she is going to hurt herself!'' The man with the cold eyes explained again and pulled a small key from his pocket. It wasn't until he unlocked her arms that I realized what had been wrong with them in the first place, my sister couldn't bend her wrists at all.
 
 ``Do you know who we are?'' The man with cold eyes asked me. I tried to struggle against them again but it was no good, they were too strong and too many of them, for me.
 
 ``What do you think we're going to do here?'' the same person continued. He unlocked my sisters wrists and then pulled a key out of his pocket and unlocked mine. Then he let go of me as well. I was shaking violently.
 
 ``We are going to take you with us'' The man with cold eyes told me sternly, but with something about him that made me think he actually felt sorry for me. It seemed like a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. He had just released me after I was held captive, beaten, tortured... what if he thought it was his duty to do so?
 
 ``We're taking you both home now'' The woman in white said with a smile. I didn't like her very much.
 
 ``What about mom and dad?'' my sister asked timidly, looking up at me for reassurance. She had been tied up as well but she was younger than me so it hadn't hurt as bad.
 
 ``They can come to visit us! They were so worried when they couldn't find you two...'' The woman in white replied with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. I wasn't sure what to think about this anymore, I was trying my best not to let myself be afraid but it wasn't working very well and these people were just making things worse!
 
 ``Now get up,'' the man with cold eyes told me. He reached for my hand but I pulled away from him as he tried to grab my wrist and yanked my arm forward, trying to pull myself back into a standing position. It didn't work at first but it worked eventually... kind of.
 
 ``Come on you two'' the man with cold eyes said again. He stepped closer to us both and reached down for our arms, I pulled away again. My sister started crying because she thought that they were going to take me somewhere bad but I assured her I was just scared.
 
 The three of them walked out of the room together leaving me with my sister who had been tied up too tightly to even get up. I felt terrible, I'm supposed to protect my little sister! I didn't want to leave her alone here but what if they took her away from me as well?
 
 ``Don't worry'' the man with cold eyes said again and his smile finally reached his eyes, making them look human. ``We are going home now so you don't have to worry about anything.''
 
 I tried not to think of it but something bad was definitely happening here!
 
 I grabbed my sisters hand as she looked at me and started crying again. We both walked out into the hallway together, leaving our mom and dad alone in that horrible room... for now anyways. I felt so guilty for not protecting them but what could have I done?
 
 ``There you go!'' The man with cold eyes said as he helped my sister up to her feet and out onto the walkway between buildings. They were taking us home, back to a world we had left behind long ago... it was time for me to face everything that happened in this place.
