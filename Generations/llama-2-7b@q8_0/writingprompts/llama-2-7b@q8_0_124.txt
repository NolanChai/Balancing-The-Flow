ah-aahh! ”
 
 The blade pierced through the skin of the left arm, up to the elbow. The girl screamed. Simon tried to help her but the woman grabbed him by his collar and pushed him aside. 
 
 “ It ’ s all right, it ’ s all right. ” The girl cried, trying to hide her injured hand with her free arm. Blood dripped from her wound. 
 
 Simon was furious but he couldn't say a word or take any action against the woman who had made him fall and cut himself by accident. She was a mother, a sister; she would never harm them on purpose. She had just acted out of reflex. He didn’t want to see her suffer in a world so cruel like this one but he couldn't help himself either. The girl’s cries had given him an awful headache and his body was getting colder and colder, as if his blood was flowing downhill. He wanted to take his clothes off again and warm up with her on the ground of that cold forest, next to the bonfire he would make for them both in order to keep warm, but instead he had to go back inside the cabin. 
 
 “ Let ’ s go inside, ” said the woman who had helped him at the beginning. Her words were still as sharp and sharp as before. 
 
 Simon walked along with her to that old, black shack made of wood and rope. He saw the candles lit on one side, next to a bed; he saw some bottles filled with water and food on another side, close to the fireplace, and then he saw a big bag in one corner. It had been lying there for at least thirty years without moving an inch. 
 
 “ I don ’ t know who put it here but it ’ s not mine. ” She said as she opened the door of the cabin. A candle was lit and a man was sitting on the only bed of that hut, reading something he had just written down with his fingertips on the old desk made out of wood and glass. He had big black curly hair; he was tall, thin but strong like a warrior. 
 
 “ Do you want to sit next to him? ” The woman asked Simon, pointing at that man who looked as if he were ready to get up and start fighting for his life in any moment. 
 
 He nodded his head. She took off his jacket, put it on the bed and left him there in his shirt, underwear and socks. Then she walked towards her husband, sat down next to him and placed a candle in front of them both. It was almost night now; she was going to stay with her man as long as that cold darkness would last. The three of them were going to be together for at least two weeks before the winter ended, even if they wouldn ’ t die from hunger or thirst until then. 
 
 “ What do you think is in that bag? ” Asked Simon, pointing his finger at it and making a question mark with his head towards the man sitting next to him. He had never seen such big eyes before. The pupils of both eyes looked like two round balls; they were like those of wild animals. 
 
 “ I don ’ t know, ” said the woman with a sigh. “ We ’ ll open it together and take turns for every day until we reach our destination. ” She thought about her daughter who was waiting for them on their way back home and wondered if they would ever see each other again or if she had died in that dark and cold forest, just like so many other women in the past. 
 
 “ But how do you know it ’ s not poison? ” Asked Simon. He wasn ’ t used to trusting people with whom he was meeting for the first time; especially not when they were strangers who had saved his life and took him into their house, all of that just because he was alone and hungry. 
 
 “ Because it 's a gift from my grandmother, ” replied the woman. She looked at her husband, then she said: 
 
 "I don ’ t know what it is, but I think we should try it anyway.” 
 
 Simon was confused. He didn’t understand why he was there or why those two people had saved his life. His body was freezing and every time he tried to stand up he got dizzy again. It was as if a curse had been put on him, the same kind of curse that made animals want to kill humans at any moment they could; it was like when one gets attacked by a tiger or another wild animal while crossing its territory. The only way to survive that situation is to stay calm and be smart enough to not do anything stupid before it's too late...
