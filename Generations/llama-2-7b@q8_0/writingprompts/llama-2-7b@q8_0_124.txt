 and Nicole, who ran the marketing department. They were both idiots, but they worked well together and we all knew it. James would take advantage of their relationship by getting her to buy shit for him at meetings when he didn't have the balls to do it himself. 
`` You look like you're about to explode.'' Nicole said with a smile, giving me that fake I'm-trying-to-be-helpful voice people use with babies. 
 ``It's my last day here and I still have to see James?'' 
 ``I think you're making a big deal about this. He'll be back soon enough.'' 
 She was right, of course. It had been a long week of getting the place ready for him, and now he was in a meeting with the bosses. I knew James would never come into the office without Nicole by his side. They were so fucking perfect together that sometimes it made me sick to my stomach. 
 ``You've been working here for over twelve years. You're going to miss him.'' She had a point. It was true, I was going to miss the place. This was where I spent more than half of my day and most of my life. But it wasn't me. 
``I don't think I ever really belonged here in the first place.'' That made Nicole pause for a second, and then she gave me one of her big fake smiles. 
``Well, we'll miss you around the water cooler.'' 
 ``There's no water fountain. We have soda machines. And it's not like there will be any water to put in them.'' I wasn't being mean or anything; I just didn't care anymore about my job or anyone who worked here. It was time to move on and let these assholes figure out their own shit. 
 Nicole laughed, that fake laugh again, then turned back toward her desk. She always looked better from the back than she did up front. Her ass wasn't perfect, but it didn't need to be either. It was a nice shape, and I liked how she worked it, showing it off. 
``I'll miss you too,'' she said as we went our separate ways. She walked away from me slowly, her hips swaying back and forth. It was obvious that she had been doing that on purpose. Nicole always loved to have attention brought to her ass. 
``And if you need a place to stay until things are straightened out with your mom...'' That was the first thing I heard when I got in my car after work, and it made me want to scream at the top of my lungs. 
``She's not going anywhere. She has nowhere else to go.'' 
 ``I don't care if she does or doesn't. I'm still here for you until you get back on your feet.'' My brother was a good guy, but sometimes he acted like the biggest idiot ever when it came to my mom. He would always want to help her out and fix things up, but then he'd end up hurting her even more than if he had done nothing at all. It wasn't fair, and I hated him for it. 
``So what are you going to do?'' 
 ``I don't know, probably just stay here with her until things start looking better. I'm sure she'll be back in a few weeks.'' He didn't seem convinced, but he didn't push it either way. My brother and I were pretty close these days; we had always been good friends growing up together, but after college things had gotten strained between us for some reason that neither of us could put our finger on. We had both moved back to the area where we grew up in Michigan, so I guess we just ran into each other more often than before. 
``How's work?'' My brother had asked me earlier about my job situation and what was going on at the office. I didn't really want to talk about it with him because he would probably end up telling our mom anyway, but I knew that if she found out then it would be even worse than usual. 
 ``Great,'' I said. ``Things have been going great at work.'' I was lying through my teeth. Things hadn't been going well for me in the past few months since they had laid off a bunch of people and cut back on hours. My job wasn't all that bad compared to some places around town, but it was enough that I needed another one soon or else we would be forced to move somewhere cheaper until things got better. 
``So what are you doing tonight?'' He asked as he started to drive me home after work. I knew where this was going, and I had been thinking about it all day. My brother was always trying to set me up with some girl from church or something like that; they were all nice girls but none of them seemed very interested in me for one reason or another (I guess because I wasn't interested). 
``Nothing really.'' It was the truth, and I hated it. My brother knew how much I hated dating girls from church, but he would still try to set me up with some girl anyway. Maybe it was because he wanted to make sure that our mother never felt alone again after losing my father last year (I had tried to explain this to him many times before), or maybe it was because he thought I needed to find a nice girl and start having kids right away, but either way the result was always the same. 
``Okay, well you should really try dating again sometime soon.'' He said as we pulled into our driveway at home. 
 ``I don't think so, I'll probably just stay here until things look up for my mom and then we can move to a different part of town or something like that.'' That was what I had decided earlier in the day, but now that my brother had brought it up again I couldn't help feeling guilty about it. 
``That would be great, you know? You could finally get some rest from having to take care of your mother all by yourself.'' He knew how much she needed me and how hard it was for her sometimes since there were only two of us in our family now that my father had passed away last year (I still hadn't told him about my mom leaving or anything like that). 
``Well, I guess we could try it sometime.'' He said with a smile before pulling into the driveway at home and getting out of his car to go inside our house where I was already sitting on the couch waiting for him so that we could talk about what had happened today (or more specifically what hadn't happened yet). 
``I think that might be wise,'' my brother said before he left me alone in the living room. He seemed happy about this whole thing because he knew how much it would mean to our mother if she finally found someone who wanted her and loved her back just like I do now (after all these years). 
``So what are you doing tonight?'' He asked again before walking away from me in the direction of his bedroom where we both knew that he was going to sleep for at least another hour or two before work tomorrow morning. It didn't matter how late it got because my brother always woke up early anyway so as soon as I heard him start snoring again then there would be no stopping him until he got out of bed and went somewhere else around town where people knew who he was (not just me).
Alyssa is a tall, slender girl. She has long blonde hair and blue eyes that are framed by thick eyelashes. She wears glasses, which she doesn't like to admit because it makes her feel old-fashioned. Alyssa's skin is pale with freckles across the bridge of her nose and on her cheeks.
The first time I saw her was at a party in my friend's house during senior year of high school. She came over to talk to me about this project we were working on together for English class--she didn't really know me very well then but wanted someone else besides her best friend (who happened to be dating my ex-boyfriend) so she chose me instead! We got along well enough that I agreed to help her out, even though it meant missing out on some time with other people at the party.
When I say Alyssa is tall I mean taller than most girls in our class; she was about six inches taller than any of us at school but still shorter than most boys because she's very slender as well. It took me a while before I realized how short everyone else around her actually was compared to her height--they all seemed so much smaller when they were standing next to each other!
Alyssa has always been one of my best friends since high school ended (and even before then). We met up for lunch almost every day during the summer after graduation, and we still see each other whenever our schedules allow it.
I've known Alyssa since she was a freshman in college. She went to school with me but lived across town so I didn't really know her very well until senior year when everyone started dating and hanging out
