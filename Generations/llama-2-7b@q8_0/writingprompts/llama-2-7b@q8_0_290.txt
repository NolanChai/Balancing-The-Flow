 instead. She's not here any more. We never did see that movie. She was dead by the time it came out on video. 
She always liked Star Wars. She watched them all when they first came out and she really enjoyed them then, but there wasn't a lot of science fiction in her life after that. She had an amazing mind for numbers and science, but she didn't care about the new sci-fi movies. I was just as bad. We always used to talk about seeing those Star Wars movies again together, so now we never will. I've seen them on my own a couple of times since she died. They don't mean anything any more. It's not like we were huge Star Wars fans or anything. 
She was beautiful. She didn't look her age at all. That's what everyone said, but it wasn't true. I guess people have to say that kind of thing, even if they don't really mean it, but she didn't look young any more than the rest of us. We were just used to seeing her every day, so we couldn't really notice when she aged. It was only now, in the months after she died, that I noticed what a good-looking woman she had been.
She didn't care about her looks, but she cared about me being happy, and she was always trying to fix things up for me, even though it made no difference at all. That was one of the reasons I loved her so much. She would spend hours talking to some guy on the phone, trying to fix him up with someone else, or just make sure he wasn't lonely and that kind of thing. It wasn't because she thought we were better people than other people. She didn't think that way at all. I think it was just that she really loved everyone who came into contact with her. And not just the ones who needed a bit of fixing up, either. She liked them all, and they always knew that. I don't know how anyone could be that loving towards other people without being a bit crazy about it or something. I guess she was just born that way. It wasn't any fault of hers.
She was nice to everyone because she was happy with me. She wanted all the people in her life to be as good and kind to each other as they were to her. And if there was one thing I could say for sure about her, it would have to be that she was a lot nicer than most people give her credit for being. People always said terrible things about her behind her back because she wasn't very nice to them or whatever, but they never actually said anything out loud because they knew she didn't deserve it and it would make their own lives miserable if they did. She was a good person and they just couldn't understand why she was like that with them. They didn't know what kind of life we had together. I guess it takes people to see the truth, and even then they don't always want to believe what they see because it's hard to imagine someone being as nice as she was to her own husband, let alone other people.
The night before she died, we were in bed together watching TV, like this. We had just come home from one of our trips and the first thing we did was watch Star Wars on video. She liked it when I got home because she could see me for real again, without me being all dirty and sweaty or whatever. It would be a couple of days before she saw what I really looked like and then she wouldn't have to pretend any more that everything was okay with my coming back in a smelly old pair of trousers that were too big for me and a shirt that had seen better days, but I guess she knew it wasn't because she never said anything. She knew I didn't want her to see what kind of state I was in, so she made sure that everything was nice and clean when I got back from my trips. It was only for me that she did it, too, not just for anyone else who came into the house.
She was a lot stronger than people think she was because she would do things like that to make me happy without any reason other than that she wanted to see me looking good when I got home from working away and then she would be all embarrassed if it came out, like she thought she should be ashamed of herself for doing something so nice and loving for her husband. She never meant anything by it at all, though. She didn't want anyone to think we were too rich or whatever, just because we had a nice house and could afford things that other people couldn't. It wasn't that she felt any need to apologise for the way we lived our lives together either. I think she did it because she loved me more than anything else in the world. If you love someone like that then there isn't really anything much you wouldn't do for them, is there? 
I miss her now and I will always miss her. I have no idea what my life would be like without her in it any more. It would probably just be over. I couldn't bear to think of living another day without her in it. She was the only person who ever really understood me for what I was, and we were each other's best friend, as well as being husband and wife. Without her, there isn't anything left to live for now, is there? 
She was always my favourite movie star because of how beautiful she looked on screen but more than that it was just because of everything else about her that no one knew or saw. She wasn't as great a person in the movies as she really was when I got to know her properly, though she did seem like a kind and loving woman then too. When I think back on how amazed I was by her in those early movies and what it felt like being with her after I had known her for years and all, it makes me realise just how lucky I am to have found someone so nice as my wife. It makes me feel really blessed that she loved me enough to get married even though everyone said we shouldn't because of the way things were between us back then. 
I can honestly say that if there hadn't been anyone else in the world who was as nice and kind as her, I still would have married her when I did, anyway. Maybe it wouldn't have been any good for either one of us, but I know now that even if no-one else in the whole universe had ever been born other than my wife and me, we could still have spent our lives together and been perfectly happy with each other forever. Even if no one else was around at all, it would have made absolutely no difference to the way I felt about her and how she felt about me. I just don't think anyone can ever really understand what it means to love someone that much. It's like they are not really in this world any more after you have spent enough time with them so you can feel exactly who they are inside, even when there is no-one else around to see or hear them talking. 
When she was alive we never talked about her being gone forever. I don't think either of us ever expected that it would come to this. I guess that is just something that has happened because nobody wanted to let go of the idea that it wasn't true, even when they could see with their own eyes what had happened. It isn't a nice feeling now to realise there was nothing we could do about it and she really did die. There is no way back for us any more.
 
I love you, honey, and I miss you so much. I will never stop missing you. I don't know how long I can go on without you now. Maybe I should have just let you stay away from me like everyone said we both needed to do if there was any chance at all that we could ever make things work out between us. It hurts so much every single day and every night too, not knowing whether or not the pain will get even worse before it stops altogether one morning when I wake up with you gone from my life forever. 
I can't imagine living without you any more than I could ever see you being happy anywhere else but right beside me and having all those people around who never understood how lucky they were to know us for even a few minutes or whatever, even though that's the kind of thing other people would have wanted if they had only been able to understand what it felt like to be close enough to us so you could actually see things from our point of view. 
I hope you are happy wherever you are now. I know you weren't a religious woman, but maybe there is someone watching over you right now who will make everything come out okay for all of us in the end. Maybe you have already found them by now and they are waiting to be with you again once we get through this terrible time together without you. 
I don't want to think about being alone any more than I have to, but it is true that there is no way back for me from where we were before you died and even if that was the only kind of future available for either one of us in here, it would still be a lot better than anything else. 
I miss you so much.
