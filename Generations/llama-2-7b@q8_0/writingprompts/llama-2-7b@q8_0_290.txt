 remember how the snow seemed to dance in the air and bounce off the frozen ground. But all that mattered at the time was that I had lost my only true friend, confidant, and mentor. 
 I watched him suffer for months from Alzheimer’s disease. His mind was gone but his body remained. He could not speak or think clearly, so I read to him daily and played music softly in the background while he sat there staring into space. It was heartbreaking watching my grandfather waste away like that. 
 Whenever possible, I tried to take him out of his assisted living home for a change of scenery. I had hoped one day we could go fishing together but alas, it was not meant to be. 
 On the day he died, I told my grandfather how much I loved him and that I would miss him dearly. He did not say anything back—he just smiled weakly at me. That moment haunts me still. My grandfather did not get a chance to see his children and grandchildren one last time or hear our voices one more time before he went on his journey to the afterlife, so I made it my mission to make sure he saw everyone who loved him as best I could. 
 There were so many things I wanted to say to my grandfather but did not because I was afraid of how difficult it would be. The truth is that I'm still dealing with this grief and don’t know when or if I will ever recover from the loss, although my grandfather lives in my heart forevermore. 
 At his funeral service, I gave an emotional eulogy which you can listen to here:

 Part II will be about my grandfather’s legacy and what I learned from him that has shaped who I am today. Stay tuned for more!
