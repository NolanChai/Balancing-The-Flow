itive in all aspects of my life – and when it comes to women, that means no one is going to beat me at anything. I make sure of that with a combination of wit, charm, and a little bit of money. In any case, I have never lost an argument because the last person who tried was also the only woman in history who ever managed to get off on top. 
 
 I love being on top and nothing beats it – except maybe me! I am like a champagne cork: popping one day and going flat the next. And I refuse to apologize for that. 
 
 It's not easy finding someone you can trust these days, so I try my best to be loyal. To those who are closest to me – my family, friends, fans – it means everything in the world to know they have got my back when they need me most.
I am the face of success. A champion. A winner. 
 
 My name is Kendra James and I don't take no for an answer.
