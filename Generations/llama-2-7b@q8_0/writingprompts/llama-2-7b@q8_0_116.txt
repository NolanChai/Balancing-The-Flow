1970s design, but it'd been built to last forever and now it was falling apart. As if on cue, one of its support beams cracked as it crashed down onto the roof. Water splashed from the roof into the parking lot below and Veronica stepped off her perch and sprinted away across the street toward her apartment. 
 
 The watchers had been there for hours; most had spent all day in line waiting for a turn to watch the old water tower come down, but this was too much. It wasn't the falling of the tower that caused the mass exodus, it was the shit-word spoken by Veronica as she ran off. She was an angel who cursed? How did they know she was an angel at all? Didn't she look human? No one had even noticed her wings until she jumped from the tower and flew away, which only made things more confusing. 
 
 As they fled down the street toward their cars and buses and vans, no one talked about what they'd seen or heard at all; the words were just spoken in an almost automatic way: `` Shit.'' 
 
 They drove away from the water tower with that single word echoing inside their heads and the question of why they were saying it without knowing if anyone else had heard it remained unanswered. As they pulled into the parking lot at the school Veronica attended, she climbed out of her car and walked toward the building, where a crowd of students was gathered on the steps. She joined them, stood in line with other kids waiting for their chance to walk through the door into the school, and then disappeared inside when the doors opened. 
 
 As they continued driving away from the scene of the water tower's demise, most of the adults who were watching that day felt sure they would never forget Veronica's word or her actions but after a couple days, some people had forgotten. Those who remembered it often said `` Shit'' whenever the thought of what happened crossed their minds, even if no one else was around to hear them say it.
