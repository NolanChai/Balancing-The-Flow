 a collection of metal pipes wailing out to create such an incredible sound...it's just mind-boggling how this thing can be played.
I was raised in the Church of Christ, so I have had many years playing piano for Sunday school services and other religious events. For my high school graduation present, my parents gave me a 32 note electronic organ that I spent many hours on, as well as some classical music.
In college, I took Organ Appreciation classes from Professor G.W. White, who was a world-class organist and had the privilege of playing at Carnegie Hall several times. The courses were about two hours in length, but felt much shorter because his lectures were so interesting and entertaining. His passion for the instrument was obvious from day one.
It took me years to finally begin studying with Dr. White when I was an adult. We began by going over Bach's Prelude & Fugue No. 1 in C Major, and he started me off on my first pipe organ with a couple of manuals (keyboards) and pedals (feet).
Toward the end of his life, Professor White had begun suffering from Parkinson's disease, so I had to take over as his student. He passed away in 2010 at age 89, but will be remembered for his love and dedication to this amazing instrument we call the pipe organ.
