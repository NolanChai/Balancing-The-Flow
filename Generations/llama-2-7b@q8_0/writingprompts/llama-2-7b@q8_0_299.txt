orm room shelves and on the windowsill overlooking the living room of my first apartment, as well as my current home, a one-bedroom in North Beach that I shared with an ex-junkie named Chuck who smoked meth off the stove. They were good times, those days. Before my life was defined by debt and alcoholism. When it still made sense to have faith in others.
Those were different balls then—black on both sides, each with a single hole in the center. A different set of weights that I'd never really understood how to use. When my wife bought them for me, she said they would help me relax. She also said there was nothing wrong with wanting more than the life I had and it didn't matter what other people thought.
I told her about how my brother and his family were vacationing in San Francisco and we were planning to meet up at a restaurant later that night, but afterward maybe head over to their hotel room for some drinks. We talked about the weather forecast—the possibility of rain—and I explained how we'd be staying late to work on a writing assignment due tomorrow, so she might as well go home and get a good night's rest before coming back out later with my brother and his family.
But in the end it was all a lie. I didn't meet my brother at dinner or head over to their hotel room for drinks—I spent that time working on a writing assignment. It wasn't due tomorrow, but there was this big project coming up—a month from now. I had already written some of the draft and I needed to make progress if I hoped to get it done in time. So instead of staying with my wife at dinner or spending time with her family that night, I worked on my assignment until well past two in the morning.
That was years before this, when things were still good between us—at least from her perspective. But I'd been losing money and sleep over the last few months while trying to find a job teaching English as a second language. It wasn't easy to get hired since my graduate degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop was in fiction, not TEFL or ESL. My wife couldn't understand why I wouldn't just teach composition at a local college for a few semesters while we waited for me to finish a book of short stories and start submitting them to literary journals so that eventually they could sell it to a small press or self-publish it through a company like Amazon.
I told her that I was doing this because I didn't want to teach composition, but she didn't understand why not: I had been teaching at the university level for years and I knew it would be easy enough to get hired somewhere as long as I had my master's degree in English from a respectable school. It wasn't like I was applying to become an accountant or something. But when she said that she didn't believe me, I got angry. "It doesn't matter what you think!"
She looked at me with those sad eyes of hers and told me that maybe it did. Then she left the apartment without saying goodbye. That night I went to bed alone. The next morning my wife was gone too. She took our dog, a small black shitzu named Ginny who had always followed her around everywhere like some sort of loyal sidekick in one of those old movies where there's this detective who gets framed for murder and has to solve his own case before he gets executed by the bad guys.
Ginny was the only thing that I liked about my wife, which is why it hurt so much when she took her away. But I also knew that Ginny would be happier with someone who appreciated her more than I did. In some ways she reminded me of me—always wandering around looking for something to eat or another person's attention—and this made me wonder if maybe we were both just too stupid to survive in the world, which is why no one wanted us.
The next week my wife moved out and I started going to AA meetings on the south side of San Francisco, where I met a bunch of guys who all seemed much happier than me—maybe even successful! They told me how they were going to get jobs teaching composition at local colleges so they could write fiction in their spare time. Then when they finished those books (which would be easy since most of them already had plenty of material from life itself), they'd publish them through Amazon and make millions!
At the meetings I tried to think about how I'd written two novels that no one wanted—both set in California, but about different things. One was called "The Fault In Our Stars" after a novel by John Green; another book called "Written On The Wind." That last one was based on the movie of the same name starring Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall (who were both dead at that point).
In those meetings, I kept thinking about how my wife had moved out because she couldn't handle it anymore—because we hadn't been able to have children or get a good job teaching composition at some local college where maybe someday soon they'd publish one of her stories in their literary magazine so that eventually people would read them and want me to write more books for them. But the thing was, I didn't really care about any of this stuff anymore—it was just something we did because it was what society expected us to do.
Now when I looked at my wife and tried to imagine her with a job or even maybe a baby (which she wanted so badly), all that came into focus was how sad she seemed whenever she talked about those things: like she didn't know who she was without them anymore—like they were the only thing that defined her in this world. And because I loved my wife more than anything else, I knew there would never be any hope for us if we kept going down this path together . . . so it had been best for both of us to end our relationship and start over again somewhere new where neither one of us felt trapped anymore by all these expectations society put on us about who we should be or what kind of life we were supposed to have.
But the thing was, this didn't mean that I couldn't still love her—or that she wouldn't always remain an important part of my heart forever even though there would never again be anything between us except friendship. Which is why it hurt so much when I woke up one morning with a headache and found out that she'd gone away without telling me where she was going or when she might return—because although it felt good sometimes to have her in my life, other times like these made me wish I could just disappear from this world entirely and start over somewhere else where no one knew who I really was . . . which is why after writing those two novels without success (and also because they were both set in California), I decided that maybe it was time for me to finally move back home again.
When my wife left, she took our dog Ginny with her and this made me sad because even though we didn't talk much anymore when we were together—at least not after one of us had had too many drinks—Ginny always followed her around everywhere like some sort of loyal sidekick in an old movie where there's a detective who gets framed for murder but has to solve his case before he gets executed by the bad guys.
I tried calling and texting my wife to let her know how much I loved Ginny (who reminded me of myself at times), but she never answered any of my messages or returned any calls, so eventually I stopped trying altogether because it felt like there was no point in continuing this charade anymore—not if things weren't going to change between us.
The only thing that kept me from giving up completely on our relationship at this time was how much I still cared about my wife even though she seemed determined not to return any calls or messages, which made it seem like we had nothing left in common anymore except memories of happier times when life felt better than today—and maybe someday soon things would improve once again so that hopefully one day she might return my phone calls or texts again just as before.
But until then there was no point in trying harder since I already knew what it was like being without her—like how sometimes you wake up with a headache and don't know where to turn for help when everything around you feels wrong or strange or even scary because all of a sudden life has changed completely from what it used to be before, which is why eventually I decided that maybe there was no point in trying harder either since nothing else seemed possible anymore except ending this charade once and for all so that hopefully someday soon she might return my phone calls or texts again just like before—only better because now things would finally feel right once more between us.
In the meantime, however (since life had changed completely), I decided to start going back home again where no one knew who I really was except maybe Ginny since even though it hurt me sometimes how little he cared about what happened during his daily routines anymore either—even though I still loved him anyway because maybe someday soon things would improve once more so that hopefully one day we might return each other's phone calls again just like before . . . only better!
