2 hours before they blow up the island everyone just went about their day like nothing was happening. ''

`` I've been looking for this movie everywhere and it was not available on Netflix or anything so I downloaded it off of some shady site. But it was worth the risk. The whole movie is fantastic. From start to finish it held my attention. You get a good sense of how important the people on that island are in this story. Some characters you don't want to lose and they aren't and others you don't care if they survive but they do anyway. But what really makes this movie is the cinematography. It has some really great scenes and a lot of suspense as well. I would definitely recommend it if you like movies with a lot of action or just plain good movies in general. ''

`` This is one of those rare films that comes out of nowhere and hits your emotional buttons. It's a great movie about ordinary people being pushed to the extremes and beyond. If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and go watch it! ''

`` I liked the premise of this movie but the acting is terrible and it just isn't as good as the reviews lead you to believe. The ending is pretty cool though. ''

`` This was a very well done movie. It had some twists that I didn't see coming. The acting was very good and believable for the most part. My only complaint would be it seemed to have so many characters and you almost don't know who they are or why they are there until later in the movie which is a little confusing at first. But overall I really enjoyed this one. ''

`` The movie has got some serious holes in its plot, but it was still an enjoyable watch. The actors were great and so was the cinematography. It had me on the edge of my seat a few times. And I guess that's all you can ask for when watching an apocalyptic thriller. ''

`` It is such a strange concept. An island with two bridges and no boats to leave, and no way off but flying or swimming (both impossible). And no phones either, because the island's electrical power plant explodes for some reason. It could have been better if it were less silly, but I really enjoyed it. ''

`` A movie about a small town that is left cut off from the rest of society and then the world starts to fall apart around them as the whole planet goes through some kind of apocalyptic change. There are different people that are all on separate paths and you see their lives intertwine and eventually meet up with each other at the end. I won't go into much detail about this movie because I don't want to spoil anything but I will say it was a pretty good movie overall. ''
