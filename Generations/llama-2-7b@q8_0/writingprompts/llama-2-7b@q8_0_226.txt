 more limited. The constant grind of manual labor and fighting over resources was taking its toll. We needed a break from this madness and we thought we could get one at the planet called Earth, which seemed so peaceful.
The journey took us weeks, but finally we arrived on that beautiful green planet. This place made everything else look like a dumping ground. The atmosphere was thick with moisture, you could feel it in your lungs as soon as you stepped outside of our ship. The humidity seemed to drip off every surface and you could taste the water in the air.
The planet itself was teeming with life. From the moment we arrived we could see plants of all shapes and sizes, they were so vibrant, like nothing we had ever seen before. There were also animals running around everywhere, they seemed to be living their lives without any cares for us or what we thought about them. We could not believe how beautiful this place was.
We spent several days exploring the planet and it just got better with each passing day. The longer we stayed on Earth the more we realized that life here was so much simpler than what we had back home in space. People didn’t seem to be fighting over resources or worry about anything other than living their lives without interference from anyone else around them..
It felt like freedom after being locked up for so long in our ship just going through the motions everyday doing whatever it took just stay alive another day without any purpose other than getting paid at the end of each week if we were lucky enough to have jobs that is.. On earth life seemed almost perfect compared too what we had grown accustomed too living out here on this mining ship called *Stars Bounty* .
Suddenly everything changed though when one day while walking through town looking at all of the beautiful flowers blooming everywhere ,a small child approached us asking if she could see inside our suit since there were no windows where we came from due too radiation levels being so high back home.. We agreed knowing that this would be our last chance to ever experience something new before returning back out into space again forever….
