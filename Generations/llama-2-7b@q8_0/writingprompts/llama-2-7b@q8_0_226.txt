 those worlds would have evolved at approximately the same time, and developed similarly sophisticated forms of communication are so remote as to be ridiculous. The probability that a message would then travel from one world to another is infinitesimal. The possibility that we could receive that signal is practically non-existent!
And yet... we did.
The Probe was launched in 2006, and had been circling the Earth for two months before it finally arrived at its destination - a small, unremarkable star in an obscure corner of space known as Zeta Reticuli 18.
No one could explain why or how it arrived so quickly after launching.
The Probe was designed to receive transmissions from intelligent life-forms who might be interested enough to want to communicate with Earth, and then transmit that message back here via radio waves, which travel at the speed of light. The designers had assumed that this would take hundreds of years, even thousands - but the Probe arrived in just two months.
When it did arrive, everyone on Earth was surprised: there were no signals from aliens. Instead, what greeted the Probe was a message so simple and cryptic as to be meaningless... 'Nobody Here But Us Aliens'.
The Probe had been sent back into space almost immediately after receiving this message - but it wasn't until the next day that anyone realised why: because the message itself was a coded instruction. The entire Probe program had been designed to do one thing, and only one thing - to receive signals from intelligent life-forms who were interested enough in communicating with Earth to use a binary code to transmit information.
In other words, it turned out that we weren't the first ones who wanted to talk!
