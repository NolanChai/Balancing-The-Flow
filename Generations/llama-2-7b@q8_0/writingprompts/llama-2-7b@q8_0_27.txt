�by that I am not on Earth anymore.
I get to work and all of a sudden I see a big black thing with red eyes. It�s very scary. Then my friend sees it too. We run away from it because we don�t know what it is. But, we find out when we go home that there are other things like us. My name is Tanya, I am 11 years old and this happened to me about a year ago.
It was raining and the wind was really howling. We were in a big deserted city with lots of tall buildings. The rain was pouring down so hard that we couldn�t even see out of our sunglasses! It was very dark but then we heard something that sounded like a car door slamming shut and some people walking around near us.
I am in a town that is completely white except for my house, which is black. The sky is gray. Everything is dead. I can hear the rain falling on the roof. It�s been raining since forever! There are no cars or people here. I�ve never seen anyone but me. When I look out the window of my house, I see a building that looks like it has never been touched by human hands before.
I wake up one morning and find myself in a room with a bed. The walls are painted red and there is a window right above it so you can see outside. My bed is covered by white blankets with purple stripes on them, they�re really soft. There is also another bed next to mine but I don�t know what�s going on yet because the door hasn�t opened yet either.
I woke up in a room filled with light and looked out the window to see the sun setting on a distant mountain range. I was on my own, without a single person around me. The only sound that could be heard was the chirping of birds outside my window as they got ready for bed themselves.
The next day started like any other. I woke up early in the morning and got ready for work with no problems at all�but things were about to change. When I stepped out into the hallway, I noticed a few people staring at me funny and walking faster than usual. Their eyes followed me everywhere I went; when I sat down they would sit too, when I stood up they did the same thing! It was so strange that by lunchtime I had decided it might be better just to stay indoors all day long instead of dealing with this kind of attention from strangers.
When I opened my eyes and found myself looking at the sky, I knew something was wrong. I was lying on my side in a white room with no furniture or windows. The only thing that made me feel better was the smell of food coming from somewhere nearby.
