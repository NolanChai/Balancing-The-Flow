ly recently how I had fallen unconscious in the woods. 
 
 My mind began to swim with memories from before I was knocked out by some sort of spell. 
 
 I remembered running through a thick forest, my eyes scanning every branch for a glimpse of danger, but nothing seemed threatening. 
 
 The only sound in the woods was that of my heart beating furiously against my chest; my lungs were already becoming painful with exertion and I knew that soon enough they would no longer have any strength left to supply me. 
 
 But then, all at once, a great roar erupted from within the trees, one which shook the very foundations of the forest. 
 
 In front of me stood a large beast, with eyes that burned with flames. 
 
 It's huge body was covered in thick fur, and it had huge fangs hanging down from its mouth. 
 
 I stood paralyzed as the creature raised one arm up, reaching towards me. 
 
 The next moment it let out a deep cry of pain and fell to its knees, shaking its head in confusion. 
 
 `` What...'' I murmured softly, confused at this odd development. 
 
 Before I could take another breath the creature rose back to its feet and continued towards me with a hungry look in its eyes. 
 
 I stumbled backwards as it began to close in on me quickly, the sounds of branches breaking under its weight filling my ears. 
 
 All at once, out of nowhere, an arrow struck the beast right through the eye and into its head. 
 
 The creature fell dead upon the ground, still for a moment before shaking again. 
 
 As it came to rest I noticed that another man had appeared behind me; he was tall with short brown hair and wore green clothing. 
 
 `` Thank you...'' I whispered breathlessly. 
 
 ``Oh, of course,'' said the man lightly. 
 
 He glanced down at my arm as his hand came to rest on it, before pulling off one of my gloves and handing it to me. 
 
 I took the glove back and pulled it onto my left hand quickly. 
 
 ``Is there anything else you need?'' asked the man. 
 
 His voice was smooth but contained a sharp edge; I knew that he could be dangerous if pushed too far. 
 
 The sound of another arrow striking close to me made me jump, and I whirled around to see the source of the noise: there stood yet another archer dressed in green. 
 
 He wore no helmet but his eyes seemed familiar, as though I had seen them somewhere before; I squinted my eyes against the light and finally remembered where: he was the man who had saved me earlier. 
 
 ``You've got good aim...'' I whispered softly. 
 
 The archer smiled and said nothing in return, just took a bow from his back and began to string it once again. 
 
 He did not look as though he would be talking for the moment. 
 
 ``Thank you both...'' I whispered again, glancing between them. 
 
 They both nodded but said nothing more; it was clear that they were not particularly friendly people. 
 
 The next moment a large bang sounded behind me and the archers had both turned around to shoot something else down. 
 
 I followed their gazes and saw what had startled them, a group of three bears roaring through the forest in our direction. 
 
 ``I'll take care of those...'' said the man with green clothing as he reached out his hands and released two powerful blasts that knocked all of the bears off their feet. 
 
 The one I had met earlier then turned to me once again, a strange look in his eyes. 
 
 ``Now you have something which was stolen from me...'' he said calmly as he held out an object to me; it looked like some sort of medallion with a dark gemstone set into the center. 
 
 I accepted it gingerly and my fingers ran over its smooth surface, feeling for any kind of mark that would tell me who had made this. 
 
 ``I have not seen anything like this before...'' I murmured to myself, wondering if this was a normal thing to own such an item. 
 
 The man smiled again and said nothing in return; instead he walked away into the trees with no sign of where he had gone off too. 
 
 After about five minutes there came the sound of two more arrows being shot, hitting their mark on yet another group of creatures that appeared to be after me. 
 
 I ran back towards the man, who stood patiently waiting for me. 
 
 ``Do you know where we are?'' I asked quickly, wondering if this man could tell me my location. 
 
 He gave a short laugh and said: ''Of course I do... You're in the forest of the dead.''
