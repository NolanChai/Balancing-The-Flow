 somehow it feels like we never spent enough time together. 

I have never been good at writing letters and I am sure this one will not be read by any other human being...it's for the sake of closure...something I desperately need to find in myself.
 
 My only wish is that you know how much you mean to me...that your kindness, compassion, and generosity touched my life so deeply that I will never be able to repay you. Your warm heart has melted the coldest of hearts and made an unforgettable imprint in my mind forever. 

 You are such a beautiful person on the inside as well as on the outside...I can only pray that someone with your amazing spirit will come into my life again some day. I would love to be able to show you how much you mean to me but until then, please know this:
