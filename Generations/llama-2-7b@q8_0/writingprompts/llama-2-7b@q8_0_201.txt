-Bill Clinton at the service for Harry Dean Stanton.
On July 14th 2017, American character actor Harry Dean Stanton passed away after a battle with Lung cancer. The Hollywood Reporter wrote on August 9th that he had died of natural causes in Los Angeles two days prior to his passing. He was known for his roles in Cool Hand Luke (1967), Paris, Texas (1984) and Red Dawn (1984). But one of my favorite films he starred in was John Carpenter's 1982 film Escape from New York.
In the film, Harry played "The Duke" who leads an all out war against Snake Plissken to save the president from a dangerous mission in New York city, which has been turned into one big prison after the United States is overthrown by foreign forces and turned into a giant maximum security jail.
While it's true that his performance was not exactly top-notch (which happens sometimes), there are still things I like about his portrayal of The Duke. Firstly, he was an experienced actor who had worked in over 200 films and TV shows since the 50s. Secondly, the character has a very cool and mysterious persona as well as a strong sense of morality. But most importantly, I feel that Harry Dean Stanton himself was truly a bad-ass person, one who was both funny and full of wisdom, someone you would love to be friends with if you had a chance.
With that said, let's get on with the list. Here are 5 reasons why I believe Harry Dean Stanton was indeed "a bad ass" in real life:
Harry Dean Stanton as The Duke in John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1982)
#1 He had a strong sense of morality and was always true to his beliefs.
I believe that Harry Dean Stanton was one who truly lived by the quote "Think for yourself, question authority," because he wasn't afraid to speak up even when it meant going against certain people in power. I think this is shown most prominently during his portrayal of The Duke in Escape from New York (1982) where he is trying to free the president and Snake Plissken, who had been left for dead after a botched mission.
It's true that The Duke himself doesn't have much screen time in this movie but when he does speak out against those who are holding him hostage (i.e., "The Warden" played by Darrell Zwerling and his goons), it is clear that Harry Dean Stanton meant every word as if they were coming from an old friend of ours, someone you could trust because they had always been there for us when we needed them most.
In addition to having strong morals himself, Harry also seemed very supportive towards others who had strong beliefs and opinions too - something that's apparent by watching clips from interviews with him over the years where he often spoke out against various forms of oppression such as racism or sexism in society today!
#2 He was an actor who made you laugh.
Harry Dean Stanton has always been a man who was known for making people laugh and that is one of the reasons why I love him so much. If you ask me, he's just like Jim Carrey from Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). You know what they say about comedians right? "They make you laugh because it hurts." Well guess what? Harry Dean Stanton was no different! He used humor to get his message across and make people think twice before crossing him or going against him.
In Escape from New York (1982), he played The Duke who had been left for dead after a botched mission but instead of being bitter about it all, he decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to teach these jerks a lesson they wouldn't soon forget! So what did he do? He turned up in New York City looking like something straight out of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and then started shooting people left and right until everybody else decided enough was enough.
I think it goes without saying that if you're gonna play a character who is tough as nails, then you need to look like somebody who could kick your ass at any given moment! That's why I love watching Harry Dean Stanton because not only does he make me laugh but also inspires me to be better person than myself.
#3 He was an actor who knew how to get the most out of his role.
Harry Dean Stanton played The Duke in Escape from New York (1982) and if there's one thing that I can say about him after watching this movie, then it would be "He sure knows how to make a character come alive!" The man had so much charisma on screen that you couldn't help but want more of him. Even when he was playing villains like in Alien 3 (1992), I found myself rooting for his character just because I loved seeing him act!
In Escape from New York, Harry Dean Stanton didn't have much screen time but every second that he was on-screen felt important and you could tell that this was someone who knew how to make their presence felt. Even though he might not be in the movie for long, it was clear that he had done his homework when it came time to filming and I'm sure that John Carpenter appreciated having such an experienced actor on set!

This character is not only tough but also kind-hearted which makes him even more badass than he already appears to be! And you know what? It's not just me who thinks so because according to Harry himself, "If I had been left for dead by my country then it would have made me angry enough to take out every single one of them!"

In this article, I tried to explain why Harry Dean Stanton was such a badass actor by listing five reasons that show his talent as both on-screen presence as well off. But even if you don't agree with my opinion, at least you can say one thing: there is no doubt about it - Harry Dean Stanton was truly someone who lived up to expectations!
If I were asked which actor should receive an award for his contributions towards cinema then without any hesitation whatsoever; I would have no choice but to nominate him!
