em and that stupid girl. She would have to die soon.. and then he could leave this hell.
The smell of decaying flesh filled the air. He had been here too long.... They needed to kill her before it was too late.. but they never came out, they were scared to come close to him because she might get him... the boy's parents did n't deserve this hell.
The boy moved towards a clearing, he knew that they were watching him, they were always here with their eyes on him, waiting for him to move so they could strike.. and the girl, well she would just have to die. It was time, but they had to kill her before it was too late... he heard something moving behind a tree, a twig breaking. He moved in the direction of the sound... they were all going to die.. except him...he was the only one who could survive this hell.... and he knew that he needed them both dead soon or else he would have no chance at escaping.
The boy looked down into his own arms, he had been staring at a picture of himself with the girl in it for days now, the boy never liked the girl but she was still his friend. He could hear footsteps moving closer to him... they were coming, and they did not have long....
