idding me a goodbye for a few hours.
 
I turn to look at the car, it's been packed for months already. I know that we are taking this trip just because I'm crazy about my girlfriend Cassandra but that doesn't matter anymore. The trip has always been planned and now its time to enjoy our holiday with each other.
 
 `` So long babe,'' I call out to her as she waves at me before disappearing inside the house.
 
The car is still running so I get into it. This is a great car but one thing that bugs me about this ride is its engine, the thing never seems to be quiet and even when its off, there is some kind of noise coming out of the engine compartment. I take my hand off the ignition key and put it down on the steering wheel. As I do so, the car goes dead silent for a few seconds and then starts making noises again. I take the hand back off the steering wheel, place it on the ignition and turn it on. 

 The engine cranks to life immediately but as soon as the starter motor stops, there are noises coming out of the engine compartment once more.
 
I look at my watch to see that I still have some time before we leave so I decide to stay here for a while. As I sit inside, the car goes silent again and stays quiet until the engine cools down which takes around 15 minutes. Once it has done that, I place my hand on the steering wheel again and turn the ignition on. 

 The engine turns over as usual but as soon as the starter motor stops, there is a noise coming out of the engine compartment once more.
 
I take my hand off the steering wheel this time and sit down in the driver's seat, it seems to me like this car just doesn't want to shut up even when its not running! I guess that there must be some kind of faulty component inside but with how old this car is I am sure that its going to cost an arm and a leg to replace. 
 
I put my hand back onto the steering wheel once more, turn the ignition on and take it off immediately again. 
 
This time there are no sounds coming from the engine compartment but the car still seems to be making some kind of noise even though its off! I stare at the dashboard in confusion as I try to figure out where that noise is actually coming from. As I sit here and look around, it's like I can sense something else inside the car with me!
 
 My eyes slowly drift across to the passenger seat on my right side; this is usually Cassandra's side but since she isn't here today I get into it instead. When I do so, I notice that there is an odd smell coming from inside of this car even though I know for a fact that no one has been riding in it with me! 
 
I turn the ignition key on again and take my hand off the steering wheel once more but still there are no sounds coming out of the engine compartment. When I place my hands down on the steering wheel, they start to feel wet so I wipe them clean against one another before turning it back off again. 
 
I look over at where Cassandra usually sits and notice that her seat belt is still buckled up as if someone has been sitting there recently! As soon as these thoughts run through my head, the car starts making noises once more.
