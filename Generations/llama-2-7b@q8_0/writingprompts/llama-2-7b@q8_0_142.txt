 The figure grinned at me, exposing his teeth. ''My name is Drakh'Thor, and I am the last son of Thulgorath.'' 
 
 ``What are you talking about? I don't know anything about a Thulgorath.'' 
 
 ``No...you know nothing at all. You are but a puppet for the gods.'' His hand moved toward mine, and his skin felt warm to my touch. ''They will keep you alive for now.'' Drakh'Thor snorted at me with amusement. ''But one day they will have their revenge. I will be the first of many who will come after you.'' 
 
 ``I don't understand any of this,'' I told him. My body trembled with fear and anger, and my eyes began to water as I struggled against a choking sensation in my throat. ''But what did you want me for?'' 
 
 Drakh'Thor smiled at me. ``I was hired by the goddess of death, Morgoth, to murder you.' He took another step toward me. I tried to back away, but a strong hand pressed against my throat and tightened around it like an iron band. ''You see...this isn't your world anymore. This is Thulgorath now!'' 
 
 Drakh'Thor moved quickly in front of me, and I found myself staring down into the barrel of a large gun. ''Do you understand?'' he asked. His lips were almost pressed against mine. ``This isn't your world anymore...'' 
 
 ``But I live here!'' I tried to scream at him, but my voice was gone. Everything was gone in that instant......
