*It is. I know it is.*

<Junior is standing under a bright blue sky with a cloudless horizon, next to a huge mountainous terrain. To his left stands a large, rectangular black cube that resembles a massive chest; on the front of which are engraved the words "THE FALLOUT CHAMBER". The inside of this box has a pink hue, with a large square platform in the center. The edges of the platform are illuminated with soft green lights, and it's surrounded by a circular black dial that bears four hands: one pointing upward from each corner.*
*Suddenly, the left-hand dial begins to spin, and as its needle approaches midnight, a voice emanates from inside the box. It is a deep, dark, gravelly voice with a strong British accent that sounds somewhat distorted through the speaker.*
**Your time has come... ** *
*The door of the chamber opens slowly on hydraulic lifts, and Junior's mother enters first. She is clad in an immaculate white lab coat, a red neck tie and a pair of black heels; her hair is tied back into a neat ponytail and her face is clean-shaven. The rest of the room remains dark as she steps inside.*
**Ah yes... The newest arrival... ** *
*Her eyes widen at the sight of Junior, who's standing on the platform in a daze; then she walks over to him, gently taking his right hand in hers. She looks down into his eyes with a warm smile and says softly.*
**Junior. Oh my goodness, you look so... different from when I last saw you, but I'm so happy that you're finally here! **
*She hugs him tightly with her left arm while keeping hold of his right hand with her free hand. Then she looks at the black dial as it reaches midnight.*
**You have a choice to make... ** *
**Uh, I mean, yes?**
*Her expression turns to one of sternness and her eyes narrow slightly, then her tone turns formal.*
**If you're going to participate in the experiment, then you need to understand exactly what it is that we do here. **
*Junior looks at his mother with wide-eyes as she continues speaking, while the dial on the black box slowly approaches 12:00.*
**You and I are both scientists, Junior. We have studied this phenomenon for many years now; we've spent countless hours performing experiments to determine what exactly it is that causes an object to fall from one point in space to another. **
*The left hand dial stops at midnight. Junior looks downward and sees a small red light in the center of the platform.*
**We know with absolute certainty that there are countless objects floating through space all around us, but they're invisible because we cannot see them... ** *
*As he listens to his mother talk, he begins to think about what she is saying; then, suddenly, he has a eureka moment and turns towards her with an expression of amazement on his face. His eyes are wide open.*
**And the thing that causes it to fall? **
*He stares directly into the camera. The dial now reaches 12:00; the hands have stopped moving and the room goes dark, except for a dim red light that is shining brightly from inside the chamber. Junior looks down at his right hand as he says.*
**Is gravity... **
*The black box's door slams shut, but instead of falling, it floats upward toward the ceiling and fades into view over Junior's head; then the entire room goes dark, save for a single point of light shining down on him from above.*
*A moment later, Junior opens his eyes as he wakes up in bed. He turns to face his mother who is sitting next to him, looking at him with concern. His eyes are wide open and he stares directly into the camera, holding a small black cube in his left hand.*
**I just had this dream... ** *
*The dial on the black box now resembles midnight again, but instead of turning slowly like before, it moves quickly as if someone has suddenly turned the dial clockwise. The room goes dark and only the bright light above Junior remains illuminated.*
*The camera cuts to a shot of his bedroom door opening from outside.*
