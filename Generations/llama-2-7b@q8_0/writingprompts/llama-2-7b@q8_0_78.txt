in a shabby brown coat and a high black hat that looked like it had been pummelled by more than one fist. The crowd parted, making way for him as he took off his hat, and everyone watched him in amazement. He was young but gaunt, with sunken cheeks, hollow eyes and dark circles under them. His hair hung in a greasy tangle over his forehead and his skin looked like it had been covered in coal dust. His eyes were like two black pits and the people in the shop shrank back as he looked around him at the merchandise. ‘A loaf of bread, please,’ he said to Agatha. She stood up from where she was crouching on the floor, brushing herself down, and frowned at him. ‘Well, what do you want?’ He shook his head in bewilderment. ‘I need a loaf of bread.’ ‘How much money have you got?’ ‘Two pence,’ he said, as if it was the most obvious thing to say. Agatha gave an exasperated sigh and shrugged, going behind the counter. She opened up one of her drawers and rummaged around for a moment, then took out a loaf of bread from beneath some packets of tea and wrapped it in brown paper. ‘That will be two pence,’ she said, and he nodded as if he’d known all along. He held out his hand towards the bread, but Agatha put it behind her back. ‘I haven’t finished yet.’ She took a knife from underneath one of the counter drawer handles and started to cut off an edge of the loaf. The man stood 143
there silently watching as she did this, and when she was satisfied that she had cut enough off for his two pence worth, Agatha handed the bread over and he took it without a word. As soon as he left the shop, everyone went back to what they’d been doing before. The people in front of them at the counter muttered their thanks and paid for their things, Agatha put the bread back into her drawer with a sigh, and the children who were playing cards stopped to look around them and ask each other if that had really happened. ‘What was he like?’ someone asked. ‘Did you see how pale and thin he was?’ ‘He looked as if he hadn’t eaten for weeks,’ said another. ‘His eyes are blacker than I’ve ever seen anyone else’s.’ ‘And his hair,’ breathed the boy who had first noticed him, shaking his head in wonderment. Agatha stood with her hands on her hips and shook her head too. It was impossible to describe how frightening he had looked, but even now that he’d gone she felt a cold shiver down her spine.
There were footsteps coming up the stairs before Iris could get off the phone to Dora. She opened the door just as Lily reached it and ushered her in with an apologetic smile. ‘Sorry, Mum. It’s been a long day.’ She shook her head, looking tired and strained. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying, and her cheeks looked hollow, as if she hadn’t slept much for days. ‘Are you all right? You look exhausted.’ Lily nodded. 145
‘I haven’t been able to sleep properly since I came back last night. The beds were really uncomfortable and I kept waking up thinking there was someone in the room with me, even though I know there isn’t a ghost, or a monster or anything.’ ‘I don’t suppose you’re having any luck getting over to see Dora?’ ‘No,’ she said. ‘The police have closed off all roads and are stopping anyone from leaving the town, so we can only talk on the phone now. I can’t wait until they let everyone out again.’ Lily nodded, sitting down on one of the chairs at the kitchen table and taking off her coat. ‘I don’t know what you thought when you saw me walking into the shop this morning, but I think it was a good thing I did. The man who tried to kidnap Dora was in there.’ Lily gave her mother an incredulous look. ‘Really? How do you know that?’ Iris took a seat opposite her, reaching for the box of cigarettes on the table and lighting one as she explained what had happened. When Lily finally sat back down after hearing the story she asked, ‘What is it about this town? We haven’t been here five minutes, and already there’s something strange going on.’ Iris shrugged and blew out a cloud of smoke. ‘Maybe we shouldn’t have come.’ 146
Lily shook her head. ‘We didn’t choose to come here. It chose us.’ She smiled at her mother, and Iris leaned over the table, resting her arms on it. ‘I don’t know about you, but I was just glad to get away from my husband for a while,’ she said with a smile, but Lily didn’t look as if she shared that sentiment.
The sound of someone at the door woke her up and she sat bolt upright in bed, heart racing, before realising it was only Edwin trying to get into his room. She lay back down again and turned over on to her side, listening to him moving about in the next room. He’d been staying with her at their mother’s house for a couple of weeks now, since he’d arrived from New York. He’d come all that way for Lily’s wedding to his nephew, but he’d left just as soon as it was over and the last thing she knew he had told her before getting on the plane back was that he wasn’t sure if they would ever speak again. That hadn’t worried Lily too much though; Edwin had never been one for talking about his feelings anyway, so she figured it was just typical of him to be like this after they’d spent months apart and hadn’t seen each other in years. It was a lot easier getting over than the last time he’d done something similar when her marriage broke up. But even if Edwin didn’t want to talk to 147
her, she knew it didn’t mean he loved her any less or had changed his mind about marrying her. When they were together there was an electricity between them that couldn’t be denied; the way he looked at her made her heart melt, and although sometimes they couldn’t find much to say to one another when they were apart it wasn’t for lack of wanting to speak. She loved him dearly and she knew Edwin felt the same about her. It was just something about how his mind worked; he could never quite put into words how he felt, so when Lily was with him things would sometimes be uncomfortable. It made her feel as if they were a mismatched couple in some way and that maybe it wasn’t meant to work out between them, but she always had the feeling that was wrong, even if she didn’t know why or how. Edwin hadn’t said anything more about their relationship when he got off the plane at Heathrow airport a few days ago after spending two weeks with Lily in London. When they were together for just a few hours on his last evening, before heading to the station and catching the train back home, he’d talked about everything else under the sun apart from their relationship but had said nothing that made her think he was changing his mind or regretted saying yes to marrying her. It was strange, because she knew they were still very much in love with each other even though Edwin hadn’t given any indication of that feeling at all during this visit. It wasn’t until the day after 148
he had gone home when Lily woke up and felt a little empty without him there to hold her hand or stroke her hair that she realised how much she missed Edwin, and it was then that she decided she would call him again as soon as they let people leave town. But for now the only way to see each other was over the phone so Lily picked up her mobile from next to the bedside table and pressed his name on the screen of the phone before he’d even got out of bed in New York. It rang once and then twice, and as soon as she heard him answer it with a ‘hello?’ she was all smiles. ‘Hi Edwin,’ she said. ‘I missed you already.’ ‘I missed you too, Lily.’ She could hear the smile in his voice. ‘Are you ready to get back to me yet?’ ‘In an hour or so,’ he replied. ‘I just need a couple more hours of sleep and then I can leave here without any problem. How about you? Are you coming back home with me again after we get married, Lily?’ She could picture him standing in front of her bedroom mirror in the early morning light as he asked this question, his hair still damp from having showered earlier, and she smiled at the image in her mind. ‘Of course I am,’ she replied. ‘We can’t keep on living apart for ever.’ He laughed a little. ‘I guess not.’
