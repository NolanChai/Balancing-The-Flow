Romania - Apr 2012
We decided to do something different on our visit to Romania. After a morning at the zoo and an afternoon exploring the city, we rented a car and headed off on the road. We found a small village called "Izvoare" (a village of springs) and got to see what rural life in Romania is like.
We saw lots of cows, chickens, sheep, dogs, and goats all wandering around in their natural habitat. I think this was the highlight of our trip to Romania. The next day we drove a short distance into the Carpathian Mountains. This area is very beautiful but unfortunately we had no time to explore much further because it started raining and we couldn't find our way back down the mountain!
On our last morning in Bucharest we visited an open-air market that was very interesting to see. We saw a lot of people with shopping baskets full of food and groceries being carried through the streets, as well as lots of carts carrying various items for sale.
We had fun eating ice cream in front of an old building that had been painted over several times, leaving only the outline of the original image visible. We saw a man painting on a wall just around the corner and decided to go say hello and have him sign our picture (see below).
