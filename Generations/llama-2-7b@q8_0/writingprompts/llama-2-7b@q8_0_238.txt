k you come with me. You're on lookout duty tonight. ''
We started off walking down the street and then cut through a construction zone. I had to step over some scrap iron lying around. We got to an abandoned building with a pile of boxes next to it, there was graffiti all over the walls inside. There were a few things in here that you could use as cover if needed.
Jarek walked up to one of the large wooden crates and pulled out his knife. He cut away at the rotting wood around where he had to put his foot on it to open up the box. He reached down into the hole and pulled out a handgun. I knew that if I was in there with him, we could have found better weapons but I trusted what Jarek did so I didn't say anything about it.
He handed me a box of ammunition for my pistol, which he had in his jacket pocket along with 2 clips.
I checked the magazine and sure enough, it was full. I took my seat by him on the crate and we both looked out at the street to see if anyone would be walking up. After a minute of no one showing themselves we started our walk down the street. It was eerily quiet with only the sounds of the traffic from further away or the wind blowing.
We got about halfway there when I heard someone running towards us and saw some flashlights going in circles ahead of them, we quickly jumped into the alleyways they were passing by so we could avoid them. Jarek walked down the first one and I followed closely behind him.
We had only been walking for a few seconds when a loud voice from behind made me stop dead in my tracks and turn around slowly with my weapon pointed at where it came from. It was just a kid who was probably 12 or so, but he was dressed like he was living on the streets. His hair was matted to his head and his eyes were red because they had been crying.
I asked him why he was following us and he said he didn't know what we were doing here but he wanted money. He started reaching for my pockets and I pulled out a cigarette and held it up like it could be bait, he quickly took the cigarette from me without hesitation.
Jarek walked over to him and asked why his eyes were red. He looked at Jarek with tears welling up in his eyes but didn't say anything back, just started crying again as he handed a folded piece of paper to Jarek. When Jarek took the paper from him I could read on it that he was probably a runaway orphans kid who had been living alone on the streets for months because his parents died and he couldn't get adopted.
He went back down the alleyway towards the street, while I walked up to Jarek and handed him my pistol so he could have it in case anything else happened. He was surprised by my quick reaction but then smiled at me when I took out a cigarette for myself. We sat there and smoked together for a few minutes until we heard footsteps coming down the alleyway we were on, we quickly got up and started walking again.
We reached an abandoned house in less than 5 minutes with the lights on inside and people moving around. A lot of them had bags on their heads covering most of what they looked like but I recognized 2 guys who worked for us.
`` Hello there fellas! Glad to see you're here! ''
Jarek told them we were fine and he just needed a few minutes in the house before leaving, one guy called out to him and asked if it was okay they could come with him but Jarek waved his hand and said no. I stayed by the doorway while he went inside with 2 other guys.
After about 15 minutes of waiting around, a van came by and stopped in front of us. It had 2 doors open on either side so that it looked like there was room for everyone to get out at the same time. I walked up and waited for Jarek to come back out with the guys who were coming with him.
After waiting about another 10 minutes, Jarek finally came back outside. He had a grin on his face and was walking in a much more relaxed manner than he usually did, that's when I knew something big must have happened inside.
