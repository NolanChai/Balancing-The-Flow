 f lucky that I have no way to know how hot it is in here…
When you read this post, you are probably using some form of electronic device like a computer or phone. There will be no electricity here on the International Space Station for at least 12 hours. This is an example of the extreme environments our spacecraft have to operate within and survive without human intervention.
It was only when I got stuck in this situation, that I realised how dependent we are upon electricity. Without it, my life would be very different: no heat or power for lighting, cooking, drinking water, communications, medical care…and no way to escape if things go wrong!
I am not the only one who is aware of this. NASA is constantly looking at how it can improve reliability and maintainability of its spacecraft systems in these hostile environments.
One example of a system which has been designed for long-term operation without human intervention is the Solar Electric Propulsion System (SEP). This system was designed to support the International Space Station, but could be used on other future missions too. The idea behind SEP is that we use electricity generated by solar panels and stored in batteries to power our spacecraft.
The SEP system uses an electric motor, which runs on direct current (DC) power supplied by its own set of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. This DC power is then converted into alternating current (AC) using a stepdown transformer before being used as the drive for the spacecraft’s main propulsion engine. The electricity generated by these motors can also be stored in supercapacitors or used to power other components on board such as lighting, heating and communications systems.
When we need extra power to manoeuvre our way into orbit around Earth during launch, there are two ways of doing it: using conventional rocket fuel (like liquid oxygen), which burns very hot but only has a short life span because of its high combustion temperature; or using electric propulsion motors that use chemical reactions between air molecules and electrolyte fluids inside them to generate an electrical current.
Electric thrusters are lighter, less noisy and more efficient than conventional rocket engines. They also produce much less waste heat. This means they can be used for long-term operations in space without any human intervention whatsoever!
Another advantage of using electric propulsion is that it allows you to use more precise navigation techniques than were previously possible, due to their smaller size and lighter weight compared with conventional rocket motors—which are much larger than even the biggest ones we use today.
We will have to wait until NASA’s next mission arrives in 2019 before seeing how this all works out though!
This article is about how spacecraft can operate without human intervention. The author explains that SEP systems are designed for long-term operation, using electricity generated by solar panels and stored in batteries to power our spacecraft, which then generates electricity using chemical reactions between air molecules and electrolyte fluids inside them to generate an electrical current.
How do I know if my oxygen sensor is bad?
Is a thermocouple the same as a temperature probe?
