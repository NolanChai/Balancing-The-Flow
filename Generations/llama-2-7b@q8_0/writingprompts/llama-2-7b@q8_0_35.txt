01:40 am at night.
The street light flickers on and off as the wires sway with the wind. I hear rustling behind me and stop. Its just my dog, she hasn't stopped since we left home.
She paces around me looking for food to eat but i don't have anything. The stench from the dumpster fills her nostrils as we wait by its side. She begins digging through the garbage in search of something to nibble on when I hear foot steps behind us.
I whistle and call out "Woof, Woof" but no one answers. It's only me and my dog and that's how I like it. A man emerges from behind a trash bin walking towards us. The street light shines down on him and in the light his face is as pale as paper. He walks over to us without speaking, his eyes staring at us with an odd look.
He holds up something small that looks like a ball of fur in one hand and he begins stroking it between his fingers, but its not a dog. Its a rat, he's holding it in the palm of his hand, "Its so cute" I hear him say before taking it to his mouth and biting down on its neck, blood spilling from its body onto the street below.
He stands there for a few moments staring at us with an odd look, then suddenly he runs off. My dog is barking at something but she's looking in the opposite direction. I turn to see what my dog has her head turned towards and to my horror i see a figure standing in the dark.
The figure moves closer towards me as the street light flickers on and off, the wind picks up again and with it comes an eerie feeling. The hair on my arms stand straight up and goose bumps cover my skin. I start to panic and run back the way we came, but its too late, the figure is now right behind me.
I stop as i hear the footsteps behind me quickening there's no where for me to go. The street light flickers on again and i see the man from before standing in front of me, his eyes are not human anymore. They're white with red blood shot veins running through them, he laughs at me and holds out a hand. I don't know what hes going to do next so I run as fast as i can but its no use, he catches up to me in an instant and grabs my arm.
The pain is unbearable, it feels like his bones are tearing through my flesh. He laughs at me again as he twists the arm hard enough for me to scream in agony. The man lets go of my arm, leaving me with a broken wrist, I run again but there's no where to hide from him.
The street light flickers on and off once more before going completely out. "Hey!" i shout out into the darkness but its useless, he can see perfectly fine in the dark. The man approaches me again with his claws digging into my back. He picks me up by the throat and slams me against the side of a building as if it were made of paper.
I feel the air being knocked out of my lungs, but I can still hear him breathing in my ear, "Please...just kill me" I choke out between my sobs. The man doesn't answer he just grips my throat tighter and pulls me up close to his face, I look into his eyes which are no longer white with red veins but have shifted back to their normal state.
The wind picks up again and the street light flickers on once more, a few minutes later it goes off again leaving us in complete darkness. The figure begins laughing at me and walks away into the night as I lay there bleeding out with my dog staring at me with worried eyes.
