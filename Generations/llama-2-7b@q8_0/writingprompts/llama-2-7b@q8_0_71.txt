 all before taking your final shot at him. This only pisses Him off, and makes Him do stupid things like make things better for the Heroes or come back stronger than ever. See Rule # 4.
 
 Rule # 4: The Hero is always right. Always. Never underestimate His powers of persuasion - this is a man who could talk you into wearing a tutu and running through a hail storm. Do not question the Hero, or try to get Him mad at you. You will fail miserably and be banished to some remote planet where He can't find you for all eternity. 

 Rule # 5: The Hero can never die. I repeat...the Hero can NEVER DIE! Do not attempt to kill the Hero under any circumstances. If the Hero dies, it is a sign of your failure as an Evil Overlord and you will be banished to some remote planet where He cannot find you for all eternity. See Rule # 4.
 
 Rule # 6: The hero MUST have his heart turned black by a bad experience with the Evil Overlord's henchmen, or perhaps by witnessing a terrible injustice done to the Hero's mother, or sister, or best friend as a young boy...whatever works. Do not give any other reason for the Hero to be so evil and dangerous.
 
 Rule #7: If the Evil Overlord is about to win his final battle with the Hero, then all of a sudden an army of heroes, knights, dwarves, gnomes, witches, talking mice or some other equally preposterous group comes out of nowhere to save the day. Do not allow this to happen! The Evil Overlord should be able to defeat the Hero with no help whatsoever, and certainly do so without any ridiculously fortunate coincidences such as a talking animal leading you through an underground labyrinth.
 
 Rule #8: If the Evil Overlord is going to meet his demise at the end of the story, then there must be a good reason for it - for example, if he tries to kill the Hero and fails. Do not let this happen! The Hero must defeat you single-handedly in an epic battle that can only have one outcome. It is better to destroy Him before the final showdown than to allow the Hero a chance to escape.
 
 Rule #9: If the Evil Overlord has any form of mental or emotional instability, this must be fully exploited and used against him in some way. This will make him much more dangerous than otherwise.
 
 Rule #10: The Evil Overlord should always have a large collection of strange and exotic weapons such as laser swords and ray guns. Do not underestimate the importance of firearms - particularly blunderbusses and rocket launchers!
 
 Rule #11: The Evil Overlord's henchmen should never, ever be allowed to question him or defy his orders in any way. If you intend to have henchman who do not obey these rules, then they must suffer a fate worse than death - for example, being turned into a frog and forced to live out the rest of their days croaking "Hail the Evil Overlord!"
 
 Rule #12: The Evil Overlord's henchmen should always be made up of mutants, aliens, or animals. These can either work for you willingly, or be enslaved by some cruel method such as putting them in a force field and forcing them to fight each other until only one remains.
 
 Rule #13: The Evil Overlord should always have a secret hideout high on a mountaintop, or surrounded by lava pits. Never place the hideout anywhere where it would be vulnerable to attack - for example, in a valley with only a small force of guards around it!
 
 Rule #14: Do not allow the Heroes any opportunity whatsoever to discover your secret plans before you carry them out. For example, do not have an Evil Overlord Council meeting where everyone can see a map that lays out all of your plans in detail and contains names, dates, and descriptions of every single thing you plan to do to the Heroes. If it is important to the storyline for the Heroes to know about your secret plans before they are enacted, then make sure they only learn the vague details such as "I will destroy them on March 15" instead of "I will use my trusty laser to destroy the city of Noland".
 
 Rule #15: The Evil Overlord should never allow himself to be locked in a room with the Hero at any time, for this could result in their accidental team-up against other Evil Overlords and so forth.
 
 Rule #16: If the Evil Overlord has an Evil Overlord army, then do not ever allow them to fight among themselves or defect from his cause.
 
 Rule #17: The Evil Overlord should never use minions for tasks which could easily be accomplished with a ray gun or some other exotic weapon.
 
 Rule #18: Do not build the Evil Tower of Evil where there are still good people who might discover it and steal your secret plans. Build it somewhere else - perhaps on another planet, or in a cave that leads to Hell!
 
 Rule #19: The Evil Overlord's evilness should never waver, even when the Hero offers him the chance for redemption. If he ever shows any kind of mercy towards his enemies, it is an indication that he has lost interest in the story and that you need to start a new one with a different Evil Overlord.
 
 Rule #20: Do not allow your Evil Overlord to have children or pets, for these creatures can sometimes be used as a cheap way of showing their owner's kindness towards others or as a plot device for getting them captured by the Heroes and/or the authorities.
 
 Rule #21: Never, under any circumstances, allow yourself to become the Evil Overlord! (unless you want to be) If you do this, then the story will end and your life will be over forever...but at least you will have had fun!
