I interrupted... '' Yes, yes! It's quite certain. In fact...there was an explosion. I know you can do something about it.'' 
 
The voice became quieter with a sigh. "Please don't tell us that there were people hurt in this incident.."
 
I hesitated for a moment and then replied '' no, thankfully! The entire area was empty...just me." 
 
A long pause followed on the other end of the line before I heard him say. "You don't know what you have done..."
 
He sounded angry but he had to be careful with what he said, it was after all a phone conversation. And he had been told not to talk about his identity. He paused and then went on. '' I...I am sure that we are capable of reversing the effect of whatever you've done....but we can't just do it without knowing why." 
 
"Why?" I asked, surprised by what he was saying. '' What makes this so important to you? Do you have something against me or my...'' 
 
He interrupted... "I am sure that your actions are well meant but we still need to know the cause of it..." 
 
'' But why?" I repeated myself and then added '' I don't understand." 
 
"I can't explain everything. But for now, just accept that you have done something very serious...very serious indeed," he said before cutting the line. 
 
For a few seconds, I was still holding onto the phone when it finally hit me...
 
# ...What had I done?!
