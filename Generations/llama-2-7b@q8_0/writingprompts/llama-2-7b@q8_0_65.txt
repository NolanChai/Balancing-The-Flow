 “Sarah!” I said angrily, pushing myself into a sitting position. “What time is it?”
 She stopped hopping around for a moment and stared at me with her big brown eyes. Her long, skinny legs were sticking out of the bottom half of a pink nightgown. A white teddy bear was clutched in one hand and the other was holding on to the edge of my quilt.
 “Ten thirty-three,” she said matter-of-factly, as if we hadn’t had an argument about this exact same thing just two hours earlier. I knew her little heart had been pounding for days now—ever since our big Santa had arrived on Christmas Eve and told her that he was bringing Sarah a surprise.
 I sighed deeply, then picked up the teddy bear from where it had fallen onto my chest and handed it to her. “Okay,” I said, trying not to yell. “Go get dressed and eat something, then we’ll go wake daddy.” She jumped off the bed again and ran over to our closet before I could blink.
 I stood up and put on my robe as I listened to her rustling around in there for a few minutes. The excitement of Christmas was definitely getting to me, too. It wasn’t just the presents that made it hard to sleep tonight—I knew we would be having company over later this morning for breakfast.
 After an hour or so had passed, I finally heard Sarah coming back into our room in her pink pajamas and pink slippers with a white fur ball on top of each foot. She was carrying the biggest plate I’d ever seen—full of grits and bacon and eggs.
 “That looks amazing,” I said, trying to hide my disbelief at the fact that she had managed to cook breakfast by herself. I’m sure her teacher had taught her a few things while we were out there on our morning walk.
 She smiled with her bottom lip protruding from between her two front teeth—the same way she did when she was telling me one of her wild stories about how she had turned into an elephant for the day. “Here ya go, Mommy,” she said as she handed it to me.
 I looked down at my plate and started laughing. “That’s too much food, honey.”
 She scowled a little but then smiled again when I reached over to put my arms around her.
 “Well, if you don ’ t like it, I can just go back downstairs and eat it,” she said, as she patted the top of my hand with hers.
 I shook my head as I sat down on our bed. She was too smart for her own good—just like me! “That’s fine,” I said in a quiet voice. “I can just wait until after breakfast.”
 She giggled and then ran back over to the closet, where she had hidden Santa ’ s presents underneath some clothes. I looked over at our clock on the bedside table—it was still 10:45. If we were going to get Sarah downstairs in time for breakfast before the others arrived, it meant we’d have to hurry.
 After a few minutes of searching through the presents, she pulled out a box that had been wrapped so many times that I thought I was looking at a brick wall on the inside. She handed me a large piece of wrapping paper and told me to tear off the last layer as she unwrapped it from both sides with her tiny little hands.
 “This is for me?” I asked, as I looked up at her with a big smile spread across my face. Inside was another box—this one a small blue-and-white ceramic Christmas tree that had been decorated with silver ornaments and lights. It had the prettiest red ribbon around its top.
 She nodded yes, as she looked down at the floor for a minute before asking me if I wanted to put it in our Christmas display on our bookshelf. “Of course,” I said, reaching out to take it from her arms and putting it onto my lap. It was so tiny—just like Sarah herself.
 I got up from the bed as she handed me another box with a big green ribbon around its top that had been wrapped by Santa himself. Inside were three shiny new silver rings for each of us. We’d been wanting to replace the old gold ones we’d worn since we were kids. It was definitely our most expensive gift yet!
 “Thank you so much, Santa!” Sarah said as she ran over to hug my leg with both arms stretched out in front of her like they were reaching for a basketball. I picked up each of the boxes and carried them into our living room where I put them on top of my present pile along with all the other gifts that had been delivered last night while we were asleep—including Sarah’s very own box of toys.
 After just a few minutes, Sarah was ready for us to head downstairs and let Santa know that he could open up his presents now. As I put on my robe again and picked her up in one arm, she pulled my hand into hers as we walked down the staircase together. It was nice having someone else around to take care of things this morning instead of doing it all by myself—for once!
 When we got to the bottom step, I heard laughter coming from behind us so I knew that Santa was already there waiting for us in his big red suit with a smile on his face as he held out one arm and waved hello. I gave Sarah her teddy bear again before handing him over too—just like she had done when we first met him last Christmas Eve when we were both little kids!
 
 “Santa!” Sarah said excitedly, jumping up onto his lap with both arms stretched out in front of her just like an airplane wing. She leaned forward slightly to give him a kiss on the cheek and then put one hand on top of each side of his head while he stared down at me with those big brown eyes that I knew so well.
 “Hi there, Sarah,” he said as we walked over towards our tree together where all her presents were sitting beneath it in beautifully decorated boxes and bags full of surprises!
 She looked up at me for a moment before turning back around to hug his arm tightly again. Then she reached out with one hand toward the box that Santa had put down next to him while I went on ahead towards our kitchen where breakfast was already being prepared by Mommy and Daddy.
 “Thank you so much, Santa!” Sarah said as she stood up straight once more from his lap before running over to give me a big hug with her arms wrapped around my neck like they were going to be there forever!
 “I love you too, sweetheart,” I whispered into her ear while I kissed the top of her head. Then I turned away from them both so that she could look back at Santa one more time before running off towards where breakfast was being served—she was already eating pancakes with some maple syrup dripping down onto her plate!
