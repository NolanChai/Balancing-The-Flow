of, his fingernails are really long.* 
 
 *This isn't right. I have to do something.* 
 
 *Yep.* 
 
 *He doesn't clean up after himself when he leaves? How does he keep getting invited back?* 
 
 *That's exactly what I said, bitch!* 
 
 *You have no idea how good you got off. Not to mention that I left you alone with a whole bunch of things that you probably shouldn't be doing alone in the first place.* 
 
 *What? What are you talking about?* 
 
 *That's what I thought you'd say, and that's why we're not going to mention any of it. Now do me a favor: Go wash your hands, then take out the trash. Then come back here.* 
 
 *Do I have to?* 
 
 *Yes.* 
 
 *Fine.* 
 
 *Okay. I'm going.* 
 
 *You know what you do next? You put that dried ketchup and the bread thing in a ziplock bag, then wrap it up tightly and stick it into your freezer.* 
 
 *Why?* 
 
 *Because if he sees it in there when we go back tomorrow, I'll deny knowing anything about it. Now get out of here!* 
 
 *I mean, really.* 
 
 *You are such an idiot sometimes.* 
 
 *If you're so smart, why didn't you make me clean up after him?* 
 
 *Because I was afraid you'd actually do it.* 
 
 *Huh. Well, that makes sense.* 
 
 *And that ketchup and bread thing is still on your plate. I swear to god, if you don't clean up after yourself next time, I won't be responsible for what happens to you when I leave you home alone again.* 
 
 *Whatever.* 
 
 *I'm going!* 
 
 *Good.*
