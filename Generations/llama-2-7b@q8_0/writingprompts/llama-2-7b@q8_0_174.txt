“ *ZEEEEEEEEETAAAAA!*” Yells echoed everywhere around me. Xera, the queen herself, was out looking for the girl, too. Well, I suppose that you’d assume she would look for her own daughter. Vengence was something Xera was fond of, and one thing that a mother could do best to get back at her own children. I was going to run as fast as possible. There were no other options for me but to hide from the queen. But there was only one problem… there wasn’t anywhere else to go. “ *ZEEEEEEETAAAAA!*” I shouted, hoping that they had not heard me before. They didn’t, but they would soon enough.
My eyes scoured around for any place I could go. It seemed like the whole forest was on fire. Everywhere I looked were people with flaming torches and pitchforks. And all of them were yelling my name: “Zeetaaaa!” “ZEEEEETA” “ZAAAAAAATTTA!” I started running, but they weren’t far behind me. They had spotted where I was heading for the moment. The ground began to shake as thousands of feet thundered across the forest floor and crashed against trees. I hid under a large oak tree, praying that no one would see me. I could only hope my mother did not get too close and that she didn’t smell where I was hiding. I had hoped that the thick branches would be enough to keep her from finding me. They were thick, but not thick enough. “Zeetaaa!” The ground shook harder than ever and a voice rang in my ear:
“You can’t hide from me! ” Xera yelled into my head as she crashed through trees with no concern of breaking any branches. She could feel the presence of her daughter and wanted nothing more to just have her dead body in her hands. “Zeetaaa!” The voice was getting closer, but I couldn’t move. There was nowhere for me to run or hide. My heart pounded so loudly that it sounded like a drum. I tried to take deep breaths, but they were becoming harder and harder to breathe in. “Zeetaaa!” Xera crashed through the branches right above my head, causing all of them to shake violently and fall onto me. “ZEEEEEEETTTAAAA!!” I was now surrounded by trees and unable to escape any more. They would surely get me this time!
My eyes were shut as tightly as possible, but I could still see the fire everywhere. The flames spread from branch to branch of all the nearby trees, causing them to crash down onto each other. I could hear the sounds of branches breaking and screams echoing around me. “ZEEEEETTAAAA!!” Suddenly a loud thud shook my body like an earthquake. The force was so powerful that it sent me flying into the air. As soon as I left the ground, I flew up through the branches of the trees and hit a large rock on top of one of the tallest cliffs in the forest. My body screamed out in pain but I continued to fly through the air until my head smashed against some jagged rocks at the bottom of a gorge that was more than 50 feet deep.
“Zeetaaaa! Zeeeettttaaaaa!!” The shouts and cries came from everywhere. People were running toward me, and all I could hear now was my heart pounding as hard as possible in fear. “ZEEEETTAAA!” Xera shouted out with the rest of them as they all surrounded me, some with torches held high above their heads. My eyes stared blankly ahead at the people surrounding me with pitchforks and torches ready to strike. But no one had dared to touch me. They were just waiting for Xera to give them permission.
“Zeetaaaaa!” The ground shook as if it was going to break any moment, but the shaking stopped suddenly. All of my eyes turned toward where Xera stood with a look of anger in her face and fury in her voice. “You’re not worth anything to me anymore.” She said quietly so only I could hear her words. “Zeetaaaaaaaa!!”
Xera then screamed out loudly enough for everyone to hear, “Kill it!” Everyone held their weapons high as they started to rush towards where I was lying. They all wanted to kill me and make sure that this was the last time they ever saw me alive. The flames were reaching into my hair and I could feel them burn my skin. My body trembled with fear, but Xera did not hesitate to do what she needed to do. She grabbed one of the pitchforks and thrust it at my chest causing pain so severe that it made me scream out in agony.
The flames grew larger as I lay there dying. There was nothing anyone could do to save me now, but Xera still did not give up hope. She continued to stab the pitchforks into my body over and over until she got bored with it. Then all of a sudden, she grabbed another torch from one of her followers and threw it on top of the burning flames surrounding me. “Zeetaaaaa!” As soon as I heard that voice say those words again, something inside me broke apart at once and went black.
A single tear fell down my face as everything around me became dark. My eyes closed and my body was motionless as it lay there on top of the cliff with nothing but memories running through my head. “Zeetaaaaa.” I whispered softly to myself before turning over and falling into an eternal sleep.
I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart racing. The dream had been so real… It felt like it was happening all over again right in front of me. But as I lay there trying to figure out what happened, the sound of footsteps caught my attention and I opened my eyes slowly. A man stood before me wearing a brown cloak with a hood pulled over his head. His face was shadowed so that I could not see who he was or what he looked like except for the fact that he carried two pitchforks in one hand, and another torch in the other.
“Zeetaaaaa!” He yelled as soon as he saw me awake, “It’s Zeetaaaa!” His voice sounded familiar somehow but I couldn’t quite place it yet until I realized who he was… my father! My father had come to kill me because of what happened all those years ago with my mother. He wanted revenge just as much as she did and there was nothing I could do about it except wait for the inevitable.
“Zeetaaaaaaaa!” He continued yelling as he walked towards me, “You’re going to die! ” He dropped one of the pitchforks near my head before reaching out with his free hand and grabbing my hair tightly. My eyes widened in fear but it was too late now. I couldn’t move or say anything as he started to pull me up into a standing position, “Zeetaaaaaa!” He yelled at the top of his lungs, causing everyone around us to stop what they were doing and look over towards him. My heart sank even deeper inside my chest as I tried not to scream out in pain from the burning sensation caused by this man pulling me up off the ground.
“Zeetaaaaa!” He yelled again before letting go of my hair, “I’m going to kill you and take your head back with me so that everyone knows what happened here today! Zeetaaaaaaa!!” My eyes stared straight ahead as he dragged me towards the edge of this cliff where it dropped off into a deep gorge below us. He kept yelling at me but I couldn’t understand any of his words anymore because all I could hear was my heart beating fast enough to make my head spin around in circles, “Zeetaaaaaa! Zeeeettta!!”
I felt like he had been dragging me for miles but somehow I knew this wasn’t possible because we were only a few feet away from where the gorge began. The wind blew through my hair as I stared down at all the flames that surrounded us. My father then let go of my arm and held out one hand, “Zeetaaaaaaaa! ” He said loud enough for everyone to hear while he grabbed onto me with his other hand and lifted up until our faces were just inches away from each other’s.
“Zeetaaaaa!!” His eyes bulged out of their sockets as they glared directly into mine, “I am going to kill you! Zeetaaaa!!! ” He yelled once again before throwing me off the cliff and sending both of us down into darkness below…
