etually ended up as one of the main characters in this novel.
The thing is that the more I flew around, the less excitied I was about it, until I started feeling trapped. It would have been easier to fly away from it all but then I realized something: "I could always go back".
In a world where humans can travel faster than sound (and even faster than light), some people find themselves stuck on an island with no way of escaping and no way of contacting the outside world.
As the characters get to know each other, they find that many things they thought they knew about their lives were not so certain after all.
This is a story about human nature, and how it can change when people are put in new situations. This is a novel about what happens when people try to fit into their own little boxes and what happens when they break free from them.
