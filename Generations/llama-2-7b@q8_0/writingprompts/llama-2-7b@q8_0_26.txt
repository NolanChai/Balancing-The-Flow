Bron approached the magician’s keep, a teetering stone minaret that jutted out of the landscape. He sighed and dismounted his horse walking the rest of the way to the great portcullis that yawned black and waiting for him. He lifted his hand in a wave at the wizard who stood at its center, but the man did not reciprocate.
“I’ve been told you wanted an audience with me?” The voice was deep and guttural like a man who had spent too long digging coal pits or scavenging bone from charnel houses. He walked out from behind the barrier, a long sack slung over his shoulders. “And here I thought it would be someone more interesting.”
Bron smiled politely and approached the towering figure, extending his hand to shake as he had been taught. The mage barely touched Bron’s skin before pulling it away with his gnarled fingers leaving only a cold chill of oily blackness on the traveler’s wrist. “I was told that I was not expected for at least another week or so?”
“And here I thought you were supposed to be my most trusted ally.” He said without looking up from the sack he carried, “No one in their right mind would come here to see me for a month and then walk away with nothing. You are obviously not in your right mind, traveler,”
“I am here on behalf of King Arthur.” Bron replied defiantly. “You have been summoned by the crown.”
The man gave an exasperated sigh and shook his head before walking past Bron and into a chamber of his own. He gestured with a finger for the traveler to follow, which he did.
“What is your name?” The mage asked once inside the room.
“I am Bron.” Bron replied stiffly.
“Bron.” The man repeated, “Why have you come to me? Why do I not simply open this door and leave you out here to rot until you die of exposure or some other unnatural fate?” He waved his hand dismissively as if the question itself was insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
“I wish for a boon, Sir Mage.” Bron answered. “I am here to seek power beyond my own and your help in securing it.”
The man looked up at him with a cold stare that seemed to pierce his very soul before he chuckled loudly and slapped the sack on the table next to him, its contents tinkling. Bron could not tell what was within but the mage’s voice carried across the room as he began to laugh again. “This is the answer you seek?”
“I do.” Bron said as he reached for the bag with both hands, “You will get your payment.”
The man snorted and continued to laugh, a deep rumbling sound that seemed to come from his gut more than his throat. The only thing in the room was this magician and Bron himself but somehow the noise still filled every corner of the chamber and threatened to overwhelm him completely. Bron had seen men fall to their knees before the mage when they had been unable to match his wit or will, he had even watched as some simply dropped dead before him after a brief moment of contact with the man’s eyes.
“You are foolish.” The wizard finally said when the noise had died down to a low murmur, “If I help you then you will have everything you seek and more beyond that. If I do not…” He shrugged his shoulders with a smile on his lips, “Then I will simply leave here unmolested until such time as I see fit to move again.”
“I understand the risk.” Bron replied calmly even though he had never expected this response from the mage. This was not how things were supposed to go at all. He had been assured that with his king’s money, and perhaps a little more, the wizard would do everything within his power to help him on his quest for power beyond comprehension.
“It is a fair price.” The magician agreed as he opened up the sack and began to dump its contents onto the table. Bron looked on in confusion while the man counted out a series of gold coins into an unused hand.
“A week? I have no interest in seeing this show you put on for my benefit any more than I do watching a mouse die slowly from poisoning.” Bron said, “I will return if you give me what is owed to me now?”
The mage smiled as he finished counting the money and stacking it into neat piles of varying heights. “Very well, but know this: if I have not received your payment by the time our week is up then you will be leaving here with nothing.” He said in a tone that brooked no argument.
“You’ve already had your payment.” Bron replied smugly, “The price for power beyond comprehension is my own life as well as those of every person I hold dear to me.”
The magician laughed and tossed his head back, the sound of it reverberating through the chamber once again. He reached out with an arm and grabbed Bron’s throat in a vice grip, forcing him into the nearest wall. The mage pulled his head close enough that their noses almost touched but he still kept his eyes closed as if looking at anything else would be too much of a strain for them to bear.
“You have no idea what you’re dealing with here.” He said in a whisper, “I could kill you where you stand right now and nobody would ever know you were missing until long after it was too late.” Bron felt as if the wizard could see his thoughts but he also knew that they couldn’t possibly be true.
“Then what is this?” The magician asked, opening up one eye to look at the traveler before closing it once more. Bron followed his lead and closed both of his own eyes for a moment just long enough to feel a tingling sensation in the center of his chest. He could still smell the mage’s body odor even with his other senses blocked off but he knew that they would never have been able to see anything anyway even if they had kept their eyes open throughout this whole ordeal.
He opened one eye just enough to glimpse a red and green sphere on a thin chain hanging from the magician’s neck, it was shaped like an hourglass but with no bottom half at all; just two opposing hemispheres that looked as if they were about to merge together into one perfect whole.
“It is the greatest boon you could have ever wanted.” The magician whispered again before opening his other eye and pulling Bron’s head away from where it had been pressed against the wall, “You are free to leave now if that is what you wish but know this: I am watching every move you make over your lifetime. You cannot hide anything from me even though it may be years or decades before I find out just what happened.”
“Thank you for everything.” Bron said as he stepped back toward the door, “I will repay you soon enough.” He paused at the threshold of the room and turned to give one last glimpse at his mysterious benefactor. The mage was looking away from him with a distant stare, as if his eyes were focusing on some far-off point in time or space. Bron left without another word but he knew that it would be foolish for him not to come back and check on the magician’s progress every so often. After all, this was supposed to be the greatest boon imaginable; how could there possibly be any downside?
Bron’s traveling companion had been dead for three weeks now. It had been a tough journey at first but then they began seeing signs of civilization again and Bron realized that it would not be much longer until they reached their destination: the magician’s keep. He could smell smoke on the wind every few miles and there were people moving about in various settlements along their path.
They had been traveling for a few hours when they finally came upon a small cluster of buildings that looked like nothing more than simple shelters made from sticks, grasses and whatever else happened to be lying around nearby at any given time or season; nothing fancy or ornate but still more civilized than most places Bron had seen in his life so far.
Bron was about to dismount his horse when a young man stepped out of one of the buildings with two children running alongside him giggling loudly as they tried to keep up with their father’s every step. The man stopped short upon seeing the travelers approach them and stared at them for a moment before he turned away from them again and continued on toward another part of town without saying anything or even looking back once more after giving Bron such an odd greeting.
“I don’t think that was very friendly.” Bron said as he watched the man walking away with his family behind him
