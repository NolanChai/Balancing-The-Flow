 different colors. 
 
 After the first few years of writing I decided to try my hand at screenwriting. 
 
 I wrote a couple scripts for TV and Movies that I thought would be big hits when I finally got them made ( HA! ) and sold them all off in 2004, before they were ever even read by one single person. 
 
 Since then, I've tried my hand at just about everything under the sun. From comics to graphic novels, and webisodes, and even a couple plays. ( I HATE theater ) 
 
 I can tell you that all of these writing projects failed miserably... except for one... this little site called www.goldenagecomics.net.
