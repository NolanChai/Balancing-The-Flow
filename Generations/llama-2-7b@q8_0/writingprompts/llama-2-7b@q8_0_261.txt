``Yes I do! And that is why I will marry him. He is not as dull as you think. He knows what to say and when to say it. I like his humor. He makes me laugh so much and he always seems to know how to make me feel better after a bad day.''

``And just who is this stableboy? Why doesn't someone else do your talking for you? '' The King demanded, still angry about the incident in front of his entire court but also secretly pleased that she was showing such spirit and had a backbone of steel.

He knew that he would have to let her marry this stableboy and he hoped that she loved him as much as he loved her. The King thought of his daughter. She is the most beautiful princess in all of Europe but more than anything she is my best friend.
