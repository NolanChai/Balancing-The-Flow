 e smiled at her, she blushed, then ran away. * 
 
 *Mr Rawlings had been waiting for her all day. He knew Alice's job kept her away from home and he knew Della would be alone today. * 
 
 *He got out of the car, walked to the house, knocked on the door. Alice was at work, but Della answered.* 
 
 *He was a teacher at school too. He had been watching her for a long time and he knew she was in trouble. * 
 
 *Alice's boyfriend Bruce was away. Mr Rawlings could help her now.* 
 
 **Della sat on the sofa, she didn't know where to look. The man was sitting opposite her with his legs crossed. He had been waiting for her all day.* 
 
 *He smiled at her, "I have a surprise for you Della."* 
 
 *She wanted to tell him no, but he held up a pink balloon in the air and she watched it float to the ceiling. She blushed. It was so embarrassing.* 
 
 **The man smiled at her, "It's okay Della, I won't hurt you." He said as he walked towards her.* 
 
 *Della stood up to run away but she didn't know where the door was.* 
 
 *She had never seen him so close before. She couldn't move, her legs were stuck to the floor.* 
 
 **He leaned over and picked her up. He put his arms around her tightly and held her tight to his chest.* 
 
 *Her body was numb with fear as he carried her towards the bedroom.* 
 
 **He laid her down gently on the mattress, pulled off her tights, lifted up her skirt. He touched her thighs, her knees and then she felt him push between her legs.* 
 
 *"Aaaahhhh," it hurt so much, he was hurting her in the wrong places.* 
 
 **The pain was too much for Della to bear. She screamed and fought to get away from him, but her eyes were closed tightly against the tears.* 
 
 *He pulled up her top and her bra so that she couldn't hide anymore.* 
 
 **Della kept her eyes shut as he touched her again. He held down her arms with one hand and touched her body with his other hand. "I love you Della, I always will."* 
 
 *He stroked her hair as she lay there sobbing.* 
 
 **She had been raped by her teacher Mr Rawlings. She couldn't tell anyone about it. Her mum would kill her and her mum needed Alice at school too much to lose her job. It was too late for Della, her mum Alice was never coming back home.*
