360-Day Countdown ''

\section{The Last Day}

The clay is dampened and molded into the shape of a man, then left to dry. When it's fully cured, Clay uses a chisel to carve out its features: jawline, eyes, nose. The process takes two days because he can't seem to stop thinking about his ex-girlfriend. He finishes the sculpture and stands back from it in an attempt to take stock of himself as a man and an artist.

Clay carries the clay sculpture into the kitchen and sets it on the counter. After turning on the faucet, he fills a small bucket with water and dumps the contents onto the sculpture's face. A puddle forms around its head. Clay stares down at the clay figure and wonders if he should have carved her eyes out before adding water to the sculpture.

He returns to his bedroom and packs a bag with enough clothes for a two-week vacation: underwear, socks, t-shirts, pants, jeans, hoodies, jackets, sneakers, sandals, and a couple pairs of boxers. He checks the bathroom sink to see if it's full again—it is—and fills another bucket with water from the faucet.

After showering and drying himself off, he puts on his baggy green hoodie and grabs the bucket of clay water in one hand. He leaves the house and walks across the street to the park.

\section{The Second Day}
Clay sits down on a bench facing the playground equipment and sets his bucket beside him. He takes out his notebook and a pen, opens it to an empty page, and writes:
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

\section{The First Day}
Clay drives to the park in his green pickup truck. The sun shines and the sky is clear blue. A jogger runs past Clay while he parks the car. She glances at him, then moves on down the street.

He walks across the street from the playground equipment and sits down on a bench facing his bucket of clay water in an attempt to take stock of himself as a man and an artist. He opens his notebook and writes:
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

\section{The Last Day}
Clay carries an old tin can he uses to rinse brushes between use into the kitchen and turns the faucet. The water batters the bottom of the can with the same ferocity as the doubt in his head. He leaves for work without telling anyone about this new project and sits down at his desk.

When he gets home, Clay takes a bath in the tub in the master bedroom. His bucket is on its side beside him, partially filled with clay water. There are still two days left until the second day.
