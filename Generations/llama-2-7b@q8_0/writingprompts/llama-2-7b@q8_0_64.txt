ating fast food from a cart that is being pulled along by a man who seems to have no legs.
There are many people around, but still no one notices this peculiar-looking man with no visible legs or arms. He walks through an alleyway and into the back of a convenience store. Once inside he pulls his coat tightly around himself in order to keep warm while he waits for a customer who is currently engaged in a conversation at the counter.
The store owner approaches him. The man with no visible legs asks the shopkeeper for some cigarettes and matches; as they exchange pleasantries, it becomes obvious that this customer has lost his eyesight along with most of what could be considered normal limbs . . . but even so , he manages to give off an air about himself which suggests he’s no less intelligent than anyone else.
He asks the shopkeeper how business is going; the owner responds by saying that things have been slow lately and they haven’t had any real customers in some time now . . .
The man then asks if there’s anything new at work these days before inquiring whether or not he can borrow a pen from behind the counter so that he may take notes during their conversation (which would be much easier than trying to write them out). The shopkeeper agrees and gives him one, but only after taking care of some other matters first . .
.The man thanks him for his generosity before exiting through another doorway into what appears at first glance as nothing more than an empty room; however upon closer inspection it can be seen that this space has been converted into a makeshift classroom where people gather around various tables and chairs in order to study together.
The man walks over toward one such table where four other students are sitting with their eyes closed while reading books from a shelf nearby; they look up at him curiously as he approaches but quickly return back down again after realizing who it is that has come into view . . .
There’s an old saying that goes something like “you can’t judge a book by its cover.” The same thing could be said about people too. When you see someone with no arms or legs, the first thought that often comes to mind is one of pity. But what if there was more to it? What if this person had some other special abilities and talents?
Well, according to Dr. Steve Gerrard—a researcher at Oxford University in England—there are actually many disabled individuals who possess extraordinary skills! For example: Some blind people have such heightened senses of touch or sound that they can identify different types of fabric or determine the location of objects around them simply by feel alone; while others may have perfect pitch and be able to hear notes which would ordinarily go undetected by someone with normal hearing capabilities.
It’s clear that these people don’t see themselves as “disabled.” Instead, they view their bodies (both inside AND out) as tools—tools designed specifically for accomplishing certain tasks in life . . . tasks like being able to communicate effectively despite having no ability whatsoever to speak words aloud.
So while it might seem logical at first glance that those lacking limbs should feel isolated from society, these findings suggest otherwise: There are actually many ways for people with disabilities—like those without arms/legs—to thrive within our modern world!
The main character in this story is a man who was born without any legs. He is an outcast in his community because of his condition and he spends most of his time alone, reading books or working on puzzles to pass the time. One day however, another man comes into town and starts talking to him about what it’s like being disabled.
The second character tells us that although it may seem difficult at first for people who are different from themselves, they eventually find ways of overcoming obstacles that would otherwise stop them in their tracks – whether it be by adapting their surroundings or simply relying on those around them more than ever before!
. The story ends with the two friends discussing what they have learned together throughout this journey: how important it is never give up hope even when things don’t seem promising at first glance; because anything can happen if given enough time!
A man without legs or arms was walking down the street in a big city. He noticed that people would stare at him as he went by, but they were only doing so out of pity for him. The man felt sorry for himself and began to cry. As he wiped away his tears, an old lady approached him with her cane and asked if she could help carry something heavy from one place to another in exchange for some change she had on hand at that time – which happened happen be money she earned by cleaning houses during the weekdays (and selling newspapers during weekends).
The man accepted her offer, but then realized how much weight he’d have been carrying around with him all day long if not just one other person had offered up assistance earlier in life so there wouldn’t be any need for anyone else stepping forward later down the road after seeing how little effort required by someone like me!
The story ends here because we don’t know what happens next – whether or not our main character decides to take on this new responsibility himself once again…or maybe finds another job somewhere else instead? We may never know exactly where life goes from here either way since every single day brings its own unique set of challenges that must be faced head-on regardless if they’re good times or bad ones; however hard things become along our journey through life – no matter how difficult circumstances may seem at any given moment in time (or lack thereof).
