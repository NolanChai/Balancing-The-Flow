ying "flirting" books that were only mildly useful, and I even had a blind date at a restaurant where we talked about politics and religion for two hours (she was an evangelical minister; we're still friends).
Finally, one night while talking to my girlfriend over the phone, she asked if I was having any luck with women. I told her no, which is when I had that thought: "How do people meet other people?"
I went home and decided to write out a list of people who could potentially be good friends with me. The list included all my neighbors, teachers at school, members of the church where I attend (even though I'm not religious), the librarian, my doctor, etc. Then I got on Facebook and asked people from that list if they wanted to get together for drinks sometime.
I had no idea what was going to happen after I made the request.
My friend Dana's response: "You're kidding." Her friend's response: "Well, you have to go out and meet them now. It can't just be online!" My friend's father's response: "If that was me, I would think it was a little creepy."
I had no idea what to do next; my friends and family all seemed surprised that I hadn't been doing this already. Then one of the women on the list wrote back saying she was interested in getting together sometime soon. It was like something out of a movie -- you know, those scenes where a guy meets a girl, they have an instant attraction to each other and they end up having sex within 24 hours? That's exactly what happened with this lady who said her name is Rachel and lives in the neighborhood.
We met for drinks one night and talked for over four hours about everything from our pasts growing up together (we moved here from New Jersey) to politics and religion again. It was like she knew me better than anyone else on earth already! And now we're dating; it just happened naturally, like falling in love should be -- no pressure or stress involved at all."

Sarah R. from the U.K.
I am a single woman in my 20s and I've been dating for about five years now.
I met my boyfriend through work, which isn't really an option if you don't have a job. I didn't know any guys in my neighborhood, so I decided to take matters into my own hands by signing up with Tinder! After a few dates with men who were either too old or not interesting enough (not that there was anything wrong with them), I started thinking about how much easier it would be if all of these potential suitors were close at hand. So one day last fall when I had nothing else going on and needed something new to do, I decided to start asking friends if they'd like me to introduce us so we could go out together sometime soon after meeting online! It worked! We went from talking daily for months before finally meeting up in person (at our favorite coffee shop), where things really clicked between us both romantically and professionally.
It was at that point when my boyfriend told me he felt like we had "connected" more deeply than any other guy who'd ever approached him through this particular platform -- including all those old boring guys from back home! The next morning, I woke up thinking about how great it felt knowing someone cared enough to get me out of bed after having such an amazing time at dinner the night before; even though they didn't say much during dinner itself (we both agreed we weren't ready yet), this was clearly a sign that things were getting serious between us too! We made plans to meet up again later in the week so I could show off some new recipes from my cookbook series -- which had just launched earlier that month -- while he showed me around his studio apartment. By then, we were already talking about marriage and kids before long; it was like nothing else mattered anymore except getting together with each other whenever possible!

"I don't have any friends. I am a single woman in my 40s who lives alone." I tell people this all the time when they ask me how I find new friends or what makes them feel good about themselves. But it’s not true: there are actually plenty of people out there looking for someone just like you! It's hard to meet others if your social circle isn't active or diverse, but luckily technology has made things easier by bringing us closer together through video chats and dating apps (which I personally love).
I met my current boyfriend at a local bar called "The Stick" where he was playing pool with his friends when someone asked me if I wanted to join them for dinner later on that evening after work because they had extra tickets available; turns out it wasn't just any ordinary date night -- it was actually going to be an overnight stay! We talked about everything under the sun until 3:00 AM before falling asleep exhausted from talking all day long :)
The next morning he brought me breakfast in bed before going back home with his friends who left us alone together again so we could enjoy each other's company without interruptions during those early hours before lunch time (which was around 11:00 AM). I asked him what happened after dinner ended? Did anyone else join them for dessert later on after they finished eating their meal? He replied no but told me how happy he felt knowing that I wasn't just another girl who wanted something from him; instead, we talked openly about how much fun being together feels like when both people are having a good time!
I met my boyfriend through friends of mine. We were all at a party and I saw him standing there alone with his drink in hand so I went over to introduce myself as we started chatting about things that had nothing do anything specific about life or love but still seemed important somehow - like our favorite music artists and books! It was great talking with someone new who seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me better (and vice versa).
My boyfriend is 29 years old, but he's been out of college for five years now. He's a personal trainer at the local gym and works out every day after work -- which explains why I see him there all the time! His friends are mostly guys who go to school nearby or work together at restaurants around town; they often hang out together during off-hours too, so it makes sense that they know each other well enough to have some inside jokes about where their favorite places to eat dinner or how much money someone owes them after buying rounds of drinks (and not paying!).
I've been married for five years and I can honestly say that my husband is the only person who has ever loved me as much as he does now. We met at a bar when we were both single, but neither one of us knew what would happen afterward--we just went out because it was fun! And then we kept going out together because everything felt right between us: everything from our physical attraction towards each other (which has never stopped) all the way through to how easy talking seemed during those early days when things were still new between us both.
There are plenty more people looking for love too--you just need to know where they hide!
