Terra Nova is an indie-styled space game that takes place in the distant future where Earth has been destroyed, and now a new home must be found for humanity to survive. Terra Nova challenges players to create a colony on a desolate planet with limited resources, as well as build their own ship from scratch. The main objective of the game is to locate an inhabitable planet that humans can relocate to, and construct a space station in orbit around that planet so that they can live there once terraformed.
Terra Nova’s development has been long-term but worth it as you will be able to see yourself exploring planets in first person view and interact with other players via voice communication. It’s quite rare these days for a game of this scale to allow the community to directly influence its direction and growth; usually, they are locked away from the general public or are completely isolated by its developer/publisher. However, Terra Nova is an indie-style title which makes it so easy for players to communicate with each other and make suggestions on how they can improve the game. It’s an exciting project that we look forward to watching grow as more people join us!
Terra Nova will be free to play, but you can choose to support Terra Nova by purchasing in-game items or donating real money for rewards such as special privileges. The first stage of development is focused on creating a functional world where players can create space stations and explore planets; later stages will expand on this with more features like trading systems, etc. If you'd like to know when Terra Nova comes out, sign up below!
Terra Nova is currently in the early access phase, so there are still many bugs and glitches present in the game. However, we hope that these will be resolved soon as Terra Nova expands into other areas such as space exploration, trading, etc., with each new stage bringing more features for players to enjoy!
