The sun was hot on her face as she lay naked on the cold grass.
She stared up at the blue sky, trying to block out the noises of the busy city that surrounded her. The buzz of car engines and blaring horns; the shouting children and laughing adults. The noise of her own heart beating was louder than all these sounds combined.
She knew she had to find a way to get back to the hotel. If she didn't, then she'd soon become an official missing person. But how? She couldn't ask for help. Not from any stranger who came within a hundred feet of her. The thought that someone could see her and know what she was thinking made her feel sick with panic.
The wind blew gently, causing the long grass to sway across the large expanse in front of her. She watched as the light bounced off each individual blade, casting tiny rainbow patterns on the surface. Her body was warm now; sweat dripping from her brow and down between her breasts.
It had taken some time before she'd felt safe enough to take her clothes off again. A few minutes earlier she'd been sitting naked on a park bench, with just a small piece of material covering her modesty. She couldn't be sure how long she'd sat there; maybe an hour?
She was too tired to worry about anything else at the moment. So far today had been full of shocks and surprises; things that were almost impossible to believe. Her whole world seemed to have turned upside down, inside out even. She wasn't sure if she should be more afraid or elated by all this.
The park bench was situated in the middle of a small clearing that bordered one edge of the expansive grassy area. There were trees nearby and even an old abandoned fountain, but for now, nothing seemed to matter other than her own safety and wellbeing. She knew she had to keep going; if she didn't, then who would?
Her mind was reeling at every new piece of information that came flooding in, making it difficult for her to think clearly about anything else. It was as though the more she learned the less she understood.
What was happening? Why was everything so complicated? The only thing she knew for sure was that if she didn't get out of this park quickly and find a way back to the hotel then everything could go very badly wrong. She had no idea where she was or what to do next. But she couldn't stay there forever, on her own, naked, in the middle of Central Park, waiting for someone to come along and help her.
The noise from the city grew louder as the park came into view. The cars that drove past looked like miniature toys from this distance, each one accompanied by a blaring horn. Her body started shivering with cold and she knew it was time to get dressed again.
She quickly pulled her dress back over her head; it covered only part of what she wanted hidden. She didn't want people seeing her breasts or anything else that might draw attention to herself. But there were still many other things wrong with the way she looked, even if no one could see them yet.
Her hair had gone from blonde to black again and was now longer than ever before; it almost reached past her waist. She'd left most of it down in front of her face as a natural mask for what was underneath. But it wasn't enough, she knew that. So many people would see her and know she was lying to them.
And they would want answers. Questions that wouldn't be easy or pleasant to answer. They might even get violent with her if she refused to co-operate. She couldn't let any of that happen; not now, not when there were so many other things on her mind. So she made sure her long dark hair covered as much of the side and back of her neck as possible.
She put everything else in place as quickly as possible: her dress and stockings first then a pair of brown pumps and lastly her coat, which was too big for her now that it had changed size along with her body. She was only halfway dressed when she saw movement to the left. A group of teenagers was coming towards her at speed; laughing loudly as they approached.
She knew she couldn't hide behind the trees this time or climb any of them. She'd already been spotted. They'd be here in seconds and they would see everything that was different about her. It made her shiver once more, even through all the layers of clothes she was wearing.
She scrambled to get fully dressed as fast as possible; it was only a few minutes before they reached her, but it felt like forever. They were laughing and talking now, making their way towards the bench where she'd been sitting. She knew that if they could see her, then everything would soon be over for her.
She pulled on her jacket and ran towards the fountain as fast as she could. It was a few feet away from where she was standing; just around the edge of the clearing. The cold water in it would give her some cover if they came after her. She'd go into the fountain and hide there, at least for the moment.
The teenagers were too busy laughing with each other to notice her as she ran towards them. But that wasn't going to last; their laughter was contagious and soon it started getting louder and more frequent. They would be looking at her now, wondering what she might be doing there.
She could see the fountain up ahead of her when they were still some way away. She didn't want to run into them directly but instead move around behind them before going down onto the grass and running straight towards it. But as she got closer to them, the laughter stopped. They all turned their heads in the direction where she was now standing and they saw her at exactly the same time.
She could see their eyes widen with surprise at the sight of her, but only for a second. Then their faces became cold and hard; nothing like what they had been moments before. She could feel the hatred rising inside them all as one and she knew it was too late to run now.
One of the boys walked quickly towards her. He didn't speak or even make eye contact with any of the others. It looked almost as if he were walking towards a ghost; just another part of the scenery that had appeared in front of him. His body language told her everything she needed to know: he was coming for her, and soon.
She kept running, but they all knew it now; they would catch up with her before long and then they'd have their fun. They'd beat her to the point where it wouldn't matter how fast she ran away from them, or even what she did next. They would still get there in time.
She stopped running when he was only a few feet away, knowing that she had nowhere else to go. She put out her hands to stop him hitting her as soon as he got close enough; it wasn't working. He smashed his fist into her face with such force that the pain made her scream. It felt like all the bones in her nose and jaw were broken at once, sending her crashing down on to the grass. She was now lying face first with nothing between her and them except for the coat she had on over the top of her dress and petticoat; everything else had been torn off by his fist when it connected with her head.
She could feel blood gushing from both nostrils and into the back of her throat. She struggled to breathe through the pain that was now spreading throughout her body. But she knew there would be more blows; they'd keep hitting her until they were sure she wasn't going anywhere for a long time.
She tried to roll over so that she could see them, but it was hard with everything hurting so much. She put her head back down onto the grass, trying to rest her eyes as much as possible while she waited for them to move away from her and leave her alone once more. But they weren't moving; in fact, none of them had left their original spot yet.
She opened her eyes again slowly so that it didn't hurt quite so badly this time. Her head was throbbing now, and she knew there would be a lump the size of an egg soon enough to prove how hard they'd hit her with each blow. But she forced herself not to look down at her face; instead keeping her eyes on the teenagers who were still standing around the fountain laughing as before.
She thought about moving, getting up and running away from them again. But every time she did that something stopped her; they'd just come after her again. So why bother? Why make things worse for herself when she was already so close to being finished with it all?
One of the boys picked up a pebble and threw it at her head, hitting her on the side of her face once more. It didn't hurt as much this time; they were starting to get used to what they were doing now. But that didn't make any difference when another one hit her in the chest with an even bigger stone from their pile next to them.
This time it did hurt more than ever before
