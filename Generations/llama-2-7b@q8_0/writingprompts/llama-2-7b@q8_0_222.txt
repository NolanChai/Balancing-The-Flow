ether making me ill.
The darkness was a friend. I could hide there; keep myself safe. Now I’m forced to watch. To see it as they bring in the first one.
She’s beautiful, so damn beautiful that I almost hate her. She smiles at them, her face like porcelain and her eyes warm with kindness, but when she sees me she stops short, and for a moment I feel hope. Then their fingers are around my throat, the metal digging into my skin as I’m dragged back to where they work.
“I’ll be back soon,” they tell her softly. “Don’t you worry.”
The words were supposed to comfort me, but instead they made me sick with fear and anger. The more time passes, the hotter it gets, and I can barely breathe. My fingers are crushed against my skin as if trying to free myself will set them on fire. But I won’t let go; not until she comes for me too.
My captors are rough with her, but they don’t beat her or tear at her flesh the way they did me. They don’t have to, she is so gentle that it would be a shame. Instead they focus on their work, and after a few hours I realize my mistake. The beauty has been turned into an unholy monster of metal and magic. She looks human now; but only just.
She was still smiling when they came to get me, her gaze sweeping over me as if she is assessing the damage done to me by their hands. But the moment our eyes meet I see that my death will be kinder than hers has been. The chains are loose now; almost easy enough for me to wriggle away from them.
“You’re mine, aren’t you?” she asks, her voice soft and low. “Why is it so hard to believe? You were made to serve me.”
I try to speak but my jaw is crushed shut by the metal of the chains, so I only glare back at her in defiance. She seems unfazed, reaching down to snatch one of my hands and bring it up against her cheek. Her skin is soft and warm, a stark contrast from the metal that now forms her fingers and toes.
“I will be your master,” she whispers before slamming me against the wall. “You can’t stop me; you can barely even touch me.” She laughs when I try to fight her off, the sound echoing around my small space like a dark chant. “Why is it so hard for you?”
“I am not your slave,” I growl at her, spitting out the words through a mouth full of metal. Even if she has me now, there are still things that she doesn’t know. There are secrets even I don’t know. Secrets that make it impossible to give up my will so easily. “I am stronger than you.”
“You were made for us,” the beauty snaps at me, her smile widening as her magic begins to burn against me. “And you have been corrupted by it. Now I must take away everything that was given to you; all those things your family and friends loved so dearly will be lost to you.”
The fire is unbearable now, my skin burning with a heat that I can’t understand. She’s using her magic against me but not to hurt me: only to make it harder for me to escape. It was meant as a lesson; a way to teach me that there are things in life that you cannot control and you must learn how to live without them, even when those things were once everything.
“I am stronger than this,” I spit at her, gritting my teeth against the heat. “And so is my will.”
But the fire only grows hotter, until finally my mind is consumed by it and I cannot resist anymore. The moment it takes me down she smiles; her smile sweet but cruel as she brings forth her hand and brings it down hard on top of my head, sending stars to dance behind my eyes and sending pain through every limb of my body.
“I know what you want,” the beauty says in a quiet whisper. “And I will give it to you. I promise.”
She smiles then, her lips pulling up at the corners as if she is thinking about kissing me; about tasting my blood and feeling my muscles twitch under her fingertips. It’s not a smile that can be trusted, but rather one of manipulation and deception; one meant to keep you from seeing what she truly thinks about you.
She has plans for us both. Plans so sinister that I cannot comprehend them. But despite my best efforts, I am still human after all…and weakness is inevitable.
The metal scrapes against me as the chains are tightened again, my face pressed up against the wall once more and my vision blurred from tears of frustration. “How long have you been here?” I ask her through gritted teeth; my words harsher than they should be when she was being so gentle with me.
“I’ve always known,” she replies softly, almost as if she is trying to calm down the raging fire in her magic that is burning against my body. “You were never meant for them.”
The beauty has been waiting for this moment; it is one of the only times when I can speak with her and be sure that she will understand me. Even now, despite knowing how much I hate her, she is kinder to me than anyone else in this place. It makes me feel vulnerable—dangerous even—but still, there is something about her that calls to me like no other has before…
“What do you want?” I ask, my words slurring slightly from the pain of being trapped between metal and skin for too long already. “Why can’t I escape? Why are they taking their time with me when all they have to do is take away whatever magic was given to me by your family…and then they would be done.”
She hesitates only briefly before answering, her voice sounding almost apologetic as it reaches out to mine. “I know that you don’t want this,” she admits softly; her fingers trailing across my forehead like gentle fingertips against my skin. “But I can’t let them take me away from here.”
“Why not?” I ask, gritting my teeth as the metal burns even more against my skin now that she has touched it. The pain is unbearable, but still I wait for her answer with baited breath; hoping that this time she will tell me what’s going on and why everything had to end up like this in the first place…
“Because they want me dead,” she tells me simply before pressing a kiss against my forehead once more. “But I won’t let them.”
