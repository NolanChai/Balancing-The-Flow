ou et Mariam and the Babelsberg Film Orchestra on their German tour, to explore the art exhibitions that were all about painting or sculpture, to follow up a few good novels. I'd been in awe of the world, and its intricacy. The light, too: how it danced through the leaves, how it shifted with the sky at dawn and dusk. I'd walked long distances, from the cemetery on the edge of town to the village church that stood next to the school in which I taught. I'd travelled along back-roads, past farmsteads, through hills, over valleys. I'd never felt so free before.
My sight wasn't yet entirely gone when I lost my hearing, and although it had been slowly diminishing for several months, I hadn't seen anything of significance until the day that everything became blackness. My sight was already weakening by then; my eyes tired quickly; the world turned a darker shade of brown – and I saw less and less. The cat, the garden, the road outside. For days after it happened, all I could see were flashes, and sometimes those weren't even recognisable as images at all. It was a gradual decline until there was nothing to be seen except blackness.
And then the first thing that I could see again, in my new life, was not black, but green – or rather a colour that looked very much like it, since there were no other colours visible. There were also vague shapes: large greyish-brown ones and smaller reddish ones. The big ones moved slowly from one place to another and the redder ones bounced about. They all seemed to be looking in my direction; some even seemed to have stopped for a while, as if they were waiting for me to do or say something.
I sat up on my bed, still wrapped tightly in the duvet cover. It was almost dark outside: evening had fallen and there wasn't much light inside either – just enough to see by without being able to discern any details. I felt that I could have been anywhere; I might even have been back home, lying on my bed with all the lights off. Or it could have been morning, a Sunday morning. The only thing I knew for sure was that this wasn't home and it certainly wasn't Sunday.
I closed my eyes, willing myself to be able to sleep again; to drift away into unconsciousness as I had done so many times before – but instead of slipping into a dreamless slumber I found myself looking at the door. There was a big wooden handle that hung downwards and which I'd been gripping with my left hand, although I knew there wasn't anywhere to go. The door was firmly shut and there was no lock on it. In any case, nobody could open it from outside; the room was at the back of a house. It had probably been built as a bedroom for a servant, who had lived in this place long ago, before I came here.
I thought about what it might have looked like when it wasn't empty – and then I started to tremble. If I could have seen properly, that is: if my sight hadn't been so poor, everything would probably be different. But I couldn't even imagine what the room would look like in daylight: how large or small the window might be; whether it had curtains and a view of the outside world.
I wondered where the bedroom was in relation to the house. Maybe this wasn't its original position either – perhaps it used to be on the ground floor, with two windows looking out onto the garden and the fields that surrounded it. The house might even have had an attic at one time – but there wouldn't have been any electricity or hot water up there. And I would never have been able to go up the stairs if there was no lift.
I closed my eyes again. Even after more than two years, it sometimes felt as if everything I saw were simply a blurred version of what actually existed. In fact, it wasn't so much seeing that was the problem; it was that nothing stuck in my mind long enough to be remembered – and even when I thought I had, there were no clear images. Sometimes I could remember a room or a landscape from before the operation but I couldn't really see anything at all: just shadows of shapes moving about.
I tried again, forcing myself to open my eyes; I was tired after all, but still not ready to sleep. And this time it worked. After staring for a few seconds into what seemed like nothing but darkness, I started to make out vague shapes and colours – they were the colours of dusk: dark blues mixed with shades of grey that changed into black at the edges.
The door was still in front of me, just as before; it must have been made from wood that had been painted white when it had been new. It was an old door, with a wide frame, which gave the impression of being extremely heavy and solid, despite having been hung only on hinges without any screws or nails holding it in place. I could tell this because I'd felt its weight, although not that often; sometimes I had to move very slowly if I didn't want my arm to start shaking.
There were two windows next to the door, one above and one below the frame. They were both rectangular and narrow, with panes of glass in a pattern similar to diamonds or hexagons – but it wasn't easy to be sure because I could only see black shapes through them, which could have been anything.
The room was long and narrow. Above me, the ceiling was whitewashed, as were two of the walls that faced each other across a small space where there had probably once stood a table or chest with drawers. The opposite wall had darker colours; it might have been painted some time ago but now seemed to be covered in black stains and streaks, which looked like dried blood.
The room wasn't very large. I couldn't even touch both walls if I stood at the other side of the narrow space that separated them – and there was no way of knowing how wide it actually was, because of course I couldn't see any floor or ceiling either. But this was all I could do; all I could make out in this darkened room. I thought about what it would be like if I were able to see again: a landscape with green trees and grass, with people sitting under them, smoking cigarettes or drinking coffee at midday.
I'd already got used to the fact that my sight had gone – but even so, every time someone spoke to me about it I could hardly bear to listen. My first reaction was always the same: a feeling of discomfort and embarrassment, as if people thought something bad might happen again. And it wasn't only what others said; there were also the things that I myself wanted to ask them, because it had become difficult for me to understand some of the words they used. Sometimes I couldn't hear them at all – especially in restaurants or on the bus: when you sit a long way away from people speaking loudly to one another. But even if I could make out everything that was said, there were still other things I didn't understand: like the meaning of words like _light_ and _colour_.
I thought about how different it would be now, if I could see again – although I didn't expect anything to change immediately. I might have to wait several months before my sight came back completely; at least that was what the doctor had said when he told me about a procedure called optic nerve reconstruction, which involved transplanting stem cells from umbilical cord blood into damaged eye tissue in order to regenerate the connections between neurons. The doctor had talked to me for nearly an hour about every little detail, until I'd been so bored that my head hurt and I felt as if it might explode at any moment.
I knew all this because of course I'd read the leaflet about optic nerve reconstruction on the internet; and even before I did, a friend had told me about it, saying she'd heard from another friend that her sister had undergone the operation successfully. But I wasn't going to be able to have this particular procedure because of my age: I was too old, they said – or rather, as if it were an afterthought, one doctor told me that the stem cells needed time in order to develop and to become fully functional: at least a couple of years. And by then, he added with a smile, it would be much too late for me anyway.
The doctor had tried to cheer me up by saying that this didn't mean that nothing could be done; there were plenty of other options, such as the use of eyedrops and laser treatments, which could help in some cases – although I should understand that these procedures would only work with patients who still had at least some remaining vision. And although he couldn't guarantee that any treatment would work on my particular case, he said it was always worth trying.
And so it turned out to be; because after a few weeks of trial and error I found myself having three sessions a week at the clinic where they tried to improve my vision as much as possible using all kinds of devices and treatments: some of which were quite expensive, but others completely free for patients who didn
