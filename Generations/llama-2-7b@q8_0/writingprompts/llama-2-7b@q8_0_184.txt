wards - if he could be bothered to cook it himself; which most times he couldn't.
This particular day of work however, Jack had a rather difficult task, and as such he felt that an extra special meal was in order. As a result, once the numbers were finished being inputted into the database for that night, and after receiving his 'lunch money' from the head office, he made himself comfortable at the small kitchen table.
Jack opened up the fridge door of the modestly sized kitchenette, looking inside to see if there was anything that he could make. But, it appeared as though Jack Palanquin hadn't been in his room for a few days; all of the food had been eaten - either by himself or by others. This was not good news at all!
With a sigh, Jack slammed the fridge door shut and began to head out to one of the two dining rooms on this floor. Perhaps he could get someone else to cook for him? It may be worth it in this particular instance.
The two dining rooms were completely empty when Jack Palanquin arrived at them, although that was no suprise - it was a weekend and not many people would be eating lunch on the workdays that they didn't get to eat dinner with their families. Jack, however, wasn't planning to go home for his 'lunch break'.
It didn't take long before Jack had found something suitable to eat, in fact it took him a matter of seconds. In one corner of the dining room sat an old dusty box of unused stationary - including several pieces of writing paper, envelopes and even some coloured pens. The box was also home to some chocolate bars - those that Jack had saved from when he was younger.
Jack smiled to himself as he rifled through the contents of the stationary box; it was a wonderful sight to see. He couldn't wait for dinner!
After getting everything that he needed, Jack Palanquin headed back to his room and made himself comfortable on the bed with his writing materials. The box itself wasn't very big so Jack had to use both arms to hold up the tablet and pen; but it was worth it.
Once everything was prepared, Jack picked up the first piece of paper, a blank one that he had saved from when he had been at primary school, and began to write. As he wrote, Jack used his own blood as ink - both the ink and the paper were made with it! The dark red ink mixed well with the white of the writing paper, creating an intriguing contrast.
The words written on the piece of paper were simple at first: "Dear Mr Palanquin, I have been thinking about what you said to me earlier today about my new job and I would like to know more."
Jack continued to write, eventually finishing the letter after a few minutes with the following; "Please can we meet for coffee sometime soon so that I may ask you some questions about your role as head of the Palanquin Corporation? If not, then it's fine. Thankyou in advance for your time. Kind regards, Jack."
Jack Palanquin sat up and folded his hands together in front of him with a satisfied smile on his face; this was going to be fun!
