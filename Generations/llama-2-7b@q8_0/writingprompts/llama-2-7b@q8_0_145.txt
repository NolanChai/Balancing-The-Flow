ceans away from their home worlds, but they were not alone. They all knew there were other civilizations out there somewhere. They just didn’t know where.
He reached for his next piece of data. The first part was a picture of the man in question; it was in black and white, but he could see the dark eyes that had captured his attention so much more clearly than he would have been able to from a moving video feed. There were a few other images; they showed him standing by some sort of vehicle or machine; there appeared to be two people with him. One of them was a woman.
His stomach twisted in a knot as he saw her, and he stopped reading for a moment, his hands shaking. He hadn’t thought about it in years. After the first time…after that nightmare on Kangor III…he never thought about it again. But now…
He picked up the next piece of information with more care than he had ever touched anything before; it was almost as if he could see his own trembling hands reflected in the data cube’s surface. He read, “Age 38. Hair Black. Eyes Dark Brown.” A little further down: “Occupation: Chief Engineer. Stationed on Earth.”
“No,” he whispered to himself, shaking his head. He knew it was foolish to doubt that this man had come from Earth; after all, who else would the 1st planet have sent? But still…he couldn’t help but feel as though something wasn’t right. It wasn’t like him to be so paranoid.
He started reading again, trying his best not to let any emotion show in his voice or his eyes. This was a job for him and the Council; it would be foolish to involve anyone else at this stage. But still…
“Name: John.” He paused. “Surname: Smith.” He tried to read the next line, but he couldn’t do it. It hurt too much, even if he didn’t know why. “Occupation: Chief Engineer.” His voice broke a little; his stomach lurched and his heart began beating faster as he continued, “Stationed on Earth.”
He was almost finished with the file by the time they got back to headquarters, but he barely noticed. All his concentration was focused on those last few words: Stationed on Earth…
“Captain.” He hesitated, knowing that this was the most important moment of the meeting and not wanting to show any sign of weakness in front of the Council; after all, they had sent him out here to find what he had found. But there was something he couldn’t keep from saying: “That man…”
“I know,” one of them said immediately. “He is not who we were expecting.”
Another agreed, but his voice sounded strangely sympathetic; it was almost as if they understood. This had to be hard for him…
“Still,” he continued, “We have no choice now that you’ve found him.” There was silence for a moment. Then another one said, “You can do this. We believe in your abilities and we trust you to handle the situation appropriately.”
They all seemed to be waiting for his response, but there was only one thing he could say: “Yes sirs.” It wasn’t much of a reply, but it would have to do.
The next day he got on board the ship and went straight down into engineering; there were still some things that needed doing before they left. He didn’t see John or the woman again for many hours, so when he did eventually come across them in one of the corridors leading from engineering to the bridge it was like seeing a ghost.
“Captain.” It was obvious at once that John knew who he was; after all, they had been on board together long enough now for everyone to know each other’s names. “I don’t think…” His voice trailed off as if there were no more words left in his head. He glanced down at the floor and then back up again with a slight smile playing on his lips before turning away quickly, leaving the captain standing in the middle of an empty corridor wondering what had just happened.
He tried not to let it get to him, but he couldn’t help thinking about John Smith every time he went down into engineering or saw one of the other engineers; there seemed something strange about them that made him feel uncomfortable…like they were watching his every move. He tried not to think too much about that either; it was all just part of being an engineer after all, wasn’t it?
He felt a sharp pain in his chest and realized he had been holding his breath for the past few minutes; slowly he let out what little air remained inside him before looking up again at John Smith. It took him another moment or two to realize that there was no one else around anymore; he was alone with this man who seemed so familiar yet also so strange all at once…
“Captain.” The voice made him jump; for a second or two, he wasn’t sure whether it had come from inside his head or outside in the corridor. He stood very still as if frozen by fear before turning around slowly and looking directly into John Smith’s eyes which stared back at him unblinkingly…
“John,” he said quietly so only he could hear, “what are you doing here?”
The engineer’s lips twitched slightly but there was no reply; instead another voice came from somewhere nearby:
“Captain,” the other man said with a smile on his face that made it clear who he really was even if this one hadn’t said anything yet. “It’s good to see you again.” He waved at John Smith before disappearing around a corner, leaving them both alone once more…
