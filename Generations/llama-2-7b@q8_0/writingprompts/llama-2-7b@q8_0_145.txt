 They lived in an environment that they had never experienced before.
There were no rules, laws or regulations.
 There was no fear, anger, hatred or malice.
 Love was the only feeling, emotion or thought.
 It was a perfect world. 
 The sun shone every day and there was no darkness. 
 Light and hope permeated everything.  
 And so it shall always be in eternity.
