ills in my drawer, put them into a bag with my phone, keys and wallet, ran out the door, and down the stairs. It wasn't until I was halfway down the stairwell that it dawned on me what happened and what this meant for me.
It's not a fire alarm. That would be bad enough but no one has ever done anything like this to me before in my entire life, and certainly not at home. If it were a fire I could have gone back upstairs, grabbed some more pills (since my doctor had already doubled the number), gotten dressed, and left with all my belongings. But no, because they thought they needed to restrain me and put me in an ambulance so I can get medical help at the hospital. And that's when it really dawned on me:
I am mentally ill.
So here is a list of things I have been told or told myself about my mental health in the past year:
1) You will never be normal again because you had a severe breakdown and have to live with it every day. (A doctor at the psychiatric hospital, who was supposedly there to help me.)
2) You are mentally ill. And that's a fact of life you just have to accept. (Mental health worker at an emergency room, who I thought was helping me get better but instead told me my whole life is over and there's nothing I can do about it.)
3) It's time for another psychiatric hospital admission. You need to stop taking your pills, and go back so they can take care of you again. (Family member who said this with a straight face like she was doing me a favor. And in my weakened state I thought it sounded good.)
4) I think we have to call the ambulance again and send you into the psychiatric ward one more time until they can find the right medications for you. (Family member who said this with the same straight face, and a look on their face like they were doing me a favor by giving me another chance.)
5) I am mentally ill. (Me telling myself over and over again throughout that night so I wouldn't panic or try to run away from the hospital or hurt someone else because of my mental health.)
I didn't know what to think at that moment, except I wanted it all to be a terrible dream and that this was just the end of an awful day. I can't really explain how I felt in that moment because there are no words for it. But I did make one thing clear before leaving:
I want to go home. (And I meant it.)
That was two years ago, but still haunts me today when my mental health is not great. When I'm feeling vulnerable or have a lot of anxiety and can't stop thinking about how bad things are, I remember that moment in the hospital stairwell where I was just handed another diagnosis I didn't want or deserve.
But as long as I keep going to appointments with my doctor, take my medications, do some form of therapy and stay physically active I can keep my mental health in check. And that is the silver lining of having a mental illness: it does not control your life, you have the power to overcome it no matter what challenges you may face.
But on those days when I feel like this isn't true and everything has been taken from me, all I can do is remember this moment in time and tell myself it will be okay.
