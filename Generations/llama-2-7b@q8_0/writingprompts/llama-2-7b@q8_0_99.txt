ly slightly less dull than the wall, and the demon that Trey had been sent here to see had only said two words to him so far-
"Trey!" He called, interrupting the young man's contemplation. "What brings you here?"
The young demon responded with a sigh and a roll of his eyes. "Well, I need a new job." Trey admitted, rubbing at the back of his neck as he sat down opposite of the creature in front of him, who simply chuckled.
"Why is that?" He asked with a smirk.
"Because my current boss-" Trey started to say before the demon held up a hand and interrupted him.
"So you're an underling, huh? That explains it." The creature replied in amusement, causing Trey to scowl at his comment. "Don't worry, young one," He continued. "We here don't care who your boss is- just what kind of job you are applying for."
"What do you have in mind? I can assis-"
"That won't be necessary." The old demon interrupted again before he could finish his sentence, making the young man groan in frustration. "I know that you were working for Satan himself and that means one of three things," He went on with a smirk as Trey grit his teeth.
"Oh dear, are we going to have this conversation? I already told your assistant that-"
"You did not." The demon retorted. "Not in so many words anyways. You mentioned it once or twice before but only when prompted to do so by him. That isn't the point though." He went on, his eyes drifting away as he thought for a moment before coming back and speaking again. "You see, young one," The demon continued with a smirk, "I know that you are still in Satan's employment because I have seen you and your master together quite often of late. I know that you are afraid to tell him that you have left his ranks or else he will simply kill you."
Trey's face reddened at the statement as he felt a mixture of anger and embarrassment, though when he saw the smirk on the creature's face, it only caused more fury within him. "You are correct in that assumption." He spat out before he could stop himself.
"That is all I need to hear." The demon replied with a nod of his head as he pulled open a drawer and took out a set of papers, handing them over to the young demon. "Sign these," He instructed simply, "And you are now officially employed by me. I will also assume that your master will not be able to track you down here anytime soon because if he does, I'm afraid we won't have a pleasant discussion."
Trey took the paper and stared at it for a moment before his eyes grew wide in shock as the word 'contract' jumped out from between the lines. He stared at it for several long moments before he could bring himself to look up once more, only to see a smirk upon the demon's lips as he chuckled underneath his breath. "I have some papers of my own you must sign as well."
Trey quickly got out of his chair and snatched them away from the creature before he could get back at him for such an unfair trick, though when the young demon looked over the documents, it took every ounce of self control to stop himself from vomiting all over them. "What is this?! Are you insane?" He yelled in anger as he pointed at the contracts in his hands.
"I am not." The creature replied calmly before getting up and taking a few steps closer to him, causing Trey to step back as fear began to consume him. "Now that you are officially employed by me," The demon continued with a smirk. "I need for you to sign these contracts or I cannot take on the job I wish to offer you."
Trey took a deep breath and let it out in a gasp, his mind racing as he tried desperately to think of another solution other than signing this document. He was going to have to do it though- there just wasn't any other option at this point. "Alright," The young man finally replied after several moments of silence passed by and the demon nodded his head in response before stepping back from Trey, allowing him some room to work.
He slowly began to fill out the document with a shaking hand, trying his best not to look at the devil's face as he wrote. When he finally finished though, he handed it over to the creature who quickly scanned it for any mistakes before giving it back and saying "You may begin your work on Monday."
Trey groaned in frustration as he sat down and signed his name on several documents with shaking hands. "What do you expect of me?" He asked once all of them were finished, causing the demon to chuckle underneath his breath before speaking up.
"I require your services in collecting a debt for me." The creature replied simply before he noticed that Trey's eyes had widened in fear as soon as he said it, causing him to add on with a sly grin "Don't worry though young one- you won't be going up against some ordinary human. You are expected to collect the debt from none other than the angel himself."
Trey was too terrified of the creature to even think about leaving, and so he did as instructed as soon as possible before making his way out of the office where he had met with the devil and onto a plane that would take him elsewhere. He could only hope that the task he was expected to complete would be more simple than the one Satan wanted him to do when he signed up for it, or else it was going to end very badly for himself.
He felt his heart sink in fear as he thought about it and couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief when he realized that at least he had another job lined up after this one was finished with. Satan might not be happy with him if he left, but the devil had never been much for loyalty anyway so as long as he didn't tell his master where he had gone off to next then everything should turn out fine in the end.
He could only hope though- because this job would probably end up being far more difficult than anything else that Satan had ever thrown at him before...
