 heart pounding as I looked at my watch.
 39.46 seconds.

The first barrier had fallen in 37.13 seconds; it was a new personal best, but I still needed another two minutes for the full course.

I pushed open the next door and walked through to the second barrier: two parallel walls with a gap between them about two feet high. As I reached the first wall, I had already started counting down in my head from three. The first time I'd done this race was on a wet, windy day, and I'd gotten the count wrong – it took me four seconds to get over. I knew I couldn't afford to do that again; if I did, then there wasn't enough time for me to finish the race.

I jumped up at exactly two seconds as I slid down between the walls and began to run through the gaps in between the barriers.

 39.48 seconds.

The third gate was a bit further away, so I ran until I reached it before pushing open the door and looking back again at my watch: two minutes exactly. The next set of gates were only about thirty feet apart; I could do this in less than twenty seconds. It had taken me five hundred and eighteen days to improve from 1 minute 58 seconds on this course, so a time of one minute fifty-eight seconds now felt like an eternity – how long would it take me to beat my new personal best?

I pushed open the next door and ran straight through, the second gate was right in front of me. As I got closer, I slowed down a little bit until I reached the door; once again, my heart was pounding as I looked at my watch: 1 minute fifty-eight seconds.

The last set of gates were right next to each other and had been built into a short wall, which meant that I had to jump up and grab one gate with both hands before using the momentum to swing myself onto the second barrier.

 39.21 seconds.

I pushed open the door and quickly climbed over the last barrier – another personal best for this race by a whole minute! I was so pleased that I had finally beaten my own record, but I knew there were still two more races left before I could call it done.

After the finish line came the time to collect my prizes: first place in the women's category, second overall and another new personal best with 1 minute thirty-seven seconds. As I collected my medals, a guy came up to me; he was one of the other competitors from our group, and I knew him slightly from training sessions at the park.

He said: 'That's a pretty good time for your first race.'
I said: 'Yeah... but it still needs a lot more work!'
