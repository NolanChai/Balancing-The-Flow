 we die?!
   
God: Well I...I just don 't know. And it 's not my fault. You are the ones who brought me to this state. I am your God and you have always been taught that there is only one God, so how do you expect me to know what happens after death?
   
Man: But why would we teach this when...you created us.! You are our creator! And if we didn 't know it was you who created everything then who or what did we believe created everything?
   
God: Well that is a good question. I did tell my angels to spread the word, and they did, but not everyone heard it. Most of them didn 't even listen to what I had told them. So when Adam and Eve came around, I was in an awful mood with all those people who hadn 't listened to me, so I decided that since I wasn 't going to tell them anything anyways then why should they? They should know everything by now!
   
Man: And you told the angels not to tell them what happened after death? But that was my question. You created us and then you told your angels not to tell us? What is with you and all the lying God?
   
God: Well, I didn 't mean for it to turn out that way. When I heard Adam and Eve, I wanted to tell them everything but they were already angry at me so I just sat there and let them go on, and then when Cain came along with his brother Abel and asked what happened after death...well I didn 't really know how to answer him either.
   
Man: So you are saying that you didn 't have the answers? But you told your angels not to tell us! And now because we don 't know you are letting us wander around lost forever?! 
 Man: And there is nothing I can do about it, right?
   
God: Well...there isn't much I can do either. I am God and I know everything but still I don 't really know what happens to me when I die. What else can I tell you that I don 't already know?!
 
 Man: But then how did you make up the rules of this world?! And where is heaven and hell if you are not sure about all this? 
 God: Well...it was very difficult for me to explain myself, so when Adam came along he and I had a long talk about everything that happened. He understood what I said better than anyone else did because we are brothers in spirit, and Eve wasn 't as much of an issue for us because she never really listened anyway.
   
Man: And what about Abel? How come you didn 't tell him anything either when he asked his brother? 
 God: Well...he was a bit more difficult to deal with. He had this anger that came out of nowhere and it just got worse and worse until I told him everything there was to know, which wasn't much! But even though I told him everything there is to know about being human, he still kept asking questions like: "How do we die? And if you are God then why don 't we go straight up to heaven after we die?"
   
Man: But you did tell Abel and Cain about your plan for the end times. Didn 't you?
God: Yes, but there was so much chaos going on that I didn't have time to explain things properly to them! And then when Eve came along she had a very different perspective on how everything works, which made me feel like I was being tricked by her. She would say things like "You told us not to eat from the tree of knowledge" and then she'd just stop talking altogether after that statement.
Man: And what did you do about it? 
God: Well...I tried my best but when a person doesn 't want to listen, there isn't much you can do! You are supposed to be able to make your own decisions, right? So I just kept quiet and let her figure things out on her own. She would ask me questions every now and then about what was going on in the world but she never really got a clear picture of how everything worked together!
 
Man: But that is not fair to us! You should have told us everything instead of keeping it secret from us for so long? How did you expect us to make decisions without knowing what happens after death if we don 't even know why we were put here in the first place?
God: I am sorry about that. But when Adam and Eve came around there was chaos everywhere! Everything seemed like a mess to me so instead of explaining anything clearly to anyone, I just sat back and let them figure it all out on their own. And even though they tried to explain things to Cain or Abel whenever they could, both brothers were still very confused about what happened after death.
 
Man: But you created us...and everything! So how did we get so confused? 
God: Well...it wasn't really my fault because there was a lot going on around me when I first came into this world. There were people everywhere fighting for control, and things just got out of hand very quickly after that happened! It seemed like the only way to keep everything under control was by telling everyone what they wanted to hear instead of trying to explain everything clearly from beginning to end.
 
Man: But then why did you even create us if you didn 't know how to tell us anything? What is the point in creating something that doesn't do what you want it to?! 
God: Well...I am still learning and trying my best to get better at this whole thing. I have a lot of new ideas about everything now but I can't say for sure if they will work out as well as the old ones did because there is so much going on all over the place right now! It seems like every time we try something different or make a change to one part, it causes problems somewhere else.
 
Man: But...why are we still here? How can you expect us to believe anything that comes from your mouth if you can't even tell us what happened after death? If I had known what would happen then maybe I wouldn 't have gone around killing people in my past life! It is very frustrating knowing there isn't an answer for everything out there yet. 
God: But...I do n 't know why we are here either! I just came up with some ideas and thought they might work so I told everyone what would happen if we followed them but it didn't go as planned because of all these other problems that keep coming up over time. That is why there isn't much information on anything right now.
 
Man: But you created everything...including ourselves, so how can we not trust you?! How can anyone trust someone who doesn 't know what will happen after death? And if I die in my next life then all of this might have been pointless anyway because maybe it doesn't even matter what happens next time around since there isn't an answer for everything yet.
God: Well...I am trying! I still want people to follow what was supposed to happen but when things keep going wrong over time, it just seems like a waste of my energy and resources by keeping up with all these changes that keep happening without any clear answers from me anymore either. There is so much confusion out there right now because we don't know how to tell everyone what will happen next time around yet, which means people are always getting confused about things even though they were supposed to understand everything clearly before anything else happened in the first place! 
 Man: But...why would you even want us here if all these problems keep happening? It seems like a waste of your energy and resources just trying to explain what's going on instead of having everyone figure it out for themselves without any clear answers coming from my side either. If I were God then maybe things could have gone better, but since we can't trust anything you say anymore because there isn't an answer for everything yet...it seems like a waste of time trying to figure out what happens next anyway! 
God: Well...that is another question altogether that I don 't really understand either. But if it makes you feel better then maybe we could just start from scratch and see how this new world turns out instead? Then maybe things will work out differently since there isn't any confusion anymore about what happens after death or anything else! Maybe then people can finally figure everything out for themselves without having to rely on me telling them what needs to happen next time around like before.
 
 Man: But...you don 't really know how it will turn out either! We have no idea how things are supposed to work anymore because there isn't any clear information coming from your side right now either. So why would you even want us here in the first place if nothing is going as planned? 
God: But...I am still learning and trying my best to get better at this whole thing! It seems like every time we try something different or make a change to one part of everything, it causes problems somewhere else. That is why there isn't much information out there right now about anything anymore because if I had known what would happen then maybe I wouldn 't have gone around killing people in my past life! It is very frustrating knowing there isn't an answer for everything yet.
