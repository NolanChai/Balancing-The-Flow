uctantly returned to it's proper position, leaving a dark red mark on Orville's arm. ''You could'a just said something, Harold.''
 ``I was too busy trying to figure out who you were kissing!'' Harold shouted. His voice sounded like he had a mouthful of pebbles. 
 
 Orville grabbed him by his arm and pulled him into the living room. ``Let's sit down, there's something we need to talk about.'' He said. After taking an arthritic seat on the sofa Harold shuffled over next to him.
 ``So what was that all about?'' Orville asked. 
 
 ``The one you were kissing... it was your mom!'' Harold yelled, causing the glass in the window across the street to rattle. 
 
 Orville stood up and stared at his friend with a look of disbelief on his face. ''How did you know? How could you know who I've been kissing for the past few months?'' Orville asked. The question seemed to bounce off Harold, whose eyes had clouded over in shock. He was just staring at Orville with an expressionless look. 
 
 Orville sat back down on the couch, his hand resting on his head as if he were holding it together. After a minute of silence he looked up and smiled at Harold who seemed to be lost in thought. ``Well?'' He asked. His voice was almost unrecognizable, full of anguish and worry. 
 
 Harold looked away and said nothing.
``Harold! You have to talk to me. We've been friends for a long time now and I don't know what you want from me but whatever it is... just tell me.'' Orville's voice was soft, barely audible even though he spoke almost in a whisper. 
 
 Harold stood up and stared out the window across the street again. Orville watched as his friend's jaw trembled, trying to keep himself from crying. After another minute of silence Orville sat down on the couch next to him.
``Harold?'' He said, reaching over for his hand. Harold pulled it away. 
 
 ``Please don't do that!'' His friend said. 
 
 Orville stared at him confused. 
 
 Harold pointed towards the door. 
 
 ``What are you doing Harold? I just want to help.'' He tried to reason with him. But Harold wouldn't respond and Orville stood up from the couch.
``Harold! I can't help you if you won't talk to me. I don't know what the problem is but-'' 
 
 A loud bang was heard as something struck the front of Harold's house causing a large dent in the plaster wall and smashing the window behind him. Orville ran into the living room, his heart pounding hard in his chest. He grabbed Harold by the arm and pulled him outside to investigate. The sound he had heard was deafening and he thought there must have been a car accident or something on Harold's street when suddenly there was another thud on Harold's front door. 
 
 Orville stood frozen in place, his heart pounding harder than ever as the door trembled and cracked from the force of the blow. He took one step forward then ran back into the house. 
 
 The noise stopped but before he could take another breath there was a screeching sound and something heavy crashed against Harold's door, causing it to collapse inwards, crushing Orville against the wall behind him with such force that his head snapped backwards and hit his skull on the corner of a nearby table. 
 
 Orville fell to the floor unconscious as Harold watched in horror from the window across the street. He stared at where his friend had fallen before grabbing his suit jacket, pulling it off of its hanger, and running out of the room screaming, ``My son! My son is missing!!''
