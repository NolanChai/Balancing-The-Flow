collect me whenever we meet again. It will help us get acquainted all over again.

    The first day I went away my name was Sammy Hagar, but it wasn't very long before everybody in town began to call me Mick. That's because I had a pet mouse named Mickey Mouse, and he liked to ride on my shoulder and bite things all around the kitchen. He was a very pretty little mouse with whiskers as black as soot.
    The next morning when Mickey Mouse woke up he found that his mother had died. Mick cried for her all day long. I carried him back into the house, but it wasn't any use because she was dead and there was nothing we could do about it.

     I remember how Mickey Mouse used to hop around on my shoulder when I walked down to the corner store. Sometimes he would sit in a crack on the sidewalk and eat gumdrops from the little girls who came out of the candy store. He seemed so happy then. Mick was like that too, but his mother didn't understand him very well because she had died young and left him alone with me all day long.
     I wanted to keep Mickey Mouse when he started running around loose in town. But I couldn't do it. There weren't any other mice who would let him live with them, so we had to go our separate ways. Mick didn't understand why we did that until one day he met another mouse named Chuck. He told me later that Chuck had a big house and lots of money.
     Well, I hope you got the letter all right. Maybe someday when we meet again I can tell you about my pet mouse Mickey Mouse. You see he was a good little mouse with whiskers as black as soot. When he started running loose in town he couldn't find anybody else who would take care of him and that made him sad.

     So that's all for now, I hope you've been well since last time we met. I'm sure you have, because your eyes are bright and happy like a little girl's should be!
