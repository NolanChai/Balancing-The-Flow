 Sammy, and Jake.
 ''Dude'' Jake began to speak as he always did before they started work. 
 ''Alright boys lets go. We have a long way to go''. 
 Tommy lit another fag and took a drag. The smoke swirled around the room as the boys stood up from their seats, ready for their next challenge.
 This is the fifth mission in the series of stories from the year 2027. If you are unfamiliar with this series then I suggest that you read the first story ''The Beginning'' which explains what happened after World War 3 and what led up to the current situation we all live in today.
 The boys left their safe house and went down into a underground tunnel, lit by their torches. It was cold, wet and smelly. As they walked through it Tommy remembered something from his childhood. ''Dude'' John spoke out of nowhere. 
 ''What?'' Tommy asked.
 ''Nothing'' Johnny replied. 
 The boys made a quick stop at the tunnel entrance to check that all the traps were in place and ready for action. After this they carried on walking down the tunnel until they came across the door leading into the main sewage system of the city. They opened it up, went in, shut it, then turned around to find themselves standing on a large pipe.
 ''Alright guys we have to move quick''. Tommy said as he looked around and saw many workers from the cleaning company passing by them. 
 ''Come on'' Jake began to run across the pipe, followed closely behind by Johnny and Sammy. They had made it before the first worker even knew they were there. Once they got off the pipe, John lit up his fag again and took a long drag of his cigarette. The three boys turned around as one and ran back down to where the entrance was.
 ''We have a problem'' Johnny shouted over Tommy's shoulder. 
 ''What?'' Tommy yelled back at him.
 ''There is a worker walking this way, if we don 't get out of here quick they are going to see us'' Jake said.
 ''Come on guys! Run run run!!'' Tommy shouted as the boys began to sprint across the tunnel towards their safe house. The workers were still some way off when the three of them made it into their safe house. They ran inside and slammed the door shut, then took a quick breathe before opening it again. They saw that the worker was nowhere in sight.
 ''Dude'' Johnny began to speak but Tommy interrupted him. 
 ''Shut up! We have to get out of here as soon as possible!!'' he said as he ran downstairs. 
 The three brothers quickly followed after him and went into the secret basement where they had the guns that were going to be used in their mission. They all knew exactly what was about to happen, so none of them needed a briefing. After they got their weapons ready, Tommy led his inner circle outside and they headed down to a nearby park.
 ''This is it'' Tommy said as he looked at the old man sitting on a bench. 
 ''We have to get in there''. John began to speak as Jake and Sammy nodded.
 Tommy pulled out his gun and fired two shots into the air. The three boys quickly ran across the park towards the building they were supposed to be attacking, guns raised. As soon as they reached it, Johnny slammed the door shut behind him as Tommy shouted ''Go!'' 
 The three boys then went inside, guns ready for action. They made their way through the corridors until they came across the first room. When they got in there, Jake slid down his gun and held up a bottle of acid that he had hidden earlier on. He poured it all over one of the men who was standing guard there. 
 ''Ah!'' The man shouted as Tommy and Sammy rushed towards him to beat him up. Johnny stayed behind, waiting for them to come out so they could go on to the next room. After the three boys left the room, Jake quickly went back into it, cleaning himself with a piece of paper he had found in the corridor. He then took off his balaclava and put it back on again. 
 ''Alright guys lets move quick'' Johnny said as Tommy, Sammy and Jake all nodded their heads. They left the room and went into the next one where they found another man standing guard there. It was easy for them to beat him up but Jake then stopped them before they could carry on. 
 ''We have to get out of here quick!'' He shouted as he pointed back towards the first room they had been in. The three boys looked around and realised that someone else had come into the corridor after they left it. Johnny quickly got his gun ready, pointing at them. It turned out to be just another worker who was on their way to clean up. They let him go past. 
 ''Let's get out of here!'' Jake shouted as he ran down the hallway towards the stairs and started to climb them. Tommy followed closely behind, then Sammy and Johnny. After they had all reached the top of the staircase, Johnny opened up the door and they ran outside. The three boys looked around and saw that everything was quiet apart from some birds singing in the distance.
 ''Come on guys!'' Jake said as he ran towards their car. 
 ''Dude'' Tommy called after him as he started to run too. They all made it inside, locked the doors then got into the driver's seat and began to drive away at full speed down a nearby alleyway before turning back onto the main road again. 
 ''Alright boys, we 've done it!'' Tommy shouted over the sound of the engine as he drove them towards their safe house where they would spend the night until their next mission started tomorrow morning.
