roll in these streets trying not to get killed or be caught stealing. That's why I keep it a secret, but I gotta get money for my brother's school fees. We live here together with our mom who has been sick the last 10 years and our dad is working somewhere we do not know about.
I have one good friend at least, named Jibril. He is always in a jolly mood. I like his energy and how he can find positive things in everything. He lives on the second floor of my shop. His mom works with me in here sometimes too, but we don't talk much because she knows what I do for money. But today I felt so bad after hearing her screaming from my workbench. I ran upstairs and found her lying on the ground crying and holding her hand.
"Oh my daughter! Oh my beautiful baby!"
She was bleeding heavily, it looked like she tried to cut herself with a knife or something? "Mom, what are you doing?"
"I want you to go to school!" She said, not looking at me. I got her on the bed and sat beside her holding her hand.
"What happened?" I asked again, she did not answer but cried harder. My heart was racing. Was my mom sick? "Mom are you okay! What's wrong with you? Please tell me!" I said loudly, while rubbing my thumb over the back of hers. She looked at me, her eyes were bloodshot.
"I want you to go to school. You have so much potential and if you do not, your dad will sell you off to a rich man."
What? "Mom, that's ridiculous! I can learn from here. I don't need school for that!"
She was breathing heavily, looking at me through her tears. "You will die in this place if you do not go to school and get an education. I want you to have a better life than the one I had. Don't worry about your dad, he will find a way." She said before falling asleep again, still holding my hand with her blood soaked one.
My heart was heavy because I knew she was right but I wanted to go to school. How could we afford it? My mind was racing and my head was hurting from all this thinking. We had to eat today! Then the thought hit me like a bullet, stealing. I don't want to be like them though, I know that is what they say when people get caught, but it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor. The punishment is still death and they would kill my brother too for not being able to go to school because we were in debt and the police had been waiting to catch us at this place before. I will do what I can, with what little money I make, to get enough for him to go to school and also to support myself and my mom. I promise her that today but how? How am I supposed to steal from those who are rich without getting caught?
I want to write a book someday. Maybe it'll be in a library somewhere and someone will pick it up, flip through the pages and say "hey this is good!" And then they can buy it and I would get money for my work and my mom could rest. She has been so sick lately and doesn't have the strength to even get out of bed anymore. She just lies there looking at me with sad eyes. Sometimes she cries like today. I try to be as happy as Jibril is, but sometimes it gets difficult when everything seems so hopeless and dark. But maybe if I write this book then someone will read it, they'll read about my life in these streets and help us.
I look at her again, she has fallen into a deep sleep now. Her face looks peaceful, she is not having dreams of how to get the money for my brother to go to school or how we are going to feed ourselves. She just sleeps. I will write this story down and put it somewhere so someone can find it one day!
