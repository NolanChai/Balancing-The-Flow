 I pray to God that we never reach that point, but I cannot say what will happen if the worst does occur. As a soldier who has served his country for the past eighteen years, it breaks my heart to think of the United States of America being subdued by an outside force.
 The mission you are about to undertake is in defense of the United States and the American people. I am writing these orders with tears streaming down my face as I imagine what I have done to my wife and children. But, I can think of nothing more that I should do at this moment than to ensure their safety.
 I can only ask you not to fail me. We have been trained for months and now is the time to prove our training in combat. I cannot express how proud I am to be a part of this mission. 
 To: President of the United States  
 Subject: [ Urgent ] The Situation, Revised Orders 
 Mr. President,
 In the past two hours you have received orders from Secretary of State John Kerry and then from General James Mattis to abandon our nation's capital. We cannot do that. Not now. Not ever. We will not surrender our country without a fight. I am ordering all available combat units in Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia to assemble at the White House at 0900 hours on Wednesday morning (tomorrow) for orders from President Obama. This order supersedes any other directives given by this administration during or following last week's election.
 Sincerely,   
 Barack Obama, Commander-in-Chief  
 The White House
