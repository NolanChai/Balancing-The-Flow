-organs to detect what had happened. A blast from within the ship had wrenched them out of orbit, sending them into a decaying orbit that was taking them closer and closer towards the planet's surface with every passing moment.
"Gravity, what is your status?" He asked as he made his way down to the engineering deck in an attempt to gain some understanding of why they had been blasted off their course. His first officer stood just outside the doorway to the warp-core area. She shook her head and stared at him with a look of despair that spoke more eloquently than any words he could have spoken.
"It's gone captain."
He nodded. He had known it as soon as she had uttered those first three syllables. It was too much to hope for that the gravity-core would still be intact, and a glance at the readings on his scanner confirmed it. The warp-core had been blasted out of the ship along with its containment system. That meant no more FTL travel for them - ever.
"Captain?" The first officer was now looking at him anxiously. He raised an eyebrow at her. It seemed that she had something to say but wasn't sure whether or not it should be said. Eventually, she continued speaking as if she were talking to herself rather than addressing the man who would soon be responsible for their lives.
"The warp-core is gone captain. We can't get anywhere near warp-speed until we've fixed things up down here." He nodded. He had been expecting her news but he was glad that she had given it to him in a different way, allowing her to be the one to tell him rather than just announcing his doom outright.
"You might as well go home. We don't need you anymore."
The captain sighed and shook his head, ignoring the pain he was sure would come later from the movement. "No I suppose not but there is no going back for us now. There has been too much damage done for that. All we can do now is keep as many of our crew alive until we reach the surface." He looked at her and she nodded, a little more confidently than before.
"Right captain, lets get down to it then."
"Aye, let's."
As they descended into the heart of the ship, the captain became aware that there were other people in engineering with them. In fact there was at least ten of them, all of whom had been on their way back from somewhere. He supposed that some had been in shuttles while others were on foot but he did n't have time to ask any questions.
He and the first officer made their way down a corridor lined with open hatches. They passed by a few of these, all of them containing men in various states of repair. One was sitting atop his bunk, his face covered in a thin layer of blood but otherwise untouched. He had been watching as one of the others lay on the floor and wept quietly. Another had been shot through the leg and now hobbled across the room with only two good limbs.
The captain nodded at each one in turn, acknowledging their presence without stopping to speak to any of them. It was not that he did n't care; it was more just that they could wait until later. Right now they all needed his full attention and so he continued walking down the corridor, past several other doors with a number of people within. One had been killed by a bullet wound to the head but no one was there to investigate what had happened. A second contained three people huddled together in a corner while a fourth lay on his back across the room and wept silently into a pillow.
Finally they arrived at the doorway that led down into the engine room itself. The captain pushed it open with some difficulty - it was warped from where it had been blown out of its place by whatever had happened to them. It seemed as if the ship's computer was still in operation though, judging by the light coming from behind a bulkhead on the other side of the room.
The first officer took one step into the room and stopped dead in her tracks. The captain followed more cautiously, unsure of what to expect but knowing that it would most likely be something unpleasant. He peered around the corner of the bulkhead to see what his subordinate had been staring at.
The first thing he saw was blood - so much blood that it had formed a pool on the floor and crept up against the far wall. The next thing he noticed were bodies, one of which lay face down in the pool of blood, a red stain forming on her forehead where she had been shot through the skull. A few others, all with various wounds and injuries, lay around them. They must have been killed by some sort of attacker rather than each other, he thought.
He then saw the body of the captain's first officer, lying on her back near a control panel. Her eyes were closed, as if she had just fallen into an unconscious sleep. The captain walked around the corner and knelt down by her side. He touched her shoulder and then let out a sigh as he felt the warmth of blood still seeping from a hole in the side of her skull.
"Oh no." He murmured, almost to himself. "She's not dead - she was just unconscious when this happened but now-"
He stopped and looked up at his captain. The captain did n't understand what he had said so he repeated it, in a slightly louder voice. His first officer shook her head and then pointed at the control panel with one hand, still clutching her pistol tightly with the other.
The captain got to his feet again and looked up at the console. It was the same as all of their others but there seemed to be a difference in this one - something that made it stand out from its brethren. He stepped closer and leaned down until he could see what was wrong with it. A faint red light was glowing on the control panel, indicating that it had been armed at some time during their journey. The captain frowned at his first officer, unsure of what to do now.
"What shall we do about her sir?"
The captain stared down at his first officer for a few moments before shaking his head and sighing again. "There's nothing I can do for her, you know that." She nodded slowly, not meeting the eyes of her commander. He looked down at her again, this time with sadness in his own.
"I'm sorry captain. I knew what would happen when you got here but there was n't anything I could do to prevent it." The captain frowned as he tried to think of something else that she had said. "What did you say?" She raised an eyebrow at him and then nodded her head towards the control panel. "Oh, yes. You said 'I knew what would happen when you got here' but I can n't understand why-"
He stopped as he realised that there was a distinct lack of panic in his first officer's voice. Instead she sounded almost calm and collected, as if the situation had been perfectly normal all along. "Yes." She said. "I knew you would get here eventually, which is why I warned you not to come any further into this room when you got here." The captain frowned again but he could n't see what it was that she meant.
"Why should I n't go down there?" He asked as he stepped back and looked at the control panel. He saw then that the red light had gone out, replaced with a green one. "It seems safe enough to me." The first officer shook her head slowly as if she was trying to convince herself of something.
"Because it's not. You see I programmed this system so that only you would be able to override the safeguards and activate it." He stared at her blankly for a few moments before understanding dawned on him. "You-" She nodded, smiling as if she was proud of what she had done.
The captain stood up straight and turned back towards the control panel again. With slow, deliberate movements he reached out and flipped a switch next to it until it clicked into place with a satisfying 'click'. He let go of the switch then but it did n't fall back into its original position because a few moments later a section of the ceiling above him fell away completely.
The captain stared up at the gap in the wall, wondering what it was that he could see from up there. His first officer took a step forwards and peered out over his shoulder, looking towards the doorway from which they had entered. She grinned again then and stepped forward, disappearing into the darkness above him as he waited patiently below her.
She did n't move for several minutes until finally there was a rumbling sound coming from just inside the hatchway. The captain frowned, unsure of what was going on but keeping his eyes fixed firmly on where she had disappeared to. Finally she emerged from the darkness and floated down onto the floor in front of him, her clothing now replaced by a much more practical flight suit than he was used to seeing her wear.
She stared
