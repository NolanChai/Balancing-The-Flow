10 minutes before the end of the day. He thinks about the countless times they've done this over and over again—and yet, he can't bring himself to do it.
 He's always the one who stays until every job is finished, no matter how many times his manager has reminded him that "you have to know when to cut bait."
 It's been his mantra for years: _finish everything you start_. And he doesn't want to lose sight of it now. Not while he's on the cusp of making his first million.
 His manager can kiss those bonus checks goodbye if he thinks he'll be able to pull a fast one and slip out early today, he decides.
 The man is furious with himself for forgetting his phone—and worse than that, for getting caught up in the moment on a Friday afternoon. It was just so tempting, but now it's too late. His boss will know if he leaves early again and he might not give him another chance to redeem himself.
 He pulls out the phone and turns off the ringer. As he sets it back down next to his keyboard he suddenly realizes that he's been distracted all day long, forgetting that there was a time before smartphones when you could focus on your work and get it done.
 A man can only be interrupted so many times before losing the ability to do anything other than take breaks or call out sick altogether.
 He pushes his chair back from his desk and stands up, determined to finish what he started today. The last time he gave in to distractions like this—like text messages and phone calls from friends about who they're going out with that night—was when he lost a major client during one of their first big presentations as an account manager at his company.
 Now, three years later, his business has finally hit the big time (so to speak). He doesn't have time for this kind of stuff anymore—not if he wants to continue growing and improving his business.
 His coworkers are all leaving their desks now that it's 5 o'clock, but there's no one else left in the office. It's just him and a handful of people who work from home on Fridays.
 They don't seem to mind though, because everyone knows how much he cares about his job—and what kind of person it makes them when they're able to look back at all their past achievements without worrying whether or not someone will find out that they were late getting something done due to being distracted by text messages from friends.
 His phone starts ringing again but he ignores it this time, instead turning off the ringer completely so he doesn't have any temptation left. He can always answer calls after hours if needed (and yes, there are times when that will be necessary). But for now all he wants is to get his work done and go home—without feeling guilty about leaving early or having someone else find out how often it happens.
 
 The sound of a ringtone jars him from his reverie and he realizes he's been standing at the door, staring blankly into space. He turns off the ringer and sighs in relief as the phone slips back down to its resting place on his desk.
 It took him far too long to get used to not having a cellphone on him all day—and even longer than that for him to be able to work without feeling like he was being watched by everyone around him through their phones or computers.
 But now, after years of practicing this method of productivity and working hard at it every single day, his phone doesn't bother him anymore because he knows exactly what's going on with it (and why) when the ringer goes off during work hours—or any other time for that matter.
 He walks back over to his desk and sits down again—this time with a smile on his face instead of one filled with frustration at having forgotten about his phone yet another time today despite trying so hard not too! The ringtone doesn't bother him anymore either because it signals someone who matters in his life calling him rather than just another random person looking for attention or money through advertising (or whatever reason).
 
 The sound of a phone going off jolts him back to reality. He reaches for the device, but hesitates before answering. There's only one call he wants to take right now—and it's not from his boss.
 He picks up and presses the speaker button so that he doesn't have to listen through his earbuds again today. The person on the other end of the line sounds like they're in a hurry, which makes him wonder if it's urgent or just an interruption from someone who can't wait until after work hours for their call (or text).
 He doesn't have time right now though—he has projects due by Monday morning and he needs to get back to working on them before it gets too late in the day.
 "I know you don't want me calling at this hour, but I really need your help." The voice sounds familiar but not like anything that should be coming from an actual person rather than just some random stranger who wants him dead or something equally ridiculous for no reason whatsoever (or so he thinks).
 "What do you mean? Is everything okay?" He asks, hoping it's nothing serious because if there was something wrong then he would want them to tell him sooner rather than later instead of waiting until the last possible second before calling back home again after work hours—which is exactly what happened with his mother last week when she had an accident while driving and ended up hitting a deer on their way home from picking up dinner at In-N-Out Burger (yes, this really happens).
 "I don't want to talk about it over the phone anymore. Can we meet somewhere?"
 This time he doesn't hesitate before answering—and it turns out there is indeed something serious going on with his friend. It just isn't what he expected at all (or so he thinks).
 
 He's been sitting in a chair for hours now, staring blankly at the screen of his phone as it vibrates and beeps every few seconds. The noise has become such an annoyance that he can barely concentrate on anything else—and even when he does manage to focus enough energy toward reading something or writing something down, the distraction comes back with a vengeance, making him forget what he was doing in the first place and forcing him into yet another cycle of distraction followed by frustration.
 The only way out seems like it would be if he just got rid of his phone altogether—but then again, how could he function without one? And besides, he doesn't want to give up on all those apps that make life easier (or at least more entertaining) like Netflix or Instagram.
 Maybe there is another solution though—some way to block out the noise without giving up his favorite apps altogether... 
 
 He looks around at the empty room and sighs as he picks up his phone again, ready to give it another shot despite knowing that this time won't be any different than all the rest. He turns on Do Not Disturb Mode just in case there are any incoming calls or text messages from people who matter in his life (or so they think)—but even with all these settings activated, he still feels like someone might find out what he was doing during work hours if they decided to snoop through his phone later on down the line.
 He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before opening them again, hoping this time will be different than all those others that came before it... 
 
 It's been over an hour since he turned off all notifications on his phone, but the ringtone still goes off every few seconds—making him want to throw something at someone just because they couldn't have waited until after work hours for their call (or text).
 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cellphone, deciding that if there was ever a time when he needed some help with a problem then now would be it.
 The person on the other end of the line sounds like they're in a hurry though—which makes him wonder if maybe this isn't such a good idea after all... 
 He closes his eyes and takes another deep breath before answering, hoping that things will work out better than they did last time when he decided to ignore someone who was asking for help because it made them feel like their life didn't matter or something along those lines (and yes, this really does happen).
 "What do you mean? Is everything okay?" He asks, hoping it's nothing serious but also aware of how quickly things can spiral out of control if they aren't handled correctly from the start.
 The person on the other end of the line sounds like they're in a hurry though—which makes him wonder if maybe this isn't such a good idea after all... 
 
 It's been almost four hours since he turned off all notifications on his phone, but the ringtone still goes off every few seconds—making him want to throw something at someone just because they couldn't have waited until after work hours for their call (or text).
 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cellphone, deciding that if there was ever a time
