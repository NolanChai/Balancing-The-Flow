 us looking like a flock of zombies, shuffling through the streets to our new home. The crows' nest was just ahead at the top of a large oak tree that we would occupy together as a family until one of us left for a new nest or passed away in the next few years.

"There she is," one crow said, pointing to the woman standing below him. Her dark hair whipped around her face and soaked into her white shirt. I had to squint my eyes to see anything other than a blur of light gray. The wind blew against us all. "Don't go over there."
 
I didn't listen.

I wanted answers. 

"Who is she?"
 
 "Her name was Mary," another crow said, leaning closer to me. His voice was quieter than the other crows and had a hint of fear in it. He tipped his beak towards her with a smile before saying something I couldn't hear over the wind.

I reached out my hand to him. "Do you know what she did?" I asked him, knowing that he was the only one who would understand me. The only one who knew how important this was to me. The other crows moved away from us and continued on their journey as we stayed there in the tree, staring at her below.
 
Mary didn't turn around or seem like she heard my question but I knew better because a few moments later her eyes met mine with a glow that burned deep within me. It was dark and it consumed everything in its path. The world seemed to stop when we made eye contact, even the birds. She looked up at us for several minutes before taking off into the air.
 
"What did she say?" I asked him again.
 
He shook his head as if he didn't know what to tell me and I felt a wave of frustration pass over me like a storm. He had promised that he would never lie to me again but here he was, not even telling me the truth about the only person in this world who knew my name.
 
I tapped on his beak with my finger until he opened up and spoke in a voice so quiet I barely heard him. "Mary killed her baby," he whispered, as if she would hear him from where she flew away. I stared at the ground below us for several minutes before looking back up again to find him gone.
 
"Who is Mary?" I asked myself one last time before heading down the tree and onto my new home.
