 little, and I had the feeling that it didn’t want me to see its tail.
The thing was inhumanly ugly; there were no words for such an appearance. It could have come from any of the horror stories I read or watched on TV. It had tentacles instead of legs, with suckers at the end of each one, and a long, black spiked tail. Its skin looked like it was made out of dried-up, blackened leather that had been shredded by something terrible. The head itself resembled nothing more than a lobster without eyes or antennae. It didn’t look real; how could it be real? I mean, it just couldn’t.
It sat on the floor in front of me at my bedroom window, and if I had been asleep, it was something that would have scared me to death. The eyes looked so familiar somehow, even though they shouldn’t. The hairs on my neck stood up, and I could feel a shiver running down my spine.
It didn’t seem very threatening; its mouth gaped open like it wanted to tell me something, but the voice that came out of those giant black holes was not something I would have liked to hear. It sounded more like a squeak than actual words. That could only mean one thing: it had no vocal chords.
I ran from my room and downstairs. Mom didn’t answer when I yelled for her, but she heard me crashing around in the kitchen because she appeared at the top of the stairs with a frown on her face. “What is it?” She asked. “Who scared you?”
“I don’t know!” I answered. The thing was gone now; nothing there, no trace left behind. It had to be a dream, right? Or maybe… maybe mom saw something too. Maybe she didn’t want to admit it. Nope, definitely a dream. “It was probably just a bad dream,” I said.
“Your face is white as a ghost.” She looked at me like I was crazy.
I shook my head. “Nah, I must have just been tired,” I lied.
She didn’t seem to believe me. She sat down on the edge of my bed and patted my back, which made me feel a lot better. Then she left for work while I was still lying there. There were other things that I could tell her about, but I didn’t want to spoil her morning with bad news before she got into a good mood.
It took the thing just one night to come back and stare at me again. The same way as always – from my bedroom window. I ran for the kitchen again, this time getting Mom out of bed too. She was more than eager to talk about what I had seen, but then she noticed how pale I looked and she started asking if something was wrong.
“It’s okay, it was just a nightmare.” I answered calmly as if there weren’t anything to worry about, which was not entirely true.
She gave me another hug and kissed my forehead like she always did when she thought everything would be fine with me again. Then she went back upstairs for some more sleep before her shift began at eight AM. I had a whole day to think about the nightmare, which I was glad of; it meant that I could get some rest without worrying about it too much.
The next morning when my alarm clock went off and my eyes opened slowly from their slumber – there was no sign of anything strange at all! The window had been closed again after being left open during the night, just like usual. There wasn’t even any trace on the floor where I saw something sitting down before bedtime either; like nothing ever happened here at all!
It made me feel a little better about everything that I experienced last night – but only for now…I was sure that whatever it had been would show itself again soon enough…
