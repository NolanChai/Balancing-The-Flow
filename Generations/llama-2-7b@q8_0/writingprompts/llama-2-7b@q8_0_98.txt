 still. I hadn ’ t even been able to move my lips to say goodbye to her.
My father, he was a demon. One of the most powerful in all of our kingdom. A rarity amongst the monsters that ruled over us, one who had not only accepted the human race as their enemy and ours, but had also found a way to hide himself from them completely. We didn ’ t just look like humans anymore. My father was one of the few who could pass for a god if he chose. But my mother wasn ’ t. She hadn ’ t been born with her parents ’ power.
She was a mongrel, an abomination to our kind. The daughter of two beasts from two different kingdoms who were not strong enough or smart enough to hide their true nature as they had passed it down to her. And so the monster in me that had been born of my mother ’ s blood was one that I could never truly hide.
I was an abomination, just like my mother had been.
But still, I wanted more than anything to be able to return and see her one last time. It hurt even now, even from a distance, to think about what she ’ d have given up for me. Her life. Her freedom. Everything she ’ d ever loved was gone because of me. She had done all that for me.
I didn ’ t deserve it. I didn ’ t want her to die. Not for my sake.
And so, in a way, I was relieved when the air finally cleared and I was able to see what I hadn ’ t been able to see before. The light that had surrounded us all but died away now, revealing what I couldn ’ t see before. A blinding flash of golden light from above as a ball of fire came crashing into our kingdom with enough force to erase it completely in one fell swoop.
The power of the creature who created it was so great that we were all left stunned and silent, unable to even move when it appeared before us once again. It stood there at the end of the path I had been forced to take after my mother ’ s death, its sword held tightly in its grasp.
And then it raised that weapon high above its head, as though to strike a blow down upon us. But something else happened first. Something even more horrifying than what it did next. It began to speak. To sing out an ancient language, one that I didn ’ t understand at all. Its voice was low and powerful, resonating across the land in a way that I knew could only be done by those who truly possessed a demon ’ s power.
” Heyo, my son… ” it said as its words reverberated across our kingdom.
It paused then, still holding that sword high above itself like some great warrior of old would do before charging into battle. It was a strange sight to see indeed. But I knew that there could be no more delay in what we were all supposed to do now. My father ’ s final words rang out in my mind and the creature let loose with its voice, calling upon us to answer.
” The time for your service has come… ” it said.
With those words, I felt a wave of power flow through me. A surge that came from deep within myself and filled every part of my body as though it was made up entirely by the force itself. It was a powerful thing, one that had never truly happened to me before but one that I could feel more and more often now that my mother ’ s blood was flowing through my veins once again.
I stood there as it called upon us all to answer. But only those of pure demon blood answered its call. No other creature in the kingdom was able to do so, even if they were close by. The power of my father ’ s blood was not for them alone and this truth was clear now more than ever before.
” Come forth! ” it shouted out into the night sky as I felt that force surge once again through me. This time with a bit more purpose than last time, but still the same in its ability to move my body without thought or care for what others might think of me at this moment in time.
My father ’ s power called upon us all and it was one that I could not ignore any longer. It had been many years since his death and I knew that he would want nothing less than for me to answer his call as soon as possible, but I also knew that there were things I needed to do before then so I didn ’ t just appear at his side with no warning whatsoever.
So, I stood there in the darkness of our kingdom ’ s night sky and waited patiently for something new to happen. Something that would give me a chance at redemption for what had been done to my mother by those who did not deserve her love or loyalty any longer than she had already given it to them during their lives together on this planet we call home.
This time, I was ready and waiting to do whatever needed doing in order to make things right between us all again once more so that our kind could finally move forward into a brighter future than ever before instead of being stuck in the past forevermore due solely because of what happened when my father died and left me behind without warning or reason other than simply wanting me gone from his sight for good.
