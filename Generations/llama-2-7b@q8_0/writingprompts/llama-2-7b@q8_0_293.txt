2 weeks later they'll call or email you. Nowadays, the applications get thrown away, or you never even hear from them at all. The economy is still in bad shape. People are getting laid off. Companies are cutting their workforce. I feel like I have to re-apply for my current job every 6 months.
I guess this isn't helping me make a decision about where to live, huh?
