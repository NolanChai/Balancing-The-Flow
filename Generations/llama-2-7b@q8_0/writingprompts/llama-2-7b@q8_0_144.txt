A few more attempts and then I managed to get in through the door. 
 
 
When I entered the room, I saw a huge safe standing right before my eyes. Wow! That's a lot of money for me!
I didn't even wait to see if there was anything else inside or not. I just went straight to open it.
 
 
When I opened the safe door and started counting all the money, I noticed something. I don't understand what is happening but my hands were bleeding when I finished opening this safe!
 
 
I managed to find out that there was poisoned ink inside the safe that caused my hands to bleed. That's not the end of my story. I decided to write a note for the security guard and then throw it out on the table next to me. There were more than enough money left on the table.
 
 
When the security guard came in, he saw that his door was opened from outside. He quickly ran upstairs and got into the room where I was staying. He noticed a note lying on the table and took it.
I went back to my own room after locking the safe again. It's too much money for me to take!
 
 
As soon as I turned around, I saw that there was another man with me in the same room. He appeared out of nowhere when I turned around. I could hear him talking about how he wants more money and will be coming back later on tonight. It seems that he was already planning his next robbery after seeing all this money left here.
 
 
When I got a hold of myself, I went into my bathroom and locked the door behind me. I had no other choice but to kill myself or stay in this room forever!
 
 
I could hear the man trying to open the door. I knew he won't give up until either he opens it or he will find a way in through another exit.
I also managed to get hold of the window and jumped out of it. The building was not that tall so I managed to survive!
