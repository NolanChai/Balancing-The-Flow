 done to save myself... 
I had to. 
124 
I felt her tiny hand squeeze mine as she said in a low voice, "You can do it."
"Yes," I whispered back. "But you know, this is not about me."
She shook her head at that and said, "No, it's all about you now." Then she gave me another one of those gentle smiles which did so much to make her seem even younger than she really was. 
"Just think," I murmured, looking into her eyes, "there is still so much life left in you. What will you become?" 
She looked away from me for a moment and then said, "A mother." 
I tried to say something positive but my heart suddenly felt like it was filled with lead weights. 
"How can you be sure of that?" I asked her as she again took hold of my hand in both hers. 
She turned her head slightly and gazed at me for a long while, then finally said, "I just know."  
The sunlight which filtered into the room was now growing dimmer as night fell. It seemed to be almost a sign that something momentous was happening—that perhaps everything in our worlds was changing forever. 
125 
Then I felt a hand slip over mine and I looked up to see her face so close that my eyes blurred for a second before she said, "You know what you have to do?"  
"I think so," I whispered back. The thought of the task ahead made me feel a little ill. 
She then took a deep breath and let it out slowly, and her voice seemed to come from far away when she said, "There will be pain."
I could only nod.  
I've never been able to explain why but I knew that now. I had always felt the need to put on a brave face for the rest of the world and I know it's what she needed me to do as well, but I knew that if I was going to be able to pull this off—to bring her back—I had to let myself feel everything in all its gut-wrenching pain. 
"And...?" she asked after a moment. 
"And then it will be over," I managed to say, but the words seemed so cold as they came out of my mouth, I knew that they weren't enough.  
She looked away from me for a minute before her gaze once again met mine and her voice was stronger when she said, "There is no pain." 
I thought about all the times she had to have endured it over the years and shook my head, feeling like I'd been hit in the stomach. 
She smiled then and her eyes were full of warmth as she looked at me. "You will never feel a thing," she said, gripping my hand harder. "That is why you can do this... 
126 
Because you won't." I swallowed hard. "I don't know how to stop it from happening...."  
"But you will." Her voice was calm. She had to be ready for this herself or she never would have said what she had. 
It was only when I looked back at her that I saw the tears welling in her eyes and they seemed almost impossible to hold in as she whispered, "You won't let it hurt me."  
"No," I murmured, my mind racing. "I won't... 
I won't ever again..." She released her grip on my hand but didn't seem to notice or care that I was trembling from head to toe as she said, "There is nothing wrong with the way we were before."  
"You mean being born?" I asked. My voice sounded so weak and distant even to myself. 
She nodded slowly. "Yes," she whispered, looking away from me now, her eyes focusing on something far in the distance. Then she smiled faintly as she turned back to me, saying, "There's nothing wrong with it at all."  
"But..." I began and then stopped, feeling like I couldn't get out of my own head what needed to be said. 
She put her hand on top of mine again and looked up at the ceiling for a moment before she said softly, "I know... But now we can change things."  
"I don't understand," I whispered. The pain was building in my heart so rapidly that it seemed like all I could do was breathe out air and hope that no one noticed the way that I was shaking from head to toe. 
127 
She smiled again at me as she looked down at our hands, then said, "It's okay... You don't have to understand." Then she placed a kiss on my cheek before turning and looking out of the window with a sigh.  
I stared at her back for a moment, feeling so small that I couldn't even believe it was mine, then finally asked in a low voice, "So... what do we need to do?" 
She turned around slowly as she said, "Well, first of all... you need to remember your promise."  
I nodded and felt my heart start beating again. She had been so sure when I'd told her the other night that I would keep it no matter what. How could this not have worked? 
"Yes," she said gently, "you promised me you wouldn't let it hurt."  
I looked at her and then back down at our hands as they rested on my chest. It felt so good to be holding hers once more but I knew that feeling was only temporary, even if we made it through this. 
128 
She started to smile again when she said in a low voice, "And you remember what you promised yourself?"  
I nodded. Of course I did—she'd told me so many times before. She knew how much I hated the feeling of being weak or afraid and now here we were together once more, in this moment where everything could change if we both decided to let it happen. 
"You won't be able to save me," she said. "But you can still make things better."  
I was about to speak when the door opened and my mother came into the room. She had her arms wrapped around herself, as if in a cold wind—her hair sticking out from beneath the hood of the coat that she always wore on these nights. 
"Mom," I whispered with surprise, "what are you doing here?"  
She smiled at me and then said softly, "I'm so sorry... You must be angry..."  
"What do you mean?" I asked as I got to my feet to go over to her. 129 
The smile left her face as she looked up at the ceiling and sighed, saying in a low voice, "But it was not meant to happen like this... I'm so sorry..."  
"What isn't?" I asked, walking toward her until we were standing close enough for me to reach out and touch her hand. 
She pulled away from my grasp when she said softly, "It's not your fault." Then she looked up at me with a frown on her face as she added, "I'm sorry... but I need you."  
"Need me for what?" I asked with surprise as I stepped closer to her. 
She hesitated and then shook her head slowly before turning away from me so that her back was against the wall in the far corner of the room. Then she whispered, "You know... don't you?"  
I stared at her for a moment, not sure what I should say or do next as I thought about all the questions and concerns swirling around inside me. Was this really happening? How could it be that my mother was here now—after everything else had gone so wrong? 
130 
Finally I looked at her in confusion, saying, "No... but you're scaring me."  
"Oh..." she whispered and then turned back to face me with tears running down her cheeks. "I'm sorry... I know that sounds crazy."  
"What is?" I asked as I stepped closer to her until there was only a few feet separating us, our eyes locked on each other in an almost frightening way. 
She hesitated again before finally saying, "That you can save me from dying here... 
"I just need your help," she whispered quietly so that it seemed like even the wind outside couldn't hear her words.  
But I heard every word clearly enough to know that she was right when she said it—that we needed each other in ways that neither of us knew yet.  
Then, without saying another word, she reached out for my hand as tears started rolling down both our faces and began to cry with me.... 131
