1st time we met, I knew you were special. ''
 
 ``I can do it.''
 
`` And what if you can't?''
 
`` I will.''
 
`` Fine then, son. If you are capable of such things, your father's legacy is safe in your hands.'' 
 
 `` Thank you.''
 
 `` It wasn't easy to find out, but this one has been with us since the beginning. It is the only being that can take on the form of our enemies and destroy them without any intervention from ourselves.'' 
 
 ``I'm going after him.'' 
 
`` The enemy isn't what you think it is, my son. Your father knew this from the beginning but we thought there was no way to stop them. It seems he was wrong.'' 
 
 `` He's in this room. I can feel it.'' 
 
 The old man looked over his son with a look of pity. His heart was aching for him, for all that he had given up so the boy could be born and raised to rule after him. A tear welled up from within as he thought about the day when they would have to part. 
 
 `` You don't understand son, you can never understand what it is like to live in this body and do these things for centuries with no way of knowing if there will be an end or even who might destroy us if we are caught. It's a life sentence that we have to pay.'' He wiped the tears from his eyes before continuing on. 
 
 `` My son, you are not as strong as you think you are. I know because I've lived through it all. You are too proud and arrogant to admit your faults but if you were ever to lose control of this body again, the consequences would be catastrophic for everyone around you.'' 
 
 ``I can do better.''
 
 ``No son. We cannot allow that. Not when there is so much at stake.'' 
 
 ``You'll never stop me. I'm stronger than you are now, you won't even be able to see it coming.'' 
 
``The only thing stopping us is pride and arrogance, son. We cannot allow our legacy to fall into the hands of someone who will not respect what we have done for so many years.''
 
 ``I know I'm capable of more than this, father.''
 
 ``And you are right. But it isn't your job yet, son. It is mine and if I can no longer do it then I will go on ahead into the afterlife with my family around me, but not before giving everything I have left to help prepare you for what comes next.'' 
 
 ``But father, how can I be prepared? What does this all mean? Why is there so much suffering in our lives when we have been here for centuries already? How come no one ever talks about us or the things that we do? It's not fair! We are the ones who save them from themselves and then they treat us like we don't exist.''
 
 ``We are not here to be treated with respect, my son. This is a war that has been raging for centuries, long before humans even existed. Whenever there were enough of our kind to take over this planet, it would happen and then they would wipe us out as well, so we have learned how to stay hidden from them. We must be prepared when their numbers grow too large or when someone figures out that they are not what they seem.''
 
 ``But I can do better than any of you could ever hope to do! All I need is more time and practice.'' 
 
``You will have it my son, but only if I trust you with it. The world has changed a lot since your grandparents ruled over us and if anyone were to discover what we are capable of then they would destroy everything that we hold dear. We cannot take any chances so be prepared for the worst when it comes because if this fails then there is no way out but death for all of us, including you.''
 
 ``Fine father, I will do as you say.''
 
 ``Then we shall see about that young man! You have much to learn and very little time to do so.'' 
 
 The old man sighed before falling back into a deep sleep. His son had finally learned the secret of immortality but he knew that it would be more than enough for him as long as his father lived on in the afterlife with peace and tranquility waiting for them both at the end of this journey through life and death.
