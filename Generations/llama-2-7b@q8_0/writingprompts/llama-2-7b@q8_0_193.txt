 to have such an intense conversation with me?
 At first, I thought he was being sarcastic; but the next day, after school, I found him outside of my house playing an acoustic guitar (with an amp), on my porch.
 We talked about bass for a little while, and he brought up the possibility of getting together to learn bass with me in my garage.
 
 The garage was perfect. It has its own lighting fixtures, and no windows. A place where we could escape the world, or at least my parents.
 So, Ethan came over that afternoon, and for a good few hours I learned how to hold the bass correctly, as well as the right hand technique, with which one can create music with this instrument. 
 At first it was awkward; but once we were both holding our instruments and standing in front of my amp (with volume on), Ethan started playing chords and melodies that I could not even recognize. It was beautiful to watch his fingers move across the fretboard, like they were dancing. 
 I was still a little confused about how to play it; but when he finished teaching me the first song (which was called: “I love you”, by The Beatles), Ethan went to my stereo and played another tune, which was called: “Shock Me” By Queen. 
 It took me a second to recognize it because I had never heard the song in full, but once I did, I stopped being confused.
 In the end, we agreed that Ethan would come over every day after school until he felt I could play without having him hold my hand for the entirety of the process. 
 Of course, if I really couldn’t do it on my own by then, he would help me out with one or two songs, as well as any tips that needed to be given. 
 That day was a few weeks ago; and I can already play the song perfectly without Ethan having to hold my hand at all. 
 My first solo project is going to be: “Shock Me”, by Queen, because it is one of my favourite songs, as well as being one that I am very good at playing with the bass. 
 I do not want this project to sound like it was made by someone who is just starting out; so I am going to make sure I play it right, without any errors whatsoever.  

### Episode Two 

It’s been a while since my last post about playing bass with Ethan. 
 To be honest, I feel like I have improved in every way possible, and that is because of our practices together; which we do once or twice per week (at the very least). 
 When he came over this morning, however, there was something different about his demeanour. I’m not sure what it is exactly; but it seemed as if he was a little bit more serious than usual.  
 After we had spoken for a few minutes and he had set up all of his instruments (including my bass), I asked him why he was acting so strangely, to which he replied: “Well, I don’t know; but something doesn’t feel right.” 
 At first it felt like he was joking around with me; but when we started playing music together and discussing what each song meant (which is always fun), that feeling disappeared. 
 He also said a couple of things about his band, The Rippers, which made me laugh because they are so bad at performing songs live on stage. It’s like they can never get their act together!  
 
I do not have a lot to say about the episode itself; but I feel that it would be best for us to continue playing music in my garage, until we can perform better than The Rippers themselves! 
 Maybe some day we will become famous and everyone who has ever listened to our songs will love them too.
