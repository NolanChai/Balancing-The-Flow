40 hours that week and no one even blinks. You can have a bad haircut without consequence because it will grow out by Friday night, when it doesn't matter anymore. 
 The best thing about Wednesday is you don't have to work Thursday morning.
# The Gift
I've never been big on Christmas gifts and I suspect it may be because I spent so much of my life in a nursing home. 
 I was always surprised when people would give me presents, but the truth is that my grandmother didn't really need toys or sweaters as she grew older. She had so many stuffed animals and afghans that there wasn't enough room on her bed for them all. Instead of giving her more gifts, I think it made people feel better if they just brought some food or something that might help the nursing home. 
 I used to hate when Christmas came around because there was so much hype surrounding it and we had no money and I felt like I didn't deserve presents anyway, even though everyone always insisted that I did. And then once you got all those gifts, you weren't really sure what to do with them or if they would even fit in your tiny apartment. 
 After my grandmother died and I moved out of the nursing home, I decided I didn't need any Christmas presents, because I had everything I needed already and people could just give me money instead. But then one year for Christmas my parents gave me a present that was different from anything they had ever given me before—they let me decide what to get them. 
 And so I went on an adventure. I spent the whole weekend before Christmas shopping for presents for my family and it was one of the most fun things I've ever done. The first day, I bought my mom a purse, because she wanted a new one but hadn't had time to go shopping. Then on Saturday afternoon I went down to my hometown and got my dad tickets to a hockey game. On Sunday, I took him for lunch at the diner where we used to eat when I was little. 
 I loved going out with my parents that weekend and having fun together instead of spending it in our tiny apartment, staring at each other and thinking about how sad everything is. And then Christmas morning I brought all their presents home from the car and gave them to them one by one. It was like watching someone open their birthday gifts—so exciting and happy! 
 My parents were surprised but they seemed really happy with my choices, especially my dad who hadn't been to a hockey game since I was five years old. The best thing about being able to decide what I wanted them for Christmas instead of just getting whatever they picked out? I didn't have any idea what I wanted at all and so I ended up picking things that would mean something special only between us, like tickets to a hockey game or the purse my mom always wanted but never bought herself because it was too expensive. It's been two years now since I decided what presents people were getting for me instead of just waiting around until they figured it out on their own—and every year has been better than any other before it, even though we don't know when this whole thing will end and Christmas is always coming up so soon! 
# The Girl in the White Coat
I was in eighth grade when I first saw her. She was sitting by herself at lunch on a sunny day like every other sunny day, but something about this one felt different to me. It was a Wednesday—the only day of the week that wasn't just another school day to be forgotten or remembered only for its end. 
 That afternoon we had an assembly in our cafeteria. There were all these different tables set up around the room, each one decorated with balloons and streamers like it was going to be someone's birthday party. I remember feeling nervous about what might happen next: would someone get called onstage or maybe asked to read something in front of everyone? 
 A girl wearing a white coat walked up to me at my table and put her hand on top of mine as if she knew exactly who I was and wanted us to be friends. Her eyes were dark brown and kind of sad, but also full of light—the way they are when someone has been smiling for so long that all the lines around their mouth have softened with joy. 
 "Hi," she said. 
 "Hi." 
 She smiled again and her smile lit up her whole face like it was on fire. There was something about those eyes—they were just too beautiful to be real, which is why I still remember them so clearly all these years later: the way they shone in their socket like stars in an empty sky at night-time when everything else is dark around you but one thing stays bright no matter how far away it seems from where your body lies on its bed asleep under blankets tucked tightly up against your chin. 
 Her name was Sarah, and she had just transferred to our school that day after living in a small town called St. Charles for most of her life. We were both eighth-graders but we'd never met before this moment when she reached out with one hand and touched my other hand while looking up at me through lashes so long it seemed like they could stretch down past the floorboards onto which our feet rested beneath us as if to remind us that no matter how far away things might feel, there will always be a way back home—no matter what. 
 That afternoon was one of those days when everything seems different than before: the air is crisper and clearer; the sunshine feels warmer on your skin; it's almost like time has stopped altogether so that everything just flows together without ever really changing its course or pace. Everything seemed to move slowly but still somehow fast all at once because this girl named Sarah was standing next to me in our cafeteria, smiling with her mouth open wide enough for me to see inside of it. 
 She looked up at me with eyes so big and bright they could make me forget everything I'd ever been told about the way people were supposed to act around one another: this is how you talk; here are some rules for being nice; now go away! 
 And then she said something that made all my doubts fade away like clouds on a sunny day: "I really like you."
 I can't remember what I said back or where we went next because at the time it felt like nothing more than another ordinary moment in an otherwise boring day full of classes and homework assignments due tomorrow morning when we wake up with our eyes wide open wondering if today will ever end! 
 But as soon as that memory came into view again I knew this would be one for the history books: Sarah was the girl who changed everything about my life without saying a single word or doing anything else except being herself while staring right at me from across the room, smiling like no one had ever smiled before.
# The Party
It's a strange thing to see someone in their late twenties or early thirties talking about how they used to go out all night and party every weekend—you might think it sounds funny at first but then again maybe not so much because there was probably some truth behind those stories after all (or at least most likely). 
 I remember being young and thinking that adults were old people who had forgotten what it's like to be a kid. But then one day when I was thirteen my mom came home from work early, sat down on her bed with an empty bottle of whiskey in hand, and started telling me all about how she used to go out partying every weekend before she had children or got married—how she met someone who would become important in both our lives but never thought much beyond that time when things seemed so fresh and exciting (which may have been true). 
 My dad was an alcoholic for most of my life, so it's not surprising that we lived with lots of empty bottles sitting around the house. There were always new ones coming in but never any old ones left behind to remind us how quickly everything changes: people change jobs and move away or die; friends get married and have kids themselves—the list goes on forever like there will never be an end. 
 When I was younger my mom would tell me about her best friend's husband who used to drink all the time when they were still dating, but now he's sober for good (or at least until next week). She said that after she married him it took some getting used too—he had trouble staying away from booze because his friends kept inviting him out on nights where everyone else got drunk while watching television together in their living rooms around town; this went on for years before he finally decided enough was enough and quit drinking altogether. 
 My mom said that she used to feel guilty about not being able to help her friend, but then again what could you do except try your best? Maybe if more people would stop thinking they know everything just because they're old then maybe things might change for the better—I don't know why I even bothered telling this story in the first place! 
 The point is: don't let age hold you back from doing what makes you happy. Even though it seems like people are always getting older and that means less time
