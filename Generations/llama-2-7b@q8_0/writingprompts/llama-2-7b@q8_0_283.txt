50 year old tree. We decided to take out all the wood that had been blown away by the wind and made a pile of wood. We will make a fire tomorrow!
Itâ€™s so beautiful here on this island. I am looking forward to my next visit. Thanks again for everything!
The photo below is a little bit different from what you might expect, but itâ€™s still a picture of an island! This one has been taken at the coastline in New Jersey, where there are tons of islands in the ocean. The picture shows the first layer of dunes and beach grasses growing on top of sand-dunes. It also shows another interesting feature, namely some old tree trunks that have washed ashore. In addition to having a nice view over the sea it is a great place for walking because you can see all kinds of tracks in the sand and itâ€™s just fun to walk around here.
Here are two more pictures from my walks at night, taken with my cellphone. Itâ€™s so quiet out here during the daytime but especially when there is a full moon you can really hear everything. I like walking in nature because itâ€™s so quiet and calm. The first picture shows an owl flying over our house while we were having dinner outside on the deck at nightfall. We have seen some other birds too, such as hawks and eagles, but no more than a few times during these months of living here full-time (October/November). The second picture is from another evening when I was walking down the road towards town with my dog Sweetpea who likes to go exploring outside.
In addition to being surrounded by nature and beautiful views, we have a great community of people living on our island too! We are all neighbours and friends here so thereâ€™s lots going on throughout the week â€“ from potluck dinners to movie nights, from yoga classes or hiking trips together with other residents, to just relaxing at one anotherâ€™s homes over coffee and cake (or wine). If you ever want some company while travelling here in New Jersey then come say hi!
There are many things that I have been trying to do on my island. One of those is to live simply. That means not having any TV or internet connection, just like back when we used to live on a farm without electricity and water supply. It also means eating fresh food from the garden and fishing for dinner every day.
The good thing about living simply is that you get more time with your family. We spend so much of our lives working or doing things outside of our homes, but when we are at home there isnâ€™t any distraction like TV shows or internet access which can be very addictive sometimes! This makes it easier for us to focus on other activities instead like playing board games together as a family and having long conversations about what happened during the day.
The first picture is from our deck, taken at sunset. We live right across from the beach so you can see everything from our living room windows â€“ even dolphins sometimes swimming near shore! The second photo shows one of many paths that lead into different parts of our property where we go hiking with dogs or take walks down by ourselves just to get some fresh air and enjoy nature.
The third picture is taken on an old tree stump sitting next door, which has been used as a bench for many years before it fell over while I was taking pictures from it (I wasnâ€™t actually meant to be sitting there). The last photo shows part of our property with mountains in the distance â€“ this is how we see them when we look out towards sea level instead of up into the clouds like most people do.
The first picture is an old fishing boat that sits on a beach near us, and Iâ€™ve never seen anyone else take such good photos from inside it! The second one was taken in town where all kinds of boats are parked at high tide every morning before going out again later that afternoon (some stay there all night). These two shots make me want to get a boat like those someday when my kids are old enough not to break things anymore ðŸ™‚
We hope you enjoyed these pictures from our life here on the island. If so, please share them with your friends and family who might also enjoy them as well! And if thereâ€™s anything else that we can do for you or answer any questions about living here then donâ€™t hesitate to contact us through email at [email protected]
Today I will be showing you pictures from my island, which is located in the South Pacific. It has beautiful views of mountains and valleys all around it as well as lots of different kinds of animals like monkeys or birds that live there too! The second photo shows how much fun we had building our house out of logs from trees growing on nearby farms â€“ this was before electricity became available for everyone so everything had to be done by hand (or foot).
In the third picture Iâ€™m holding up some freshly caught fish while standing next to my wife who is cooking them over an open fire outside our home; she makes delicious meals every day and we always have plenty left over when guests visit us too! The fourth photo shows just how peaceful living here can be with no one else around except ourselves. Finally, thereâ€™s another shot of a view from up high looking down towards some nearby towns which are hidden away in valleys surrounded by mountains â€“ it reminds me why I chose to come live on this island instead of somewhere bigger or busier like Los Angeles or New York City!
