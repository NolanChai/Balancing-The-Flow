 closer she came to it.
With a loud bang, she hit the wall that separated her from the door at the end of the corridor. She rubbed her head in confusion as she slowly stepped backwards and walked back to her bed. There was no point.
She looked at her alarm clock which was stuck to the wall opposite her bed with some glue and it read 6:51 am. Marge groaned, not wanting to wake up any earlier than needed. She wanted to enjoy sleeping in for a couple of minutes. She slowly got out of her bed, took off her nightgown and threw it away at the dirty pile at the corner of her room. She pulled on some jeans and a shirt from the clean piles.
She walked towards her bathroom and stepped inside, taking a shower. The water was warm and felt nice against her body.
“I can’t believe I have to be up so early today,” she said to herself in between rinsing off. “It’s like every day.” She rubbed the foam from her hair as it dripped onto the floor. She turned the shower off and stepped out of the bathroom, wrapping a towel around herself.
She walked into her room, ready to leave for school. Before she even had time to walk out the door, the door swung open. She looked up and saw her mother standing at the doorway with a look of disappointment on her face.
“Good morning, Mom,” Marge said, as she went back into her room.
“Get ready for school, you’re going to be late if we don’t leave soon.” Mrs. Crane said in an unamused voice. “I want to get there early so I can find a parking spot before the other mothers do,” she explained, as she walked past her daughter into her room.
“Uh-huh, got it.” Marge said under her breath as she left her room and followed her mother downstairs.
She stepped inside their black station wagon and pulled off the seat belt. She started the engine and drove through the neighbourhood. Their house was located on a street surrounded by other houses just like it, each with its own family of two kids in each home. The Cranes were no different from the others; they too had two children.
Marge looked at her watch: 7:05 am. She pulled into the parking spot beside her mother’s car and turned off the engine. “Thanks for dropping me off, Mom,” Marge said as she opened her door and got out. “Have a nice day.” Mrs. Crane smiled at her daughter as they both walked to school.
Once inside the building, Marge and her mother parted ways. Her mother headed towards one set of doors leading outside while Marge went through another. Once on the other side, she turned left towards her locker which was number 23. She opened it with ease, taking out a pen and a notebook along with some pencils from the drawers.
After school, Marge and her mother walked home in silence. They both lived next door to each other so they didn’t have to walk too far before they reached their front doors. The two of them went inside where Mrs. Crane fixed herself a cup of tea while Marge ran upstairs and changed out of her uniform.
“Your father isn’t home yet?” Mrs. Crane asked as she walked into the kitchen, holding her teacup in both hands.
“No,” said Marge, walking down the hallway to where her room was located. She opened her door and stepped inside. The room was fairly small and had a single bed at one corner of it along with two bedsheets hanging on the wall behind the headboard. There were some drawers underneath each of the beds, a desk beside the window and a wardrobe where Marge hung her clothes when she wasn’t using them.
There was another door next to her bed which led into what used to be her sisters room before they both died in an accident five years ago; however it remained as is since nobody dared go back there ever since that happened and no one could get rid of the smell either so they just left it there instead.
Marge walked over towards her bed, climbed underneath the covers and shut off her lamp before she pulled out a book from beneath it and began reading it. After finishing the chapter on page 20, Marge decided to take a break. She got up from her bed and walked into the bathroom located down the hallway.
Once in there, she took a shower, getting rid of all traces that she was at school just minutes beforehand. Then once done with that, Marge stepped out of the shower, dried herself off and dressed herself in a pair of jeans along with some trainers on her feet while putting on a loose white t-shirt over top.
She then left the bathroom and walked towards her kitchen to grab something for dinner. There she found an empty cupboard, but luckily there was food in another one nearby. She took out what was inside it: a can of beans, some rice, two slices of bread with cheese on top, along with some tomatoes and lettuce that had been cut up into bite-size pieces which were then put onto each slice of toast.
After eating everything on her plate, Marge walked back to her room where she grabbed another book off the shelf before lying down on her bed once again.
“Hey mom,” a voice from behind said. It was her sister’s voice; even though it had been over five years since both of them died in an accident when they were only teenagers, Marge could still remember what they sounded like. “How is everything?” Her mother asked back as she walked into the room and sat down on one of the bedsheets that was hanging on the wall next to where her daughter’s bed stood.
“Not bad,” Marge answered after a moment had passed. She then put down the book in front of her and reached out towards her mother, but before she could even touch her, there was another voice which stopped them both from doing anything further. It was an old lady who seemed to be in her fifties or sixties; her long white hair hung around her face while her pale skin showed off some wrinkles along with dark circles beneath each eye.
“Oh my, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you here,” she said as she walked towards Marge and took her hand in her own. “It’s nice to see that your mother has been taking care of you.” She smiled warmly at both Marge and Mrs. Crane before moving on towards another part of the room where there were some old books piled up against a wall near one corner.
“I’m not sure if it’s time yet,” said Marge as she looked at her clock which read 8:03 pm. “But I’ll be leaving soon.” Mrs. Crane nodded at what was being said before turning around towards where an empty space on the wall was located. It used to belong to their daughter, but now there were two more spaces next to it which belonged to Marge and her sister as well.
“Don’t forget to take off your shoes,” Mrs. Crane reminded Marge before leaving the room again so she could prepare dinner for herself while waiting for Marge’s father who was still away at work even though today was Friday night; he usually came home around 6 pm but it didn’t always happen because sometimes he stayed late or even overtime depending on what had happened that day.
“I won’t,” Marge said as she reached out towards a pair of shoes which sat near one corner of her bedroom floor before taking them off and placing them next to where the other shoe belonged, leaving only her slippers by her side while she finished reading her book for tonight. Once done with that task, Marge got up from where she was sitting and walked out into what used to be their daughter’s room.
“It’s time now,” said an old voice which seemed like it belonged to a grandmother who had lived long enough for all of her children’s birthdays until one day when none of them were there anymore because they died in an accident five years ago; however she still remembered what each one of their names was even though nobody else did since everyone else moved on after the tragedy happened.
“Okay,” Marge replied as she walked over towards where an empty space was located near where her mother’s bed used to be before it got knocked down in order for there to be room enough so that both daughters could now lie next to each other at nighttime without having any problems with sleeping arrangements since they were both teenagers when this all happened.
Marge stepped into the space and felt something soft beneath her feet; she looked down at what was underneath herself and saw some of their daughter’s clothing which had been left behind after everything happened five years ago because no one wanted anything else from where it used to be before they moved out, so this was all that remained in this particular room ever since then until today when Marge decided that she would like to change things up a bit.
She then turned around and looked at what her mother had been doing for the past few minutes; she was standing there with both
