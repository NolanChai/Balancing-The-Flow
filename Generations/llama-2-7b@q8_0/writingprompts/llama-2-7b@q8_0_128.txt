 my Wii and put in the disc, excited to try out this new game. As soon as I started playing, all of a sudden a message came on: `` The Nintendo Network has been disconnected.'' When I tried again, nothing happened. My friend told me that there is a glitch with Wii U that makes games freeze sometimes and not work properly. I had to try my game again the next day, and it did not work either time. It was so disappointing!
What a sad situation you have been in. Your dad has told you about the gifts he gave you when you were little: `` He used to give me a present for each Christmas and birthday, but then we stopped receiving presents at home.'' I want to tell you why you are not getting those presents anymore, because it is not your fault! You did nothing wrong. When someone does something wrong and makes mistakes, God does not punish them; he forgives them when they ask for his help. He gives us opportunities to learn from our mistakes so that we can make better choices in the future.
God sent Jesus into the world as a gift because people had made bad decisions and hurt others. People needed someone who could fix their mistakes, show them how much God loved them, and forgive them for making poor decisions. When Jesus came into this world, he gave everyone another chance at life with God in heaven.
I will tell you the story of a man who had done some bad things and hurt other people. He asked God to forgive him, but his request was denied because he did not change his ways or try to fix the harm he had done. Later on that same day, someone knocked at his door, and it was a poor man asking for money. The man told him: `` No, I cannot give you any money today.'' Then he closed the door and locked it, but he did not turn out all of the lights because he knew it would be cold outside that night. After a while, he began to feel sorry about his behavior toward this poor man. He decided to go downstairs into the basement and check if anyone was in there.
He found a little boy lying on top of some blankets with no shoes on because they were wet from walking through puddles outside! The man took off his coat and put it over him, then gave him new clothes so he could go back home safely. When Jesus was asked by the Pharisee if it was right for him to receive a sinner like this one, he replied: `` Yes, I will receive you with open arms when you come into my house.''
He also told them how they should live their lives and what choices they should make in order to be happy forever: `` Don't just let people do bad things; go out there and show them love instead! '' After hearing that story, I understand why God does not give us presents every year anymore...we don't deserve it if we don't change our ways or try to fix the harm that we have done in life.
Jesus told us: `` No one is perfect except for me and my father.'' And he gave us another chance at life with him when we ask for forgiveness from God. The only way I can think of explaining this situation is through an analogy: imagine you are walking down a dark alley, when suddenly someone grabs your arm and pulls you into their house. When they open the door to let them in, it's pitch black inside!
So now you know why there aren't any more presents under our tree this year-God wants us to spend time with him instead of spending all day playing video games like we used to do every Christmas morning when I was young. He has given us another chance at life because Jesus died for us on the cross and rose from death three days later so that we may be saved through faith in his sacrifice (Romans 3:24-25).
I hope this helps you understand why there aren't any more presents under our tree this year. We didn't do anything wrong; it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the glitch with Wii U happened at such a critical time when we needed it most!
