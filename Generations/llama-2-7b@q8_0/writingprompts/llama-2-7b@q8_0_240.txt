 A flash blinded him for a second and then it was gone.
 He blinked hard and rubbed his eyes. 

 The camera focused in on him again and began to record. 
 
 Dave stared at the ceiling of the cockpit, wondering what he had been thinking. 

 Then he noticed a strange smell wafting towards him. It was not the normal air freshener that his boss liked so much. There was something more overpowering about it. The scent was...

 _Strawberries_. 

 Dave knew strawberries like nobody else. He'd had some a few nights ago with his girlfriend. She was really pretty. He sighed heavily and continued to ignore the camera. 

 A voice came out of nowhere: "Hey there, Mr. Gronkowski," it said in an excited tone, as if he'd just been given a great gift.

 Dave turned around. Behind him was a man with short blonde hair and a shiny brown suit, like he'd stepped out of a 1950s movie set. 

 He held up his hand, palm forward. A small device was attached to the end of one finger. 

 "You are on camera," said the man, as if he'd been waiting for Dave all day just so that they could chat.

 "So what?" asked Dave, wondering why this guy would have a camera hidden in his suit, or why he would want to talk with him at all. 

 The man laughed and stepped closer to the console. He looked over the shoulder of the pilot as if it were an obstacle course.

 "I see what you mean," said Dave. "You're a little too close."

 The man ignored this remark, his smile only getting wider. 
 
 A beep sounded in the cockpit and Dave glanced back at the screen where he was typing. He paused, waiting for the computer to respond. Then a new message appeared:
 _"Sorry Dave, I'm afraid you are too late."_

 "Too late?" said Dave with confusion on his face. 

 The man behind him chuckled. "You just failed your first test," he said. "If you want to fly the plane then you must be better than that."

 Dave was confused but it didn't matter because another message appeared on screen:
 _"Please note that your actions are being recorded for quality assurance purposes only,_ 21083

 
 A loud voice sounded from behind him. It was coming through the speakers of the cockpit. "We need to test all the pilots this week," it said in a gruff tone. "All those who fail will be terminated immediately." 

 Dave turned around, his eyes wide with fear.

 "Terminated?" he asked with shock.
 
 The man behind him smiled. "Don't worry, you are only being tested," he said. "And there is nothing to worry about."
 
 But Dave had already jumped from his seat and was running towards the exit of the cockpit. He stopped in front of a door and turned around just as the man behind him did. Dave felt like he'd just been stabbed in the heart by a hot knife, but he kept running, out of the cockpit, and into the airport hallway. 
 
 "Dave! You can't do this!" shouted the voice from the speakers.

 Dave didn't even stop to listen. He just ran as hard as his legs could carry him, ignoring the fact that he was wearing a bulky jacket and pants made for the winter. The airport hallway was hot, much warmer than it should have been, especially with the doors open behind him, but Dave didn't care about the temperature. All he cared about now was getting as far away from that man in the brown suit as quickly as possible. 

 As soon as he got to the end of the hallway, though, another voice spoke over the loudspeakers: _"Dave Gronkowski, please return to your seat."_ 

 Dave stopped and turned around just as the door in front of him opened again. It was the man in the brown suit. He stepped out slowly and smiled at Dave. 
 
 "Please don't run away from me," he said gently. His voice was soothing but Dave knew that it wasn't genuine. He could tell by the way his eyes flickered up and down, as if looking for an opportunity to escape. 
 
 _"You can trust me,"_ said the man in the brown suit. 

 "No thanks," replied Dave, turning away again. He hurried back towards the cockpit. 
 
 The man in the suit called out after him: "I will let you off with a warning this time, but next time I'll have to call security."
 
 Dave didn't answer and just kept running, until he finally reached his seat in front of the console again. He sat down heavily and pulled his headphones on over his ears, blocking out all sound from outside of them.

 The man in the suit stepped back into the hallway, the door clicking shut behind him. 

 "Dave Gronkowski," said a voice over the speakers, "you have failed your first test. Please return to your seat."

 Dave took off his headphones and stared at them for several seconds before putting them back on again. He sighed and sat down in front of the console once more. His mind was still reeling from what had just happened, but he knew he had no choice but to continue the test if he wanted a job.
 
 He typed his name into the system again, then began pecking at the keyboard like a madman. But this time it wasn't so hard. His fingers moved quickly and accurately over every button and keypad on the console. The numbers flew across the screen faster than he could keep up with them. 

 Dave Gronkowski had passed his first test!
 
 A message appeared on the screen: _"Congratulations, you have passed your first test!"_

 Dave looked around for a moment before he saw the man in the brown suit walking towards him. He stepped back into the cockpit and sat down beside Dave once more. 

 "That was very impressive," said the man. His face was beaming with excitement as if he were on stage giving an acceptance speech for winning an Oscar. "I'm sorry for being so harsh before, but I really think you have a lot of potential."

 Dave felt embarrassed by this praise and his cheeks turned red from the heat of his face. He was also embarrassed about running away in front of everyone, including security personnel who could have arrested him on the spot if he wasn't so fast. 

 _"So,"_ said the man in the brown suit, "I hope you don't mind that I've decided to give you a second chance."

 Dave stared at his companion for a moment before saying: _"Yeah... Okay then."_ 

 The man smiled and leaned back in his chair. Then he held up the small device on his finger, pointing it towards Dave. "Now I'm going to ask you some questions," said the man. "You just answer truthfully and you should be fine."

 Dave nodded but felt nervous about what might happen next. The thought that this strange man had a camera somewhere in his suit was making him feel uncomfortable again. But he tried to ignore it, knowing he needed to focus on the task at hand.
 
 The man held up his device and spoke: _"I'm going to ask you some questions now,"_ then pointed to a screen on the wall in front of them. It was blank but Dave knew what it would say once they started asking the questions. "If I like your answers, then we will have no problem continuing this test," said the man with a smile. 

 Dave nodded again and felt his heart rate increase slightly. He took a deep breath and tried to concentrate on the task at hand: answering questions about himself that nobody would ever want to know anyway. 

 "Okay, I'm ready!" he said.

 The man nodded back at him before pressing some buttons on the device in his suit. A few seconds later, Dave could feel a cool breeze coming towards them from somewhere behind and above where they sat. He turned around to see that there was nothing there except for an open doorway leading into another room beyond. The only other thing in sight were two long rows of seats facing each other on either side of the walkway, with people sitting down like they had just come out of a movie theatre or something else equally strange. 

 _"You've got about four minutes,"_ said the man from behind him, "to answer as many questions as you can." 

 Dave looked over to see that there were two rows of seats facing them on either side of where they sat in front of a big screen. There was nothing else in sight except for an open doorway leading into another room beyond and two long rows of seats facing each other on
