�t sure if it was because of the stove or because of him.
I knew that I would have to tell him that he could not stay here with me anymore, but I felt guilty about saying such a thing, so instead I simply asked him in my sweetest voice whether he had any plans for tomorrow night. He seemed surprised by my question, and he stared at me as though I was an alien from another planet, and then he shook his head slowly.
“I don ’ �t have anything planned,” he replied. “In fact, nothing but a whole day of uninterrupted sleep.” His eyes looked sad for a moment before they lit up once again, and he smiled.
He looked at me with a puzzled expression on his face, and then the corners of his mouth curved into a smile as he spoke. “But you ’ �re beautiful,” he said in his deep voice. He came over to my chair, knelt down by it, and wrapped both of his hands around one of mine.
He looked at me with an expression of tenderness I had never seen before, and he seemed almost afraid that he would wake up from the dream he was having right now. Then his face twitched into a smile. “I am,” he said softly as he leaned closer to me. He slowly moved forward so that our lips met gently, but he immediately stopped when I drew back and pushed him away.
“No,” I replied firmly with a stern look on my face. Then I rose from the chair, stood up straight, and walked over to the stove. I had cooked several pieces of roast chicken in a pan before, so now I knew what to do. I picked it up off the burner and set it down onto a large platter that sat on the table. Then I brought out a knife and fork from the silverware drawer underneath the sink.
“We can eat outside,” he replied with his arms wrapped around me, which made my heart beat faster than before as if I had just seen an angel in flight or heard music that made me want to dance. My stomach was filled with butterflies, and I felt a warm sensation spreading across my body like sunshine.
“I think we ’ �re going to have to find someplace else,” I said to him as we were walking together back inside the house after picking up our dishes from outside on the grass where we had been eating dinner last night before returning them into their proper place in one of my kitchen cabinets.
“I thought you might say that, so I have already made arrangements,” he replied. Then he smiled at me as if to reassure me that everything would be alright, and then he kissed me softly on the cheek before opening up the door into our bedroom with his arm stretching out behind him to guide us inside where we stood still for a moment and looked around us silently while listening to the sounds of people talking loudly just outside in front of our house.
“I thought it would be nice,” he said finally after standing there for several minutes without saying anything else, which was unlike him because usually when he spoke it was always something very serious or deep about some issue we were having at work together with other people who were also working hard just like us so that everything could go smoothly without any problems coming up along the way as long as everyone did what they were supposed to do according to their individual jobs responsibilities within a given period of time before another day began anew once again with another new set of tasks requiring completion by people who cared enough about themselves and others around them in order for things like this kind of thing would happen in the first place.
