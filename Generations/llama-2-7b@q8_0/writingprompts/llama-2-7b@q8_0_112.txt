 that 's what you do when the bus is late: take off your earphones and listen to a very old lady tell you she has a boyfriend who 's got no legs, only one arm and half an eye but he treats her well because he loves her. He gives her presents all the time because he 's so rich.
I sat there thinking, _This woman is mental_ , when suddenly I heard the bus rumbling to a stop.
So now she had my attention, right? She started telling me about this boyfriend of hers who was very rich, and she always went to his house on weekends. He even gave her presents sometimes because he loved her so much. And I 'm thinking, _She must be mental_.
I was just wondering what else she might say when the bus door opened and everybody got off. I looked at my watch, then at her. She had n't finished telling me about this boyfriend of hers yet.
So I pulled my headphones back on again to listen to music while I waited for the next bus – but of course she was still talking away!
I went out and got myself a coffee because it was cold. And then there was this woman standing by her bus shelter who looked just like the old lady from the bus, so that 's why I thought about telling her to take a look at herself in a mirror, you know? Because I had seen people dressed up as her before – they were the same age and everything. They had big bags under their eyes and long grey hair with lumps on top, and one of them had lost all her teeth and was smoking roll-ups like she was a tramp or something. She had a purple scarf wrapped around her head and wore this big coat that had all these buttons on it; it must have been about ten years old and the colour was so awful that everybody looked at her because it just screamed, _Look at me! I 'm mental!_ And then she started to speak to me like that woman who got off the bus –
She asked for a match.
I pulled my headphones out again because I had n't finished listening to the last song on my iPod yet. She was talking to another lady by her bus shelter about how rich they were going to be, and their boyfriends who were just like that old woman's: richer than you can imagine, with half an eye and one arm. I was thinking she must be mental when this other lady turned around and said, _Look at me!_
And it 's true – the first thing people notice about her is that she has a big lump on top of her head and no teeth; in fact, she looks like a tramp. But what people don't know about her is this: she just finished writing a book for kids called _The Truth About Me_.

My dad died today. I know that sounds crazy but it 's true.
It started out as usual, the day he got home from work and did n't eat anything or say hello to me – just went straight upstairs into his bedroom to sleep like a normal person. But then he woke up about eleven-thirty with this strange look in his eyes that made him look even worse than ever before, if you can imagine that! I was watching _Doctor Who_ downstairs on the sofa while Mum sat reading one of those magazines she buys every week because it has lots of pictures of celebrities. I had to wait until she got up and went into her bedroom; then I ran upstairs with my iPod, turned on his music and started listening to some songs from my favourite band _The Mighty Boosh_.
I heard him moaning in the bathroom: it sounded like he was sick. And that 's when I realized what had happened. It was just a matter of seconds until I knew, because right away his door opened and he fell backwards into my room! He looked really bad. I mean – _really_ bad; I have never seen him so bad before in my life!
I picked up the phone and called for an ambulance while Mum rushed into our room to see what was wrong with him. His face was all red and wet, and his hair was sticking out like he 'd been caught in a storm. Then I saw blood coming down from underneath one of his eyes. It looked so bad that I had to hold my dad's hand while we waited for the ambulance because I knew I couldn't do it on my own!
The next thing I remember was sitting at the hospital drinking a cup of tea with Mum in this place called _Intensive Care_ where they keep people who are really sick or dying. They had this old man lying there, dead and covered up like he 's asleep. He just looked like some kind of freak – all white except for his eyes which were black because nobody else had been born yet!
When my dad came back from the hospital that evening I knew something was wrong but I didn't know what it was until we got home and Mum went into her bedroom to lie down on top of our new double duvet cover. The way she was sitting up against the headboard, with only a thin sheet covering herself, made me realize something important: she had been sleeping in my dad's old room ever since he left!
That 's when I realized that _my_ room is not my room anymore – it belongs to _Mum_. And we have a new double duvet cover. It 's called the _Bird and the Bee_. It 's got flowers all over it, like something out of the film _Beauty & The Beast_ , which makes me think of Mum as this lady who lives with a beast – that 's what she is to me. And I wonder if he might not have been her dad after all because he had a strange look in his eyes, too!
I took my iPod and ran upstairs into my own room, where there are pictures of The Mighty Boosh everywhere because they are the best band ever made: _Naboo Naboo!_ It 's true. They are the only band I like any more – not that it makes me sad or anything like that – just different nowadays.
The next day we went to see my dad in hospital and he was still lying there with a tube sticking out of his mouth. That's when Mum asked him what had happened, because she didn't know herself! I mean: why would you say _hi_ or _bye_ if your name is _Mark_?
The doctor said that my dad 's heart had stopped but it started again on its own – so now they have to put a machine inside him and pump his blood for the rest of his life. That's why I call it a _machine_ , because I think that must be what he needs: some kind of pumping machine to keep his heart going! But if you ask me, his heart should just stop completely, like all the other hearts in this hospital – and then we would never have to see him again.
That 's why they are saying my dad might not make it for a long time yet, although I don't really know what that means. It sounds good: _a long time_. Like a year or two?
So now he is lying there in hospital with a tube stuck up his nose and his heart stopped – but they say he 's alive. He can hear everything around him like normal, though I have no idea how that could be possible! Then again, I have seen people die before so maybe it 's not such an impossible thing after all; there are plenty of people walking around with a tube up their nose, for example.
When we left the hospital I decided to go and buy some food for Mum because she had been in bed most of the day crying and couldn't get out of it! So I went downstairs into our kitchen and started opening cupboards trying to find something to eat – anything at all. There was nothing in any of them, though: they were completely empty!
I opened the fridge to see if there might be a sandwich or something in there but it too was completely empty. And then I noticed this strange sound coming from our living room – like somebody patting on the floor with their fingers!
So I ran into my dad's old bedroom and looked under his bed where we always keep food: an empty box of crisps, a couple of packets of chips, some rice crackers, some jam . . . it was all there. But as soon as I saw the boxes, I knew what had happened – or at least, I thought I did!
It turned out that Mum had been eating our food in his bedroom and hiding the empty boxes underneath my dad's bed! When I confronted her about it later on she just looked away; so then I asked if he was dead yet – but she said no, because they 're not sure.
After that I started looking at everything around me: our fridge and cupboards are full of food again; Mum's bedroom is the same as before with all her clothes and jewellery in it, just like a normal room for somebody who is alive! Even though he can hear everything, my dad is still dead – and I don 't know why.
