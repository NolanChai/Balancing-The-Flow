ers beating in his chest as he tried to understand what had happened in the last fifteen years since they'd been apart.
He remembered how she used to touch him, and he would shiver with excitement every time she did it. She would stroke his face or run her fingers through his hair when they were sitting next to each other watching a movie, and even though she didn't know it she was sending out signals that he could feel and understand.
He felt like he was being torn between two women at this moment in time. The one he had been married to for the past fifteen years, and the one he was seeing now. She had been nothing but an annoyance as a wife and someone who used him to get pregnant and then left him to raise their son alone.
He did everything for that boy, and he didn't know what he would have done if she hadn't wanted his son so badly. He had hoped that this day would never come where he was forced to sit across the table from her again. His wife. The woman who left him when he needed her most.
He sat down in a chair and then noticed that she was still standing there with that look of joy on her face. She didn't know what had happened, but he did, and it had been fifteen years since they had seen each other last.
