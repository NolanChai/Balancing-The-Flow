 ships and crew.
I couldn’t help but smile at the thought of meeting my father’s side for the first time in two years. It seemed like a lifetime. A lifetime of being told stories about his bravery, his honor, and his devotion. He was a hero on the battlefield, and it made me proud to be his son.
The ship appeared from out of the clouds, shining brightly beneath its canopy. The ship landed with a great thud. I looked at my father, and he nodded. “You ready?” He asked in a whisper as he took off his cap and placed it on the desk beside him.
I didn’t reply, but instead walked from the room, leaving my father to complete any last minute preparations. As I walked down the stairs, I felt that familiar feeling of pride and love for him. He was a brave soldier who fought against evil, he was honorable, and he never gave up. It made me proud to be his son.
The doors to the dining hall opened and I entered with my father and mother by my side. There were hundreds of soldiers sitting around us eating their lunches. They looked at me with curiosity as they finished their food or started conversations with others around them about what was happening that day on the battlefield or in town where they had been stationed over the past few days before returning to base camp for this last mission before going back home again soon afterward
I could feel my mother’s eyes upon me as she looked at every soldier who was looking at me with interest and excitement about what might happen next during this mission together!
