uded trees, while squirrels and chipmunks scurry through the underbrush. A fresh smell hangs in the air as if God had just created it with a whiff of his divine breath.
Wow! It is hard to believe that we are now into our second day of Advent. The calendar may say that it is only December 2nd, but for me and I am sure for many others who are preparing for the celebration of Jesus’ birth on Christmas Eve or Day, it seems like Christmas has been going on for a very long time already!
For those of you who have come into our church during the season of Advent this year, I want to personally welcome you. If you are new and do not yet feel comfortable attending worship services at our church or participating in any other way with us as a member of our family here on “Mount Hope”, we encourage you to take the time to introduce yourselves to one or more of us who can be found in our sanctuary this morning.
Our desire is that everyone who attends worship here will feel welcome and wanted as well as feel comfortable when they come, so please know that if you don’t yet “feel at home” with us, I want to assure you that it really is not about what we are doing or not doing in our sanctuary that makes you feel that way. It has far more to do with how each of us as individuals approach our time here and what expectations we have when we come through our doors.
If we enter the building expecting to worship God, sing hymns and listen to his Word, but come expecting to hear only a sermon, or if we attend expecting to receive some sort of spiritual enrichment from the choir’s anthem or organ prelude and are disappointed because there is none, then we have failed to understand what it means to worship.
Worship involves so much more than just singing hymns, listening to a sermon and passing the collection plate. To truly worship God is to give him the respect that he deserves as our creator, redeemer and sustainer. It is an action, not simply a feeling or experience, but it must start with the heart before it ever can be manifested through words and actions.
That said, let me explain what we mean when we use the term “worship” here in the sanctuary on Sundays, because our definition of worship may differ from that which you might expect to see or hear. For some this will be a very good thing while for others it may not.
When we gather together on Sunday morning, we are worshipping God through music. The songs and hymns we sing have been chosen by our choir director with the help of our music committee because they fit well into what we call “traditional worship”. These hymns are usually written from a time when there was no television to watch on Sunday morning, radio or iPods. They were simply people singing together about God and his love for them and all that he has done for them.
The music you hear will also be played by our organist who has been given the task of selecting pieces of music that will complement what we are singing as well as enhance it in a way that helps to create an environment wherein each one of us can better connect with God in our own individual way. In fact, we are not so much “singing” to God when we sing these hymns, but rather “worshiping him” through music and song.
Someone will come forward shortly to read a scripture passage from the Holy Bible that will also be read by the pastor during his sermon and both of us have chosen it because we believe it fits well with the theme for our worship this morning, which is “Welcome”.
The reason we choose those passages and topics in advance is so that our worship services will flow in a way that connects all of us together as one body. The music, scripture readings, prayers, sermon and offering are not intended to be a series of isolated events happening at different times during the course of our worship service, but rather they are meant to help form one cohesive whole.
When we sing these hymns together, we are “worshipping” God; when we hear someone read the scriptures that follow, we are being reminded about what he has done for us through Jesus Christ and how we should live our lives as a result of it all; when the pastor offers his prayer, we are uniting with him in lifting up our needs to God along with his; when he preaches, we are receiving instruction from the one who is the teacher sent by God himself and lastly when we offer what we have been able to give to God this morning through our tithes and offerings, it is as a way of saying “thank you” for all that God has given us and for his love which never ceases.
In other words, everything about what we do here on Sunday mornings has its place in our worship service because it all leads to the one thing that makes worship truly complete; fellowship with the members of his body who gather together to praise their Father through him and one another.
This is how I hope you will view your time when you come to worship here at Mount Hope. It should never be about what we do, or don’t do on Sunday mornings in our sanctuary, but rather it must always be seen as a way for us to give God the respect that he deserves by worshipping him through everything that happens during this time of fellowship and praise together.
I also want you to know that we have done all that we can do so that those of you who are unable to come to church on Sunday mornings will be able to follow along with what is happening here through our web site, Facebook page, or our worship service podcasts which you can listen to on your smart phone. We also offer a prayer line if you have something very urgent that needs praying about and I encourage you to make use of any of these resources so that you won’t miss out on what is happening at Mount Hope.
I am going to wrap things up now, but before I go, let me say this one more time. If you do not feel “at home” here with us yet as we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ during this Advent season, then I encourage you to come forward and introduce yourself to someone after worship. We are a warm family who loves each other deeply because God first loved us.
You will discover that at Mount Hope you don’t have to pretend; you can be just like you are with everyone else here, because we all share the same burdens, joys and sorrows. That is what makes this church family unique and one of a kind, so don’t hesitate to make yourself known to us today as we welcome each other into our home during Advent.
