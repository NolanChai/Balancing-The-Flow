ard old girl was raped by her father and her brothers. She suffered greatly. The young lady wanted to die but couldn't find the strength, she wasn't even able to take a knife to herself. 
 
 In the end she did what she knew would bring her peace, she took out her knives and cut her own throat and hung herself in a tree. 
 
 A few days after her death, I found myself standing at her funeral looking at the grave of one of my sisters. It was raining hard that day, it hadn't stopped pouring down for days, and you would think this girl deserved to be remembered, but no one showed up. No one had even heard about her death. 
 
 The whole town was silent except a few men talking in the background about what happened. She had been raped by both of them, her father and one of his friends. They were talking about how they'd kill me if I said anything. 
 
 This girl didn't deserve to be treated this way, but it was normal for my town. It wasn't even the first time a young girl had been raped by their fathers. No one cared enough about them to find out what happened before it was too late. 
 
 After that day I swore that if I could have saved her life, I would have. Even if just one more person showed up at the funeral she would still be remembered in some way. She had deserved that much for what she went through.
