umseh? ” I asked. 
 
 He was a young boy with shoulder-length blond hair, which he wore pulled back into a ponytail. He stared up at me, eyes wide with terror. His dark blue eyes were almost black. They looked as if they had been painted on to his face in thick oil paint. I knew him well enough to know that he was frightened of me. 
 
 “ What do you want? ” he asked. 
 
 “ What is your name, boy? ” I replied. 
 
 “ My friends call me Tecumseh. ” He said nothing else. His eyes shifted from my face to the controls, and back again. I couldn’t read any emotion on his face. Was he afraid of me or not? He had been frightened enough by the Dark Flag in its attack, but now that it was gone, he seemed to be struggling between fear and anger. 
 
 “ Tecumseh. ” I said again, ignoring the question. 
 
 “ What do you want? ” 
 
 “ I have a lot of questions for you, young man, but none of them begin with your name.” I began to walk around him and toward the console. He scrambled out from behind it and stood in front of me. I had to look up to meet his eyes, and even then he was taller than I by almost a foot. 
 
 “ Do not move, Tecumseh. ” I said calmly. His right arm snapped toward the console like a whip, knocking one of the keypads off its mount. The keys rattled together as they fell to the floor in front of me, but that was all it took. 
 
 “ Tecumseh! ” I shouted. He stopped his attack and backed away from me again. His eyes narrowed with a look of determination as he prepared for another assault. I stared at him for a moment before turning my attention to the console. 
 
 The control panel was a mess, keys were missing, wires had been ripped apart, and there was even a crack in one of the screens. It seemed that Tecumseh hadn ’ t been very gentle when he tried to steal this ship. I stood up and brushed some dust off my pants before starting to inspect the damage. I turned on a few of the panels until they glowed back to life, and then checked each screen for damage. Aside from a couple of cracked screens, everything appeared to be in working order. 
 
 Tecumseh stood there, watching me with his dark eyes. His arms were crossed over his chest, and he kept shifting from side to side. He obviously didn’t like the attention I was giving him. I turned around and looked at him for a moment before walking past him on my way to the doorway that led into the hall. 
 
 “ Tecumseh. ” I called out, trying again to get his attention. 
 
 He stepped forward and blocked my path, which forced me to stop in front of him. His face was pale, but he still had a hard look on it. There seemed to be two different personalities battling for control over him: the scared little boy and the angry young man. It was almost as if they were both trying to show me just how tough they really were. 
 
 “ You will not harm me, ” I said calmly. He stared at me without replying. There was something about his eyes that told me he wanted me to know what a fool I was for thinking this ship would ever work again. His arms had shifted slightly from the crossed position they were in when I approached him, but they remained tight against his sides as if he planned on taking whatever it took to get away. 
 
 “ Tecumseh. ” I said firmly, trying one more time to get through to him before giving up and walking away. He looked at me again with a smile that was anything but welcoming or friendly. His lips pulled back into an angry snarl as he began to shake. The next thing I knew, he had taken two quick steps forward and punched me in the face. 
 
 It hurt worse than I thought it would. My head was spinning and my vision started to blur at the edges as I tried to keep myself upright. Tecumseh stared down at me with a satisfied look on his face. 
 
 “ You ’ re not very smart, are you, ” he said. He sounded almost disappointed in himself for having made such an easy mistake. I knew then that the Dark Flag would never get away from this ship alive. 
 
 My vision began to clear and my head started to stop spinning as I looked up at him with a smile on my face. I stood slowly, looking around until I found myself facing him again. He had an unnatural grin on his lips and something about the way he looked made me want to laugh in his face. 
 
 “ Tecumseh, ” I said, taking another step toward him. 
 
 “ You ’ re not going anywhere, little man. ” He replied as calmly as if we were just standing there discussing our day over a cup of coffee. 
 
 I stepped forward again and took another blow to the face that sent me stumbling backward through the open doorway into the hallway. Tecumseh was quick to follow, but before he could get all the way inside, something hit him in the side of his head. He dropped instantly to the floor as the Dark Flag landed on top of him. 
 
 The black-clad woman looked up at me with a smile on her face and her arms wide open waiting for me to jump into them. I shook my head at her, but she didn ’ t seem to notice. She took another step toward me, then stopped suddenly when the doorway filled with more armed men in black uniforms. 
 
 “ Tecumseh! ” she shouted as she grabbed a fistful of his hair and pulled him back up to his feet. I quickly got out of her way before another blow could connect with my head. The Dark Flag pushed me aside, sending me sprawling into the hallway. She then stepped forward, kicking Tecumseh in the side with her boot as he tried to regain his balance on the ground. 
 
 “ Do not touch him again! ” I shouted, trying once more to get through to her before she could do anything else to Tecumseh. Her eyes narrowed slightly and then turned away from me. She kicked Tecumseh one last time in the leg before turning around to walk back down the hallway toward the bridge. 
 
 I pulled myself up off of the floor, took another look at Tecumseh ’ s unconscious body, and followed after her. There was no way she could get away from me this time. She had to listen to what I had to say.
