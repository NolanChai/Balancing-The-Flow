Comment: Thanks! I found another similar one on [here](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-5435081/is-this-an-idea-for-a-starter) but wasn't sure whether this was a new entry or the same as an existing one.

Comment: I have found another one with a similar theme here: [Bio-Luminescent Organism](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bio-luminescent) (although the idea is very different).

Answer: This sounds like SCP 877, or at least, it's a similar concept.
