ing to lose a family member to these beasts, as long as we stuck together in groups there wasn't too much danger from them. We learned how to hunt our food as well, so that didn't stop us either. In fact many of us loved the sport and became great hunters. We could have gone on like this forever; evolving, spreading out across all the land.
We were a race unlike any other before or since, with no true leader to control our destiny we made up for it by being self sufficient in everything from farming and building homes to making weapons of war. But one day we had a meeting that would change everything. We learned that a giant predator was coming at us from the South West. This beast was unlike any other before or since, and it was coming to eat us all.
With only days left to prepare for what was soon to come our people were scared; most of them had never seen such an animal. Although they had heard stories about the monstrous creatures that roamed these lands in ancient times. They spoke of giants that stood nearly twice as tall as us, with four limbs and a hide so tough it was nearly impossible to cut through.
Many tried to calm our people; saying that the beasts we feared were nothing more than an old myth passed down from generation to generation. But it didn't work, we all knew what we had to do; fight or flee! In the end most of us did one or the other; we either left for the North East and started our lives over again, or stayed behind and tried to save as many people as possible with what little weapons we had.
There are still stories in the South West today about a great war that took place between man and giant beast. Some say it was more like an epic battle between gods than mere animals; this is why there are so few giants left in North America today. Many of those who witnessed these battles first hand would tell you how many giants died at the hands of our people, but I doubt any were able to count them all.
One thing's for sure though; if we hadn't been such a peaceful race then maybe some of us might have stood a chance against what was coming. Unfortunately we had no way to prepare ourselves; and as far back as we could remember there had never been an enemy that we couldn't deal with.
But we were not prepared for this giant beast, and soon it would begin its invasion of our homeland!
The people living in the Northern parts of North America did nothing but wait as news spread through their lands about the impeding war; many of them simply went into hiding while others tried to find a way out. The South West was already under attack at this time and soon it would be their turn for war too, but most of us were completely unaware that this battle had even started until much later.
The story we've been told says that these giants came from far away lands, possibly across the ocean somewhere because no one knew them before then either; however I don't believe anything so simple as "giant invaders" would cause such destruction on our people. If they were truly an enemy to us then why didn't we fight back? What stopped us from defeating these beasts once and for all?
Well it was probably the fact that there weren't enough of them to kill off every single person on Earth; no matter how much power a single man has, he cannot take down an entire race if his enemies outnumber him. This is why so few people are left alive today after the war we call "The Battle".
It started with two young boys who were playing in their village one day when suddenly they heard something strange coming from across the river. They ran home to tell everyone about it, but no one believed them until much later when more and more children began talking about hearing something similar as well; at first people thought that there might be another group of kids out playing too far away for anyone else to notice them though.
As time went on however things got worse instead of better; soon adults were saying they could hear it too! And then one day we woke up and found that half our village was gone...
We weren't sure if the sound had anything at all to do with what happened, but many people believed that somehow someway someone had been able to make the giant creature come out of hiding so they could get rid of us once and for all. If this was true then why did no one see it? And how did it know where we lived?
There were many questions left unanswered by those who survived, but what's done is done... now all that matters is finding a way out before our enemies come back for another round!
As I said earlier, there was nothing simple about "The Battle". It wasn't just an invasion by giant monsters; it was also the first time in history when people had to face their own mortality. Not only did we lose most of our population at this point but many others were left behind as well because they refused to flee with everyone else or didn't know what else to do. Some even chose death over living without family members, friends, or anything familiar at all; it was a truly heartbreaking time for us all!
If you've read this far then maybe I've managed to get through enough information about our people before the Battle that now makes more sense than ever before? If not please let me know where my story needs improvement so we can fix everything together. After all, history is something we should always strive for perfection on every front; it just takes time and effort!
