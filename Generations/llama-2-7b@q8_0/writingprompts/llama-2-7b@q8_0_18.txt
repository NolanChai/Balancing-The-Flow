ered on their table.
She looked at her watch, 10:39pm. She'd been waiting for 8 minutes since she had ordered herself a large glass of white wine. She took a sip of it and looked back to her watch again. She had decided that if the waiter didn't come before then, she would go out there and order her own drink and just get on with it herself, even though they may not be happy about it.
She watched as one guy who was leaving got in a scuffle with someone outside of the pub (it seemed to be between him and some guys from the plasterers table). She then took another sip of her wine. It was 10:52, she looked at the watch again, there was no waiter.
She pushed back her stool and walked towards the bar. There were about four staff members behind the counter. "Hey" she said, as if she knew them all personally. The one who had been serving to the guys in front of her just shrugged at her, looked bored and carried on talking with his colleague. She then pointed towards the middle of the room. He still didn't understand what was wrong, so she shouted over him "A large white wine!"
He just nodded and walked away to fetch it for her. 3 minutes later he came back with a glass full of wine. "Here you are", he said. She took the glass from his hand, thanked him, and paid him. As she was walking back towards her seat, she looked over at one guy who had been sat there when she first arrived. He was now getting up to leave as well.
"I'd like to join you for a drink", he said. She smiled slightly and asked "You don't mind if I have just one?"
He shook his head "No problem". He ordered himself another large white wine, and sat down next to her at the table that was now occupied by 4 guys from the plasterers table. They all looked over at them, and then started laughing as they left.
The other guy took a sip of his drink and said "So what's your name? I don't think we've properly introduced ourselves". She replied "I'm Liz." He smiled back "Hi", he said. It was the first time that she had ever heard him speak, it wasn't a particularly nice voice in her opinion.
"What about you?" she asked. The guy took another sip of his wine and then thought for a moment before answering. "My name is Andy". They both laughed at how he'd said his name so awkwardly.
Liz looked around the pub again. It was just past 11pm, and there were about 6 or 7 people left now. She decided that she had spent enough time in this place already, it wasn't particularly pleasant to be sat at a bar with guys you don't know from Adam, and one of them is so drunk he can barely stand up.
She got her handbag out, and then asked him "Do you mind if I have another drink?"
"No", he said without much enthusiasm. She paid for the round that she had just bought at the bar and then walked away from the table. He looked after her as she went.
She sat on a stool in the corner of the bar, and ordered herself a large white wine again. When she came back to sit down next to him, he was already starting another glass of white wine. He took it from her hands and said "Here you go" and then drank half the glass. She decided that this guy is probably just as drunk as that other guy who left.
She had to take a sip of her wine before she could say anything, she didn't want to sound too drunk in front of him. He was now sitting with his back against the wall, and had one leg stretched out across the floor. She said "So, why did you decide to join me for another drink?"
He put the empty wine glass down on a small side table next to his feet and replied "Well, I didn't like that guy from the plasterers table when he came over to sit at your table". He was now sitting up straight and looking her in the eye. She took another sip of her drink before answering him.
"I don't blame you", she said. "He's a right weirdo." Her mind started racing again, this guy is really quite good-looking, she thought to herself, I wonder what he does for a living? Maybe he's an accountant or something like that. She took another sip of her drink and then asked him the same question back "So, why did you decide to come over here?"
He replied "I didn't know anybody else in the pub tonight." They both looked around the room again for a moment, and she noticed that there was only one other person left now, an old man sitting at a corner table with his dog. She pointed him out and said "Do you have any idea who he is?"
Andy replied "Nope", while he took another sip of wine. She decided that if this guy thinks she's weird then maybe it would be better not to speak anymore about what they were actually doing there, so she just nodded at him and continued looking around the room again.
She noticed a couple of guys standing near the bar. There was an older guy with dark hair, he looked a bit like Elvis Presley if you asked her. He had his arm around this young man who must have been in his late teens or early twenties.
"So what do you think about the way that guy is dressed?" she said to Andy as she pointed towards them. "I don't know", he replied. She took another sip of her wine and then added "Well, I mean look at him - He's got on these skinny jeans that are just a bit too long for him, so they kind of drag across the floor when he walks."
"Oh yeah? Well he's got some nice legs", said Andy. They both laughed again and then fell silent as she looked back at them. The younger guy had his arm around the older man and they were having a conversation with each other, it was clear that the younger one didn't want to be there but wanted to do everything he could just so that he wouldn't upset Elvis Presley over here who seemed more than happy enough for him to stay.
"I think I like this place", she said, still looking back at them and then took another sip of her wine. She thought about how long it had been since she last went out and spoke to someone that she didn't know. It had probably been a good few years now actually...
She looked up again as they walked towards the bar area. "I don't think I should really leave you alone here", said Andy, "it doesn't look like anyone else is going anywhere." She shook her head and smiled at him "Don't worry about it mate, I promise to be careful."
"You know what?", he replied as he took his jacket off the back of his seat, "I might stay here too". She smiled again and then asked "What are you going to do?" He pulled on his shirt collar for a moment before answering her question.
"Well I've just got to get a couple more drinks in me first", he said while winking at her and walking towards the bar area with his empty wine glass in hand...
