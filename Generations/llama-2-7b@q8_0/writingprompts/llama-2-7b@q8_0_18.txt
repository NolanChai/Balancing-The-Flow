 `You know the tree house we had when we were younger? 
 `Yeah that one over there. 
 `Yeah thats right! 
 `Well I've been digging around and I found this old box of memories.' 
 
 'I can't believe it!'
 `` It was under the old oak tree. 
 'It wasn't a great tree house, but we had some fun there!' 
 ''This is so cool, you know those days were special. 
 `I remember my mum telling me I should have been more careful about leaving the window open.'
 
``What was in this box? 
 `A photo album, a few old toys and that tree house map!'
 ``You're so lucky we didn't get robbed when we left it there.
 'It was a small burglary at worst, they didnt take the toy car or my action figure.'
 
``Let's go inside, you can show me where it all is now. 
 `Yeah! I've got some things from back then that I still have.'. 
 
 'We are going to go on a walk down memory lane and visit the old stomping ground of yesteryear.' 
 ``I can't wait, it feels like we're kids again! 
 `What do you think about them days?'
 'I remember back then I was more into video games and comics'. 
 
 ''You've got to show me what you still have of the old stuff. 
 'I used to collect baseball cards, you never gave me a penny for my collection'. 
 ``You know I don't care about money now but when I was younger it really mattered to me.'
 
``Let's go downstairs and take a look at everything we still have.''
 'I remember we both had a few things that meant alot, did you ever lose any?'
 ``I never lost anything!'. 
 ''You were the only one who was good with that stuff, I always got it wrong!' 
 `Let's go get your old video games and see if they work.'
 'We should check out my old bedroom first!'
