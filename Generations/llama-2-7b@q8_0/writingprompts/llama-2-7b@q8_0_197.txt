ant and rave at me for all the things that goes wrong in this world; but what are you doing to change them?
 
I have heard your prayers, seen the tears you cry on my shoulder (sorry, I don't have one). The gods and angels will help you if you believe hard enough. But even then, I won't come in rescue, for that is not what I am here to do.
 
I am Death. I take all the people when their time comes. And it doesn't matter who they are, no matter how rich or powerful they might be, there will always be a day when I will have them. 
 
They may die in my hands or from other means, but when I take them you know that the end is near. For those of you with less than 10 years to go, your time will come soon enough and don't worry about it for you are not on my list just yet.
 
The only one who can stop me from taking away people is you. If you don't want them dead then take care of them for the rest of their life. That way I won't have to come near them and they will live long enough for you to see the day when your loved ones die. And if that isn't good enough, just give in to it. 
 
You can try to fight me but you know that you are going to fail at one point or another. So accept what comes and learn to move on.
