 and walked out of the building.
 
As I strolled on I began to feel a little more alive. There was nothing quite like fresh air in my lungs after being confined inside an office all day, so I decided it would be nice to take a walk around town. The sun had begun to set and people were heading home.

 ``Hey,'' a girl's voice said behind me as she caught up with me. 

``Oh hey,'' I replied while looking over my shoulder. She was standing there wearing a light grey shirt that matched her eyes perfectly and black jeans that had been rolled down to her knees. Her long dark hair cascaded across the top of her shoulders and a pair of round sunglasses completed her look. 
``How do you like my outfit?'' she asked with a wide smile. 
 ``It's nice,'' I answered, as I tried to think of something more complimentary to say but nothing seemed to come to me. She glanced at me curiously before breaking into a radiant smile and continued walking.
