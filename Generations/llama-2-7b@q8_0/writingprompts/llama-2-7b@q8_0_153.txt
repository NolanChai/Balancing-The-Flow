 from the one we know now; one that never had such things as money or disease or war.
And yet all things must end: the sun died, and then it rose again, but this time it brought fire with it. The skies changed to blackness, and when Gejjet ’ s minions tried to soar through their former home they were engulfed in flame. Their beautiful carapaces crackled and smoked under the onslaught of fire; some few escaped into the ocean or underground caves but most perished.
Now, as the sun rises once more, Gejjet has called her minions back to their ancient homeland—the new world they left so long ago. They have found a small land filled with people who still worship the sun god and know nothing of war or money. With the help of his loyal followers, Gejjet plans to restore the power that was once his in an effort to reclaim what has been lost since the fall of his kingdom.
Gejjet is a God, as are his minions. He was the ruler of the ancient world and lord over all life on earth. But when he fell into despair after being betrayed by one of his closest friends, Gejjet decided to retreat into exile so that he could regain himself before returning again to reclaim what had once been his.
Gejjet has returned to a world filled with strife and warfare; people are killing each other over land and resources while the sun god is nowhere to be found. With Gejjet ’ s minions by his side, he sets out on a quest for vengeance against those who have wronged him—but can even they hope to stop an army of evil?
Gejjet’s return means that he will once again become a God and rule over all life on earth. This time around however, things are going to be different…
