 The man and the woman had been found guilty of adultery and were brought before him as he stared into their eyes. He was wearing nothing but a loincloth. His beard hung over his chest in curly blonde hairs; a thick ring of golden hair surrounded his head, cascading down to the floor like an ornate crown.
 God's first words came from above as he gazed at them. `` Why are you naked?'' The man and woman were shocked by their sudden appearance before God. 
 God had told Noah that he would destroy everything because of what they did, but then he had changed his mind. 
 God shook his head as the two people stared in surprise. He spoke to them again: `` Go from your home and be fruitful and multiply!'' Then he turned away. 
 The man and woman ran down a dusty road toward their home. 
 God sighed.
