â€‹a dream for me and one that would never come true because my mother was always telling me to study hard and become something in life, instead of just being an artist.
I grew up and got into art school where I started learning to draw more realistically and be precise with my lines. I learned how to mix colors and create textures on paper. I learned how to add a variety of lighting effects and shadows to give my works depth, but I never lost the passion for comics that I had as a kid.
After art school, I got into working in the comic industry for various publishers such as Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Dynamite Entertainment, Valiant, Boom! Studios, Archaia and IDW Publishing, to name a few, where my style and techniques were tested.
I am now focusing on illustrating children's books, fantasy novels, creating digital comics for young adult readers as well as teaching art.
