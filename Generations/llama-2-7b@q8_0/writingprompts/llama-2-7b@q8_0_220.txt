avantage of by future generations. But since then, humans have become much more dependent on time and its manipulation. This has created many problems: for example, companies spend huge amounts of money trying to attract more customers with a better service; this in turn puts stress onto workers because they are not allowed to take breaks or go home early.
As well as this, there is the problem that if someone does have spare time on their hands, then it has no monetary value and can therefore be wasted away on activities such as watching TV or playing video games; these things can lead to boredom which in turn causes mental problems in people who are used to living fast-paced lives.
All of this means that even though we live in a world where time is money, it does not always seem like it when you look at the amount of stress some workers feel and how many hours they spend at work every day.
In conclusion, although there have been many benefits from turning time into a commodity such as increased productivity, there are also downsides to this system including high levels of stress in employees and a lack of spare time for leisure activities which leads to boredom among some people who live fast-paced lives.
