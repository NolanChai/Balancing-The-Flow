Ania Nieto is an astronaut, but she hasn’t been to space yet — because NASA doesn’t send people there very often these days.

It’ll take a couple of months before Nieto goes up into orbit. But she has already spent plenty of time at her desk, writing emails like this one: “Are you sure?”

On Monday morning, the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket will take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster and a mannequin dressed like an astronaut.

There are a few women who have been to space. But most of them did it years ago, and they’re no longer at NASA or SpaceX.

Astronauts are supposed to be trained doctors who go up into space for a couple of weeks once every six months. But the last time this happened was almost 10 years ago.

In the meantime, NASA and SpaceX have been busy sending robots instead of people into space for science experiments or commercial cargo missions.

It’s not that there aren’t women who want to be astronauts. But it’s been harder to get selected and become an astronaut than it used to be, according to NASA officials.

NASA wants astronauts with more varied backgrounds and different skill sets, including computer scientists, engineers and medical researchers who don’t need to be physicians.

But NASA still has a long way to go before it can send anyone up to space without some experience or training, said former astronaut Nicole Mann, who is now a lieutenant colonel with the Air National Guard and was the first female pilot chosen for SpaceX’s crew.

``I can’t imagine that NASA will be ready to launch people without any training into space — or even untrained medical personnel, for that matter,” Mann said by phone from Houston on Friday evening. “They have been working towards a more diverse population, but they still need trained people.”

The space agency hasn’t been sending people into orbit for a while now. But NASA astronaut Anne McClain is working hard to change that.

McClain, who was selected as an astronaut in 2013, had been planning a space launch with fellow NASA astronaut Christina Koch for later this month. But her trip has now been delayed until March because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to McClain’s Facebook page.

McClain and Koch had planned to spend eight months aboard the International Space Station. The mission was part of an effort by NASA to bring astronauts back into space for more frequent flights, according to NASA officials.

``The space station is not a destination,” McClain told the Houston Chronicle last month. “It’s really an incubator to learn how we go back.”

McClain and Koch are scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 17th, according to NASA’s website.

If all goes well, McClain will become the first mother in space. Her daughter is now nine years old and was born three months after McClain was selected for astronaut training in 2013.

McClain, who became the first female Navy combat pilot in 2014, says her daughter is also an astronaut fan.

“She was pretty excited that I’m going to go and live in space for a little bit,” McClain said in an interview last week. “I hope she’s proud of me, because it’s been hard work.”

The daughter is also happy that her mom will be leaving Earth for a while, according to McClain.

“She was really excited I’m going to get away from the baby,” she said, laughing. “I’m looking forward to having a little bit of space and time alone.”

NASA has been working for decades to increase its pool of astronaut candidates — including women.

In 2013, NASA launched a recruitment drive in which it received more than 8,000 applications from people who wanted to be astronauts — the most ever for the agency’s program.

That was the first time NASA had allowed anyone outside of its own ranks to apply, and it’s unclear if there were more women applicants than men. But NASA said that “overall, women represented nearly 25 per cent” of applicants who applied by mail or online during the period in which the applications could be submitted.

“There were quite a few people who applied and didn’t make it,” said Linda Ham, NASA’s deputy chief astronaut. “It was not that women weren’t applying or making the cut.”

She added that she thought about this topic often when her own daughter wanted to apply for astronaut training, but wasn’t old enough yet to do so because the minimum age is 18.

``I’m glad that there are young people who want to become astronauts now and can see themselves going into space,” Ham said by phone from Houston on Friday evening. “It makes me happy.”
