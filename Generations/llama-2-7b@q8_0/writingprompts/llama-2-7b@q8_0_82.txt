 aching, stiffening up; I wanted to wake up. I wanted to run away and never come back.
My first thought when I awoke was, "I have to find out who's responsible for this." My second thought was, "Why did I ever go back?" I couldn't get over the fact that my life had been stolen from me by someone who didn't even know how long I could endure. And now they were trying to kill me...
"Well, aren't you looking lovely this morning." The voice was familiar and yet unfamiliar at the same time. "I hope you're enjoying yourself..." The man standing next to my bed seemed almost amused by my discomfort. "Because you are going to enjoy it for a long... long... LONG time!"
My mouth fell open when I heard the sound of something heavy hitting the floor near where the voice had been. I could hear him walking around behind me, but all I could see were shadows on the wall in front of my bed.
"What's going on?" I said, my eyes wide with terror and confusion. "What have you done to me? What did I do? Who are you people?!"
I could hear him moving around behind me. When he spoke again, his voice was much closer now. He had moved over to the other side of the bed and was leaning down in front of my face, his breath fogging up the air between us. "You did nothing... I did everything," he said, his voice growing louder as he neared me. "Now let's talk about your future..."
"Talk?" I screamed at him. I tried to struggle against the restraints that held me down on my back, but they didn't move even a millimeter; in fact, they seemed to get tighter. "Who are you? What do you want from me?!"
"Why," he said, his breath heavy on my face, "would I need anything from YOU? After all, you are the one who wanted this..." His voice trailed off for a moment as he reached down and grabbed something behind him. He pulled it out, and suddenly I could see where his voice had been coming from; he was holding a flashlight!
"What is that?" I said as he held it in front of my face. "That's not mine..." It wasn't until then that I realized what the man in front of me must be--the one who had abducted me and brought me to this place; but more than that, the one who had taken away everything from me.
"It is now," he said as he turned off the flashlight with a flick of his wrist. He then reached down into his pocket and took out another object... It was my cell phone! "I'm afraid you won't be needing this anymore, my dear..." I could tell from the way he held it that he didn't intend for me to have it again anytime soon.
"What are you doing with my stuff?" I said, struggling against my bonds once more. "Where is my clothes?! You can't just take them away without my permission!"
I could feel a chill run down my spine as the man in front of me smiled at me again and replied: "Oh, but you see..." He paused for a moment to look around the room before continuing: "...you won't need anything else." Then he turned back to face me once more. "You've already been given your new life here with us..."
"What are you talking about?" I said, struggling against my bonds again even though they were still tightly locked onto me. "I don't understand! What do mean by 'new life?'"
He reached down and picked up the flashlight that was lying on the floor next to him before turning it back on again so he could see me better in its beam of light: "It means exactly what it sounds like," he said, his voice calm now as if he were talking about something completely ordinary. "You're going to have a whole new life here with us."
I could feel my heart racing as I tried to think about how this could possibly be true... Could the man in front of me really be telling me that I was going to spend the rest of my days being forced into some kind of sexual slavery? If so, what would happen if someone found out about it--and worse yet, how could he even know what kind of person I was before all this started?!
"But why would you do such a thing?" I asked him as he stood there looking at me with the flashlight in his hand. "What makes you think that people like us deserve any special treatment from others?"
He reached down again and picked up my phone once more, holding it between both hands so he could see it better: "Because," he said firmly before turning back around to face me, "we are the ones who deserve it... Not you."
"No..." I said as my eyes widened in horror. "That's not true at all! It's always been about love for you--not power or domination like this!"
He smiled again before turning back around to face me once more: "But who can say what will happen when we finally get together?" he asked me with a sly grin on his face. "I mean, there are so many possibilities..." Then he reached down and picked up my phone one last time before turning off the flashlight again: "We'll just have to wait and see..."
As I looked at him in shock as he walked away from me back towards where I had been tied up earlier, a wave of nausea overcame me--I could feel myself starting to lose control again. This couldn't be happening... He couldn't be serious! But even worse than that, how could someone like this man possibly believe in something as absurd and ridiculous as love?!
"It doesn't matter anymore," I said finally as I felt my body beginning to shake uncontrollably. "You can take away everything else from me... But you will never be able to take away my freedom!" Then I struggled against the restraints that held me down on my back until they suddenly snapped off at their connection points--freeing me once more!
I immediately jumped up onto my feet and ran towards where he had left the door open earlier; but just as I was about to go through it, I felt someone grab hold of me from behind. "Please... don't..." I begged them before turning around to face whoever it was: It wasn't until then that I realized how badly my body still hurt all over--and not only physically either! The shock of what had happened just moments ago had left me feeling completely empty inside; but even worse than that, there was no way out now... And no matter where you go or what you do in this life... There are always going to be people who want something from YOU!
I woke up with a start. The first thing I noticed was that it was dark outside and that my body felt heavy, like someone had put weights on me while I slept. Next came the stench of sweat and urine--and then there were two men standing over me. One of them was holding a gun to my head; the other one was wearing a ski mask so that only his eyes showed through the holes for his eyeholes.
"This is how it's gonna go down," said the man with the gun as he pointed it at me again and pulled back on its trigger: "You are going to get out of this car right now!" His voice was calm but stern--the kind that made you feel like something bad was about to happen if you didn't do exactly what they told you.
I sat up quickly and pushed against my seatbelt so I could stand up straight; then I started trying to figure out which way was the door so I could get it open before these guys did anything else crazy! But as soon as I got out of my seat, both men rushed over towards me--one holding a knife while another one held onto my arm tight enough that I knew if he didn't let go soon I would pass out from lack of blood flow!
"All right," said the man with the gun again, "get in there and shut up!" He pointed toward an old trailer across from us--the same one we had driven past earlier when we first saw him pull out onto Highway 33. The other guy who's gripping onto my arm let go of it just enough so that I could turn around and see inside the trailer; but even before I got all the way there, I knew what was waiting for me: It was a room full of people--all of them strapped down onto metal chairs with their heads covered by hoods!
"What is this place?" I asked as soon as we got into sight of each other; but even though it had been quiet up until then, there were suddenly three or four different voices shouting out at once: "Who the fuck are you?" "Get away from us!" And worst of all--"Hurry up and get over here so we can beat your ass before they find out what's going on here!"
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them--it was like something straight out of a horror movie! These people looked terrified, but at least
