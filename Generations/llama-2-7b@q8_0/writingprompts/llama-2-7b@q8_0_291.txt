 skill of his.
“What is this?” He asked himself, picking up an envelope and reading the name on it, “Samantha Foster”. Bob didn’t remember sending an invitation to her for breakfast as they had been meeting at the office every day this week for work related projects. But then again, she hadn’t come by yet today either.
He decided he would just sit back and wait in his office until she showed up. He opened the door to a knock at 9:05 AM. “Sorry I’m late.” Bob heard Sam say from behind the door. She was out of breath as if she had been running. “I didn’t hear you come by,” he said, leading her into his office.
“This is nice,” Sam said looking around at the pictures and personal items on the walls, “You really like horses?” She asked, pointing to a picture on Bob’s desk of him and his horse riding in a field. He nodded his head yes. “Me too.” The two sat down in their chairs as if they were in an old movie scene from the 1950’s.
“What did you think?” Sam asked, looking at Bob.
Sam was quiet for a moment, thinking about her response to Bob’s question. He hadn’t been expecting that answer and he didn’t know what to say either. “Thank you,” he said awkwardly, looking down at his hands on the table in front of him.
He noticed Sam had become very flustered and red in the face. She was sitting a little closer to him than normal and she had her head down and hair covering most of her face. Bob thought maybe she was blushing. He smiled and continued looking at his hands, he wanted to say something but nothing seemed fitting enough for what she had just said.
Bob reached across the table and placed his hand on top of Sam’s which rested in front of them. They remained there with no movement until Bob looked up again into her eyes and asked, “What did you want to tell me?” She blushed even more at this question and lowered her head a little more.
“It was my idea,” she said quietly and paused for a moment.
She stared back at him with a puzzled look on her face. “I don’t know what that means but it sounds very strange.” He replied to Samantha. She put her hand over his, which was still holding hers, and gripped it tightly.
“Tell me more,” Bob said, leaning in closer towards Sam and lowered his voice to a whisper. “It’s about my family, I want you to meet them.” He looked into her eyes and she nodded her head in approval. They continued this for the next few minutes as they shared with each other some details of their respective families.
Bob noticed that Sam was starting to get even more flustered and a bit shy around him. She was noticing every little movement he made and was reacting accordingly, sometimes blushing and giggling at his smallest gestures or innuendos. They were both becoming so nervous that they had stopped talking for a while, just looking into each other’s eyes without speaking.
“You know,” she started as if breaking the silence between them. “I have never liked kissing before.” She blushed again and Bob found himself smiling even more at this admission from her. He took his hand away from hers for a moment to get up out of his seat. As he stood in front of Sam, he reached into his pocket to get what he was looking for when she spoke again.
“I don’t know if I can do it now.” She said with the same shyness as before and her head down again, but this time to look at the floor under their chairs instead of up at him. “I want to try though,” Sam added in a much quieter voice. Bob put his hand back on top of hers again which she immediately grabbed onto with both hands, as if he was holding her up from falling down or something. He then returned to his seat and placed her palms on his cheeks. They remained there for what felt like hours but was actually only a few minutes before either one of them moved away.
They looked at each other, smiled, then leaned in together and kissed for the first time. It lasted just long enough for Bob to realize that he had no idea what they were doing with their lips or how to make it stop. So they pulled apart again, still smiling and holding hands, as if nothing ever happened between them.
“I guess this was a very weird way to meet someone.” Samantha said, looking at him with an amused grin on her face. Bob shook his head no and smiled back. “This is how I want to get to know you,” she told him before turning away from the desk to look out of the window behind them, where she was staring into space.
“I love this view,” Bob said with a smile as he looked at her profile in the window. She turned around slowly and smiled back at him.
