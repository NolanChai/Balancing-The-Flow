29 and had been working there for three years. I knew the company's top brass, including its founder, Jack Boyle, who had built a formidable reputation over the past thirty years. But this event had nothing to do with my personal or professional life, or so I thought.
At that time, in early March 2013, I was sitting at my desk, trying to catch up on some work and get ready for the weekend, when our office manager buzzed me through the intercom.
"Maria? It's Jack Boyle."
I hesitated before answering. He could have called in sick or he might even be out of town—we had several offices around the country.
"It's okay," he said, "come to my office now."
I stood up and walked slowly toward his door, knowing I was about to walk into a scene from a nightmare. Whenever we worked late at Boyle & Virgilio, Jack would let us know by shutting the blinds on both sides of the large conference room in which he held meetings with clients. He'd usually leave some kind of note on his door that read: _"No admittance."_ I wondered what could be so important at 10 p.m. that my boss would send me to see him on a Friday night, but before I could enter the room, Jack opened the door and held up his hand.
"You can come in," he said, "but it might not be for long."
I walked toward his desk, wondering what could possibly go wrong at this point. Then I saw it: a large silver-plated revolver. It was on the desktop, pointed away from him, and there was a red bandolier wrapped around its grip.
"What is that?" I asked him. "Is it real? Are you kidding me?"
"Yes," he said. "It's real."
I felt my heart racing as I tried to figure out what I should say or do next, when Jack began speaking again: "Do you know why I have a gun in my office? It's because of you."
My eyes darted around the room. There was nothing I could use against him—no weapon, no tools, not even my cell phone. I knew there would be a confrontation here, but I had no idea how it would play out or how much time we'd have together before things went to hell.
"I know you were behind this," Jack said. "That girl you've been dating—"
"I don't even date her," I snapped back at him. "I just took her to lunch."
Jack looked at me for a few seconds, as though trying to decide whether or not to believe me. Then he smiled. "You know what? It doesn't matter if you do or not, because this is all your fault," he said, motioning toward the gun on his desk. "This was meant for someone else."
"Who?" I asked him.
"Someone who tried to blackmail me. And now they won't be coming back."
Jack leaned forward and pulled out a picture from a drawer beneath his desk, which he handed to me. It showed an attractive young woman with long blond hair in a cocktail dress. Her arms were crossed, and she was smiling at the camera as if wearing some kind of secret smile.
"What's her name?" I asked him.
Jack shook his head. "I don't know."
I looked down again and noticed the revolver was now pointing directly at my chest—it was closer to me than it had been a moment ago.
"Who is she?" I asked him.
He seemed irritated that I wanted to know her name, as if he found this whole thing inconvenient rather than frightening. "I don't want you involved in anything," Jack said. "You should just go home and stay there until we're finished."
"Finished?" I asked him.
Jack nodded toward the gun again and smiled. "That's right," he said. "We have to finish it."
I knew that was a reference to what would happen next. Whenever someone had something they needed to get off their chest, Jack would often say: _"Let's finish it."_ He wasn't saying goodbye—he was saying let's do this once and for all.
At first I thought there must be a mistake; maybe he had the wrong person. Then I remembered that he had said something about an office romance.
"So you have a girlfriend?" Jack asked me again, as if confirming my suspicion that I was about to die. "Is she at home? I'd like to meet her."
I felt sweat breaking out on my forehead and under my arms. It wasn't the first time I had been scared in this office, but it certainly didn't get any easier as we got older. As a teenager, I used to think that the worst thing possible would be for someone to kill me—but I'd never even considered dying by my own hand until now.
"So who is she?" Jack asked again.
I could barely breathe anymore as I thought about what would happen if I told him the truth: _a beautiful blond girl from my office_. But I knew that was a lie, and I didn't want to tell him any more than that—because even though he had never met me before, there was something in his eyes telling me this wasn't going to end well.
"I don't know," I said finally, hoping he might get the idea on his own: _Let it go, Jack._ "She just came into work one day—"
That's when things began happening more quickly than expected. First there was a loud bang as if someone had fired a shot through my chest; then the smell of sulfur and gunpowder filled up the room with its rotten stench—it made me want to throw up right away, but I knew I couldn't do that here or anywhere else in this office.
"So you have no idea who she is?" Jack asked me again. "You just met her a few days ago."
He was looking at my hands now and then pulling out the revolver from its holster on his belt: _"And this is what I'm supposed to believe, Maria? That there's nothing between us?"_ It felt like he had been staring at me for hours as he took out a knife from another drawer beneath his desk—a small silver blade with an ivory handle and red plastic tip.
I watched him carefully cut open the bandolier, which was made of thick leather wrapped around several layers of cloth. Inside, I could see what looked like two hand grenades filled with gray smoke—one had been placed over each wrist strap on his holster so that he could pull them out whenever necessary without taking it off first.
"I guess you didn't believe me when I said I don't know who this girl is," Jack said, as if trying to figure out what kind of person would tell him lies about their own life. "You think she must be someone important."
He moved closer toward my desk now, slowly taking his pistol out from under the blinds and putting it back in its holster: _"I don't want you involved in any way,"_ he said again _, "but if that means something else—well then I guess we have no choice."_
The whole time I could feel my heart beating faster and louder than ever before; it was like being stuck inside some kind of machine with only one setting: _fast_. All these thoughts were running through my head at once, but the most important thing I knew for sure was that I couldn't tell him anything more about me or her. Because if he found out who she really was—the girl from work—then we'd both be dead before I could finish explaining why this had never been meant to happen in the first place: _I don't want you involved._
"Let's just end it," Jack said now, as if he knew what I was thinking but still couldn't believe that someone would come into his office and tell him they didn't care about any of this. He pulled out another gun from beneath the blinds: _"And then we can get on with our lives."_
I stared at him for a moment before speaking again: "It was just meant to be between us—between me and her, not you."
_"So why didn't it stay that way?"_ Jack asked me. _"Why are there all these other people involved now?"_
I could feel my hands shaking as I tried to come up with an answer that would satisfy him: _"Because they wanted something from us both and we couldn't give it to them."_
_"So what if we take care of them?"_ Jack asked. He pointed toward the revolver in his holster again: _"You can help me finish this."_
I took a step back as he slowly moved closer towards my desk, still holding both weapons tightly in front of him—the bandolier and grenades swinging wildly behind them like some kind of madman's cape. I knew what was coming next
