 ays ' time. He thought he had a right to tell me what he thought about life and death? What the hell would he know anyway, a guy who has n't seen a woman since 1984?
I looked over at my sister. She was asleep, her head propped up in the crook of her arm. The guard must have forgotten about her for a moment and I'd taken advantage to let him get away with it. As long as he was standing there, I had an opening. He reached down and straightened out the sheet that covered my legs so they were spread open and I could see his pants getting hard.
He smiled. ``Would you like a hand job?'' 
 
I told him to get away from me with those things. His eyes narrowed.
``You should be grateful,'' he said. He took out something shiny from under his jacket and waved it at me. The way it was shaking around in his hand, I knew what it was. I looked over at my sister, but she was still asleep. Maybe if the bastard raped her again, she'd come awake. 
 
He smiled again. ``This is a new kind of methadone that they give you just before your execution. It blocks all of your pain receptors so that even when they put the needle through your vein and stick it up your ass,'' he said, wiggling his hand like a butcher's knife, ``you won't feel anything at all.'' 
 
``It 's not real. It doesn't work, '' I said, even though I had no idea what the guy was talking about. The bastard just smiled again and started to undo his belt. My sister moaned in her sleep. I felt like crying. ``I think I'll have my way with you first,'' he said, leaning down over me. 
 
``Get away from me!''
He kept coming closer and then suddenly, as if by accident or maybe on purpose, he fell over onto the bed next to her, his face smashing into a pillow. He started to snore loudly.
My sister moaned again in her sleep. I took my chances and got up off the bed and left the room without waiting for the guard to get up. 
 
I heard them calling after me when I was downstairs, but it didn't matter anyway. Nobody ever came back into the cell except one time before I even met my sister. It was a few months before she got there and I was sitting on the floor reading when suddenly there were two men in the room. I saw the shadows through the bars of the door first, then their legs as they moved closer to me. One had his gun drawn while the other reached down under his jacket and pulled out something that looked like a stick with a spike at the end on it. 
 
``Sit up against the wall over there!'' he said in a loud voice, pointing at my sister who was sleeping by herself next to the bed. I had just moved when they kicked me in the head and knocked me down again. My mouth tasted blood but I was too stunned to do anything about it. The man with the stick came closer and raised his hand over my face, so close that I could feel his breath on me. 
 ``Stay there!'' he said, pointing a finger at me. Then he kicked me again in the back and I fell onto the floor. I tried to get up but they had tied my hands behind my back with some kind of rope. The second guard was holding a gun on them as if he expected them to attack him any time. They just stood there, glaring at me like two scared kids. 
 
``Why are you doing this?'' I said finally when I had enough strength in my voice again. ``I haven't done anything to you!'' The guard with the stick shoved me back onto the floor and leaned over me so that I could see his face. It was all red from having been hit in the face by one of his own comrades earlier, but still he wasn't scared or embarrassed at being there. 
 
``We want you to know how much we hate you and what you did to us!'' he said with a voice like a snake charmer's. ``So don't think that just because you're going to die, it 's going to make up for all the pain you caused us! We will not rest until we have made your death as miserable as possible!'' 
 
I looked over at my sister then and she was awake. She had her eyes closed and seemed like a statue frozen in time. The man with the stick walked over to me and kicked me again, this time in the groin so hard that I screamed out loud. My sister started crying when they left. They didn't even look back at us as they walked down the hall toward the stairs to the lower levels of the building where nobody ever came except for one guard who changed every night and then two other guards during the day if he needed help with something or another prisoner had gone insane from being in solitary confinement too long. 
 
The next thing I knew, it was two days later when my sister woke me up again to tell me about what they did that night while she was asleep. She said that they took a scalpel and cut off all her hair before tying her down on the bed so that she couldn't move around at all during their torture session with me. I felt like I wanted to throw up when I thought about what had happened, but there wasn't anything we could do except wait for them to come back again and maybe this time kill us both if they were feeling really cruel toward prisoners on death row who were scheduled to die soon enough that no one would care what happened anyway. 
 
It seemed like an eternity before they came back but it was probably only two or three hours at most since we didn't have any clocks in our cells and all the other people down here were asleep because everyone was scared of going crazy from being alone so long without any human contact except for what happened during these visits every night where they came back into your cell to torture you just before bedtime when they knew that no one else would be awake yet or able to hear anything happening outside your door. 
 
When they finally did show up, there were three men this time instead of two and each one had a different kind of weapon with them which he used on us after tying our hands behind our backs again so tightly that it hurt just as bad as having been beaten up by cops or soldiers in combat zones like Iraq where you don't know what the enemy looks like until they attack your unit from behind while shooting machine guns at every direction all around them. 
 
It didn't matter though because nobody would ever find out if anyone was killed during these attacks because no one could see anything that happened inside their cells since there were no windows anywhere except for maybe one on each end where visitors could look into them without being seen themselves unless they wanted to leave evidence behind which might prove useful later when they started investigating why so many people had been disappearing from prisons across America lately especially here in Florida but also up north too according to some news reports about how prisoners were getting killed off like cattle before being shipped back out again without anyone realizing that anything strange was going on until much later after everything else became clear too late for anybody except maybe us who knew what happened before anyone else did and couldn't tell them because nobody believed us anyway despite all of our proof! 
 
I tried to stop crying, but it wasn't easy. I kept seeing my sister's face as she lay on the bed in front of me, her eyes closed and looking so peaceful that I almost cried again right then before they could get to her because even though this was only supposed to be torture for us both instead of something much worse which nobody knew about yet until later when everything got revealed after we were dead already anyway. 
 
They pulled me over onto my stomach so that I was facing away from them, then they cut off all of my hair too just like they did with hers earlier in order to make it easier for them to scalp both of us later on when they wanted our bodies mutilated even more than they already were at this point. They grabbed a knife out of one of their pockets and started cutting away strips off my head until there was nothing left but stubble all over, then they took some sort of plastic tool that looked like a pliers except for having a small blade attached to it with two long arms on either side which meant you could grab someone's scalp really tightly before squeezing down hard enough so their brains would start bleeding out through every opening where hair once grew instead of blood anymore after being chopped off like weed grass from a lawnmower leaving only stubble behind. 
 
I screamed as loudly as I could while my sister was still sleeping peacefully beside me when they cut into her scalp too because she didn't know what was happening yet either although if anyone had asked her beforehand, I think she probably would've said no thank you anyway
