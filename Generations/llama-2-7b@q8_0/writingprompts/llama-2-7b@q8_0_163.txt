rown into a cage with the other victims, I was waiting for my turn in the chamber of death. The only thing worse than knowing what would happen when they finally let me out . . . would be waking up tomorrow to do it all over again.
In 2056, Earth has been conquered by the Gripps-a race of alien invaders who enslave humans and use their energy for their own devices. Seventeen-year-old Rory lives with her family in a small village, farming and trying to survive under the rule of their oppressors. In an effort to gain freedom, she disguises herself as a man and signs on aboard the Gripps' most deadly ship, hoping to sabotage the Gripps from within. But Rory is soon confronted with the fact that there may be more to her than even she realizes-and that perhaps freedom for all of humanity might not come as soon as hoped.
