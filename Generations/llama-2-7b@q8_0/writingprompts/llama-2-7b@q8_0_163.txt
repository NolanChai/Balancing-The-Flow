 I had seen anywhere else in my life. I wasn’t sure how to feel about them: I could not think of any good way to describe them. Mrs. Petrie said that the next thing we should know was that they were called upper and lower case letters, and then she told us what each letter looked like on a capital or small letter form.
“A is for apple, B is for ball,” Mrs. Petrie sang. “C is for cat, D is for dog.” I’d never seen the alphabet sung before; it felt almost magical. There were twenty-six letters altogether and we had to learn each one by heart. We would be tested on them later in the year, and when we knew all of the letters Mrs. Petrie said that we would have a party to celebrate!
We sat around our desks, which had little wooden chairs for us to sit on while we did our work. Each seat was covered with an orange cushion so it wasn’t hard at all on my bottom. The classroom floor was the same as the playground floor: concrete. There were no rugs or carpets to warm my feet and keep me from feeling chilled, like I had been in Mrs. Taft’s kindergarten class.
Mrs. Petrie had a special box for us that had all sorts of things we could use when she was teaching us something new: crayons, colored pencils, a ruler, and some sticks with felt tops on the ends that you could hold in your hands while you were writing. When we did our work I liked to watch how Mrs. Petrie moved her arms around to draw letters up or down on a board; they looked like butterflies with their wings moving in all directions as she wrote them for us.
It was time for lunch, and there were trays of food waiting on the table at the front of the classroom. There were sandwiches made with white bread and peanut butter, a bowl of green salad, and a tall glass filled with red juice that Mrs. Petrie said was called tomato soup. When I had tried it before in Mrs. Taft’s class at home I did not like the taste much; now I found myself looking forward to having my own cup for lunch.
I put my sandwich into a brown paper bag along with the rest of my food, and took the juice glass over to where Mrs. Petrie was sitting on her chair by the doorway to wait while we all finished our lunches. When she handed me the drink she asked if it was okay for her to borrow my red plastic cup; I had been given one from home just like the rest of us, and it was perfect for having a drink because there were handles on both sides so you could hold on tightly no matter how much you wanted to sip.
“Thank you very much,” Mrs. Petrie said as she took my cup with her when we went downstairs after eating lunch in our classroom; it was a bit strange, but I felt good about giving away something that belonged to me so that everyone could have one too.
