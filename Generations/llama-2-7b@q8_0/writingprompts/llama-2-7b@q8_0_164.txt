 for me and did not take her eyes off her Poké Ball as she sat on the floor, staring at it and thinking of her Pokémon, while I was trying to convince her that her monster had nothing to do with her.
`` You can't let your Pokémon grow up inside a Poké Ball, '' I told her. `` They need to get out there and hunt and battle and learn how to survive in the wild.'' 
 
The trainer's face became blank as she tried to understand what I was saying. She slowly nodded her head in understanding.
`` My Pokémon needs to grow, '' she said. `` He must get out of here. I know he'll learn more and become stronger by doing so.'' 
 
I watched her eyes light up with hope as she turned to look at me again. She didn't have a lot of money for Poké Balls or training equipment, but she knew what was best for her Pokémon. I would be glad to help her and her Pokémon whenever they needed it in the future.
`` All right then, '' I told her. ``Let's get your monster out there so he can learn how to live on his own.'' 
 
That was the start of an unbreakable bond between me and a trainer that has stayed with me for all these years. It is a memory I will always hold dear, one that still gives me hope when times are tough and encourages me to continue my search for Pokémon in places far from here.
 
Today was the first time since he was released from the hospital that I was able to spend some quality time with him alone. I think it is because he has finally realized that what he did wasn't right and that I'll never leave his side, no matter how much trouble we might get into together. We just went through a lot of things together this past year... but today, for the first time in all these years since the battle between us began, he looked at me with love in his eyes. 
 
We had both been fighting so hard and so long, that neither one of us really knew how to express ourselves anymore. But we knew what each other was thinking without having to talk. All that mattered now was just being together again, as if nothing had changed at all since the day he saved my life when I almost got killed in a battle against his teammates. 
 ``You're not going to tell me off this time?'' He said with a smile on his face. ``I'll never get used to that look of yours, no matter how much we spend together as friends from now on!'' 
 
`` Oh yeah? I remember that day when you saved my life... you were so scared for me and thought it was your fault! That I almost died because you couldn't protect me! But then when we got back home, we realized how much we had in common with each other and became good friends. We even helped each other get better at battling!'' 
 
``Yeah... yeah that sounds about right. I was so happy to have found someone like you who could understand what I was feeling inside my heart when nobody else would listen to me or help me deal with all the hurt and pain from losing everyone important in my life... but now everything is different, isn't it?'' 
 
``Yeah it sure is! Now we can fight together against those who threaten our lives without having to worry about getting hurt in a battle!'' I said excitedly. ``We're both stronger than ever before because of all the hard work and dedication you put into training every day, even though it was difficult for me at first... But now that we know what matters most in this world, everything just falls into place perfectly without any problems at all!'' 
 
I smiled back at him as he stared up at me from below while still holding my hand tightly with both of his arms. The two of us were finally together again after so long... it was like a dream come true for both of us because now we knew that no matter what happened in the future, we would always be there for each other! 
 ``Hey... do you remember when I told you about my friend who died last year?'' he asked me. 
 
``Yeah! That was pretty sad, wasn't it?'' I replied, looking down at him sadly as if something terrible had just happened to both of us all over again. ``But thankfully we were able to help her spirit live on in my heart and mind forevermore so that she could never be forgotten by anyone else ever again!'' 
 
``Yeah... well anyway, let's forget about those things for now because it makes me sad every time I think of them. Instead, why don't we just enjoy being with each other as friends and not worry about what might happen in the future? We can take care of everything else later when we have more time together... Okay?'' 
 
He smiled back at me with a smile on his face. I knew he was thinking about all the wonderful times we had spent together before, but now he wanted to start fresh and not dwell on any sadness or negativity that might come from our past experiences because it wouldn't help either one of us at this point in time anyway! 
 ``Sounds like a plan,'' I replied as we walked outside together hand-in-hand through some tall grass nearby so that no one would see us leaving my house unnoticed. ``I can't wait until tomorrow when everything will be okay again... because now is not the right time for either one of us!'' 
 
We both stood still as we looked out over an old abandoned farmhouse far away in the distance where no one lived anymore except maybe some animals who needed help finding new homes with people who cared about them enough not to hurt anyone else's feelings even if they wanted nothing more than just having someone else around all day long without having any problems whatsoever! 
 ``Goodbye,'' he said as we parted ways once again before disappearing from each other forever into our separate lives until next time... But somehow I knew deep down inside my heart that one day soon everything would work out perfectly between us because that's just how love works sometimes without any help at all!
