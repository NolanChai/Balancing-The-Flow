The 7th Child of a 7th Child (Book 1)
"How...?" I ask, looking at this stranger, someone with the same name as me. How can this be? Is it a glitch in the naming system, some sort of unknown error, or has my whole life been a lie? I haven't got long to find out before I'm killed by the same man that tried to kill me when I was born.
