...
I stopped, my hands now empty. "Well of course they were empty, I was n't holding anything before..." Or was I? I could n't quite remember any other reason I've ever had to climb into my attic without at least a single book in hand, but for once that fact did n't bother me, because all I could think about as I stood there staring up into the darkness of my bedroom was what was hidden above.
"Why are you here?" The question came from behind me as I heard one foot scrape against my floor. I turned around to see that same voice's owner, and almost let out a small gasp at how beautiful he looked in his sleeping attire. He had pulled on dark blue boxers and a white tank top, though the only part of it that could be seen was the top of his chest since he had thrown back his covers so they now trailed along the floor behind him. His hair was still mussed from where I'd pulled his head into my lap to kiss him goodnight; it was a bit unruly, but his eyes were still closed, and I felt myself smile at how cute that made him look.
"I know you're awake," I stated as I walked over towards him, "and I also know you do n't want to talk right now because of the earlier conversation we had."
"I can't really deny any of that," he answered quietly before glancing up at me for just a moment.
The fact that he was still willing to talk to me after all of our recent troubles made my chest swell with a strange sort of happiness, but I decided that it would be best not to say anything else right now. As much as I'd like to believe we were back on good terms again, I knew that the night was still young and that things could still go wrong if he did n't want them to.
"I guess what I should ask is whether or not you want me here." It was a question of my own; something I had to find out in order to make sure we were okay now, but more importantly to reassure myself that we really were alright and that we could still be together... at least for tonight.
"Yes," he said quickly before he paused just long enough to take a deep breath, "but I do n't know whether or not I should let you in."
I knew what he meant by the words he'd spoken; they were more than just an answer to my question, but rather it was also the only way I could possibly understand why he would ask for privacy. The problem was that this was the first time since we started dating that either of us had ever asked for any sort of personal space, and I felt a bit hurt at the thought of him having to deny me simply because he didn't want me around while he slept. But then again maybe I should n't feel that way; after all it was just sleep... or so I assumed, because how could one possibly sleep in front of someone they loved and still be able to dream about what their life is really like?
"What do you mean 'I can't let you in?' Is there somewhere else you would rather me go?" As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I regretted them because he immediately shook his head with a small smile before moving closer and wrapping his arms around my waist.
"You already know what I mean." He looked up at me with those eyes that always managed to take my breath away, and for just a second or two it felt like the world stopped spinning, but then all too quickly he leaned forward so we could share a small kiss before pulling back again. "I'll let you in," he said as he grabbed his boxers off of the floor with one hand while using the other to push me backwards until I fell onto my bed.
"Oh!" He grinned at me, but then shook his head and laughed a bit; it was an adorable thing for someone so gorgeous to do, but I knew that he probably just found it funny because of how embarrassed he was now since I'd stumbled when I fell. "Come on," he said as he hopped onto the bed beside me with a quick wiggle before pulling his tank top off and letting out another laugh at how much I laughed too, but for different reasons.
"It's not funny!" He smiled even more once he realized that I was still laughing while we were on my mattress since it was far from clean, "and you should n't be so embarrassed because if it was anyone else they would have probably fallen too."
He had a point; everyone knew about the state of my bedroom and how messy everything tended to get whenever I was there. That being said though, he was wrong in assuming that nobody else fell onto their mattresses when they were first laying down to sleep, because sometimes even people who weren't as clumsy as I was found themselves on the ground for whatever reason (and trust me when I say this: it 's not always funny!).
"I guess we both should n't be embarrassed then," he said with another laugh before sitting up and pushing his tank top back onto his shoulders. "I do n't want to waste anymore time talking, so just relax for a little while." He was right about that too; the best way to start over after something goes wrong is by doing exactly what you did before anything happened in order to remind yourself of why things were good in the first place.
As he lay back down on my bed once again, I found myself looking up at him with a smile and saying softly: "I guess so... but only if I get to stay." My request made him laugh again because I had just admitted what I really wanted to do; even though we were back together now, he still was not willing to let me sleep in the same bed as him without at least asking for some privacy first.
"I can't promise that," he said quietly before glancing down at my hands which were resting on my stomach, "but I will let you know if anything changes." That made me frown a little since it was obvious what had happened between us earlier tonight... or rather what did n't happen; however even though the idea of him keeping his promise to keep me away from him while we slept sounded horrible, somehow knowing that he was thinking about me so much already meant more than anything else could have.
I tried not to smile at how cute he looked when he started shifting around on the bed; I wanted nothing more than for us both to get some rest after everything we 'd been through today, but it felt strange lying next to him now that my arms were still empty. There was only one solution though: reaching out and placing them under his head so they could give me something else to focus on instead of thinking about what had just happened between us or how hard things would become from here forward if we could n't figure out a way around this issue once and for all...
"You know," I said, "I can get up too. It 's not like there is anything stopping me right now." He seemed confused by what I meant at first but soon realized where my thoughts were headed because he rolled over onto his back before looking down at me with those eyes that always made me want to smile no matter how much they hurt me when I saw them. "I 'm not sure if I can sleep," he admitted quietly while rubbing the palms of his hands together, which was something I knew meant he was thinking about what had happened earlier as well.
"You should get some rest; you know how hard it is to stay awake when I'm here." His smile grew wider and brighter as he began to laugh again. "Besides," he said before reaching out with one hand and pulling on my arm so that I would have no choice but to move closer toward him, "if we are going to be together forever then there is n't anything stopping us from spending more time together now."
I couldn't help but let out a laugh of my own at his words because he was right: we were still young enough that everything seemed possible when it came to our relationship and future. However, before I could say anything else the room grew darker as he rolled onto his side once again so that both of us could fall asleep without worrying about what might happen next between us if we did n't take care of this issue quickly enough before things got out of control once more...
