oped at the corners. He was always wearing a gray sweatshirt and dark jeans that were ripped at the knees. 
 I used to call him "Hobo" when he followed me down the street or through the mall. He looked like one of those guys who slept under a bridge in his sleeping bag. I guess he could be, though, if it came down to it. 
 I was always afraid for my life but never saw him do anything wrong. There were plenty of things that made me suspicious, though. 
 He watched me at the movies and the mall. It was easy enough for him because we lived in a small town where everybody knew each other. 
 His car was always parked across from my house. I noticed him driving past my school. And once when I got on the bus he stood there and waited till I got off. He had that kind of patience, even though he was about fifty years old or so. It was creepy to think about it later. 
 I didn't tell anybody at school because they'd get mad if they heard me say this: _Hobo was a weirdo_. They'd want to be nice and find out what happened and why he wanted to follow me around town. 
 And that was just the problem: Why? 
 I went through the usual stages. First, denial. Then anger at myself for being so stupid as to let this happen to me. Then fear. But after a while I got past those emotions and worked on figuring out why he was following me. I wondered what kind of guy would do something like that? 
 Maybe it's because my dad died when I was little, and nobody took care of me. Mom didn't want to leave her job at the bank so she could raise two kids alone. So I had to take care of myself a lot of times. I always did what I thought was right. 
 Like when Mom got sick with cancer a couple of years ago and I had to quit school early and work to help out. Sometimes my brother, Joel, helped me do the chores around the house. We were like two old guys on our hands and knees scrubbing the floors together. 
 After that Mom got better and we all went back to normal again. That's when I started getting noticed by the girls at school. That made me feel good, but it also made Joel mad because I was starting to get more attention than him. 
 He always wanted to be number one in everything. Like when he told everyone that he could ride his bike faster down this steep hill than anyone else in town and he would show them how. Then he ran into a parked car on the way down. 
 But I think Joel was just jealous because I got more attention from the girls and sometimes had to stay after school for detention or miss recess or something while they let him do whatever he wanted without asking questions. That's how things were when I was fifteen years old. And that's what made me start taking care of myself, too. 
 After Hobo started following me I stopped talking to my friends at school. It was better if I just stayed home and read books or work on projects for Mom's garden club. Sometimes Joel would ask me if we could hang out, but I just shook my head and said no because he always wanted to do something that involved some kind of action: He always had to be doing something all the time. 
 It wasn't easy being a teenager with Joel around. My friends were always trying to get me to do stuff with them, but it was hard because I never knew what Joel would say or do if he found out about it. So I kept telling him that I didn't want to go anywhere without permission from our mom first. That shut him up for a while. 
 Then when I turned sixteen and started driving around with my friends, Hobo followed me again. He was still at the movies or the mall when we got back in the car and went home afterward. I didn't tell Joel about it because he would get mad if he thought his little sister was doing something without him knowing about it first. 
 When winter came around my friends wanted to go skiing, but they were all afraid that Mom would find out so they had to sneak away and take me with them in the middle of the night when she was asleep. It wasn't fair because Joel should have been included too since he was older than I was by six months or so. 
 Sometimes my friends asked if Hobo came along with us, but they didn't know what to do if he did. He would follow us up the mountain and then wait at the bottom in his car until we got ready to head home again. That's how it worked for a while. 
 And then one day when I was about sixteen years old things changed forever between me and Hobo because I started to realize why he had been following me around town all this time. It wasn't just because of some strange obsession or anything like that at first, either. 
 It was a lot simpler than that—I just thought it would be fun if we went for a ride together sometime without my friends being involved too much anymore. That was what he wanted from the start, but I couldn't figure out why until later when everything came out in plain sight one day while we were driving down this country road toward nowhere special at all—just some random place where there weren't any houses or businesses anywhere around us as far as my eyes could see in every direction. 
 And that was just fine with me because nobody would have been able to find out about it even if they tried really hard. Not unless something bad happened anyway, which wasn't likely at all considering how nice I had always thought Hobo was before this trip took place between us both alone inside our own car on its way down the road toward someplace unknown but interesting for sure in every possible way imaginable . . .

# Catching Up
When she's not working at her new job, Tori Nelson enjoys reading and writing in a cozy corner of her bedroom. She tries to avoid getting distracted by the fact that it overlooks the neighbor's yard and sometimes an unwelcome visitor might be there, peering through her window.
Today she is trying to finish _The Book That Changed Everything_ , but a text message from one of her co-workers pulls her away from the story for a minute. When she finally looks up again, it's after four in the afternoon and the sunlight is pouring through her window into her face.
She picks up her phone to see what the message says: _"It's over."_ That sounds ominous; Tori doesn't like it when things are over without warning or explanation—even if they are bad things, which this one clearly isn't (she hopes). It might mean that somebody died but probably not.
Tori stares at the words on her phone for a while before she can bring herself to call her friend back. She doesn't want to say anything that will make him upset about what happened earlier today, so instead of asking him if he's okay or whatever else might be appropriate under these circumstances (and there are many), she just says: "What do you mean?"
He tells her the whole story in a few brief sentences before he gets off the phone. It sounds like something out of an old western movie—somebody got shot and they had to ride away fast without stopping for help because it would take too long to explain everything that happened when they finally arrived at their destination (which is probably going to be another town far away from where they started).
Tori sits there listening, feeling bad for him but also kind of relieved that she didn't have anything else planned today. It turns out he was just kidding around with her anyway; she doesn't believe he would actually do something like this himself even though he did admit it wasn't really his fault either (she guessed as much).
"Sorry," she tells him, which is all that needs to be said because it feels good to say sorry after being mad at someone else for making you feel bad about yourself. It's not like they were fighting or anything—just arguing over something stupid—but sometimes people get angry when they should just let things go instead of trying too hard to make up for whatever happened before.
_Well, that was fun_ , Tori thinks as she hangs up the phone and goes back inside her house where she finds herself feeling even better than before because now there is nothing left to worry about except what's going on in the book she has been reading lately (which isn't much).
She opens up _The Book That Changed Everything_ again just as if nothing happened today except maybe some bad dreams last night involving giant spiders or something like that (which were actually pretty cool) but now it seems like there might be some good news coming soon because everything always works out for the best eventually even though sometimes people don't want things to work out in their favor—especially when they get scared about what could happen next if something goes wrong with this whole thing we call life.
