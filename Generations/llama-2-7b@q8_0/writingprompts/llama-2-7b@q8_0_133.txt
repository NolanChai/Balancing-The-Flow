aircase. The top of each floor is more than twice as high as our dormitories, which makes us feel as if we’re living at the very edge of the earth, or perhaps on its back, looking out over the ocean below.
I passed my friends, Jaya and Will, who were both sleepwalking upward with their heads down, their lips moving in what might have been prayers or might have been spells. I passed Tristan, too, carrying a tray of food that looked to be a mix of chicken and some sort of cake. He was grinning at me, and it wasn’t until we were side by side that he spoke.
“I haven’t seen you in days!” His voice was as happy as his smile.
I glanced around, and Tristan dropped the tray before us both could react to keep it from breaking. The food fell to the stone floor with a wet thud, the cake splitting into two pieces but not quite disintegrating entirely. Tristan winced. He picked up one of the cakes with his hands as if it was alive and wriggling on the floor and handed it over without saying anything more.
“Here you go,” he said in a low voice, “but be careful.” I took it and slipped it into my robe before continuing toward my room at the top of the tower. The cake smelled good, and even as I hurried away from Tristan, my stomach reminded me that it had been nearly three days since I’d eaten anything.
When I reached the top of the stairs, I paused in front of a door and turned the handle. It was locked with a key—as always, though I didn’t know why no one else bothered to pick up their own keys and lock them away safely when they were done using them.
I looked around for something to pry open the door but could find nothing except for a shoe that wasn’t mine, which had been left outside. It belonged to my twin sister, Artemis, and was a size or two too small. I took it off of the floor and used its heel as an unorthodox tool to turn the lock open.
The door swung open with a creak, and I stepped inside. As soon as I did, I realized that someone else had been here before me. It wasn’t just my robe that was dusted with cobwebs now: a corner of my desk was covered in spiderwebs, too, as if the web-spinners had decided to make their home on top of mine while I was away.
“Artemis?” My sister didn’t answer at first. She had been sitting up all night studying, as usual—she could be very stubborn about her own work when it was time to do so—but now she lay facedown in bed with her long blond hair tangled on the pillow beside her head. I gasped and ran forward to her side, afraid that she had fallen from our tower bedroom window or that something terrible might have happened during the night.
Artemis didn’t stir when I shook her shoulder until finally she sat up in a half-sleepy state and blinked at me with tired eyes. She looked over my shoulder for an explanation of what was going on, and then her brow furrowed as she remembered that I hadn’t been in our room the night before.
“You were supposed to help me,” Artemis said, frowning. “I needed your help last night.” She rubbed a hand across her eyes to erase the tiredness. She had dark circles under her eyes and a small bruise on her forehead that hadn’t been there when we went to bed together hours before. I reached out my hand to touch it, but she pulled away.
“Why?” Artemis asked, but even as she said it, she was already shaking her head and trying to shove me away from her room. “Get out! Just get out!” She pushed against my shoulder with more force than I expected—more force than my sister usually used when she spoke to me—and for a moment I stared at her as if she were someone else entirely, or had changed into a shape that wasn’t quite hers.
My sister pulled the blankets up around herself and sat back down on her bed with her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Artemis said softly. I glanced at her bedside table, where a small pile of books was stacked with carelessness: the tomes she had been studying so closely during the night when they should have been sleeping. She hadn’t slept for two straight days, and she needed more rest if she wanted to be prepared for our next lesson today.
I nodded and turned back toward the door, my shoulders drooping in defeat even though I knew that Artemis was right: there was no point in me staying here now. She wasn’t going to speak with me about her nighttime activities—if she had done anything wrong at all—and there was no reason for us both to be awake when the sun rose early this morning. I turned the knob, but before I could leave our room and go back downstairs into my own bedroom below, Artemis grabbed me from behind with one hand.
“Luck,” she whispered. “Remember what I said.” Then she let go of me again and curled up on her side with the blankets pulled high around her face. She didn’t speak as I left our room and headed back downstairs to my own place.
I wasn’t sure what Artemis meant by it, but luck was an important part of being a Magister. The Magisters are known for their luck and skill with magic; they say that the Magisters can turn one drop of water into enough oil to light a single candle for as long as anyone could possibly need it. They’re also said to be able to make even the dead speak to us through our dreams, and some of them are so powerful that they can turn sand into gold or breathe new life into a corpse with their own magic.
I thought about all of these things as I reached my room, which was on the second floor of the tower, and set the cake on top of my desk—still in pieces but at least intact now that Tristan had dropped it instead of breaking it. The walls here were so high that they seemed to swallow me from behind and press down on my shoulders like a great weight. The floor was smooth stone, covered by rugs as worn as they were beautiful: old Persian carpets that looked even more exquisite than usual with their bright colors and intricate patterns now that we’d been awake for days without sleeping at all.
I was so tired that I didn’t bother to take off my robe before crawling under the covers of my bed, which felt like it was made out of stone as well—but maybe that was just because I hadn’t slept in my own bedroom since last week when Artemis had taken over mine while she worked on her latest project. The pillows were soft beneath me, and even though I didn’t know if they belonged to anyone else’s bed, I burrowed into them gratefully with my head tucked against the wall.
I sighed and turned away from the cake that had been left for me on top of my desk, where it was now covered by a thin layer of dust. “But luck is better than nothing,” Artemis had said, so I picked up one of her books—the one she had been studying when I woke up this morning—and placed it back in its spot on the shelf above my headboard. The book was thick and heavy with pages of writing that looked almost like gobbledygook to me; no matter how many times I tried, I couldn’t read any of Artemis’s books because they were all written in her own language instead of our own.
I yawned again as the sun began to rise outside my window, and then I turned to lie down on top of my bed for just a few minutes until Jaya and Will came downstairs with me so that we could all eat together before class started again. But even after they left and only Tristan was still standing there beside my bed watching me with his hands behind his back, I stayed awake longer than usual as the sun rose higher into the sky above us, illuminating every crack in our stone walls and making it impossible to ignore how much bigger Artemis’s room seemed compared to mine.
I heard something drop to the floor a few moments later: something that sounded like glass or maybe a bottle being broken. Then I realized what was happening—that my sister had been standing by my bed all along, and now she was making her way back through our tower to where we kept our own belongings downstairs below us so we could carry them upward again in time for today’s lessons.
Artemis picked up the cake that I’d left on top of my desk when I’d first woken up, and then she opened her mouth as if to eat it. Instead of doing anything else though, she held the piece of food between two fingers while looking at me with a question in her eyes. “Luck?” Artemis asked before
