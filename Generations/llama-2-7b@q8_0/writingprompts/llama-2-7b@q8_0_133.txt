etly not an option but something far more dangerous.
"That's just fine," he muttered with a nod to the man before taking another drink. He sighed as the liquid slid down his throat, "What is it I ask you for?"
The bartender gave Alistair a hard look and then a smile, "Well you see sir I know who you are." The man grinned slightly, "I can be of assistance to your cause." He said before glancing around the room as if trying to avoid some sort of punishment from his fellow drinkers.
"So you're a spy," Alistair said flatly as he finished another drink, he took in another deep breath and then looked at the man, "Well... do you have something for me?" He asked with a raised eyebrow, looking the other way from his eyes to make sure no one was listening.
The bartender's smile grew slightly wider, he tapped Alistair on the shoulder and pulled him in close before whispering, "I know of a man that might be able to help." He nodded slowly, "He can lead you to your destination if you wish."
"That would be... helpful," Alistair said with a nod as he put his empty glass down. "What's the catch?"
The bartender gave a slight smirk and then tipped his head, "I am sure I could convince him to let me keep some of this man's goods for myself." The smile grew wider on the face of the man who's name he had yet to learn. He looked back over at Alistair with an intense look in his eye.
"How do we get started then?" Alistair asked, he watched the man as a slow smile formed across his own lips. It wasn't often that someone offered him help and he didn't expect anything too difficult to come out of it.
The bartender smiled once more before looking at something behind Alistair. He had a look of horror on his face, but then looked back to the man, "I think you should meet with this person alone." The smile slowly faded from the mans face as he took in another breath.
Alistair turned around to see nothing out of place, though the bartender's reaction was enough for him to turn back around and look at the man again. "How do I know you aren't lying?" He asked, taking a step forward with his arms still by his sides, waiting to hear something that would assure him this man was telling the truth.
"I believe in my heart I could never lie," The bartender said as he tapped Alistair on the shoulder again and then walked off leaving Alistair alone at the bar once more. He waited for a few moments before looking around to make sure no one would be watching him from any angle, then turned around and looked back over at the man who had left.
"Alright..." Alistair said flatly as he stepped away from the bar and walked slowly in the direction of where the bartender had gone. He watched his surroundings for any threats before moving on, he had no idea what was going to happen next or if it was a trap but he knew that it would be worth finding out.
The man disappeared into one of the back rooms and Alistair followed as quickly as possible. When he got there he saw the bartender sitting at a table with someone else, he stepped back and looked at them for a moment before taking a step forward. "You are to meet this person alone," He said flatly before stepping out of sight again.
"I will be just fine," Alistair responded as he stepped closer towards the two men seated around the table, his eyes narrowing on their faces but still holding them at bay. "I don't trust people who are too eager to help." He said flatly before walking over and sitting down across from the other two men.
The man looked up with a grin on his face as he noticed Alistair was close enough, "Very well then... I am sure you can be of service to me as well..." The man smiled wider, he reached into a small bag that sat in front of him and pulled out what appeared to be a black cloth. He set it down on the table and held his hand up over it before pulling back slowly revealing an ornate necklace made of gold with some sort of gemstone hanging from the chain. "I would like you to have this as payment for your service," The man said as he motioned to Alistair.
"Alistair?" Alistair asked, he looked over at the man in front of him and then down at his hand with a slight frown on his face. He had no idea why this man would call him by that name but he knew he'd find out soon enough. "I don't think we know each other well enough for me to accept such a gift."
The man nodded before looking up once more at Alistair, "Yes I am sure you are correct... but I believe in your strength and ability..." The man paused for a moment before continuing on with his sentence. He leaned forward and placed the necklace gently in front of Alistair. "Take it, and then let me know if we should meet again." With that said he smiled widely at Alistair who had no idea what to do next or where this would go from here...
The man waited for a moment as he stared at the necklace before looking back up at Alistair with an intense look in his eyes. The man then reached forward and placed it around his neck, he looked over at the two men who had been sitting across from him. "Thank you," He said flatly before standing up and walking out of the room without another word to either one of them.
