vering chair in front of my desk, and waited. I knew she wouldn’t be long in coming to me, but I wished it hadn’t taken so long; after all, if I was going to die tonight I might have preferred to spend the time with her instead of waiting alone. 
 She didn't even say hello as she entered my office and sat down, crossing one leg over the other as if she were comfortable, but the way she kept shifting around on the seat belied that idea. I didn’t say anything either; I wasn’t about to start off with an awkward silence. 
 “You know what I want.” She finally spoke. Her voice was calm, soothing almost, but her tone made it clear just how serious she was. 
 "I'm sorry." It seemed like a stupid thing to say, but if there was one thing I knew about her, it’s that she loved hearing me apologize for whatever had happened between us. She didn't even need to hear what the apology was for; as long as I said those words she’d be happy and satisfied with herself. 
 “Say it again,” she urged softly. Her eyes were almost pleading, but she didn’t seem scared or angry like she normally did. That only made me want to apologize more. 
 “I’m sorry.” I repeated in a much lower voice than before, and I watched her smile as if we had just spent the night together. It wasn't quite what I was after though; I wanted to know why it had taken so long for her to come here tonight. She hadn’t been this calm and relaxed with me since that one time, when she came to my office and sat across from me in silence before pulling out a gun and threatening to kill herself if I didn't agree to have sex with her right there and then. 
 “I'm sorry,” I repeated for the third time; this time it sounded like a plea instead of an apology, but she seemed perfectly satisfied with it anyway. The smile on her face didn’t fade as she spoke again; whatever she had to say, I was sure that it would make me even more happy than the apologies I had just made. 
 “I've been waiting for this all night,” she said. She paused and leaned forward in the chair so that her chin rested on the back of her right hand. It was an odd pose, but one that seemed to suit her perfectly; it even seemed as if it had been done intentionally instead of by accident. “I just wanted you to know first.” 
 “You can’t die tonight.” I didn't want to hear what she was about to say next, not after what happened last time with the gun, but I knew that there was no avoiding it either. My hand shook as I raised it to cover my mouth and stop myself from saying anything, but she caught me anyway. 
 “You have to die tonight.” There was no fear in her voice; if anything, she sounded even more calm than she had been when she entered the room earlier. She leaned back again, letting her hands fall onto her lap as she looked directly at me. I thought for a second that it would be better to turn away from her, but there was something about the way she stared into my eyes that made me stay where I was; whatever was going to happen tonight, we were going to do it together. 
 “But you can't die yet.” She said suddenly as if I’d been saying all of this out loud instead of just in my head. “I have to spend a little more time with you first.” Her smile never faded as she spoke; it was the same one that she had had since before she pulled the gun on me, and it made me think that nothing could ever make her angry or scared again after this. I wondered if I would ever be able to look at her the same way again if she managed to get away with what she wanted tonight; was there any way to escape what was going to happen? 
 “I don't understand.” She looked up at me as though she expected an answer, but all I could do was shake my head. I couldn’t even think of a way to reply when she spoke again. 
 “It doesn't matter anyway,” she said quickly; it almost sounded like there was something she didn't want me to hear as she spoke the words, but I knew that nothing would come out of her mouth without my permission first. It had always worked before, after all. 
 “I wanted you to know ahead of time though.” She took a deep breath and looked away from me; it was almost as if she were trying not to cry again, although it didn't seem like anything was wrong at this point. I sat there quietly for a second, wondering what to say next or how to respond; whatever she had planned for tonight I was sure that there wasn’t much I could do about it now, and so I decided to just sit there quietly as she spoke again. 
 “You have to die tonight.” Her voice was still calm despite the words I knew were coming next; they were the ones I hadn't wanted to hear before, but now that I did know what would happen I couldn’t bring myself to stop her from saying them anyway. The tears I had expected never came out either, and so instead of breaking down in front of me like she usually did when she got upset about something, she kept herself together even as she continued speaking. 
 “I'm sorry.” Her voice was almost a whisper this time; it was barely audible above the sound of my own heartbeat. She looked away from me again and her eyes seemed to lose their focus for a second before they focused on something else that I couldn't see. When she spoke next, though, it didn’t seem like she had been distracted by anything at all; instead there was only one thing in the room with us anymore: us. 
 “I love you.” Her voice sounded even calmer now than it had when she first arrived, and I couldn't help but smile as her words brought back memories of those times before everything went wrong between us. She hadn’t said that to me in so long, not since before the night of the gun, and hearing those words again was more than enough to make my heart skip a beat. 
 “I'll miss you.” There was a hint of sadness behind her voice this time; it wasn’t nearly as bad as when she had cried earlier but there was still something about how she said that word which made me feel terrible for what I was going to do to her tonight. She kept staring at the spot on my desk where her hand used to be, and I watched her eyes widen in surprise as they landed on something else instead of just focusing on empty space like they usually did when she had gotten nervous about what I was going to do next or say afterward. 
 “You're so beautiful.” It took me a second before I realized that these weren’t words that were coming out of my mouth, but rather those of hers instead; she was staring at something on my desk again and looking just as surprised by what it had become as when we first saw each other earlier this week. 
 “You're so wonderful.” Her voice was still calm, but now there seemed to be a hint of happiness behind every word she said. I couldn’t help but smile as she continued speaking; the look on her face was one which I had never seen before and it made me want to hug her close without having to ask permission first or worrying about how hard it would hurt if we did fall into each other's arms again like we used too. 
 “You're so perfect.” She stopped speaking for a second, but then her hand shot out across the desk and grabbed onto mine before pulling me closer to her. I tried my best not to smile or laugh as I let myself be pulled toward her without saying anything at all; this was what had been missing from our relationship since everything went wrong between us last time around, and now that it was back again there wasn't anything in the world which could make me want to leave. 
 “You're so beautiful.” The words came out of my mouth again before I knew what happened next; she pulled me closer still until our faces were only inches apart from each other's. Her eyes seemed lost for a second, but then they focused on mine as if they had been staring at me the whole time instead of something else entirely different like before this week. 
 “You're so perfect.” I couldn’t help myself any longer; I let go of her hand and reached up to hold onto hers instead with both of my own hands while she spoke again without saying anything else at all except these two simple words over and over again until it seemed like we were going to be stuck together forever. 
 “You're so beautiful.” The silence between us was deafening now as we stared into each other’s eyes; I felt like everything in the room had stopped moving and that time itself was standing still just because she wanted it to stay right there with us instead of going on without any regard whatsoever for how much longer until one or both of us would die tonight. 
 “You're so wonderful.” Her voice sounded sad again now as if something had changed between us since we first met
