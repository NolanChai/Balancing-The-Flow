The UNSC has been a very interesting place over the past couple decades. The Bush Administration was able to push through some questionable resolutions in order to invade Iraq but then it seemed like it was mostly dead for the rest of the Obama Administration. This is the first time that I can remember an American president leading a meeting of the UNSC and it seems pretty cool to me.

I have to ask, why did this take so long? The U.S. has been threatening nations with nuclear destruction since World War II but we've never had an official meeting on this subject? Seems like something that should have happened a long time ago...

### Analysis:

The UNSC is the most powerful body in the United Nations and it was established by the UN Charter. This is where all of the major decisions are made for peacekeeping operations, sanctions, etc. The UNSC has been around since 1945 but this is the first time a U.S. president has led one of their meetings!

In order to do this, President Obama had to convince other world leaders that it was necessary and important enough to warrant his attention. It seems like he succeeded because they all agreed to the resolution without much discussion or argument. This shows just how powerful our country is on the global stage even though we're not as prominent as some of the other countries in Europe (like France) or Asia (like Japan).

### Conclusion:
