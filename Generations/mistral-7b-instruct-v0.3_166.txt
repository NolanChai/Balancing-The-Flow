Witnesses were left in awe as two bolts of lightning struck a suburban front garden, capturing the attention of many and leaving behind a trail of destruction. The incredible event was caught on camera by a resident living nearby, providing a breathtaking view of nature's raw power.

The footage shows the first bolt of lightning striking the ground near a tree before the second bolt swiftly follows suit, creating an electrifying spectacle that lit up the night sky. The intense flashes were accompanied by loud cracks and thunderous roars that could be heard throughout the neighborhood.

Residents in the area reported feeling the strong vibrations caused by the lightning strikes, with one commenting, "It was like nothing I've ever experienced before â€“ it felt like an earthquake!" The two strikes left behind charred marks on the ground and damaged several nearby structures, including a shed and fencing.

Meteorologist John Smith explained that the simultaneous strikes were caused by a rare weather phenomenon called a step leader, in which a positive charge travels downwards from the cloud towards the ground while negative charges move upwards from the ground to the cloud. When these two charges meet, a lightning bolt is formed.

"It's not uncommon for there to be multiple strikes during a thunderstorm," said Smith. "But it's extremely rare for them to happen at the same time and so close together."

The meteorologist warned residents to stay indoors during thunderstorms and avoid using electronic devices, as they can attract lightning. He also advised people to unplug appliances and turn off air conditioning units to prevent damage from power surges caused by nearby strikes.

As cleanup efforts continue in the aftermath of this extraordinary event, neighbors remain in awe of the incredible display they witnessed just outside their doorsteps. The memory of the two bolts of lightning striking the suburban front garden will undoubtedly be etched into their minds for years to come.
