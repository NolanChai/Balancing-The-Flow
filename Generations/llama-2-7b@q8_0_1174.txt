I see the First Lady is greeted by children who are dressed up as animals and dance. I also see a table with flowers that seem to be piled on top of each other and there are candles on top of the flower arrangement. There seems to be some kind of feast set up for the table and there are people in the room that do not look like humans, they might be ghosts or spirits because they donâ€™t have bodies.

### Clarification:
The children were dressed up as animals because it was a theme party. The flowers were piled on top of each other to represent how many birthdays the child had for example if you were turning 7 then there would be 6 flowers on the arrangement, and so forth.
