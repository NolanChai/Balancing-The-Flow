Jonathan Burrows, who was convicted of fraud for evading Â£43,000 worth of train tickets, has been barred from working in the financial industry. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed a ban on Mr Burrows, preventing him from carrying out any regulated activity without its prior permission.

Mr Burrows admitted to defrauding his employer, First Capital Connect, by using false tickets and passes to travel between 2010 and 2013. He was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay back the stolen money. The FCA has now extended that punishment by banning him from working in any financial services role.
