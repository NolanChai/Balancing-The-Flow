The show's producers are now under fire for an episode that caused an uproar and led some to call for the series to be banned.

### Explanation:
1) The Israelis, who have been a traditional ally of US in the region, are not happy with Homeland. This was done to convey their displeasure.
2) Now that they have created so much fuss, they will probably get some new publicity for season 6 which is due to be released soon.
