Glen Campbell's wife Kim said in a statement to People magazine that her husband is "probably not aware" of the nomination he received at the 89th Academy Awards. She added that she had been trying to explain the news to him but that it was difficult for him to understand.

Campbell, who has been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since 2011, was nominated for Best Original Song with the song "Iâ€™m Not Gonna Miss You" for the documentary about his life and battle with Alzheimer's, Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me.
