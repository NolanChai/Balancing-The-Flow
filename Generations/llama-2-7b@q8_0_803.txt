- Andre Santos arrested for drink-driving in London

### Subtext:

Arsenal left back Andre Santos has been arrested and cautioned after he was found to be driving over the limit in an early morning traffic stop. The Brazilian defender was stopped by police shortly before 3am on Friday as he drove his car on the A1 near Woolwich, south London. Police said that the player was breathalysed and the test showed him to have a level of 45 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath in breach of the Road Traffic Act. Santos was arrested for drink-driving and later cautioned, but was not charged with any criminal offence as it did not meet the legal threshold for prosecution under the Act. The 26-year-old, who joined Arsenal from Fenerbahce in May, is expected to appear at Woolwich Crown Court on October 10 after being issued a court summons and given six penalty points on his licence. He was also banned from driving for a year as he is required by law to have been disqualified for at least 56 days before the end of the ban. Arsenal, who were not aware that Santos had been arrested until informed by police later in the day, said they would await the outcome of court proceedings and decide on further action once more information was available. A club spokesman said: 'Arsenal Football Club is aware of the matter involving Andre Santos which resulted in him being charged with drink-driving this morning.'
