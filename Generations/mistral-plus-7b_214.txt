A schoolboy in Germany has landed a monster fish that is not only impressive in length but also in weight! The boy, who was on a fishing trip with his father, managed to reel in an enormous catfish measuring at least eight feet long and weighing more than 300 pounds. The giant fish is believed to be the largest one ever caught by a German angler. It is not known exactly how old it is but experts estimate that this particular catfish could be anywhere between 25-40 years old!

The young fisherman, who has been identified as Maximilian K., was out on the river with his father when he reeled in this incredible catch. After a long struggle to bring it ashore, they managed to securely land the enormous creature and take some photos of their impressive accomplishment. The fish is now being carefully studied by biologists who are eager to learn more about its size and age.
