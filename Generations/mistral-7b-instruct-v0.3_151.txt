 manipulating data to downplay the health risks associated with its products. A new report by British American Tobacco (BAT) has been criticized for using methods that may have skewed the results in favor of the company.

The report, titled "Towards a Smoke-Free Future," was published last week and claims that switching from smoking to BAT's e-cigarettes could reduce the risk of lung cancer by 97%. However, critics argue that the study used flawed methods and did not take into account the long-term effects of e-cigarette use.

One of the main criticisms is that the report only considered the short-term effects of smoking and vaping, without looking at the cumulative impact over a lifetime. This means that it may have underestimated the risks associated with continued e-cigarette use.

Another concern is that the study did not compare BAT's e-cigarettes to other brands on the market, but instead only looked at their own products. This raises questions about the objectivity of the research and whether it was designed to promote BAT's products over those of its competitors.

In response to these criticisms, BAT has defended the report and insisted that it follows rigorous scientific standards. The company argues that its e-cigarettes are a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes and can help smokers quit. However, many public health experts remain skeptical and have called for more independent research into the long-term effects of e-cigarette use.

This is not the first time that BAT has faced criticism over its data practices. In 2013, the company was accused of manipulating studies to downplay the links between smoking and disease. The allegations led to a probe by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The latest report has reignited concerns about the tobacco industry's influence over scientific research and its efforts to promote its products as safe alternatives to smoking. Critics argue that companies like BAT have a vested interest in downplaying the risks of their own products while exaggerating the benefits, in order to maintain profits and undermine public health initiatives.

As e-cigarettes become increasingly popular, it is important for consumers to be informed about the potential risks and benefits of these products. While they may be less harmful than traditional cigarettes, it is still unclear what long-term effects they may have on users' health. Independent research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes, and to ensure that they are marketed honestly and responsibly.
