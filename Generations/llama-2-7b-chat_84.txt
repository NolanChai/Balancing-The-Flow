As I sit here in the midst of this chaos, surrounded by the unfamiliar sounds of explosions and gunfire, I can't help but think about how much my life has changed in just one year. It's as if time itself has shifted gears, moving at an alarming pace that I can no longer keep up with. One moment I was living my normal life, the next I found myself caught in the midst of a war zone. The colors of my world have faded away, replaced by the cold grayness of reality. Laughter has given way to tears, and hope has been replaced by fear. And yet, even as I struggle to come to terms with this new reality, I find myself wondering if there is still a glimmer of light in the darkness. Is it possible for me to hold on to my humanity in the face of such unimaginable horror? Can I find a way to keep my heart beating, even when everything around me seems to be collapsing? These are the questions that haunt me as I try to make sense of this madness.
