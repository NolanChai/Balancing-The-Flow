## By . Leon Watson . A former Hare Krishna devotee who spent ten years in a temple learning to be celibate is facing jail for committing a series of sex attacks. Sean Keen, 50, was a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) from 1982 until he left the church in 1993 when it split into two factions over issues of management. He joined ISKCON after leaving home aged just 17 and lived at its temple in Wimbledon for nearly a decade. During that time, Keen was known as "Krishna" and became part of the cult's hierarchy, where he spent most of his time learning to be celibate. However, on Friday night, the former Hare Krishna devotee was found guilty at Croydon Crown Court of ten counts of indecent assault against seven female victims aged between 14 and 23, which he committed between 1986 and 1993. The court heard that Keen sexually abused the girls as they lay on beds in a room in the temple where they had gone to be taught meditation or other classes by him. One victim said she felt "violated" after he groped her breasts, fondled her underwear and masturbated while lying next to her. Another was sexually assaulted when Keen pinned her down as she lay on his bed and told her: "Just be still for me." Another victim said that although Keen had initially been a friendly person to her during the time she lived in the temple, he later used to rub his penis against her as they sat in meditation. The court heard that a further complainant was also subjected to similar sexual assaults by him when she was 14 years old. One victim said that Keen would lie next to them and "groped" their breasts, fondled underwear or masturbated while they slept at the temple, which they were allowed into only if accompanied by a parent. Another claimed he touched her genitals during meditation sessions and then forced himself on top of her as she lay in bed. In all cases, Keen would tell his victims to keep quiet about what had happened "because it was a part of being at the temple". He was arrested after police were alerted by one of the complainants following allegations that he had sexually abused her while he lived in India during 1982. The court heard how, when police interviewed him over his relationship with the girl, Keen admitted touching her genitals and making advances towards her, but denied the more serious offences. During one of the interviews, he told officers: "I've been guilty of a lot of things." One victim said she was abused by Keen at least 20 times during her four years living in the temple and that she had tried to report him to ISKCON leaders. But when she did so they dismissed her allegations as "exaggerated" and told her: "Leave it with us - we will deal with it." She said she only went public with what Keen had done after he was arrested following the allegation that he raped a girl in India. The court heard how Keen had previously been convicted of sexually assaulting one female in 1984 and was put on probation for 20 months, but was not required to register as a sex offender because it was deemed there were insufficient grounds to do so. He was also given a suspended sentence and ordered to pay Â£75 costs after he admitted indecent exposure in 1985. The victim's mother said: "I think the fact that this man is not on the register of sex offenders makes me sick." Detective Constable Steve Cousins, from Croydon Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: "The victims were vulnerable and in a situation where they felt unable to speak out. Keen's abuse has had a serious impact on their lives." After the trial ended yesterday, Keen was remanded in custody to be sentenced at Croydon Crown Court today (WEDS).
