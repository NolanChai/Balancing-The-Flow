The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) recently announced that they had raised over £270,000 in the last financial year from selling seized items of value on the popular online auction site ebay. The items included luxury watches, designer clothes and other valuables which were confiscated during police operations targeting criminal activity such as theft, fraud and drug dealing.

The MPS has been using ebay for several years now to sell these items in order to recover some of the costs associated with their enforcement activities. The money raised from selling the seized goods is then used by the force to help fund future investigations and operations. The sale of confiscated items on ebay also helps reduce storage costs and ensures that valuable property is not simply destroyed or left unused.

The MPS has seen great success in using ebay to sell their seized items, with over £270,000 raised in the last financial year alone. This figure shows that online auctions can be an effective way of recovering costs associated with enforcement activities and helping reduce storage costs for law enforcement agencies.
