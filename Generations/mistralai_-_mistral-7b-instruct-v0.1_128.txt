 It's not uncommon to feel nostalgic about past teammates or players who have left a significant impact on your career, especially when you see them playing for other teams. Terry's admission that he felt lost without Lampard's presence during preseason training is understandable given their long-standing partnership and friendship both on and off the field.

As for his discomfort seeing Lampard in a Sky Blue kit, it's important to remember that while they were teammates at Chelsea, they were also fierce rivals. Lampard was known for his ability to score goals against Terry and his defenders, making him a bitter enemy during their playing days. However, it's worth noting that both players have moved on from their rivalry and have become close friends in recent years.

Overall, it's understandable that Terry might feel a sense of loss or discomfort when seeing Lampard in a Sky Blue kit, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he can't respect his former teammate's choice to play for Manchester City.
