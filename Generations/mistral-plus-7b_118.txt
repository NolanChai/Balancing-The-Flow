Danny Bowman, a 19-year-old student, was struggling with addiction to social media. He was constantly checking his phone for likes and comments, and it was having a negative impact on his mental health. Danny found himself becoming increasingly obsessed with seeking perfection, feeling that he had to always be the best at everything in order to feel good about himself. This obsession eventually led him to take an overdose of sleeping pills at his Newcastle home. Fortunately, he was taken to hospital and received medical treatment for his addiction. With the help of therapy and support from loved ones, Danny is now on the road to recovery.
