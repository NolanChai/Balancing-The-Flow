This is a very personal essay and the author has taken a great deal of courage to share her story with the world. I can understand why she would be reluctant to do so as the subject matter is quite serious but I think that by sharing her experience it will help people who have been through similar things and also raise awareness for others in a positive way.

I am very impressed by how honest this essay is and how much emotion and thought has gone into writing it. It is clear that the author is very passionate about the topic of war, as she speaks with great authority on the subject. I think the use of personal anecdotes to illustrate her points helps to bring the reader in and makes them feel more connected to what she is saying.

The only thing I would say is that at times it feels like there are too many ideas crammed into one paragraph, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. However, this could also be intentional as the essay does have a lot of information packed into it and maybe she wanted to convey how overwhelming and confusing the experience was for her.

Overall I found this essay very engaging and well written. The author has done an excellent job of bringing her story to life and making us feel like we are right there with her experiencing everything firsthand. It is clear that a lot of research went into writing this piece as there are many references to history, literature and culture throughout.
