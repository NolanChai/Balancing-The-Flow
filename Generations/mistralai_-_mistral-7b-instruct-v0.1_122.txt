 NASA had planned to launch the Mars Science Laboratory, also known as the Curiosity Rover, on November 5, but the launch was postponed due to technical difficulties with the spacecraft's power system. The delay will give NASA engineers more time to troubleshoot the issues and ensure a successful launch.

The cost of the mission has also been increasing, and NASA officials said that they are working to stay within the original budget of $1.7 billion. However, some analysts have expressed concerns about whether NASA can afford to keep up with its ambitious space program in the face of budget cuts and funding uncertainty.

At the news conference, NASA administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency will launch a new lunar mission called Artemis III before the end of 2011. The mission will include a robotic rover that will search for signs of past water activity on the moon.
