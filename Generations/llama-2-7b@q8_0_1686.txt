I can understand what you are going through. It is not easy to face the fact that your ability to have a baby will be affected for the rest of your life due to an injury. Your situation seems to be very painful and I hope things get better in time. In this case, the court might find it necessary to grant you compensation to make up for the medical bills and loss of income that comes with being injured while on duty as a doctor. The process might not be easy though especially if there is a lot of negotiation involved between both parties.
