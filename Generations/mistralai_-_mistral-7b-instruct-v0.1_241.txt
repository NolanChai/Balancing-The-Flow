 The rocket launched by North Korea on December 12 reached an altitude of about 4,350 kilometers (2,728 miles), according to the South Korean military. This suggests that the warhead could potentially reach the U.S. West Coast in about eight minutes if it were fired at the right angle and under the right conditions.

South Korean officials have been monitoring North Korea's rocket launches closely and say that this latest launch shows progress in the country's efforts to develop a long-range missile capability. The launch was also a violation of international sanctions imposed on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program.

The United States has stated that it will take strong measures if North Korea continues to conduct ballistic tests and develops a long-range missile capability. However, some experts believe that the country is unlikely to have the technical capabilities to build a reliable missile system capable of reaching the U.S. mainland anytime soon.
