Ebola patient in Lagos makes full recovery after dancing his way out of hospital A Liberian boy who danced his way through the horrifying ordeal of coming down with killer disease Ebola and cheered up his fellow patients has made a full recovery at a hospital in Lagos, Nigeria . The four-year-old was rushed to an isolation ward in the country's most populous city after falling ill while waiting for a flight from Monrovia to his home village, the BBC reported . Despite being given antibiotics as a precautionary measure and placed under quarantine for Ebola treatment, doctors eventually diagnosed him with malaria - a common tropical disease caused by parasites that infects millions of people in Africa each year . He was soon discharged from the hospital after making a full recovery to join his father who had returned home before him and has been quarantined for the past three weeks in their village.
