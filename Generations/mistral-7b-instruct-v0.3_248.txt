 Rick Perry's office for a meeting about an upcoming event in Austin, Texas. Little did he know that this encounter would change the course of his life forever.

Bassett, a former Navy SEAL with a degree in mechanical engineering, was tasked with finding a way to power a large outdoor stage during South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual festival showcasing music, film, and technology. The challenge was significant, as the event's main stage required 300 kilowatts of electricity - enough to power around 200 homes.

With a background in renewable energy and a passion for sustainability, Bassett knew he had an opportunity to make a difference. He proposed using a combination of wind turbines, solar panels, and fuel cells to create a clean and efficient power source for the event. The governor was impressed with his proposal, and Bassett was given the green light to bring his vision to life.

Over the next several months, Bassett and his team worked tirelessly to design and build a portable energy system that could meet the demands of SXSW while minimizing its carbon footprint. They faced numerous obstacles along the way, including limited funding, technical challenges, and skepticism from industry veterans who doubted the viability of their project.

But Bassett was undeterred. He believed in his mission to create a sustainable energy solution for large-scale events and refused to give up. Finally, just weeks before SXSW was set to begin, the team completed their system - a 50-foot tall wind turbine, solar panels, and fuel cells capable of generating over 300 kilowatts of electricity.

The success of the renewable energy system at SXSW caught the attention of event organizers across the country, and Bassett was soon in demand as a consultant for other high-profile events such as the Coachella Music Festival and the Sundance Film Festival. His company, Contour Energy Systems, continued to grow and innovate, developing new technologies that made renewable energy more accessible and affordable.

In 2015, Bassett's work was recognized by President Barack Obama when he awarded him the Champions of Change award for his contributions to clean energy innovation. Today, Contour Energy Systems is a leading provider of sustainable power solutions for large-scale events around the world, demonstrating that it's possible to have fun while making a positive impact on the environment.

Sam Bassett's story serves as an inspiration for anyone who wants to make a difference in the world. By pursuing his passion for sustainability and refusing to back down from challenges, he was able to create a successful business that not only benefits his bottom line but also helps protect our planet for future generations.
