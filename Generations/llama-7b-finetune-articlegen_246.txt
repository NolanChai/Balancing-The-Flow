The shooting happened on Thursday when the woman and her friend were visiting a local orange grove in Florida. It was there that the unnamed 21 year old girl was shot, however by whom is still unknown at this moment. According to officials from the sheriff's office of Orange County in Florida it does not look like charges will be filed against anyone involved due to what is known as "stand your ground" or "no retreat". The law allows those who feel threatened to use lethal force, even if they could have fled. However that is where the problem comes in because how do you tell which case falls under this law and which one does not?
The Florida Law Center claims the law is a form of vigilantism and should be abolished. The man who shot the girl was not present at the time the police arrived on scene, he was out of state, so no further action can be taken against him. What this means for all of us is we have no idea how far people will go to protect themselves. Are you prepared to do whatever it takes?
