- I thought this was very interesting, but as I think about it, this is one of those things where we’ll never know for sure. I believe in the case of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
that there were many people that could have been responsible and because of this, it is nearly impossible to point out exactly which bullet was the one that caused his death. Also, if I remember correctly,
the only evidence we can really see of how much damage a modern bulletproof vest would have done to him, was from a picture taken of his body in the car after the assassination. In this image, his left arm is bent at an odd angle and has no visible injury that I could find, but it is also important
to note that he wasn’t wearing any type of modern bulletproof vest during the shooting and therefore there was nothing for him to be protected from.
