 It seems like you've shared a news headline about a significant United Nations event, specifically a meeting of the UN Security Council heads of state, where President Joe Biden led discussions for the first time. The focus of this meeting was to address the issue of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

This is indeed an important topic as nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are key issues in international relations. The adoption of a resolution on this matter by the UN Security Council, which includes some of the world's most powerful nations, indicates a collective commitment towards maintaining global peace and security.

However, it's important to note that the specific details about the resolution, such as its content and implications, are not provided in your message. For a more comprehensive understanding, I would recommend looking for additional sources or official statements from the United Nations regarding this resolution.
