 A new study has used ancient DNA to analyze a Minoan fresco depicting children boxing and has found no evidence to support the theory that the Minoans were refugees from North Africa. The previous theory suggested that the Minoans were forced to flee their homeland due to invasions and colonization by the Mycenaeans, but this new research suggests that they were a distinct culture with their own unique language and traditions. The study also sheds light on the complex social hierarchy of the Minoan society, with evidence of both high-ranking rulers and lowly slaves in the fresco depiction.
