Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court, under new rules to protect them from a second assault.

The Ministry of Justice has announced that victims who report a crime can request that they do not have to face their attacker in court. It is hoped that the new measures will encourage more people to come forward and reduce the number of cases where victims drop out of the system due to the stress of reliving their ordeal through giving evidence.

Under the plans, prosecutors would be given greater power to make decisions about whether it is appropriate for a victim to give evidence in court. They could decide that the trauma of giving evidence could be avoided by allowing them to give their evidence via video link, or by having their statement read out in court instead.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Victims should not have to go through a second assault on their dignity and emotions when they are already at their most vulnerable.'
