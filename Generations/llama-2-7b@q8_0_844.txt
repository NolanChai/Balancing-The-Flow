<p>In my opinion, this is not a good way to start an article. I think the author should have used the name of the person or people involved in the story instead. This could be done by putting their names after a sentence that begins with "By." The first paragraph could then begin with a statement about what the weight loss expert did for his daughter, followed by information on why she is suing him.</p>
