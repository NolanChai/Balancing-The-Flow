The Daily Mail is the UK's most widely read newspaper. It has over 7.5 million unique visitors to its website and 46 million page views a month. It is also one of the most popular newspapers in the world, with 100 million readers worldwide every day. The Daily Mail is a British tabloid newspaper that was founded in 1896 by Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe).
The Daily Mail has been criticised for its reporting on the murder of Daniel Morgan, the journalist who was killed by his brother-in-law Paul Foot. The newspaper's coverage of the case has been described as "a disgrace" by police commissioners and journalists alike, including Peter Oborne, who said: "The Daily Mail should be ashamed of itself for allowing this story to become an embarrassment to British journalism."
