TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over the show's depiction of homosexuality.

In the now-scrapped episode, Buddy Valastro and his team at Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey create a wedding cake for a gay couple named Danny and Dave. The cake features two grooms dressed as superheroes.

The network has been criticized by conservative groups over its decision to air the episode, which was scheduled to air on June 23rd. TLC released a statement saying: 'We have decided not to air the Cake Boss episode that featured a wedding cake for same-sex marriage. The network and production company are currently in discussion about future episodes of Cake Boss.'
