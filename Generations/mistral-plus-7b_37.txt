Manchester City has ended its pursuit of Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o and will continue to look for a top-quality forward to bolster its squad, a source close to the club confirmed Sunday. The Premier League champions are still keen on Ajax striker Luis Suarez and have also had an offer accepted by Benfica for Brazilian starlet Carlos Tevez. City has already signed Robinho from Real Madrid in a deal worth Â£32.5 million ($60 million) but is still keen to land another top-class forward as the club prepares for its first Champions League campaign.
