Rush Limbaugh has continued his attack on a student he branded a 'slut' for her views on contraception despite being ditched by advertisers and conservative groups, insisting that the backlash against him is a 'threat to free speech'. In an interview with CNN on Monday, Limbaugh claimed that the outcry over his comments about Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke was part of a larger effort to silence those who hold unpopular views. 'This is a threat to free speech,' he said. 'This is a threat to the First Amendment. This is a threat to the ability to have an opinion, to express an opinion, and to be able to defend yourself when people are trying to shut you up.' Limbaugh's comments come as his radio show faces a growing backlash from advertisers and conservative groups, with some calling for him to be fired or boycotted. Despite the criticism, Limbaugh insisted that he has not changed his views and will continue to speak his mind. 'I am not backing down,' he said. 'I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to be bullied.'
