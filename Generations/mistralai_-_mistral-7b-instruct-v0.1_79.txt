 There are conflicting reports about whether the US government has attempted to shut down WikiLeaks. According to CNN, officials at the Pentagon and State Department denied on Friday that they knew of any such efforts or had asked companies to do so. However, earlier this week, unnamed sources told Reuters that the US government had sent letters to Amazon, asking the company to stop hosting the WikiLeaks website.
