The cheerleader who has proudly shared snaps of her posing with dead exotic animals in Africa has reportedly received death threats from Real Housewives of Miami star Joanna Krupa, according to her father. The 26-year-old model and animal rights activist has been subjected to vile abuse since she posted a photo on Instagram of herself posing next to a giraffe that she had shot in South Africa.

Following the controversial post, Joanna Krupa took to Twitter to call her out, writing: “Kendall Jones, You’re a disgusting human being! Shame on you!” After the tweet went viral, the 35-year-old model continued to bash Kendall for her actions.

“I just want people to know that this girl kills animals and posts pictures of it on social media,” she told E! News. “She’s a disgusting person. I don’t even know what to say.”
