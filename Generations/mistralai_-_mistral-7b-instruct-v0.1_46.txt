 The mayor of Naas, a town in County Kildare, Ireland, has resigned and is facing a possible police investigation following controversial comments made about people of black African origin.

Mayor Alan McGrath was criticized for his statement on social media that he would no longer represent "black or Asian" people in the town, citing a "lack of engagement."

The comments sparked widespread outrage and calls for his resignation, with many people condemning what they saw as racist sentiments.

The Irish Times reported that McGrath had resigned after a meeting with local politicians and community leaders to discuss the issue. He is believed to be facing a police investigation for his remarks.

Ireland's national broadcaster RTE said in a statement: "We are deeply disappointed by these comments, which do not reflect the values of diversity and inclusion that we hold dear."

The controversy comes as Ireland has been grappling with issues of racism and discrimination, particularly against people from black and Asian backgrounds.
