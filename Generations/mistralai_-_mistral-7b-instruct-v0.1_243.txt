 The human rights organization accused the rebel group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FDLC) of carrying out the attacks between November and December 2019 in the central region of the country.

The FDLC is one of several armed groups operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been plagued by conflict and violence for decades. The group is believed to be supported by Rwanda and has ties to the genocidal Rwandan Hutus who fled to Congo after the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Human Rights Watch said that its researchers interviewed survivors and witnesses of the attacks, who described how the FDLC targeted villages in the region, looting and burning homes, and killing civilians, including women and children.

"The FDLC's brutal attacks on civilians are a horrific reminder of the suffering endured by people caught up in the ongoing conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo," said Jean-Philippe Fichet, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "These attacks must be condemned and the perpetrators held accountable."

The organization called on the international community to increase pressure on the Congolese government to address the root causes of the conflict, including political instability, corruption, and economic exploitation, and to provide greater support to efforts to disarm rebel groups and promote peace.
