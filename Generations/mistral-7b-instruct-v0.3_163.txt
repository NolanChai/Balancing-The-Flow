 It sounds like you're referring to escargot, which is indeed a French delicacy that has gained popularity in other parts of the world. However, I must clarify that when you mention snails "crawling their way across the channel," it might create some confusion as the English Channel separates England and France, not England and any other country where escargot might be popular. If you were referring to an increase in actual snail populations or the spread of a specific variety of edible snails in England, please provide more context for a more accurate response.
