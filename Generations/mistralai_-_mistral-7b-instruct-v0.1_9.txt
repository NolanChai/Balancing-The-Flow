 It is not uncommon for workers to strike something significant while excavating, particularly in areas with known geological formations or previous construction activity. In this case, it could be anything from old utility lines to remnants of a previous structure. It would be important for the workers and their superiors to take the necessary precautions to ensure everyone's safety and that any potential hazards are properly addressed before continuing with the project.
