 Jonathan Burrows, a former finance worker who admitted to evading train fares and repaid £43,000, has been banned from working in the financial industry. The ban was imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) following an investigation into his conduct while employed at JP Morgan.

Burrows, a 32-year-old from London, used a fake Oyster card and a refund claim to obtain more than £40,000 in discounted fares on the London Underground between January 2017 and August 2018. He admitted his guilt after being confronted with evidence by the FCA and paid back the money in full.

However, the FCA's investigation found that Burrows had failed to act with integrity and honesty while working in the financial industry. He had not declared his misconduct to his employer at the time and had also lied about his qualifications when applying for a role with another financial institution.

As a result, the FCA has banned Burrows from working in any capacity in the financial industry. The ban will last for five years from the date of his conviction.
