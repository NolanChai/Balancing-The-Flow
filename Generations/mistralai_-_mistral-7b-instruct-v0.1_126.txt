 It's important to note that "free" cash doesn't necessarily mean that it is immediately available for transfers. The amount includes profits from sales and net income, but also accounts for payments such as player salaries and other operating expenses. Additionally, the club may have plans to reinvest some of this money in infrastructure or long-term development projects, which could impact its availability for transfer spending. However, it does suggest that Arsenal has a strong financial position and may be able to make significant investments in the squad if they choose to do so.
