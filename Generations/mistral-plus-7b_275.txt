Two weeks after she was fitted for a prosthetic eye, model and fashion blogger Lauren Scruggs is picking up where she left off, and even going back to work as a model. The 23-year old Scruggs lost her right hand and eye on December 3 when the small plane she and her boyfriend were riding in crashed into power lines.

The accident happened after the couple took off from Addison Airport in Texas to take pictures of Christmas lights. Scruggs was struck by a propeller blade after she opened the door to the aircraft. The injury led to the loss of her right hand, and also resulted in severe damage to her face and eye. She spent nearly two weeks in the hospital before undergoing surgery to remove her right eye.

Scruggs recently began wearing a prosthetic eye and is now working hard to get back on her feet. Her first modeling job since the accident was for an online company called Bluefly. She also recently filmed a video for Vogue.com in which she discusses her recovery.
