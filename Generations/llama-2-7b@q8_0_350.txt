Instagram, one of the most popular mobile apps out there, has recently announced a new feature called Stories that allows users to post photos for 24-hours. They are then posted in reverse chronological order, meaning you will only see what is recently published by your followers. I am personally excited about this addition because it means that Instagram is no longer just a way to share photos with friends and family but also as a medium of self-expression and communication with the public at large.

As a digital marketer, I understand how important it is for companies to have an online presence where their products or services are promoted through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc., which is why many brands have jumped on board by creating accounts on these sites so they can share content with potential customers in real-time rather than waiting until after the fact when itâ€™s too late
