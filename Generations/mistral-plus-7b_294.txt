Colonel Gaddafi’s fugitive son Saif al-Islam is trying to reach a safe haven in Zimbabwe while also negotiating to surrender, officials have said. The Libyan leader’s youngest son and one of his most powerful lieutenants has reportedly been offered asylum by the government of President Robert Mugabe. It was not clear if the offer had been accepted.

According to reports, a Zimbabwean delegation met with Saif al-Islam in the Nafusa mountains region in western Libya on Thursday and has promised him safe passage out of the country if he agrees to surrender. The country is reportedly considering granting him asylum.

Saif al-Islam was captured by revolutionary fighters last week after a four-month manhunt following his father’s death in October. He was taken to Misrata, the city that had led the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi, and then transferred to the capital Tripoli where he is being held at an undisclosed location.

On Friday, Saif al-Islam was reportedly moved again to a new prison in southern Libya, possibly to prevent him from meeting with his father’s former supporters who are still loyal to the regime.
