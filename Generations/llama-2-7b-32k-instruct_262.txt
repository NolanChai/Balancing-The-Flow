Washington (CNN) -- A protester was fatally shot by a law enforcement officer Wednesday night in Ferguson, Missouri, following weeks of sometimes violent unrest in the St. Louis suburb, authorities said.
A CNN crew witnessed police officers firing weapons into a crowd near the burning QuikTrip gas station. Protesters were seen throwing rocks and bottles at the officers who returned fire with tear gas and bullets. One protester was seen being carried away on a stretcher as another threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the direction of an officer.
The officer-involved shooting is under investigation by the Justice Department's civil rights division, according to a U.S. government official with knowledge of the probe. The FBI and the St. Louis County Police Department are also investigating, according to officials.
Washington (CNN) -- A protester was fatally shot by a law enforcement officer Wednesday night in Ferguson, Missouri, following weeks of sometimes violent unrest in the St. Louis suburb, authorities said.
A CNN crew witnessed police officers firing weapons into a crowd near the burning QuikTrip gas station. Protesters were seen throwing rocks and bottles at the officers who returned fire with tear gas and bullets. One protester was seen being carried away on a stretcher as another threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the direction of an officer.
The officer-involved shooting is under investigation by the Justice Department's civil rights division, according to a U.S. government official with knowledge of the probe. The FBI and the St. Louis County Police Department are also investigating, according to officials.
The St. Louis County Police Department has identified the slain protester as 18-year-old Michael Brown, who lived in nearby Jennings, Missouri. Ferguson is a predominantly African American city that was more than two thirds white at the last census. The teen had no known criminal record, authorities said.
St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters early Thursday morning that Brown was shot in his back and left arm by an officer responding to a police call of shots fired. He added that Brown may have been trying to take the officer's gun when he was killed, but said they had not yet determined how the shooting occurred.
Another officer who was present at the scene told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Brown was "charging" toward another officer, whose weapon discharged after Brown grabbed it. The police chief did not immediately respond to CNN's questions about whether witness accounts were contradictory or whether there had been any physical altercation between officers and protesters before shots were fired.
Brown's death comes amid three weeks of unrest in Ferguson, sparked by the August 9 shooting death of 18-year-old black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer named Darren Wilson. The incident set off protests and clashes between residents and law enforcement officers that have sometimes turned violent.
Another person was shot Wednesday night, but the condition of that victim is unknown, Belmar said. He did not say how many people were shot during the incident. A witness told CNN that there were at least two shooting victims who were taken to the hospital with injuries. Another eyewitness account reported three wounded protesters, including an off-duty police officer who was hit in his arm by gunfire.
The police chief said he would not identify the officer involved in Wednesday night's fatal shooting because the man was not yet a suspect or target of the investigation. But he described him as an 11-year veteran of the department who had been assigned to Ferguson since late January, and that he knew Brown by name and had spoken with him on multiple occasions.
The officer is currently being debriefed by authorities, Belmar said. It was unclear whether he would be suspended or reassigned in the meantime.
St. Louis County Executive Charles Jaco told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the police department has "a lot of questions" about the shooting and promised an independent investigation into the incident. He said witnesses who had been interviewed described a protester throwing a Molotov cocktail at officers before shots were fired, but added that they did not see Brown trying to take the officer's gun as reported by Belmar.
"We don't know if there was any altercation or conversation," Jaco said. "But it is absolutely clear that he was shot in the back."
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for Brown and his family Wednesday night, saying they deserve answers about what happened to their loved one.
"I've made it clear that this tragedy must be fully investigated," said the President, who has been criticized by some activists for not yet speaking directly with protesters in Ferguson. "And those responsible need to be held fully accountable."
The Justice Department is sending a team of law enforcement and community experts to help investigate Brown's death. They will work closely with the St. Louis County Police Department, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and the FBI, officials said. The team includes a civil rights division lawyer, an attorney from the department's Community Relations Service, two crime scene investigators, and representatives of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Protective Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service.
Obama said he has asked Attorney General Eric Holder to send a personal representative from the Justice Department's civil rights division to Ferguson as well to offer assistance in addressing community concerns about the police shooting.
"This is not an isolated incident," Obama told reporters earlier this month when talking about protests sparked by Brown's death. "There are too many examples of African American men being shot and killed or injured for reasons that don't have anything to do with committing any crime."
Holder said last week that the Justice Department would investigate whether racial bias was a factor in Ferguson, but he didn't say if it would be considered a hate crime. The FBI will also investigate the incident as well, and authorities haven't identified the officer involved in Brown's shooting yet
