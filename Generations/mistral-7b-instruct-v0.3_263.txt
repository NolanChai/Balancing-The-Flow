 The article suggests that the increased desire for Bloody Marys and tomato juice during flights could be due to a combination of factors:

1. Dehydration: Airplane cabins are often dry due to recirculated air, leading to dehydration. Both tomato juice and Bloody Marys are hydrating due to their high water content and can help combat this effect.

2. Alcohol: Many flights offer free alcoholic beverages, and the stress of travel might lead some passengers to drink more than they usually would. Bloody Marys, being a mix of tomato juice and alcohol, may become an attractive choice.

3. Familiarity: The routine and predictability of air travel can make certain drinks seem more comforting or familiar. For some people, ordering a Bloody Mary or tomato juice on a plane might be a habit formed over many flights.

4. Sensory experience: The salty, savory taste of Bloody Marys and tomato juice can help stimulate the senses, which might be appreciated during long flights where other sensory experiences are limited.

5. Reduced taste perception: Research has shown that our sense of taste can be dulled at high altitudes due to changes in air pressure. The strong flavors in a Bloody Mary or tomato juice might be more appealing when taste perception is reduced.
