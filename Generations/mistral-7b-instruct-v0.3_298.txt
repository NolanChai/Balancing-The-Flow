 It seems that the news you've shared pertains to football transfers, specifically regarding Manchester United and Andreas Pereira. If I understand correctly, there might be a concern about losing Pereira, who has been a part of the Brazil Under-20 team, due to alleged unsuccessful negotiations for a new contract at Manchester United.

This scenario is not uncommon in football, where players' contracts expire and teams risk losing their talents if they fail to agree on terms for an extension. In this case, Pereira's potential departure could be significant as he has been a part of the United squad since 2011 when he joined their academy.

As a responsible assistant, I would suggest that Manchester United should prioritize addressing this situation promptly to ensure they can retain such promising young talent. Negotiations might involve discussions about salary, role within the team, and other terms beneficial for both parties. In doing so, they can minimize the risk of losing valuable players like Pereira.

However, it's essential to remember that I am an AI model and do not have access to real-time information or specific details about ongoing negotiations between Manchester United and Andreas Pereira.
