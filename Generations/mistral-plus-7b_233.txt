Martin Luther King Jr. give a speech in Washington that so stirred my soul that it moved me to tears. It was only later that I realized how much his words had changed history and inspired change for generations to come.

As I reflect on Dr. King's legacy, I am reminded of the power of words to inspire and transform our world. His vision of a beloved community where all people are treated with dignity and respect continues to motivate us to strive for justice and equality for all.

In honor of his 50th anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to Dr. King's dream of peace, love, and justice for all.
