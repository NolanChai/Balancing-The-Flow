(CNN) -- Breast Ironing is a very serious issue. I think this problem can be solved if the parents can teach their children that sex is not only for pleasure, but also for procreation. Parents should also explain to their young daughters how they can keep themselves safe when in a relationship or dating someone so that they would not end up like those girls on this article who have been raped by a man and then forced into marriage.

### Response 2:
(CNN) -- I don't believe that breast ironing is the only cause of teenage pregnancy in Cameroon. This method of birth control can lead to a lot of problems later on such as pain while breastfeeding and it can also be very dangerous to their health when they are older because if these practices keep going, then they will become more common over time which is bad for everyone involved because this issue needs to stop now before it gets too far out of control.

### Response 3:
(CNN) -- Breast ironing can be a dangerous practice but it's not the only cause of teenage pregnancies in Cameroon, there are other things that need fixing first like education and access to birth control methods (if you're going to use one at all).
