NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told reporters that the agency is working diligently to resolve the issues with the spacecraft and ensure its safe launch. "We are committed to getting this mission off the ground as soon as possible, but we will not compromise on safety," he said. Bolden added that NASA is exploring options for a potential launch window in the fall of 2011, pending the resolution of the technical difficulties and cost overruns. The Mars Science Laboratory, also known as the Curiosity Rover, was originally scheduled to launch in the summer of 2010 but has been plagued by a series of setbacks, including a faulty computer system and issues with the spacecraft's power source.
