To avoid the cost of purchasing a boat, a new business has been established in London which offers clients their own personalised power boats on London's famous River Thames. The company, called 'BoatLagoon', was founded by entrepreneur Shane O'Sullivan.

The client pays an hourly rate for the service and is then able to pick up their boat from one of the company's five locations along the river.

"It's a great way to see the city," said O'Sullivan, who has been operating the business since last summer. "You can do it on a day trip or even for longer trips to Brighton or Paris."

The boats are powered by environmentally friendly engines that produce fewer emissions than traditional petrol-powered boats and the company provides all necessary safety equipment.

O'Sullivan said he was inspired to launch BoatLagoon after his own experience of buying a boat in London. "When I bought my first boat, it wasn't easy," he said. "I had to find the right one, then pay for storage and insurance." He added that "it can be quite a stressful process."
