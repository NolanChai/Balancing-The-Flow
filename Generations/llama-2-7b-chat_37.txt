Manchester City's pursuit of a world-class striker has been ongoing for several transfer windows now, and it seems that they are not willing to give up on their quest for the perfect goal-scorer anytime soon. With their recent decision to end their interest in Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o, the Citizens will now turn their attention to other potential targets, including Juventus's Mario Mandzukic and Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski.
According to sources close to the club, City's management is determined to bring in a proven goalscorer to complement their existing attacking talent, which includes Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne, and Leroy Sane. The club's owners are willing to spend big to achieve this goal, with reports suggesting that they are prepared to break the bank to secure the services of one of these highly-regarded strikers.
Meanwhile, Eto'o has been linked with a move away from Barcelona in recent weeks, with several clubs expressing interest in his signature. However, it remains to be seen where the Cameroon international will end up, as he continues to weigh up his options and decide on his next move.
