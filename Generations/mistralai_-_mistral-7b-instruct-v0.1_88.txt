The man, named only as "Mr Chan" in court, was caught by police officers on the night of February 18 after allegedly inciting others to join the protest march against Beijing's proposed electoral reforms.

During the march, Mr Chan allegedly whistled in the face of the officers, prompting them to arrest him. He was later released but was then taken back into custody and charged with public order offenses.

In court today, the magistrate remanded Mr Chan in custody until his next hearing on April 17.

The incident sparked controversy, with some protesters praising the man's bravery, while others criticized him for distracting attention away from the main issues of the protest.
