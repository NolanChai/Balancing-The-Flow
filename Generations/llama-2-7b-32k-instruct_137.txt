The group was quarantined after six people tested positive for H1N1, including two employees and four guests from mainland China. The company did not say how long the guests had been in Hong Kong. 

The hotel issued an apology on its website, saying it should have acted with greater sensitivity. It also apologized to anyone who was inconvenienced by the quarantine.
