There was a time when films stood little chance of success unless there was something special about them. The film industry was filled with glamour and movies were made for the screen rather than to be sold on DVD or through downloads. They had to tell an interesting story, have excellent photography and good acting - otherwise they would not succeed. There are still films that meet these criteria but sadly they are few and far between and if you don't know where to look then it can be difficult to find them.
