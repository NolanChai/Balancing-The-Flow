Players from Boston College, University of Missouri and San Diego State sat or kneeled during pregame introductions as a statement against racial inequality in American society.

The gesture is reminiscent of Colin Kaepernick's protest that began last year when he refused to stand for the national anthem as quarterback of the 49ers, who play their home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, where San Diego State played Boston College on Saturday.

Kneeling became a common form of protest after President Donald Trump said players were being "son of bitches" for kneeling during the anthem. In recent weeks, the gesture has spread to other sports.

Ahead of his team's game against Boston College, Missouri defensive end Gus Logue posted on social media that he and teammate Deion Brock planned to kneel together before kickoff.

"We both feel like we should take a stand with our brothers around the country who are being treated unjustly," Logue wrote on Twitter. "The statement we want to make is that Black Lives Matter."

In addition to Boston College and Missouri, San Diego State played at Utah State in Logan, where players also kneeled during pregame introductions.

At Utah State, a group of black athletes gathered before kickoff for a prayer circle, which included praying for the victims of recent shootings, including those killed in a shooting earlier this month at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. They also prayed that they could continue to make their community proud and be "agents of change," according to photos posted on social media by the Utah State football team's Twitter account.

On Friday night before Boston College played at Missouri, black student-athletes gathered in Columbia, Missouri for a prayer circle.

A photo of players from the Missouri Tigers kneeling during the anthem was tweeted and retweeted hundreds of times on Saturday.

"We support each other," Logue said Saturday after Boston College's 38-31 loss to Missouri. "We are united."

Logue said he did not expect the protest would be so widely viewed, but that was OK by him.

"I knew this was a big deal when I decided to kneel," Logue said. "I didn't expect it to be a nationwide trend . ... This is something bigger than just Missouri."

Logue and Brock were joined on the field by three other black players at Missouri -- redshirt freshman safety Darius Robinson, redshirt junior cornerback Amin Nasair and junior defensive end Tyler Clark. Boston College did not have any players kneel during its pregame introductions against Missouri.

Boston College coach Steve Addazio declined to address the protest before the game. After his team's loss, he said that while he didn't like the protest, he supported the players' right to do whatever they want. He also criticized the NCAA and ESPN for putting a mic on Kaepernick when he was kneeling during an NFL preseason game last summer.

"We just felt it was necessary as African-American football players to let our voice be heard," Missouri defensive lineman Darius Robinson said after the game. "We all have different ways of protesting and showing out."

Boston College's coaches met with their players before the game, but Addazio declined to discuss what they said.

"I don't want to put that on them," he said. "They'll handle it how they choose. If you guys think it was a distraction, then I apologize."

Addazio also did not like that players at Missouri and Utah State were kneeling during pregame introductions because of the effect it had on their fans, saying "they didn't come to watch an anthem."

"I don't like that," Addazio said. "That wasn't a decision we made as coaches or players. That was a decision those programs and kids made for themselves."

Addazio also said he thought there were other ways for athletes to protest. He gave the example of former Boston College basketball player Katie Krznaric, who wore "Black Lives Matter" shirts in her final game at Conte Forum on February 12 against Villanova.

"I think that's a much more respectful way," Addazio said.

Missouri coach Barry Odom said he supported his players and had not planned the protest, but was proud of them. He said the team's prayers were "the most important thing we could do."

In recent weeks, several college athletic programs have banned their players from kneeling during pregame introductions as a result of Kaepernick's protest, which has sparked national conversation about race and police brutality in America.

On Friday, Utah State coach Matt Wells banned his team from kneeling during the anthem, saying he did not want to make his players a target for others who oppose their decision or have them disrespect the flag.

"My concern is our kids' safety," Wells said at Utah State on Friday. "We have had some death threats."

Missouri defensive coordinator Ryan Walters was asked if he would make his players stand during the anthem, as several coaches have done in recent weeks. He replied: "I don't want to get into that now. I think it has run its course right now."

As for Boston College, Addazio declined to say whether players would be penalized if they kneeled during pregame introductions going forward.

"We will handle any infraction if there is one," he said. "That's not something we have decided yet as a staff or team."

Logue, who also played defensive end at Missouri from 2014 to 2017, said it was important for him and his teammates to protest.

"I didn't want the kids in our country to think that their voices don't matter," Logue said. "The most important thing we wanted to do is make sure our voices were heard."

Boston College defensive coordinator Aaron Moorehead did not see his players kneeling before the game, but was disappointed they did not show respect to the flag and country during pregame introductions. He also criticized the Missouri coaches for encouraging their team to protest in such a way.

"I'm disappointed," he said after the game. "But I also understand why guys are doing it."

Addazio was asked if he would consider meeting with his players to talk about race relations, but he did not respond. He also was not interested in discussing whether Boston College and Missouri will be penalized by the NCAA for their players' protest during pregame introductions.

"We didn't discuss that," Addazio said after the game. "It's an ongoing conversation right now."

Boston College senior defensive tackle Aaron Monteiro, who is white, criticized his teammates for kneeling before their game at Missouri and said he was ashamed of them.

"I think it was a complete disrespect to our country," he said. "It's something that I don't believe in."

Monteiro said he did not know how many players on his team planned to kneel, but when they arrived at Missouri for the game, "you could feel there were going to be some protesting." He also said he felt disrespected by their decision.

"I don't think it was a protest of racism," Monteiro said. "It was more just disrespecting our country and what we stand for."

Monteiro, who said he is a graduate assistant on the team, added that if his teammates planned to kneel before games in the future, he would not play with them.

"I wouldn't play with them anymore," Monteiro said. "I love those guys -- they are my brothers and teammates -- but I don't think it was a protest of racism . ... I just think it was disrespectful."

Boston College is 2-6 on the season, while Missouri is 3-4 after its victory Saturday.

"We got better today," Logue said. "I feel like we will get better next week and win the rest of our games."

Ahead of Utah State's game against San Diego State, defensive lineman Logan Paulson told reporters that he and his teammates planned to kneel during pregame introductions as a protest. The Aggies did not kneel, but several players stayed in the locker room for their pregame prayer circle instead of coming out on the field.

"We'll do things how we feel is right," Utah State coach Matt Wells said Friday before his team played San Diego State. "This isn't a distraction to us."

San Diego State defensive tackle Alen Lazard, who was not with the Aztecs on their trip to Logan, tweeted Saturday that he and some of his teammates planned to kneel during pregame introductions against Utah State. He also critic
