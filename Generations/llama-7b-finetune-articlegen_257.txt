I was a drug-sniffer who became a junkie! Police officer got hooked on heroin after posing as an addict for undercover operations By . Daily Mail Report . A drugs squad officer became hooked on heroin after posing as an addict for undercover operations. Robert Carroll, 40,  who lives in Huddersfield, claimed he 'inhaled fumes' - a mixture of tobacco and cannabis - at the height of his addiction. And the father-of-one also said he was supplied with the drug from dealers working on behalf of police officers in West Yorkshire. He revealed that one officer asked him for a £15,000 'gratuity' so that he could continue to get hold of heroin. Mr Carroll has since turned his life around and is now a fully-fledged drug squad sergeant, helping to put other dealers behind bars. He said: 'It was the worst period in my life. I didn't know where it would end - but thankfully for me, I got clean.' Mr Carroll began working for West Yorkshire Police in 1992 and quickly realised his skills could be of use to undercover operations. The officer was eventually promoted to sergeant in the drugs squad and has worked on many high-profile cases including Operation Stargate.

I was on the street as much as the dealers were. The line between cop and criminal is very thin, especially in an operation like that' . The officer said he went to extraordinary lengths to conceal his addiction from colleagues at the force. Mr Carroll, who lives with his wife Liz and daughter Rachel, 24, added: 'I would go for weeks on end without telling my family - I never wanted them to see me like that. 'I was trying to live two different lives - but it got to a point where I couldn't hide what was going on anymore.' Mr Carroll said he began taking heroin during the early 90s and soon became addicted. He explained: 'I had been doing covert operations for years but there came a time when you needed to take a break from the job - sometimes that was hard to do if you were addicted, and that was certainly true of me.' The officer revealed he eventually agreed to give up drugs for good after his wife confronted him with his problem. He said: 'I'd never thought I would become an addict but it happened - I was a cop on the edge.' Mr Carroll has since turned his life around and is now a fully-fledged drug squad sergeant, helping to put other dealers behind bars (file picture) He also claimed he received 'protection' from corrupt officers during his addiction. But Mr Carroll insisted that he was never involved in any of the criminality he came across while undercover. He said: 'I would go for weeks on end without telling my family - I never wanted them to see me like that. 'I was trying to live two different lives - but it got to a point where I couldn't hide what was going on anymore' . The officer recalled one occasion when he took heroin in the back of a police car before returning to work at West Yorkshire Police headquarters. He added: 'It was a bad experience - I wasn't allowed to drive, and so I had to go home on public transport which meant walking around Huddersfield High Street for about an hour. 'The line between cop and criminal is very thin, especially in an operation like that.' Mr Carroll went on to reveal how he was offered £15,000 by a West Yorkshire officer who worked as a dealer. He said: 'I was doing undercover work when I found out - it was one of the guys from my team who had been supplying me with heroin.' The officer continued working for West Yorkshire Police but became concerned about his addiction after he began suffering withdrawal symptoms. He added: 'It was really tough - and there were a lot of sleepless nights. I couldn't get off the drugs - it was like a horrible mental prison.'

He added: 'I've lost thousands and thousands of pounds - it's not just the drug dealers who get rich from that kind of activity.' And the father-of-one also revealed how he was asked by a West Yorkshire officer working in the drugs squad for a £15,000 'gratuity'.

I couldn't get off the drugs - it was like a horrible mental prison' He recalled: 'I remember walking into his office one morning, and he asked me if we could talk to each other in private. He then asked for £15,000 - it would have been paid into my account so that I could continue using the drugs.' Mr Carroll continued working for West Yorkshire Police but became concerned about his addiction after he began suffering withdrawal symptoms (file picture) The officer went on to reveal how one of his colleagues had become addicted to heroin while working undercover. He said: 'One day I got a phone call from him saying that he was an addict - it wasn't easy for either of us.' Mr Carroll explained: 'We didn't use the same dealers so we were never in any danger, and as far as I know no other officers ever became hooked on drugs because of what they were doing. 'There is a line between cop and criminal - but it isn't always easy to tell where that line should be.'

'It got to the stage where I couldn't get off it - and there wasn't any point because I would have had to start all over again.' Mr Carroll also revealed how he became an addict while working for Operation Stargate, the force's major investigation into a network of drug dealers operating in Huddersfield. He said: 'It was a case where we were going undercover - and it led me down that road, but I don't think anyone else would have been able to do what I did because I had experience.'

He said: 'I'm not proud of what I did - but I am thankful for what happened. It helped me learn about the problem.' And Mr Carroll added that he was able to move on from his problems by setting up a support network in Huddersfield with other former addicts. The officer said: 'There are still times when I feel scared, but it's getting easier all the time. 'It might sound odd but I would definitely recommend getting involved with the work of Hope - because they have helped so many people like me.' West Yorkshire Police said it was unable to comment on individual cases. But a spokeswoman added: 'The safety and welfare of officers remains paramount to us as we try to keep them safe when carrying out their duties in some difficult situations. 'All officers who work undercover are required to follow strict guidelines.' Mr Carroll said he had been left out of pocket after handing over money to police officers who promised him drugs .
