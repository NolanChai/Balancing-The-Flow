 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has attributed the 2013 UPS cargo plane crash in Alabama to pilot error, as reported by CNN. However, certain NTSB members criticized UPS for not implementing measures that could have potentially prevented the tragic incident. This crash resulted in the deaths of both pilots on board. The investigation revealed that the pilots failed to follow proper procedures during their approach to land, leading to the plane's collision with a tree and subsequent crash. Despite the pilot error, the criticism directed towards UPS suggests that the company could have taken additional precautions to enhance safety in their operations.
