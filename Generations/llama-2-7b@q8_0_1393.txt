1. Write a Python program which takes a text file containing words (as sentences) from an online article of your choice and classifies those words as belonging to one of two classes, "terror" or "non-terror". You may use any sources you like for the training set but you must be careful that each word in the sentence is only counted once.
2. If you have more than 30% of your words classified as terror then print a message that the author does not write well and you are not convinced the article is accurate.
3. If the article has no terror words (<30%) then print a message stating that you are pleased with the author's writing style and feel confident that the article reflects current events accurately.
