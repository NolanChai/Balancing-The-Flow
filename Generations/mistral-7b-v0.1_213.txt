### Discussion:
* What is the significance of this visual record? Why should we care about its existence, or the fact that we have it?
    * A visual record can help us understand events better than just written accounts.
    * We are able to see how the event unfolds and how people reacted in real time.
* What is the significance of the fact that there is only one such film? Is this good or bad?
    * It's not good because it means we have a limited amount of information about what happened.
    * It's also not bad because it means we can focus on one film and not get overwhelmed by too much information.
* What is the significance of the fact that this visual record was made by an amateur? How does this change our perception of the event?
    * An amateur is someone who doesn't have a professional background in filmmaking. They are usually hobbyists or people who just like to make films for fun.
    * When you look at a film made by an amateur, you can see that they didn't know what they were doing and made mistakes along the way. This changes our perception of how seriously they took their job and makes us question whether they really understood what was happening during the event they filmed.
* What is the significance of the fact that this visual record was made by an amateur? How does this change our perception of the event?
    * It shows that anyone can make a film, even if they don't have any training or experience in filmmaking.
    * It also shows how important it is to document events as they happen, because you never know when something might happen that will be important later on down the line.
