As part of the instruction, we were asked to design a poster for Kelly and her son. I did my own research on Kelly and found out that she was convicted of helping her boyfriend murder her husband in 1997. She had been married before, but left him because he abused her. I thought it was interesting that she didn't get into trouble until she got a man who abused her as well. The fact that the boyfriend murdered Kelly's husband instead of her makes me think this relationship was an escape for her from her past.

I made this poster to show Kelly and her son, Brandon, that she isn't forgotten about. She is loved by many people and has had a major impact on everyone who knows her story. I hope that this poster will inspire others to also share their love and support for Kelly so that she can know how much she is loved and cared for before her final moments.
