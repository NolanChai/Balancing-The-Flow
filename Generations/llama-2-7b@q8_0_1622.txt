The United States is supporting Iran because Iran has made it clear that they would like to destroy the Islamic State (IS). There is no evidence, however, of any joint efforts by the U.S. and Iran to fight against IS. Instead, there is a growing body of evidence showing that Iranâ€™s role in fighting against IS has been minimal at best. The U.S. and Iran are on different sides when it comes to Syria. In fact, they were both funding opposition groups that were fighting one another in the country.
