The 19-year-old midfielder has been a mainstay for Brazil in the 2015 U-20 World Cup, and was linked to Tottenham Hotspur as well as United before the tournament started.

Now he will be leaving Brazil on Friday without an agreement on his future. The Manchester club failed to open talks with him after the final group stage match against Senegal, and now looks like a lost cause for the Premier League outfit.

It is unclear if the player has other suitors waiting, but Pereira did not hide his desire to join United in an interview with Brazilian media last month . "I would say it's pretty obvious that I am interested (in moving)," he told Sport TV. "There are many teams I want to go to and Manchester is one of them."

Pereira has been a regular for Brazil's U-20 national team since 2013, when coach Carlos Amadeu made him his starting midfielder in the final World Cup qualifier against Venezuela. He played all 90 minutes that day and was instrumental in Brazil securing their ticket to Turkey .

"I think he's a very talented player," Amadeu told Sport TV about Pereira, "he is technically good, he can do many things, he can create, dribble, pass, shoot...he's a complete midfielder and I expect him to keep improving."

Pereira made 13 appearances in the Brazilian league with Flamengo this season but failed to score or assist, which may have played into United's decision not to sign him. In the same interview Pereira admitted he was aware of his poor stats and aimed to improve them . "This is something that worries me, that I don't get results," said Pereira, who has been with Flamengo since 2013 but played for six other teams before it, including Vasco da Gama.

United did sign another Brazilian, Joao Mario, earlier this year and he made his debut against Swansea City in the FA Cup semi-final . The Red Devils also have other Brazilian players such as midfielder Fred who has been linked with a move away from the club since Louis van Gaal's appointment.

United is also interested in signing two more Brazilians, Lucas Moura and Wendell Lira, both of whom are expected to be sold by Sao Paulo this summer . While Pereira is still young, his experience has shown he can handle the pressure at the international level and can play with some of Brazil's biggest names.
