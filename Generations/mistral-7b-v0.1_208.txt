In the past few years the climate has been warming up. It's not just due to global warming, but also because the sun is getting hotter and hotter. In the future it will probably be even hotter, but for now we are in an interglacial period where temperatures are rising.

I think there are many reasons why temperatures are rising, but I'm not sure if global warming is one of them. There could be other factors that contribute to this rise in temperature such as human activity or even natural disasters.
