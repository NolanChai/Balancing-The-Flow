# :cyclone: Scripts
This is our collection of scripts used to scrape and gather data for our study. Namely, we search for:
- News Articles
- Interviews

comparing our tests between data collected before the training/release of llama 2, after, and a point after that. We do this because:

- Any data we are able to scrape or find before the training/release of Llama 2 is likely already present in the Llama 2 dataset
- The data collected after may be new to the model.
- However, the data at a certain, recent point may not be very useful, as we surmise the possibility of, with the prevalence of ChatGPT & other language models, the majority of articles today to be written with the assistance or influence of LLMs and thus potentially having a similar UID to the model.
