      "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

      "Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .\n",

      "MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. \"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,\" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. \"I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down.\" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. \"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones.\"  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. \"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,\" Babineau said. \"It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies.\" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. \"I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,\" he said. \"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. \"I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos.\" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. \"I just knew what I had to do at the moment.\" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. \"You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,\" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. \"I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,\" she told AP. \"It's really very surreal.\" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: \"On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. \"My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive.\"  See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's \"American Morning\" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. \"I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,\" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, \"I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' \" he said. E-mail to a friend .\n",

      "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and \"none appeared worrisome,\" a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used \"monitored anesthesia care,\" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver.  Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer » . \"The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,\" Snow said. The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50. E-mail to a friend .\n",

      "(CNN)  -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\" The suspension makes \"a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement.  Watch what led to Vick's suspension » . Goodell said the Falcons could \"assert any claims or remedies\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of \"Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture\" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, \"full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,\" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. \"The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,\" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. \"Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,\" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. \"Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' \" Vick also agreed that \"collective efforts\" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. \"Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. \"Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,\" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.  See a timeline of the case against Vick » . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,\" Toobin said Friday. \"The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' \" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to \"make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\" with the dogs that are being held by the government. \"Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals.\" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to \"arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property.\" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to \"approximately\" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen \"a statement of facts\" in the case.  E-mail to a friend .

      "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Youssif held his sister's hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story. Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\" he said. \"We knew there was kindness out there.\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \"no stone unturned\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring » . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \"general donation\" area that is marked \"Youssif's fund.\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\" She added, \"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \"I will do anything for Youssif,\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \"Our child is everything.\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend . CNN.com senior producer Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.\n",

      "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. \"People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,\" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. \"They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path.\" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. \"I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother,\" she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. \"No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!\"  Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to \"save my child\" » . Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. \"At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough,\" she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, \"My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing.\" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. \"They took advantage of me,\" she says softly. \"At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it.\" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. \"It's increasing,\" Suha says. \"I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things.\" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. \"At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,\" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. \"It's a taboo that no one is speaking about.\" She adds, \"There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists.\" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. \"Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide\" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, \"come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this.\" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: \"She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners.\" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. \"They took this path but they are not pleased,\" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. \"Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live.\" But she says, \"I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this.\" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. \"It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,\" she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. \"I lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie.\" E-mail to a friend .\n",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- A key rebel commander and fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment was killed over the weekend in an air attack on a guerrilla encampment, the Colombian military said Monday. Alleged cocaine trafficker and FARC rebel Tomas Medina Caracas in an Interpol photo. Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as \"El Negro Acacio,\" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. \"After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,\" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. \"The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself.\" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia.

      "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House press secretary Tony Snow, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino, the White House announced Friday. White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \"sadly accept\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving » . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \"He'll battle cancer and win,\" Bush said, \"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \"and that loan is now gone.\" \"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \"Fox News Sunday\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \"The Tony Snow Show\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \"I'm also putting on weight again,\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \"I actually feel very good about\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment. E-mail to a friend .\n",

      "(CNN) -- Police and FBI agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket launcher tube on the front lawn of a Jersey City, New Jersey, home, FBI spokesman Sean Quinn said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Friday morning, police said. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at the 754th Ordnance Company, an explosive ordnance disposal unit, at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Army officials said. The launcher \"is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety,\" police said, adding there was no indication the launcher had been fired recently. Army officials said they could not determine if the launcher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. \"Al Qaeda doesn't leave a rocket launcher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies,\" said Paul Cruickshank of New York University Law School's Center on Law and Security. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and \"both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it.\" Quinn also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Army official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided. According to the Web site Globalsecurity.org, a loaded M136 AT4 anti-tank weapon has a 40-inch-long fiberglass-wrapped tube and weighs just 4 pounds. Its 84 millimeter shaped-charge missile can penetrate 14 inches of armor from a maximum of 985 feet. It is used once and discarded. E-mail to a friend .

MORNINGSIDE EDGE TRAILER PARK - DAY\\n\\nThe sun casts a warm glow over the eclectic collection of trailers that make up the Morningside Edge Trailer Park. In the heart of this kitschy, suburban vortex, we find the largest and most garish trailer of them all: THE PINK PALACE, home to our film\\'s protagonists.\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - DAY\\n\\nThe Pink Palace\\'s kitchen is a true wonder to behold. Every available inch of counter space is covered in campy knick-knacks, ironic food-themed art and vintage appliances. The wallpaper features a repeating pattern of flamingos wearing chef\\'s hats, and the wooden cabinets have been painted a color that could only be described as \"shocking pink\".\\n\\nFrom the master bedroom, we hear the loud, brash voice of our film\\'s heroine, LYDIA SLICK. She is a miraculous 6-foot-tall vision of stylish excess, wearing a leopard-print caftan, complete with marabou-trimmed sleeves. Her makeup is perfect, from her overdrawn red lips to her sky-high teased bouffant.\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(in frustration, whining)\\nAll we have are eggs? Again?\\n\\nEnter her flamboyant and apathetic roommate, RICKY RUFFLES. He struts into the kitchen, wearing a glittery gold polyester leisure suit, the very embodiment of 70s disco.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(in a sarcastic tone)\\nWell, what do you expect? These beauties are all we got, darling.\\n\\nLaying on the counter, almost concealed by the various knick-knacks, there is a dozen eggs. Ricky grabs them and begins to march over to the stove where an ostentatious frying pan is waiting. He flips the switch on their neon pink branded toaster, igniting a countdown into their culinary chaos.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(while humming, grinning)\\nJust call me Chef Ricky!\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(getting excited)\\nOh, make me the most fabulous omelette you have ever made, Ricky!\\n\\nRicky starts cracking the eggs with a flourish that would make Liberace weep. Bit by bit, he tosses the shells behind him, leaving a trail of eggshells in his fabulous wake.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(suggestively)\\nYou know, making omelettes is like making love, darling. You need a gentle touch.\\n\\nLydia approaches the stove, eyes fixed on the eggs with an intensity that\\'s borderline dangerous. She dons a pair of oversized, bedazzled oven mitts, shaped like lobster claws. Ricky shoots her a side glance, amused.\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(securing her oven mitts)\\nAllow me to be your sous-chef.\\n\\nAs if on cue, their quirky neighbor TIFFANY TINSEL bursts through the trailer door. Her cotton candy beehive hairdo bounces with each step, and her monstrously large fake eyelashes create a breeze that rustles the flamingo wallpaper. She is a creation straight out of a 60s B-movie, wearing a tiny, shiny silver dress that matches her silver go-go boots.\\n\\nTIFFANY\\n(exaggerated gasp)\\nDid I hear someone say \"omelette\"?! It just so happens I\\'ve brought something that will make your omelette so divine, even John Waters himself couldn\\'t resist!\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - MONTAGE - DAY\\n\\nTiffany reveals an array of outrageous toppings: hot pink caviar, absurdly expensive truffle shavings, Carolina Reaper pepper slices, and... an ordinary bottle of hot sauce.\\n\\nThe three characters begin to assemble the omelette – a true dance of decadence. With each bizarre ingredient they add, it becomes more and more apparent that this is no ordinary omelette. It\\'s a grand ode to gluttony and camp, fit for a John Waters film.\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - DAY\\n\\nThe sound of the toaster popping marks the end of their culinary creation. Lydia wields a knife adorned in sequins, ready to slice into their omelette. As she begins to slide it through the eggstravaganza, they gasp in amazement.\\n\\nInstead of a yolk-derived interior, a literal rainbow emanates from within, casting swirls of vibrant colors across their faces.\\n\\nThe trio shares a cacophony of laughter, a near hysterical cackle straight from the heart.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(grinning)\\nWell, I think we made an omelette fit for the divine herself!\\n\\nThey each take a decadent bite of the omelette, a union of friends, feasting on an absurd dish that connects them like the roots of the Morningside Edge Trailer Park.\\n\\nFADE OUT:',\n",

       "  {'content': 'Title: All Aboard the Moroccan Tram: A Comprehensive Guide\\n\\nWhether you\\'re trying to get to the bustling markets of Rabat or exploring the vibrant streets of Casablanca, a swift and affordable mode of transportation is essential. Enter the Moroccan tram: a clean, comfortable, and eco-friendly way to travel! This article will provide everything you need to know to successfully navigate the twisting turns of these charming cities with ease, all whilst seamlessly blending in with the locals.\\n\\nStep 1: Familiarizing Yourself with the Routes\\n\\nBefore setting foot on the platform, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the tram routes in the city you\\'re visiting. In Morocco, two main cities – Rabat and Casablanca – are currently operating trams, with expansion plans in other cities well underway.\\n\\nThe Rabat-Salé Tramway system consists of two lines (T1 and T2), spanning over 20 km, connecting the two neighboring cities of Rabat and Salé. The Casablanca Tramway, on the other hand, has a single 31 km route (T1) with over 50 tram stations.\\n\\nMost tram stations showcase a route map highlighting the major stops, but you can also download a digital map on your phone, or get a physical copy from tourist centers, hotels, or travel agencies.\\n\\nStep 2: Purchasing Your Ticket\\n\\nMoroccan trams utilize an automated ticketing system. Upon arrival, locate the ticket vending machines, also known as \"guichets automatiques\" in French. Available in multiple languages, these machines accept both cash and cards.\\n\\nThere are three types of tickets available: a single-use ticket, \"Abonnement La Carte\" (rechargeable card for multiple uses), and a day pass, suitable for tourists planning to ride the tram multiple times a day. The prices are quite affordable, with a single-use ticket costing around 6 MAD (approx. 0.6 USD), making it a budget-friendly option for tourists.\\n\\nStep 3: Boarding the Tram\\n\\nWith the ticket in hand, proceed to the platform and watch for your tram to arrive. Be prepared to move quickly, as Moroccan trams are known for their punctuality. Note that trams in Morocco have designated areas for men, women, and families, and separate seating areas for those with disabilities or senior citizens. Be sure to adhere to these social codes to ensure a pleasant travel experience.\\n\\nBefore stepping on board, let passengers disembark first – following the age-old practice of \"premier sorti, premier servi\" (first out, first served). Once inside, validate your ticket or rechargeable card by pressing it against the terminal – the inscriptions \"validez ici\" (validate here) will guide you through the process.\\n\\nStep 4: Navigating Your Journey\\n\\nThroughout your ride, keep an eye on the digital displays or listen for automated announcements notifying passengers of approaching stops. Moroccan trams are generally quiet and peaceful, encouraging passengers to chat quietly or lose themselves in a book.\\n\\nWhile immersed in the journey, don\\'t forget to take in the spectacular surroundings – transitioning from relics of ancient history to modern architectural marvels, Moroccan cityscapes are a treat to the eyes.\\n\\nStep 5: Exiting the Tram\\n\\nAs your destination approaches, press the \"Arrêt demandé\" (stop requested) button, typically found near the exits or windows. Gather your belongings and prepare to exit, assuring that you don\\'t leave anything behind. Remember, a swift exit is appreciated by fellow passengers!\\n\\nOnce off the tram, be vigilant of your surroundings as a bustling street or a serene alley might greet you! With these tips in mind, you\\'re well-equipped to confidently navigate the Moroccan trams while soaking in the wonderful sights, sounds, and smells of this magical North African country. Happy travels!',\n",

Its enchanting cities, aromatic food, and picture-perfect landscapes make it a dream destination for travelers worldwide. To add a cherry on top, the experience of roaming around the country using its extensive bus network is undeniably a delight.\\n\\nAs a visitor to Morocco, taking the bus is the most convenient and budget-friendly way of unraveling the magic of each city. This guide is here to ensure you have the best bus experience during your Moroccan adventure. So, hold on tight as you embark on this incredible journey with us!\\n\\n1. Choosing the Right Bus Service\\nMorocco boasts an extensive network of bus services catering to various needs and preferences. High-quality intercity buses like CTM and Supratours step up the game with comfortable seats, air conditioning, and onboard washrooms. On the other hand, local buses provide cheaper alternatives but may require a bit of compromise on convenience.\\n\\nAlways make sure to research the available options for your itinerary and consider factors like budget, comfort, and the need for advance booking. Look out for online reviews and ask fellow travelers for their experiences to be better informed.\\n\\n2. Embracing Bargaining Skills\\nMastering the art of bargaining is an essential life skill in the Moroccan marketplaces, and the bus stations are no exception. Especially while using local buses, you may need to negotiate the fare to get the best price. A warm smile, a firm disposition, and few phrases in Moroccan Arabic (Darija) can go a long way in making the bargaining game smooth sailing.\\n\\n3. Navigating Bus Timetables\\nMoroccan bus services have departure and arrival times that are subject to change. To avoid any hiccups in your travel plans, it's crucial to double-check the timings and routes of the bus service you plan to use. Google Maps can provide relatively reliable information. Additionally, the bus station staff or fellow passengers often speak English or French and can assist you with your queries.\\n\\nDon’t forget to factor in some buffer time in case of unexpected delays or changes.\\n\\n4. Acclimating to Bus Etiquette\\nWhen you travel by buses in Morocco, understanding the local etiquette will enhance your experience. Here are some pointers to keep in mind:\\n\\n- Reserve your seat while purchasing a ticket or by using seat numbers (if provided).\\n- Be mindful of maintaining personal space while seating.\\n- Offer your seat to the elderly or people in need.\\n- Keep your voice low while conversing or listening to music.\\n- Always help fellow passengers with their luggage or directions, if necessary.\\n\\n5. Snack Up and Stay Hydrated\\nLong bus journeys can take a toll on your body. To stay energized, make sure you carry some light snacks, like energy bars or nuts, along with a bottle or two of water. During pit stops, you can also soak in the local flavor by tasting Moroccan roadside delicacies.\\n\\n6. Befriending the Locals\\nMoroccan buses are a fabulous chance to connect with the friendly locals – exchange stories, learn about local traditions, and ask for insider tips on your destination. Remember, a smile is the universal language of kindness; be respectful and engaging, and who knows, you might make lifelong friends!\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Moroccan bus experience is an adventure in itself. Embrace the journey with its quirks and surprises, and you'll cherish these memories for years to come. With our comprehensive guide in hand, you're now equipped to navigate the wonderful world of Moroccan buses – all aboard on this magical ride!\",\n",

Soft classical music plays in the background, creating a sophisticated ambience.\\n\\nCharacters:\\n\\n1) Emma: A woman in her early 30s.

       "  {'content': \"Title: Navigating Your Way to Morocco's Airports: A Step-by-Step Guide\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPicture this: you've just immersed yourself in the enchanting world of Morocco – a land of enchanting medinas, majestic mountains, and golden sand dunes. And now, it is time to bid farewell and catch your flight back home. However, as most travelers can attest, getting to the airport can be daunting, more so in an unfamiliar country. Fear not, for this article will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to navigate your way to Morocco's airports with ease and confidence. \\n\\n1. Know Your Airport \\n\\nFirst and foremost, it is crucial to know which airport you'll be departing from. Morocco is home to a number of international airports, including the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, Marrakech Menara Airport, Rabat-Salé Airport, Fes-Saïss Airport, and Tangier Ibn Battuta Airport. Make sure you're well-aware of which airport you need to reach and double-check your airline's departure terminal.\\n\\n2. Determine the Transport Options \\n\\nMorocco boasts a well-connected public transport system, ensuring that you have several options to choose from, ranging from taxis and buses to trains and private transfers. Assess the pros and cons of each method to decide which one best suits your preferences, budget, and departure time.\\n\\n3. Taking a Taxi\\n\\nTaxis are a popular choice among travelers for their availability and convenience, although they can be expensive. Make sure to look for the official airport taxis which are typically beige and have a taxi sign on the roof. Negotiate a fixed price with the driver before starting your journey, as airport taxis often don't use meters. Additionally, it's a wise idea to ask your hotel or a local for an estimated fare in advance to avoid getting overcharged.\\n\\n4. Opting for a Bus\\n\\nIf you're seeking a more budget-friendly option, buses are an excellent choice. Major Moroccan cities, such as Casablanca, Marrakech, and Rabat, offer airport express bus services that run between the city center and the airport, usually on an hourly basis. These buses are spacious, air-conditioned, and equipped with luggage compartments for your comfort. Keep your eye out for stops that have a sign displaying an airplane symbol, which indicates that the specific route will take you to the airport.\\n\\n5. Hop on a Train\\n\\nAnother comfortable and affordable option is to take the train to the airport. The Casablanca and Marrakech airports are connected to their respective city centers via reliable train services. Be aware of the train schedules and frequency, as well as the travel duration, to ensure you reach the airport with ample time for check-in and security procedures.\\n\\n6. Booking a Private Transfer\\n\\nFor those seeking a hassle-free and personalized experience, booking a private transfer to the airport is an excellent choice. Numerous companies provide door-to-door transfer services, often at competitive prices. Be sure to book your transfer in advance, particularly during peak travel season, to secure your spot.\\n\\n7. Allocate Sufficient Time\\n\\nRegardless of the mode of transport you choose, allow plenty of time for your journey to the airport. Factor in unexpected delays, such as traffic congestion or transport strikes, to ensure that you have ample time to check in, go through security, and board your flight without any undue stress.\\n\\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\nArmed with this step-by-step guide, you'll be navigating your way to Morocco's airports like a seasoned traveler. By planning ahead and anticipating potential challenges, you'll not only save time and energy but also leave this enchanting land with lasting memories and the desire to return someday.\",\n",

       "  {'content': 'Title: The Best Time to Visit Morocco: A Bounty of Choices\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nAre you considering a sojourn to the exotic and enchanting land of Morocco? This North African gem is like an indulgent feast for the senses, a destination where you can immerse yourself in vibrant colors, tantalizing smells, and entrancing sounds unique to the region. One question you may be pondering is when to embark on this adventure. With numerous factors to consider such as weather, budget, and your personal interests, the best time to visit Morocco may vary from traveler to traveler. Let\\'s embark on a journey to help you decide when the perfect Moroccan getaway beckons for you.\\n\\nWeather-wise Wonderland\\n\\nMorocco boasts a diverse climate, with coastal regions enjoying Mediterranean warmth, the Sahara Desert experiencing scorching heat, and the Atlas Mountains displaying snow-capped peaks. The seasons differ notably, providing you with distinct experiences and landscapes depending on when you choose to visit.\\n\\nSpring (April to June) - Blossoming Adventures\\n\\nFor many travelers, spring is the ideal season to visit Morocco. From April to June, the weather is pleasantly warm without being stifling, the countryside bursts with vibrant wildflowers, and the peak tourist season has yet to begin. This is an opportune time for you to wander through the labyrinth-like streets of Fes, marvel at the stunning architecture in Marrakech, or embark on a hike through the blooming Atlas Mountains.\\n\\nSummer (July to September) - Coastal Escapes\\n\\nWhile summer heat may deter some from visiting the bustling cities during this season, it\\'s the perfect time to explore Morocco\\'s beautiful coastal regions. For beach enthusiasts or those seeking a more refreshing experience, cities such as Essaouira, Tangier, and Casablanca offer breathtaking coastal views and are significantly cooler than their inland counterparts. Along with splashing in the crystal-clear waters, summer also offers the chance to witness the incredible Gnaoua World Music Festival held in Essaouira each June.\\n\\nAutumn (October to November) - Captivating Contrasts\\n\\nIf you\\'re enticed by the diverse landscapes and experiences Morocco offers, autumn could be your ultimate choice. During October and November, temperatures are comfortable, making city exploration enjoyable and Sahara Desert adventures more bearable. The autumn colors transforming the Atlas Mountains create a magical backdrop for hiking or simply enjoying the change of seasons.\\n\\nWinter (December to March) - Snowcapped Serenity and Budget Bliss\\n\\nFor the budget-conscious traveler or skiing enthusiast, winter offers an exciting experience with the added benefit of lower prices and fewer tourists. Although the nights can be brisk, the daytime temperatures are typically mild across the country. Venturing to the snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter allows access to picturesque ski resorts, while the Sahara Desert promises cooler, comfortable temps for a camel trekking or desert camping adventure.\\n\\nTailor the Trip to Your Tastes\\n\\nUltimately, the \"best\" time to visit Morocco is subjective and varies according to individual tastes and preferences. Nature lovers might find spring enthralling with blossoming landscapes, while skiing aficionados may be drawn to the snow-covered mountain peaks during winter. Budget-conscious travelers and those seeking solitude might appreciate the off-peak seasons, while event-inspired adventurers will want to align their journeys with specific cultural festivals.\\n\\nNo matter when you choose to venture forth, drenched in the golden hues of a Moroccan sunset or awash in the scents of exotic spices, your Moroccan experience will be unforgettable. Let the land enchant you, as Morocco offers a magnificent tapestry of unforgettable moments just waiting for you to explore.',\n",

       "  {'content': 'In the Italian city of Siena, the world decayed. The cathedral bells tolled emptiness, and the streets choked on the stale breath of the expired; yet, darkness knew no sin.\\n\\nAndrew Tate, a sinewy, grizzled container of fury, and Tristan, his younger, equally muscled brother, split the foul air with purpose. The two transcended mere siblings, forged through a crucible of torment and loss; they wore the time like the sheathed weapons at their sides.\\n\\nThe sun hemorrhaged golden beams over the horizon, bathing their forms in an otherworldly glow, that of warriors come to wage a battle that would never, could never, end. Men of mere flesh would have crumbed beneath such an undertow, but the brothers Taye bore the weight with casual disdain, as they did all things.\\n\\nTheir teeth clenched as they surveyed the landscape before them. The deformed silhouettes of decomposing denizens - the walking dead - stumbled through the streets, moaning with an insatiable desire for human flesh.\\n\\n\"Tristan, il coraggio della città è nelle nostre mani,\" Andrew murmured, his voice dancing like barbed wire over the solemn atmosphere. \"Vecchio stato e nuovo.\"\\n\\nTristan nodded, understanding the weight that bore upon them. They stood as the last icons of a place, a people, a heritage, that could never return. \"Glass windows, bravo leader,\" he replied.\\n\\nThe brotherly vernacular signaled their accord - the shared history, an intimacy that only two men at each other\\'s backs and in each other\\'s nightmares could share. Windows, shatterable shards of light, offered a slender pathway for them to see their survival.\\n\\nThe Piazza del Campo beckoned within the shattered remnants of Siena. The piazza would contain answers or oblivion, but the brothers accepted the locked doors of time with determination.\\n\\nThe air itself shimmered with the smell of the damned, the walking corpses staggering like bent weather vanes through the dying day. The brothers traversed alleys, shadows elongated by their footsteps, dreaming of once again tasting sweet Italian wine, as sweet illusions promised by the pictures of the past that now only mocked them.\\n\\nBut not all memories were liars. Patterned lines tattooed Andrew\\'s forearm, an inked tribute and reminder to the time before, the brotherly bond immortalized with ink where the soul had first formed it.\\n\\nEntering the cavernous emptiness of the piazza, the brothers welcomed the winds of coming night, feeling their masculine essence blending with the dying spirit of Siena. Here, in this place, they could become a fortress; perhaps of men, perhaps of ghosts, and perhaps... heroes.\\n\\nThey slinked around the banisters and corridors, like sentinels scavenging for discarded morsels of hope. In the middle of the vast piazza stood the cathedral of Siena - a once-majestic triumph of immaculate architecture, now tarnished by pestilence.\\n\\nAndrew signaled for Tristan to follow as they scaled the cathedral steps, their purpose streamlined by the purity of masculine brotherhood.\\n\\nThey paused beneath the reliquary of conjoined saints - the mystic and the mortal - recognizing the symbolism. In the darkness, Andrew\\'s eyes met Tristan’s, a silent oath exchanged.\\n\\nEntering the cathedral, they acquired the materials necessary for their survival - blades, medical salves, and blessed water. It was within the holy confines of the house of God that the brothers Tate would make their final stand.\\n\\nLike the figures of mythology ascribed to them by their very names, Andrew and Tristan sprinted back into the city, their strides cutting the darkness in front of them. Behind them came the hounds of hell, the shambling parade of the dead, spurred forth by the scent of living blood.\\n\\nThe cathedral offered no sanctuary but one forged in the arms of brotherhood, souls ingeminated by the fires and the aching hunger of a world turned monster.\\n\\nThe duo eluded countless dead hands, each ready to seize the threads of their lives and wrench them to the cheerless abyss; it was not the fear of the end that drove them forward but the worship of the stand.\\n\\nAnd stand they did, spellbound shadows against the encroaching tide of death, as they butchered the fiends before them, the men pacing behind them, a part of them that forever dwelt in sorrow replaced by rage.\\n\\nAt last, amidst the ruined streets of Siena, the brothers\\' blood ran cold as formidable adversaries closed in. Exhaustion wore at them, and blood, mingled in the colors of lost humanity, drenched their bodies.\\n\\nClasping their weapons, they sensed the circle narrow, and Tristan met Andrew\\'s gaze.\\n\\n\"Glass windows,\" he said one last time.\\n\\nAndrew paid his brother a lopsided grin. Together, they charged into the gnashing jaws of eternity. One brother. Two walls. An unbreakable, untamable force against the backdrop of the damned world.',\n",

LUNA DEL AMOR CAFETERIA - DAY\\n\\nThe Luna Del Amor is a beachside resort in the heart of Playa Bonita, a small but bustling coastal town. A gentle wind wafts in from the ocean as the sun casts its golden rays over the cafe, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere. The airy, open-plan cafeteria is adorned with mosaic tiles and vibrant curtains with exotic potted plants scattered throughout the bustling room. Sounds of clinking glasses, light laughter, and scattered whispers of the patrons fill the place; this is a spot where people meet to relax and enjoy delicious food.\\n\\nWe see ISABELLA (45, poised and elegant, with jet-black curls tumbling down, adorned in a lace blouse and pencil skirt) sliding into a seat opposite her long-time rival, CLARA (48, devious and cunning with fiery red tresses cascading over her shoulders, dressed in a figure-hugging floral summer dress with stilettos). They are surrounded by fellow café-goers; college students typing away on their laptops, young mothers feeding their babies, and sunbathers in spray-on tans evoking the essence of luxury and relaxation.\\n\\nISABELLA: (sneering) Well, Clara, I never thought you’d dare show up in Playa Bonita after all these years.\\n\\nCLARA: (spiteful) You should be grateful, Isabella. Without me, you’d have nothing to brag about at your insufferable dinner parties.\\n\\nWaitress CONCEPCION (22, bubbly with dual-colored buns in her chocolatey hair, in a white button-up short-sleeve shirt paired with a black apron and denim shorts) arrives at the table, tray laden with food in hand. She carefully sets the plates before the warring ladies: cheese empanadas, a towering seafood enchilada stack, and sizzling churros in glistening caramel drizzle.\\n\\nCONCEPCION: (sweetly) Ladies, enjoy your feast. Please let me know if you need anything else!\\n\\nIsabella and Clara visit barely a nod in her direction, locked in mutual disdain.\\n\\nISABELLA: (tight-lipped) What do you want, Clara?\\n\\nCLARA: (mockingly) Nothing, dear. Just thought it was about time we settled our differences, one way or another.\\n\\nISABELLA: (offended) Ha! Like I’ll ever forget what you did!\\n\\nAs the tensions build, nearby café-goers start to take notice. A lovestruck young couple halts mid-lipsmacking exchange; a band of girlfriends dining together rotate their heads in unison, sensing the brewing drama.\\n\\nIsabella picks up a cheese empanada between her perfectly manicured fingers, slowly eyeing Clara with malicious intent. With a sudden flick upwards, she sends it soaring, and it plops unceremoniously onto Clara's head, cheese spilling out into her fiery red locks. Her face contorts in horror and rage.\\n\\nCLARA: (outraged) How dare you!\\n\\nIn retaliation, Clara grabs a handful of seafood enchiladies from the stack, rice, and seafood cascading like a waterfall from her grip as she looks to return the favor. With ferocity, she plants her ammunition on Isabella’s head, sending an eruption of crabmeat, black beans, and salsa verde throughout her jet-black curls. Isabella gasps in shock, horrified.\\n\\nISABELLA: It's on.\\n\\nIsabella and Clara both stand up dramatically. Neither of them backs down, smearing churro and caramel sauce onto each other's faces in a ferocious display of hands-on feud.\\n\\nCafé-goers at the neighboring tables back away from the scuffle, locking eyes on this captivating showdown. Suddenly, patrons begin to take sides. College students shockingly abandon their caffeinated concoctions to rally behind Isabella or Clara, taking up scones and guacamole-covered chips as their preferred instruments of destruction.\\n\\nISABELLA: (yelling) You'll pay for everything you've ever done, right here in front of everyone, Clara!\\n\\nCLARA: (equally determined) Trust me, Isabella; you'll regret this!\\n\\nAs chaos unfolds around the dueling women, Concepcion strides into the fray, bravely attempting to break up the mayhem. She is promptly coated in spilled pink horchata from a passerby, her dual-colored buns dripping in the once-frosty beverage.\\n\\nCONCEPCION: (aghast) Everyone, stop this madness at once!\\n\\nThe hushed café-goers freeze in their battle poses and slowly begin to backtrack from their chosen sides, shame-facedly returning to their seats, while Isabella and Clara continue to glare daggers, chests heaving in indignation.\\n\\nCONCEPCION: (composing herself) You will *not* turn this place of love and friendship into a battleground. If you wish to fight, do so where no one else will suffer and clean this mess up immediately!\\n\\nIsabella and Clara exchange one last venomous glare before begrudgingly reaching an unspoken temporary truce. The scene dissolves before they begin to clean up their disastrous showdown, drawing the attention of everyone around them.\\n\\nRelief patterns the faces of café-goers and the remaining tension dissolves. The lovestruck couple slink back into their embrace, and the band of girlfriends resume cheerfully dominating the scene. As Isabella and Clara wipe creamy avocado off their faces, their duel will be vindicated another day.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\",\n",

       "  {'content': \"Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation for Phonics and Spelling Success\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nTeaching young children the essential skills of phonics and spelling is a critical component of early education. Through these foundational tools, children learn to understand the written language and become proficient readers and writers. This chapter will explore the importance of phonics and spelling in early literacy development and provide practical strategies for creating an engaging and effective learning environment.\\n\\nThe Importance of Phonics and Spelling\\n\\nPhonics is the relationship between letters and sounds in a language. It helps children understand the alphabetic code and learn to decode words. Young children must grasp this essential skill to develop reading and writing abilities, as phonics is the foundation of all written communication.\\n\\nSpelling is closely related to phonics, as it involves accurately representing spoken sounds in written language. Mastery of spelling requires an understanding of phonics, along with the ability to blend and segment sounds into words. Effective spelling instruction helps children internalize the rules and patterns of written language and develop automaticity in reading and writing.\\n\\nDeveloping Phonemic Awareness\\n\\nPhonemic awareness is the ability to recognize and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words. Children must be able to identify and play with sounds before they can understand the relationship between the sounds and the letters that represent them. Developing phonemic awareness lays the foundation for successful phonics and spelling instruction.\\n\\nHere are some strategies to help young children develop phonemic awareness:\\n\\n1. Rhyme Time: Encourage your children to listen and produce rhyming words using familiar objects, stories, and songs. This helps them recognize patterns in spoken language and increases their sensitivity to sounds.\\n\\n2. Syllable Clapping: Clap out the syllables in words and have your children imitate you. This will help them break words into smaller sound units and practice listening for individual sounds.\\n\\n3. The Sound Game: Have your children practice isolating the initial, medial, and final sounds in words by listening and repeating those sounds. This helps strengthen their ability to hear and manipulate individual phonemes.\\n\\nCreating a Print-Rich Environment\\n\\nSurrounding children with print in various forms helps them develop an understanding of the purposes and functions of written language. Here are some ideas for creating a print-rich environment in your home or classroom:\\n\\n1. Label objects: Label common items in the environment, such as furniture, toys, and supplies. This helps children associate print with meaning.\\n\\n2. Display environmental print: Use street signs, logos, and commercial packaging that children recognize and can associate meaning with print.\\n\\n3. Encourage writing for different purposes: Provide opportunities for your children to write for a variety of purposes, such as making grocery lists, writing notes, and creating stories.\\n\\nTeaching Letter-Sound Relationships\\n\\nOnce children demonstrate phonemic awareness, it is time to teach them the relationship between letters and sounds. Below are some strategies to support this learning process:\\n\\n1. Alphabet books: Read alphabet books containing clear illustrations and examples of objects that represent each letter sound.\\n\\n2. Letter-sound matching games: Use games such as memory or Go Fish! with pairs of written letters and pictures representing their corresponding sounds.\\n\\n3. Multisensory activities: Have children practice forming letters with various materials, such as playdough or sand, while saying the letter name and the sound it represents.\\n\\nIntegrating Phonics and Spelling Instruction\\n\\nTo teach phonics and spelling effectively, educators and parents need to plan purposeful and engaging activities. Here are some ideas:\\n\\n1. Explicit instruction: Teach letter-sound relationships, blending sounds, and segmenting words using explicit, systematic, and multisensory approaches.\\n\\n2. Word families: Teach words that share common spelling patterns, such as rhyming words or words with the same vowel sound.\\n\\n3. Sight words: Introduce high-frequency words that do not follow typical phonics patterns and are best learned through memorization and repeated exposure.\\n\\n4. Dictation: Have your children listen to and spell words and sentences, emphasizing the connection between the spoken sounds and their written representation.\\n\\nBy using these strategies and continuously assessing your children's progress, you will successfully lay the foundation for their phonics and spelling development, guiding them on the path to literacy success.\",\n",

       "  {'content': \"Title: Timing Your Perfect Morocco Escapade: A Guide for Different Travelers\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMorocco has long been a favored destination for travelers worldwide. It presents a fascinating fusion of cultures, from the Mediterranean to the Sub-Saharan, with landscapes and festivities as diverse as its people. No two visitors will have the same trip, and knowing when to embark on your Moroccan adventure could make all the difference in creating your perfect experience. With that in mind, we've crafted this guide to help you determine the best time to visit Morocco according to your traveler type and preferences.\\n\\nFor the Culture Connoisseur\\n\\nIf immersing yourself in Morocco's vibrant culture is your top priority, then visiting during one of its captivating festivals should be on your itinerary. Each season brings a different event to life, giving you a chance to witness the cultural tapestry that Morocco is famous for.\\n\\n1. Spring (March-May): The festival season kicks off with the International Nomads Festival, held every March in the desert oasis of M'Hamid El Ghizlane. Celebrating the nomadic heritage of the region, this makes for a unique, colorful, and music-filled experience.\\n\\n2. Summer (June-August): The summertime showcases Morocco's love for music, featuring festivals like the Gnaoua World Music Festival in Essaouira or the Fes Festival of World Sacred Music. Visiting during these months allows you to take in two of Morocco's most scenic cities while enjoying an energy-packed celebration.\\n\\n3. Fall (September-November): Among the cultural events that occur during autumn, the El Kelaâ des M’Gouna Rose Festival in May stands out. It attracts perfume connoisseurs from around the globe and showcases Morocco's lush flora and delicate rose harvest.\\n\\nFor the Adventure Seeker\\n\\nThrill-seekers have plenty of options when it comes to outdoor pursuits in Morocco. However, the adventure of choice and the ideal time for it will vary depending on your preference and the region you wish to explore.\\n\\n1. Trekking: Morocco's stunningly diverse landscape offers hiking opportunities year-round. However, spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) are the most favorable times due to cooler temperatures and panoramic views of snow-capped peaks and lush valleys.\\n\\n2. Surfing: Morocco's Atlantic coast attracts water sports enthusiasts from around the world, with its impressive swells and beginner-friendly breaks. The most consistent surf conditions can be found between October and March.\\n\\n3. Skiing: If hitting the slopes is your version of adventure, Morocco presents a unique and exotic ski destination. The season typically spans December to February, and the Atlas Mountains offer picturesque ski resorts like Oukaimeden and Michlifen.\\n\\nFor the Budget Traveler\\n\\nVisiting Morocco off-peak allows for budget-conscious adventurers to enjoy more of the destination for a fraction of the cost. Opting for the shoulder seasons—spring (April-May) and autumn (October-November)—ensures a perfect balance of pleasant weather and budget-friendly options when it comes to accommodation and other amenities.\\n\\nDuring these periods, you'll find that prices are more negotiable, meaning you can snag better deals on your riad or hotel stays, souvenir-shopping and even food experiences.\\n\\nFor the Weatherwise Wanderer\\n\\nMorocco's geographic wonders present vastly different weather conditions depending on the region. Here's a brief guide to the weather patterns throughout the year:\\n\\n1. Coastal Cities (Casablanca, Rabat, and Essaouira): Featuring a Mediterranean climate, these cities have mild winters and warm summers, making them enjoyable all-year-round.\\n\\n2. Imperial Cities (Fes, Marrakech, and Meknes): Possessing a semi-arid climate, the temperature can soar during summertime, while winter months can be chilly, especially at night. Late spring and fall are the most comfortable seasons here.\\n\\n3. Atlas Mountains: Trekking and skiing are weather-dependent adventures in the Atlas Mountains. Expect cold and snowy weather in winter and milder temperatures in the summer months.\\n\\n4. Desert (Sahara): During the day, the region can experience blazing heat, whereas nighttime temperatures can be surprisingly cool year-round. The transitional seasons of spring and fall present the most predictable and pleasant climate.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nMorocco's alluring combination of landscape, culture, and adventure caters to a wide array of traveler preferences. Each season brings its unique charm and appeal, making Morocco a fabulous destination at any moment of the year. This guide is a starting point to help you customize your Moroccan escapade, ensuring your trip is as unforgettable as it is personal. Happy travels!\",\n",

MORNINGSIDE EDGE TRAILER PARK - DAY\\n\\nThe sun casts a warm glow over the eclectic collection of trailers that make up the Morningside Edge Trailer Park. In the heart of this kitschy, suburban vortex, we find the largest and most garish trailer of them all: THE PINK PALACE, home to our film\\'s protagonists.\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - DAY\\n\\nThe Pink Palace\\'s kitchen is a true wonder to behold. Every available inch of counter space is covered in campy knick-knacks, ironic food-themed art and vintage appliances. The wallpaper features a repeating pattern of flamingos wearing chef\\'s hats, and the wooden cabinets have been painted a color that could only be described as \"shocking pink\".\\n\\nFrom the master bedroom, we hear the loud, brash voice of our film\\'s heroine, LYDIA SLICK. She is a miraculous 6-foot-tall vision of stylish excess, wearing a leopard-print caftan, complete with marabou-trimmed sleeves. Her makeup is perfect, from her overdrawn red lips to her sky-high teased bouffant.\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(in frustration, whining)\\nAll we have are eggs? Again?\\n\\nEnter her flamboyant and apathetic roommate, RICKY RUFFLES. He struts into the kitchen, wearing a glittery gold polyester leisure suit, the very embodiment of 70s disco.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(in a sarcastic tone)\\nWell, what do you expect? These beauties are all we got, darling.\\n\\nLaying on the counter, almost concealed by the various knick-knacks, there is a dozen eggs. Ricky grabs them and begins to march over to the stove where an ostentatious frying pan is waiting. He flips the switch on their neon pink branded toaster, igniting a countdown into their culinary chaos.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(while humming, grinning)\\nJust call me Chef Ricky!\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(getting excited)\\nOh, make me the most fabulous omelette you have ever made, Ricky!\\n\\nRicky starts cracking the eggs with a flourish that would make Liberace weep. Bit by bit, he tosses the shells behind him, leaving a trail of eggshells in his fabulous wake.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(suggestively)\\nYou know, making omelettes is like making love, darling. You need a gentle touch.\\n\\nLydia approaches the stove, eyes fixed on the eggs with an intensity that\\'s borderline dangerous. She dons a pair of oversized, bedazzled oven mitts, shaped like lobster claws. Ricky shoots her a side glance, amused.\\n\\nLYDIA\\n(securing her oven mitts)\\nAllow me to be your sous-chef.\\n\\nAs if on cue, their quirky neighbor TIFFANY TINSEL bursts through the trailer door. Her cotton candy beehive hairdo bounces with each step, and her monstrously large fake eyelashes create a breeze that rustles the flamingo wallpaper. She is a creation straight out of a 60s B-movie, wearing a tiny, shiny silver dress that matches her silver go-go boots.\\n\\nTIFFANY\\n(exaggerated gasp)\\nDid I hear someone say \"omelette\"?! It just so happens I\\'ve brought something that will make your omelette so divine, even John Waters himself couldn\\'t resist!\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - MONTAGE - DAY\\n\\nTiffany reveals an array of outrageous toppings: hot pink caviar, absurdly expensive truffle shavings, Carolina Reaper pepper slices, and... an ordinary bottle of hot sauce.\\n\\nThe three characters begin to assemble the omelette – a true dance of decadence. With each bizarre ingredient they add, it becomes more and more apparent that this is no ordinary omelette. It\\'s a grand ode to gluttony and camp, fit for a John Waters film.\\n\\nINT. PINK PALACE - KITCHEN - DAY\\n\\nThe sound of the toaster popping marks the end of their culinary creation. Lydia wields a knife adorned in sequins, ready to slice into their omelette. As she begins to slide it through the eggstravaganza, they gasp in amazement.\\n\\nInstead of a yolk-derived interior, a literal rainbow emanates from within, casting swirls of vibrant colors across their faces.\\n\\nThe trio shares a cacophony of laughter, a near hysterical cackle straight from the heart.\\n\\nRICKY\\n(grinning)\\nWell, I think we made an omelette fit for the divine herself!\\n\\nThey each take a decadent bite of the omelette, a union of friends, feasting on an absurd dish that connects them like the roots of the Morningside Edge Trailer Park.\\n\\nFADE OUT:',\n",
